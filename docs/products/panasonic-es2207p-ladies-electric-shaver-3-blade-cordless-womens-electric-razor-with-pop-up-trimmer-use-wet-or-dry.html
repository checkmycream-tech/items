            <li>THIS one is so awesome - love it.  </li>
            <li>It works great, good battery life and no issues.</li>
            <li>I am soooo thrilled!</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my 4 in 1 Braun epilator/shaver which I really liked!</li>
            <li>It also has the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval and that means a great deal to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a great day! :)to get into the corners of the plastic inside.</li>
            <li>Have a great day! :)</li>
            <li>so glad that I did, this shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li>Not the best, but OK between shower shaves</li>
            <li>It shaves remarkably close for an electric razor and the charge holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent, works better than any one I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li>SHE wanted one :) perfect gift for the ladies!</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it does a much better job than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>I gifted my sister with one just like it, she needs it cause she has to be on blood thinners, and this is a great shaver!!!</li>
            <li>very happy, find it does a better job using shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Before buying this, I tried a cheaper electric shaver to see if this route would be successful and it broke within two months.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this shaver, very impressed with results and</li>
            <li>Best cheap, electric shaver out there!  </li>
            <li>This is a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>I thought this price was great and it recieved good reviews so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Good starter rechargeable razor for teens, also great for women who like an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>If it works for a year, it will be a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>what a pleasant surprise when I decided to try this one....</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to hear that She was so happy to have this</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say that this shaver works great on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>It really is easy to handle amd shaves perfectly.</li>
            <li>i wanted something TOO strong :D</li>
            <li>It was great when it worked but an item should work for more than 9 months!</li>
            <li>best electric razor I have ever had and great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>For the good points, it appears well made, is easy to hold, and does a very good job with no nicks or cuts!  </li>
            <li>beautiful to look at and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I took very good care of it, cleaned in between shaves, always put it away in a safe place,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get cuts like on a razor though on the bright side.</li>
            <li>What a great price for an amazing Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a good product for the cost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why a lady&#x27;s razor can&#x27;t be as good as a man&#x27;s razor, but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This one is as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is good product.</li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>and they gave the 2206 a good rating.  </li>
            <li>Shave is fairly close, probably as good as you can get with an electric.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>She likes it and was a good gift</li>
            <li>And best of all, it&#x27;s about 95% of razor smooth and</li>
            <li>She loved it -</li>
            <li>This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Of all the Ladies Shavers I had, this is the best one, gives a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it provides a good shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but it won&#x27;t replace my razor.</li>
            <li>so price wise -</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a good product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel too (like vacation, where you will never see those people again) kind of thing.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s this good and at this price.</li>
            <li>For the money, its seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>i have had good results</li>
            <li>it was a really good product</li>
            <li>Works good on legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li>Really Good Rechargeable Razor.</li>
            <li>The razor was a good price and it does the job without any problems.</li>
            <li>It is good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Shaves close, holds charge for a while, good price.  </li>
            <li>I loved the close shave.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find a good shaver in the stores and have to buy on line.</li>
            <li>This one works well on legs, not so good for underarms as it will bite.</li>
            <li>so I decided to ditch razors all together and get this instead after I saw it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Recommended was a good purchase</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for the value.</li>
            <li>Well, it looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>I loved my Remington until I bought this.  </li>
            <li>cause i think is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Very impressed, smooth shave considering it&#x27;s an electric razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver works well and gives a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>In the beginning it seemed really good.</li>
            <li>you decide to buy this, good luck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all around a good item.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I&#x27;d say it is a good value.</li>
            <li>a THATS good.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an electric razor that shaves as good as a blade, I like the MACH III TURBO.</li>
            <li>Nothing works as good as a blade</li>
            <li>Good item and</li>
            <li>It does a good job with the armpit hair.  </li>
            <li>The battery is still good</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>She loves the fact that it can be used in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact and good quality.</li>
            <li>Good price, good quality</li>
            <li>The razor was good in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a good wet/dry shaver...</li>
            <li>The shape was good for handling it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the ES2216PC that gets a closer shave, but it does the job</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved the results I got from this, but the battery stopped holding a charge after fewer than six months.</li>
            <li>like the way it&#x27;s shaped ,fits good in your hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;stays clogged and hence cant do a good job at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>, just charge for a bit an you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Good quality, works well.  </li>
            <li>It works good for trimming hair and keeping it neat.</li>
            <li>It holds charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Loved it until it died out.</li>
            <li>The price was fair</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>veeeerry good.</li>
            <li>Good product but would not recomend using it in the shower</li>
            <li>It does a fair job, just have to keep going over the areas, it doesn&#x27;t chafe or pull.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>This works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one for $20 since it had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>but it does a good job without irritation.</li>
            <li>Good to buy two and have both fully charged.</li>
            <li>good charge and works well</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a good brand for shavers.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as good as with disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product it...</li>
            <li>I guess if you can afford to replace it every 3 months, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>It works good for an electric shaver but not as close as a blade razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it does the job fairly well.  </li>
            <li>It works great and it nice to not have to buy razors all the time.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, works well, great price</li>
            <li>I loved the pop up razor</li>
            <li>no issues and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li>But will be good for travel.</li>
            <li>Item received as advertised in good time.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave and the trimmer is good also I take it in the shower it gives a close shave</li>
            <li>Good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>it is good price, good</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is a good product for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Good price and did the job-</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>This shaver is almost as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>For being a $20 shaver, it does a really good job.</li>
            <li>It was also a surprisingly closer shave than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The shaver works good for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It was as good as shaving with a razor</li>
            <li>Deliver was prompt and good.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps a nice charge.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>So I believe it&#x27;s a good idea to charge it between shaves.</li>
            <li>, however, I feel it&#x27;s a good feature to have in case</li>
            <li>I believe the design is good for both,</li>
            <li>The blade and the foil are replaceable, so that&#x27;s a good think.</li>
            <li>I believe the design is good for both,</li>
            <li>The blade and the foil are replaceable, so that&#x27;s a good think.</li>
            <li>She used it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and it is good for legs but not underarms.</li>
            <li>Good for the bikini zone.</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>The good news?  </li>
            <li>all good.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s a good razor</li>
            <li>I loved my remmington</li>
            <li>styling, fits good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good quality, doesn&#x27;t nick my legs</li>
            <li>I have been searching for over a year for a good shaver.</li>
            <li>the wife says it good for her legs ...  </li>
            <li>2Stars...&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good for legs ,arms,and pits</li>
            <li>Good price for what you get, and a 2 year warranty for parts and labor.</li>
            <li>she loved it when she opened it and uses it with no complaints.</li>
            <li>Good close shave on legs.</li>
            <li>It indeed did not irritate, so it fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good shaver, works well all over.  </li>
            <li>Of course the Es2205 is still working, my daughter loved it too and took it to college, my wife whined for weeks when it was gone.....</li>
            <li>rips my hair out, hurts, i was hoping it would be good</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs was longer than I would like to admit and this did a really good job.</li>
            <li>Good price...</li>
            <li>The shaver holds its charge well and does a good job.</li>
            <li>(Michael Ham&#x27;s book on shaving is a good beginner&#x27;s resource).  </li>
            <li>Good product and uneventful service.</li>
            <li>* Surprisingly durable.  </li>
            <li>Either way, you&#x27;re going to be getting about 2 years of good shaves out of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This razor works really good.</li>
            <li>so if this is what you want, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>you name it ) and none has worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how good it did on a never before shaved leg.  </li>
            <li>All the good stuff.</li>
            <li>then I saw this one and read the reviews which are mostly good.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it does in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for 10 or so 3 minutes session.</li>
            <li>The price seemed like a good value and the ratings were good.  </li>
            <li>Just a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>Good as quality point of view.</li>
            <li>Good God I returned this thing immediately.</li>
            <li>and it did good</li>
            <li>Even so, this product represents good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, this shaver is still a good buy.</li>
            <li>Seems to be made of good quality but just doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li>good in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Good for legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Does a good job shaving.</li>
            <li>Ordered this shaver because it seemed the best option available.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because it had a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>i would buy it again and recommend it to others as a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good shave and I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver for women who have to use them and it keeps a charge for a week.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the Panasonic</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Good shaver.  </li>
            <li>This went on for 2 years until it stopped working for good</li>
            <li>It did its job fairly well.</li>
            <li>The price and quality is superior.  </li>
            <li>I use on my armpits, but not as good on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The way it&#x27;s shaped, you get a good gripe, no slips.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>Loved it!!...until it came time to charge it and it would not charge.</li>
            <li>Oh well, for the price it is good.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>The item looks to be of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Fair warning...</li>
            <li>Good for hip/knee replacement/broken bones shaving of legs....</li>
            <li>For bikini lines and areas where you prefer to shave, this is a GOOD BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a fair number of razors and never stuck with one.  </li>
            <li>Bummer because when it was working I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic for men for years and really loved it.</li>
            <li>It will never be as good as a disposable</li>
            <li>problem is that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving my head</li>
            <li>arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>good value for money</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>if you can shave in that amount of time your good..</li>
            <li>It gives you the basics and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Does a good job in the bakini area.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and a good travel item.  </li>
            <li>Price is good too.</li>
            <li>Its too good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Nearly as good as a razor.</li>
            <li>It gives a fairly close shave and works well.</li>
            <li>Does good job.</li>
            <li>you can get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>Good investment.  </li>
            <li>Works well and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I get a good close shave on my legs and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>All the reviews said the item was good, but how will I ever know.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it would be so good for the price</li>
            <li>So I got this thing out of the box and it worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>This one is a good choice.</li>
            <li>This does a good job to *closely trim* without leaving razor burn ....</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>but if you want a good close shave guess you got to deal with that part.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>battery life is also good, I managed to do both legs up to my bikini line and both arms without running out of power.</li>
            <li>It does hold a charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good prodict for the price.</li>
            <li>A bit bulky but does a good job.</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver because it had good reviews</li>
            <li>this was a gift for my sister and she loved it</li>
            <li>It is a perfect fit for my needs.</li>

            <li>It does do a good job shaving.</li>
            <li>This shaver hurts AND didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving either.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>The charging mechanism is really unique and handy - no cords!!!</li>

            <li>Does a wonderful job, nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very happy and delivery was super speedy.</li>
            <li>Not a heavyweight or close shaver but perfect for quick whisks to keep my legs looking neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave for something at this price point is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it works like a charm, and not only did it work wonderfully on my legs but also under my arms, so I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, does a great job, very close shave.  </li>
            <li>but i kind of had to struggle a bit at first to find the best way to get a close shave on my nether regions, lol. .</li>
            <li>But it works great and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>How quick is that!!!</li>

            <li>This electric shaver gets me incredibly smooth skin (ALMOST as close as a razor!!)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother giving her the instructions I laid out here because after all, she did insult my favorite product of all time!</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my technique wasn&#x27;t the best (pulled some hair, missed some hair, etc.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, always wear a helmet when riding a bicycle!</li>
            <li>It did not shave any of my hair off, and I got more scratches than anything!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really glad I got this backup!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I Love It!..</li>
            <li>and I love  it!  </li>
            <li>Great value &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li>easy to use and works great</li>
            <li>It works great and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>works great, easy to charge and hold while using</li>
            <li>This razor does exactly what I want it to do and is a great tool for a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>and this is the first electric shaver that I have been able to use on my underarms without any cuts or reactions!!!</li>
            <li>Very good shaver, Light and easy to use, Keeps good charge.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic shavers, and I try to stay loyal to the brand since it&#x27;s a great value for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great shaver.....</li>
            <li>Works fine and is great for the price.</li>
            <li>if you have fine hair it doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
            <li>This shaver is very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>All I have to say now is that this razor was amazing while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Great price and function smooth.</li>
            <li>You have to use it to believe how great it is to shave  any  part  and see how smooth it is .</li>
            <li>The shaving blades are extremely smooth and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Then I got this, and it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing ...</li>
            <li>It does a great job and is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>(Plus, this is a great, cheap shaver to try</li>
            <li>But it works great, giving me smooth legs without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Electric never gives as smooth a shave as a razor, but it&#x27;s a great touch-up tool.</li>
            <li>And I have never cut myself using this which is amazing.</li>
            <li>After months struggling with Remington&#x27;s Smooth and Silky, I am supremely happy with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>Under $20 is an amazing price.</li>
            <li>Razor worked great until it stopped charging after 6 months of light use.</li>
            <li>Great light weight electric razor.</li>
            <li>This really is great for both in shower and out of shower (i primarily use it out of the shower).</li>
            <li>I loved this shaver, but on a day I needed it the most, it did not work.  </li>
            <li>Liked the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I have to use this with water running in shower to keep my skin warm</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic, for another great product!</li>
            <li>I also like that there&#x27;s a nice compact place for it on my electrical outlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it kept catching my hair and not cutting/shaving it off..</li>
            <li>I use the razor on it&#x27;s own without any sort of cream or soap.</li>
            <li>Works ok but doesn&#x27;t do a good close shave.</li>
            <li>in all, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, I am very impresses with it.</li>
            <li>Delivers a nice close shave without irritation</li>
            <li>Nice electric shaver for women.</li>
            <li>Re-charges nicely.</li>
            <li>So this is perfect for those times, when you don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;Wax\\&quot; kind of closeness but don&#x27;t want to go around looking all beastly either.</li>
            <li>Wife liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to get my own</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;d be nice to have that option.  </li>
            <li>A cord would be nice but take up space</li>
            <li>Shaves nice.</li>
            <li>The design is nice.</li>
            <li>The fact that this device is water proof is also nice.</li>
            <li>Now that the box has been opened and the razor used by her, I can tell you it&#x27;s a nice razor.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked</li>
            <li>She had a razor but would complain about it catching and not getting as close.  </li>
            <li>I used my husbands electric razor a couple of times and decided to get my own.</li>
            <li>you are an experienced electric razor user -- then this is one of the best models I&#x27;ve used at a surprisingly low price.  </li>
            <li>I am kind of scared to bring it in the shower though.</li>
            <li>Should have bought one of these handy shavers years ago.  </li>
            <li>it was so nice</li>
            <li>My wife needed a good rechargable shaver and she is quite pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>And be sure to use a good serum to rub all over after you shave.</li>
            <li>I feel it was really the best from the multitude offered by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Now that my daughter has one of her own</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, close shave for legs.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver, its great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors and they were as effective as running a paper towel over my legs.  </li>
            <li>pop up trimmer is a nice feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about razor cuts but you still get a nice shave.</li>
            <li>It looks nice.</li>
            <li>, I feel like it&#x27;s more work to get a good shave that way.</li>
            <li>It is nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so well</li>
            <li>The charging unit is nice, there&#x27;s no cord, it just sits in the electrical socket.</li>
            <li>and it does a really nice job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is nice to find a ladies razor that has been made as sturdy as a mans.</li>
            <li>My shaver will not charge on her charging dock or my own.</li>
            <li>It shaves very closely, it does so rapidly, and I hope you will be as happy with it as I am!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Wish I knew it could be this nice-</li>
            <li>Razor is effective if shaving arms.  </li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>Its shaves the closest, but of course not as nice as a razor.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and allows her to safely shave her legs.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>But it always works a fair amount of time and does a lovely job.</li>
            <li>What a nice razor.</li>
            <li>Would have liked charge cord that plugs into the wall and sits on the end table where the shaver sits in a charge cradle.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Better than some shavers, not as good as others.</li>
            <li>It has a handy plug in recharging station</li>
            <li>I liked this shaver while it was working.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave with no nicks or pinches.</li>
            <li>Excellent value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t use it without charging for a good 10-15 minutes just to be safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also nice and lightweight and the sleek design and color is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving my legs</li>
            <li>It really does a great job on leg hair!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest razor, but for my needs it has worked great &amp; cleaning it is very simple.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave with one swipe.  </li>
            <li>and she did it on her own.</li>
            <li>for me -- I&#x27;m thrilled to have an electric shaver again</li>
            <li>It is more convenient for me to shave this way than in the shower, though, so it is a good option for me.</li>
            <li>I had one before and liked it, but the battery did not keep the charge .Since</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll always keep one of these handy for years to come.</li>
            <li>For the price of this razor, I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>I also own a beard trimmer with attachments.  </li>
            <li>: I love this razor, it still holds a good charge</li>
            <li>Neither of my daughters liked this.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried it on legs yet but am sure it will do just as good a job there also.</li>
            <li>Liked this one</li>
            <li>Satisfied and price was good.</li>
            <li>Handy to use in the bathtub.</li>
            <li>Nice qulity.</li>
            <li>nice performance and also nice price.</li>
            <li>it is so nice</li>
            <li>Handle fits nicely in my hands.  </li>
            <li>A nice design</li>
            <li>I liked the reviews on this one.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to shave a bit more often, but if you don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I wish there was way to return for any kind of money.</li>
            <li>and it is a nice color.  </li>
            <li>Nice grip, too.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not used to this kind of shaver</li>
            <li>Really pulls on hairs and hurts unless it&#x27;s at the PERFECT angle.</li>
            <li>1.) Perfectly and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrived really fast--four days; packaged perfect.</li>
            <li>It is okay but not as good as it could be.  </li>
            <li>Has handy attachments.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave for an auto shaver.</li>
            <li>shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is nice</li>
            <li>Perfect shave when you don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li>Would also be nice if you could use it corded as well, in case you run out of juice during a shave.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>I came on to buy another ands a gift for my mother-in-law as she also liked it.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it a no star because honestly, it did NOTHING.</li>
            <li>In the shower and with the addition of shaving cream, it&#x27;s effective and close.</li>
            <li>Of all the hundreds of purchases I have made on Amazon, this is my absolute FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice marketing strategy by Panasonic .</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Chargeable, sleek, sturdy, effective.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the shape and design of the shaver head.</li>
            <li>This is nice and sturdy but it does not shave close.</li>
            <li>It has a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li>Good product, glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>i am loving this.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering her her own</li>
            <li>Works nicely on him.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The best part was the charger, I no longer have to search for a place to stand the charger unit on, I just plug it in to the socket and there it perches until ready...</li>
            <li>pop up trimmer is a nice touch though.</li>
            <li>Will travel nicely in the travel bag included.</li>
            <li>Real blades are the best....</li>
            <li>Very close shave and very happy with results.</li>
            <li>Probably not as good as a razor shave, but not an appropriate expectation.</li>
            <li>This is a nice razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean and very attractive.</li>
            <li>would even pay more to have these changes, as this is an unbelievably good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Does a nice close shave on your legs.</li>
            <li>I had no choice but to use my Gillette Venus Breeze (which I now love even more lol) and reshave!&lt;br</li>
            <li>really nice, just what I wanted I am going to have knee surgery, so this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>It has excellent battery life and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Originally, I really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice pouch.</li>
            <li>I own a Remington that I have had to replace the blades twice already.</li>
            <li>Handles underarm curves with no pulling or catching.  </li>
            <li>Shaving legs gets a good shave, albeit, not terribly close.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li>and it does a really nice job.</li>

            <li>My legs are very appreciative of the smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Cleans super easy and great too!!</li>
            <li>It is fairly sturdy, does a pretty good job, and the battery carries a good charge.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and packing  was very good.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I have ever owned, it is fast and works perfectly, I cannot live without it</li>
            <li>Works great, good for the first timer and for the lady shaving for years.</li>
            <li>Perfect option for first time Pre-teen shavers:).</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>

            <li>Overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li>What more do you need?</li>
            <li>I have tried many ladies electric shavers...and they were lousey...</li>
            <li>OK for this price.</li>
            <li>I am pleased I tried this one this time.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and comfortable, and does a good job.</li>
            <li>and i love that i can shave on the go</li>
            <li>I love the easier wall plug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>She is so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love the charger.  </li>
            <li>so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li>So, when I was put on anticoagulants, my clumsiness became something more than an inconvenience.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this shaver for trimming my husband&#x27;s neck hair and shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave!</li>
            <li>So much better than giving my daughter a razor.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad i got this though.</li>
            <li>My search for the best personal electric shaver ended when I purchased this Panasonic series.</li>
            <li>When that died, I thought there must be a better brand out there, so I looked at Amazon reviews and decided on this one.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts, I&#x27;ll be very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>This works way better than the one I was using.  </li>
            <li>which I guess is okay since I&#x27;m not using it to shave anywhere else</li>
            <li>And, if your bathroom sockets are sideways, you&#x27;re not going to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several over the years, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is no power cord on the recharger.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results this shaver provides.</li>
            <li>It does not give you a smooth feeling at all!</li>
            <li>This shaver just stopped being able to charge, and died within a year.  </li>
            <li>Love this wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Glad to be rid of it now.</li>
            <li>She wanted to be able to sit safely in a chair and take her time shaving.</li>
            <li>The shave is close, but not always perfect (especially when I don&#x27;t take my time).</li>
            <li>The one fix I&#x27;d like to see is to be able to replace the trimmer blade.</li>
            <li>It was better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve bought over the years</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers for women do not work well at all.  </li>
            <li>Most leave a stubble.  </li>
            <li>2 Years would have been a better review if I had used it more</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great razor!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I like it but the Remington WDF 7000 is better, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver is much better (and price is lower) than the Panasonic shavers with heads (razor part)</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this one on line.</li>
            <li>My beauty routine has changed &amp; I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>After reading multiple reviews of electric razors, I found that this one was considered the best.</li>
            <li>On top of that, no matter where I shave it tugs on the hairs and hurts.</li>
            <li>It is okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been extremely satisfied with the many types of Panasonic products that I have purchased over the years</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I could stick with it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver, and I LOVE</li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and the shaver stands on top of charger that plugs into the wall</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I use this more then a razor.</li>
            <li>I love the cordless wall charger design.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to have better results with that based on the reviews I had read before deciding to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I like that so many of the parts are replaceable.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for an excellent shaver, look no further than the Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors and none help with this problem.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Just got this razor last night, and for the price I am Very impressed!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than any</li>
            <li>Love this one.  </li>
            <li>Love the wall charger that comes with it too.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It gets my legs just as smooth as disposable razors with NO razor burn!  </li>
            <li>received my Panasonic ES2207P a couple weeks ago, and am truly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>love the compact charger:  </li>
            <li>ok....</li>
            <li>Besides that though I love it.</li>
            <li>light and nice.</li>
            <li>I will love it</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my daughter a year ago, and was pleased by the design.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this changed my life.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this Shaver.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>:) You&#x27;ll not regret it.</li>
            <li>We read many reviews before selecting this one.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair, so it&#x27;s not the best closest shave.</li>
            <li>Works great and charges really fast.  </li>
            <li>Mostly in between shaves with this razor.</li>
            <li>Daughter love the way this works</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works OK, not as close as I would like.</li>
            <li>Love the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of these and this one works as well as any of them, and better than most.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite</li>
            <li>and I love that amazon still carries this version.  </li>
            <li>I have had this item for years and really love it.  </li>
            <li>They were gifts to my daughters and they simply love them too.</li>
            <li>Love it and in my opinion for an electric razor -</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>if I’m able to return them, could you please tell me how to do it or give me the address where I can send the package?</li>
            <li>I like that my legs don&#x27;t get nicks any more.  </li>
            <li>I like that better.  </li>
            <li>Can anyone suggest a better option for under the arms?</li>
            <li>Love the fact</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers most of my life and most of them have been Remington.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many electric shavers for my wife over our 40 year+ marriage ranging.</li>
            <li>I love the way it is set up for charging.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with price, shipping, etc.</li>
            <li>I am very happy not having any bumps on my legs, especially the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Much better than adding disposables to the landfills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I tried the $40 Remington side by side to the Panasonic - and the Panasonic is 150% better at getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>but mostly I use the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>tried the Panasonic with the pivoting head, which I assumed would be better.  </li>
            <li>Love that is rechargeable, plugs into outlet</li>
            <li>They sure don&#x27;t make things like they used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good quality and powerful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t have to get in the shower to shave</li>
            <li>but okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I had read a bunch of reviews before purchasing this, so I make sure to have my razor fully charged before use, to limit the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;es that can occur (just like with a &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; razor).</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this shaver.</li>
            <li>LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>it my wife is in love with it</li>
            <li>Make sure the unit is FULLY CHARGED before using and it will work well.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried this brand  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had it about a year now and still love it.</li>
            <li>Works great, gets very close shave, but not as close as shaving in the shower with my intuition razor.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love how it charges on the wall...</li>
            <li>The faster the blades move, the better and closer the shave.</li>
            <li>also love that this is a wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be able to give a better review.</li>
            <li>and the charger is a lot more compact.</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love the shaver however the metal tore</li>
            <li>Ok I just purchased the shaver and already I need to replace the shaver.</li>
            <li>If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the money!</li>
            <li>not as close a shave as desired, but better than a blade shaver for my touchy skin</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Love having an option not to be &#x27;gorilla girl&#x27; forever.</li>
            <li>Sure some places it does not get as close like a razor.</li>
            <li>Besides my husband,this is the second best thing that has ever happened to me.</li>
            <li>and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Off to find something better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace two battery operated shavers that I used for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to get it to start again but have to wait around 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is ok.  </li>
            <li>Works better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for 2 years and still love it.</li>
            <li>However, as with all electric razors, your are not going to get that nice silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>but I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>i wish it worked better to get the hairs.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>When that one finally quit I did an internet search for best leg shavers and this one came to the top.  </li>
            <li>The price is outstanding and it does the job in 1/4 the time without the emptying.  </li>
            <li>The charger is positioned so that it sits on top of the outlet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite pleased for the 3 months I did get to use it, however.  </li>
            <li>To date, I am completely satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and dont require me to change batteries.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job removing hair on both legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>but I love this waterproof razor.</li>
            <li>The contours are great and the shave works really well under arms or at the bikini line, using the pop up head.  </li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;m not expecting it to last forever, but for now it is great!</li>
            <li>The price of shipping is going to end up costing me more than the price of the razor.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, I find I have to shave more often with this shaver</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Amazon was excellent in their customer service and the second shaver</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you applied more pressure you might get a closer shave</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say and dislike the minimum number of words required in order to give you feedback.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my shaver.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more for my daughters!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable value.</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep it fully charged</li>
            <li>We are well pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I bought a 1 to 3 GE adapter because the razor charger takes one more outlet than I had available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many reviewers here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it works....</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that I can&#x27;t get hurt with the guard.  </li>
            <li>It an ok shaver.  </li>
            <li>works ok not as close a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li>I love this razor</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this razor, especially for the price I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I also do not like the base/charger that has to be plugged into the socket with the razor sitting on top of the wall socket.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and does a good job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>This razor works better than any women&#x27;s (or men&#x27;s) razor I have ever used and</li>
            <li>I downgraded the review because I had hoped to get more out of this</li>
            <li>This is one the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to a razor shave and you will not be able to obtain that with any electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to use when in a hurry</li>
            <li>I especially love this razor because I can now shave any time of day, versus only when I shower.</li>
            <li>am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Mostly for the bikini area and sometimes legs.</li>
            <li>For a $20.00 shaver, it does ok.</li>
            <li>But, overall does a great job like it a lot!</li>
            <li>I purchased this after learning I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave my legs in the shower before and after knee surgery for fear of infection.</li>
            <li>And when it would work, let&#x27;s just say it acted more as an epillator than a shaver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave many product reviews, but I must for this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Lovely shaver, a must have.</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to find another the even comes close.  </li>
            <li>You need to plug it upright into an outlet and stand the shaver on top.  </li>
            <li>I solely use this shaver for my \\&quot;woman area\\&quot; and I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>and so pleased with how well it works.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite travel razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have one and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this more than my Gillette Quatro.</li>
            <li>Was a worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li>She said it is one of the better razors she has had.</li>
            <li>the charger has no cord just box plugs into outlet and the razor sitting on top of box.</li>
            <li>I use this razor mostly for my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>and it works better if you use about 15 mins after bathing before using lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>just make sure you fully charge it the 1st time</li>
            <li>This brand is better.</li>
            <li>hold the shaver perpendicular to the surface, so that the foil and both side of the trimmer are touching your skin.</li>
            <li>I think 20 minutes is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, there&#x27;s a ton of it.</li>
            <li>I know I will enjoy for years to come!  </li>
            <li>and she love it</li>
            <li>and I glad I did get this one</li>
            <li>It offers a great trimmer and produces a nice close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>It works as described and love the cordless charger</li>
            <li>So glad I bought</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>, I make sure I apply the Vitaville</li>
            <li>For her it is perfect to use in between using a traditional razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Although I followed the directions and make sure it&#x27;s charged up before using.</li>
            <li>I look forward to having it for many years.</li>
            <li>My mother and my mom are both satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>the battery - works well for both of us :)</li>
            <li>and may not be able to get it to function again.  </li>
            <li>Much better than disposals.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>so I anticipate more than a year&#x27;s usage.  </li>
            <li>Still love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>This does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>Love this E razor.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would never be able to shave my legs again.</li>
            <li>more nicks, cuts, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy</li>
            <li>Nice size and shape but does not give a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues to date after many months of ownership.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice now, but am impressed by how well it shaves.  </li>
            <li>Even better?</li>
            <li>Have been quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>For my underarms, it works well though it does leave some stubble that i can feel more than see so</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>Unlike most shavers, it can go forward and backward and still cut hair; it doesn&#x27;t matter which way you hold it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very close but for just trimming it does a great job.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for me and gives a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>it is so cheap&amp;#34; and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also put it on the charger every day after I use it (mostly so I know where it is), so I have never had a problem with the battery dying mid-shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve told most of my friends about using an electric shaver, and after feeling how smooth my legs are, almost all of them want to try it!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is OK.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor in many years.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that I can shave off unwanted hair and not start to bleed.</li>
            <li>My legs were smooth and there wasn&#x27;t a bump or burn in sight!</li>
            <li>I thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s OK, that happens</li>
            <li>(It does not work as well on skin fresh out of the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;* Good battery.</li>
            <li>No hairs pulled and it still runs like a top.  </li>
            <li>We both agree that mine is the better razor.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t use batteries that just have to be thrown away and cause more garbage.</li>
            <li>There are not that many budget priced rechargeable wet/dry shavers out there</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay for legs if you are pressed for time or missed some hairs in the shower around the ankles.</li>
            <li>it so much I bought one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Works Great</li>
            <li>glad I bought it</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t remember much then I guess it&#x27;s not all that great.</li>
            <li>a WIn Win..thank you so much....</li>
            <li>It is well build and guaranteed safe for use, even by the novice.</li>
            <li>but glad I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>We are both very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone of our female friends.</li>
            <li>nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I should have read more of the 1 star reviews before purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it did the job better than a razor</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>I love the design and the punch.</li>
            <li>The charge is OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It does the job for sure, but not the close shave as a razor would.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite electric razor.  </li>
            <li>And not that the product is defective, it is just been on the market many years now</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried on my legs and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works well, much more efficient than blades</li>
            <li>It felt more like plucking than shaving.</li>
            <li>and it has been a lot more than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see through them any way).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review if that happens to me.</li>
            <li>Better than a razor.</li>
            <li>After looking at many of these types of shavers and going through their reviews, I chose this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li>Okay gals, so here&#x27;s the scoop on this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite feature is the wet/dry feature.  </li>
            <li>Love my razor.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the shave and runs very quiet.</li>
            <li>that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check ship date.  </li>
            <li>and I shave my neck mostly about once a month</li>
            <li>Ive ordered 2 more for friends that tried out  the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have taken it on trips, use it at home and can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Sure misses a lot of hairs to the point</li>
            <li>I also love the pop up shaver for my courser hair.</li>
            <li>I love it because I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>We both would buy again and we do recommend. :)</li>
            <li>Everything it said , and better.  </li>
            <li>Charge has not run out after more than 7 uses.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t like something or the site of purchase, I am more than glad to write a book.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t pay that much more for it either.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver</li>
            <li>, This is my 2nd one I have ordered they are so  nice!!!!</li>
            <li>I was so nervous about this shaver when I bought it because so many people were giving semi-bad reviews or saying that it hurt...</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will have it for many years.</li>
            <li>Better cut, trimmer catches the longer hair better.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and have been using it a lot.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it and it fits well in my hand and love the color.</li>
            <li>the result is not all satisfying.</li>
            <li>Love this, doesn&#x27;t get as close as razor shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for keeping the bikini area under control!</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand and is effective in shaving.  </li>
            <li>Close smooth shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li>I prefer men razors because they work better</li>
            <li>The shaver head pulled and rugged at hair and didn&#x27;t even get most of them.</li>
            <li>The shaver I have from the 1970s works better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure after seeing it (even in box still).</li>
            <li>, I will purchase something more like a Clio palm-size shaver.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure your shaver is fully charged before you use it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>But for my purposes (namely my legs), I&#x27;m 100% satisfied (and then some).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the razor twice and have been extremely pleased with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is great and really does work for longer or stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and so she stayed with the same model and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped it on the floor and it magically sprung to life.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I only paid $12 for this through Amazon Warehouse deals, and I am very happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple of passes to become hair-free, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many Elec.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Even the best of razors left me with razor bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>I guess its ok for shaving your legs...</li>
            <li>I think my husband will be glad im no longer having to use his shaver :)</li>
            <li>in all, this product comes as described :]</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shaver.</li>
            <li>Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love that it has no cord.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington ladies shavers for years and based on the reviews decided to try this one and it shaves much better.</li>
            <li>As my three stars attest to, it is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>So  glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I have had one for a year or more.  </li>
            <li>but they look like they cost more than another razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great razor considering I have tried many others, and wax kits too.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Glad that Amazon displayed a reminder on the web page of the date that I had purchased this item through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great to keep the chin hairs to a minimum when I am in too much of a rush in the morning to use tweezers.  </li>
            <li>No time to shave I just use it and head out the door. :)</li>
            <li>Gave to someone as a gift,not sure what to rate it yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The shaver doesn&#x27;t give you a finish like that of shaving cream and a razor, but it made me feel better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>It works okay.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with this razor, though I didn&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with it then and use it regularly at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by how well this razor works, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I stayed with Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just madly in love with this thing.</li>
            <li>It cuts closer and more thoroughly than all the others.  </li>
            <li>However, it does work and my girls love it</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t my favorite model.</li>
            <li>I want more of a trimmer than a shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this based off of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I can just pop the top off and rinse it off.</li>
            <li>Low maintenance at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li>U get a more temporary effect than if you use a disposable shaver.</li>
            <li>finally i found this and iam now very happy that it gave me a close shave without burns.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure which to get.  </li>
            <li>I will say I have never been to any store or site that carries so many</li>
            <li>you Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;  :):):)</li>
            <li>:):):):</li>
            <li>Okay nevermind the name here, its the wife writing the review.  </li>
            <li>I got this about a year ago and still love it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more; it&#x27;s everything that I needed it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the above aspects, I&#x27;m most impressed with the ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>Never owned one before, but glad I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>Would expect this to cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li>use it in water just to be on the safe side, but it still came up with problems.</li>
            <li>It plugs into the wall; the razor plugs into the top of the charger.</li>
            <li>Bought one for me and one for my best friend, she and I both have 2 different types of hair and growth.</li>
            <li>, I use my finances amazon account to buy stuff :-)</li>
            <li>I love this razor, but.</li>
            <li>Overall, best razor ever.</li>
            <li>Need 6 more words ok all done.</li>
            <li>Its even better when im in a hurry</li>
            <li>i love this razor</li>
            <li>I was able to return this item</li>
            <li>and I love the fact you can place it on the charger and don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li>It holds its charge much better than most.</li>
            <li>and I think I am in Love.</li>
            <li>Used mostly on my bikini area</li>
            <li>I love the hell out of this razor.</li>
            <li>Also it does not give as close a shave as a razor, but for the cost and safety compared to a razor I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a bit more close of a shave</li>
            <li>but most of you results will turn out wrong👎</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get a useable shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this!!  </li>
            <li>definitely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when I have last minute outfit changes into skirts and shorts and haven&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li>I opted for the Panasonic shaver and love its sleek design and charger.  </li>
            <li>This morning I said to myself that there HAD to be a better way.  </li>
            <li>This purchase was more to do with water conservation than expecting a close shave.  </li>
            <li>That I have to shave more often</li>
            <li>semi-Bad&lt;br /&gt;It sits directly on top of the plug charger.</li>
            <li>His health care aids say the razor works better</li>
            <li>That lift up is great on the area under his chin and it really gets in close.  </li>
            <li>Not having to buy batteries anymore makes this an even better value.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The price makes it even more</li>
            <li>This is okay...</li>
            <li>I have had a Panasonic for many years and it just stopped working .</li>
            <li>Love this Panasonic cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading so many people saying this stops working and stuff.</li>
            <li>Read a lot of reviews on different brands and decided on this one and very very happy with it!  </li>
            <li>SHOPPED AROUND A LOT FOR A SHAVER FOR MY WIFE, MOST WERE BATTERY OPERATED.</li>
            <li>OK to trim, but not close at all.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I try this shaver.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide quite as close a shave as a manual razor, but then I didn&#x27;t expect it to, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>How many times are you going to ask people to review the items they order.  </li>
            <li>What I have used &amp; read got a better preview.  </li>
            <li>It can be used several times without charging and works best in the shower or tub.</li>
            <li>I love this rechargeable razor.  </li>
            <li>This is more like 4.5 stars.  </li>
            <li>For an inexpensive razor, it sure works.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my legs and NO irritation!</li>
            <li>It does shaves my legs OK, no problem there, and that is why I gave it 3 stars--it just does not work for my chin.</li>
            <li>I love that its rechargeable and in my experience I do not have to charge it between uses every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in and let it charge overnight because I wanted to make sure that it was fully powered.</li>
            <li>That came from using a trimmer on my face for many years.  </li>
            <li>Had I not been wearing mine, my injuries would have been much more severe.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.  </li>
            <li>Use it in the shower, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this shaver will perform as well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the design fits my hand great.</li>
            <li>There are many like it</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s how most products are nowadays</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>It does shave the hair close, invisible to the eye, but it, like most electric razors, do not get razor close.</li>
            <li>Just love it.  </li>
            <li>It has been more than a month, and I am ineligible for a return.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this item.</li>
            <li>I think it is better than my disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it ...</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind saying, I try to get the best deal possible</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally satisfied, I&#x27;d give it a 10 of 10.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that this has caused no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, anything else would raise the price, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>this product and better than they used to make them.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>If somebody&#x27;s going to be super-close (or touching)</li>
            <li>This would be a much better product if it had an optional electric cord</li>
            <li>have to rest it on top of something just in case.</li>
            <li>:) .  </li>
            <li>I love shopping with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I decided I&#x27;d call customer service to make sure we&#x27;d receive another.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>and the razer stands on top of it</li>
            <li>i love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is just one more thing to clutter up  your living space.</li>
            <li>A bit more curved.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting a disposable.</li>
            <li>However, it fit nicely in my hand, &amp; glided over my legs with ease.</li>
            <li>If the charger had been better, I would have given this shaver 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that many reviews for this item mention the shaver dying after 8 months or so.</li>
            <li>Safe, fast and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I decided to buy this razor.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>and I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love that it is rechargeable and waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>My latest one died after 1 year.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;m not going to lie...</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it in water</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also love the charger.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>A must have for all ladies who don&#x27;t like to get their underarms waxed more than once a month..</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave...very, very close.</li>
            <li>usually most of electric product here in amazon do have 110-220v range, but this doesnt.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t going to find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Nice comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li>Love That It&#x27;s Rechargeable</li>
            <li>Does a great job, really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t cut her self any more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to practice more and see if that improves with user-experience.</li>
            <li>, I found this razor, and, after some research, decided it would be the right choice, based on many good reviews</li>
            <li>Shipped here quickly and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>My legs feel very smooth after shaving and the armpits are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>I love that it can be rinsed under the water to keep it nice and clean.</li>
            <li>she shaved with a razor in the shower, she would be in there well over a 1/2 hour and drain our 80 gallon hot water tank!!!</li>
            <li>It seems to be very powerful, so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus for someone whose skin can handle it!</li>
            <li>That being said it must be effective and user friendly.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Have used it twice and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far , so good !  </li>
            <li>features all around havent got sstuck better than any raor ive tried its great highly recommended</li>
            <li>Ladies, this works perfectly for those &#x27;special&#x27; sensitive areas that need a close shave.</li>
            <li>Good product especially when you have very fine leg hair,  maintains a charge for a good time, would recommend it.</li>
            <li>No, you&#x27;ll never get as close as a normal razor, but it&#x27;s great for in the summer when you have to shave more often.</li>
            <li>biggest qualm with the shaver is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for like and hour depending on how many areas you are going to shave, but the battery holds charge pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had the first for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a nice clean shave I have tried others</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean shave</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice clean shave</li>
            <li>It has smooth result and is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Hands down best electric razor ever and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>A great product, I highly recomented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>i need nickel-free since i&#x27;m highly allergic, so it&#x27;s great for underarms.</li>
            <li>and it has worked fine, still going strong battery and all!</li>
            <li>Battery lasts forever, super easy-to-use, and looks so cute too!</li>
            <li>Special longer hair razor head should be handy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know there were so many excellent dry shavers like this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and shave more often because it is so easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits easily in my hands though I think some sort of gripping material would be better on the sides as it can get slippery.  </li>
            <li>Gives a very clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked mine so much that I ordered a spare plus 3 more for gifts!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>But if you use it correctly and keep it charged, it can be a pretty good substitute.  </li>
            <li>Not as close/smooth of a shave as a straight razor, but easier &amp; more convenient to use, resulting in an attractive and comfortable shave anywhere &amp; anytime its needed.</li>
            <li>This razor is so good, and shaves so closely, it&#x27;s now my first choice every time.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Razor works perfectly and has a long battery life once fully charged.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a good 3 days growth going on... which isn&#x27;t much...and every once in awhile</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It keeps a good charge and is not complicated to use.</li>
            <li>However, the shaver does a pretty good job of delivering the close shave one always hopes to get with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...</li>
            <li>This panasonic gives you a close shave, battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It hold a pretty good charge...</li>
            <li>so im very happy with that, although there is some minor itching for about a day or so.  </li>
            <li>I think this item is the best It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your skin I wish I had purchased it long ago</li>
            <li>Does a good job consistently.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job for an electric.</li>
            <li>Pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>works pretty good ...</li>
            <li>If you are one that wants a good enough close shave, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>I can keep my legs looking pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor but pretty good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>The first time it didn&#x27;t turn on I thought it was done for good.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time and works great!</li>
            <li>Just got this product yesterday as my very first ladies shaver, I love it!</li>
            <li>This works pretty good</li>
            <li>that is a pretty good buy</li>
            <li>I gave this item 5 stars because it is the most comfortable razor to hold and gives such a close and perfect shave  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this seller again... as long as they have the best deal.</li>
            <li>When I first got this shaver, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on another review where someone had bought these as a safe option for new shaver and so glad!!  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a very good product and will buy more as I need them.</li>
            <li>Once again, I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>For this price it is TOTALLY worth it!!</li>
            <li>But it worth of its price!!</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy my friend introduced me to this product because now I can&#x27;t see how I would ever live without it.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new shaver, and this one is doing great.  </li>
            <li>It works great on all areas, from legs and arms to the more sensitive areas like underarms and bikini areas.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Love it, so easy</li>
            <li>The top snaps on and off for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Everything can be totally dry, and it removes the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have something where I can just do a quick touch up and go.</li>
            <li>I mostly just use it on my legs and it glides easily across my skin and cuts the hairs quite closely.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold, has not pulled any hairs, and is water safe.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I have ever bought for the under arms on dry</li>
            <li>it is safe and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, all that aside, this is still an excellent dry leg shaver, which is what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>Just turn and shave dry legs for an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>I love the razor and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I love that its rechargeable and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is rechargeable and so easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Handy for quick touch ups</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to work</li>
            <li>Top comes off for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>So in terms of using it dry, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts anymore it does an awesome job shaving dry.</li>
            <li>Safe and easy to use .  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ve used it dry, both work perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, I bought one for my daughter a couple years ago and it is still going strong</li>
            <li>I found that it works best if you shave dry.</li>
            <li>After returning a shaver from another manufacturer, I was a bit hesitant to use this, but it is wonderful - shaves closely and does not scrap or burn even when used dry</li>
            <li>just wonderful must better that I expected at the price paid.</li>
            <li>I LOVED using this razor &amp; bought it in February because of the low cost &amp; good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave that I get to enjoy too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the grand kid will enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works better if you grow your leg hair out for a week or more, but I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of not having fairly smooth legs, so that&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
            <li>Light and comfortable in my hand, it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>No electric shaver will ever be as good as a manual shaver but at full full charge it comes close.</li>
            <li>It remains charged and is very easy to manipulate, shave and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised and happy to receive these items before Christmas after the promised date was after.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to use and to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Wow!  Works great.  </li>
            <li>Great price, offers convenience with charger and it works well with unsightly and thicker hair!</li>
            <li>This razor gives a beautifully close shave, leaving me far more smooth feeling than I had anticipated, and leaving not a trace of stubble to be seen.</li>
            <li>do like how easy it is, how good it is with my skin (no cuts or anything) and how fast I can shave now!</li>
            <li>It has a smooth shave, it has a very comfortable handling and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>Once I get up to the fine hairs on top of my thigh, it doesn&#x27;t get it 100%</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure how well a shaver would work.</li>
            <li>For me, it seems to glide best when used dry and no bumps or irritation to speak of!  </li>
            <li>I had the older version of this too, the blue/green one, which I liked but bought this one when I lost the charger (I&#x27;d had that for years, and it still works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been very happy with any of them and most of them &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; the skin to some degree or other and cause pain and bleeding.</li>
            <li>Works great so far and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Not the closest shave, but is very good at getting the job done in one pass rather than shaving the same area repeatedly.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very easy to use, and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I found that it works best in the shower with shaving cream and hair length is a major factor in the success of the shave.</li>
            <li>I am now using the shaver and like it very much - I find it much more effective</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase, it works just fine on my legs, and is very easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>As with most electric razors, the shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I would have liked, but it certainly was better than not being able to shave at all.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and at a great price that arrived right to my door!</li>
            <li>And for those of us with skin issues and have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors without a skin reaction, this alternative is great.</li>
            <li>I  love how it it gives  a  smooth and  </li>
            <li>Still feels smooth but not as smooth as a 5 blade disposable shave!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge and has so far lived up to its name because I have been able to successfully maneuver it closely over all my curves...</li>
            <li>Best $20 I have spent in a while-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ES2207P since early 2013, and let me tell you, after having used this WONDERFUL product dozens of times, it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using a disposable razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Love the close shave and how smooth it is on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I think the most important things to remember when using this is:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>so far it works great.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of getting her lady bits smooth.</li>
            <li>She never complains about it, so I&#x27;m giving it Great Star Action.</li>
            <li>Works great for this 63 year old.</li>
            <li>So far it works great.</li>
            <li>so far a great product.  </li>
            <li>My wife wasn&#x27;t happy with her old electric shaver (also a panasonic shaver)</li>
            <li>But I checked the aggregate site (free) Consumer Search and this was the top women&#x27;s shaver</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>This does an excellent job, although I must say I have never used it wet, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li>Giving great relief to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I was happy that she was not self conscious anymore.</li>
            <li>My daughter recommended this to me and so far, have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>I had to do three or more passes to get my legs really smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the pop up trimmer blade and the close shave blade leaves my skin feeling smooth all day.</li>
            <li>over all I happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>While it says it is available to use in the shower, I will use my blade razor for that, as it gives the closest shave, even better than this.  </li>
            <li>I am hair free and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.</li>
            <li>but it works great in the shower and seems to be completely water-tight.  </li>
            <li>Original charger &amp; original battery, amazingly.</li>
            <li>I love the design, light weight,, ease of operation.  </li>
            <li>far it seems to work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great option for a young girl to learn to shave her legs without having to worry about cuts  &amp; nicks from shaving.  </li>
            <li>This razor has been great so far.  </li>
            <li>I love this electric shaver, and it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I imagine you have to use it more often for a really smooth leg</li>
            <li>She says it does a great job and is completely waterproof and holds a charge well.  </li>
            <li>i recommend  this product for women who like a smooth, close shave and don&#x27;t like getting cut by their shavers. :3</li>
            <li>This is great for young and elderly ladies.</li>
            <li>and I really love how light it is.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>and I feel more comfortable with her using an electric than a blade.</li>
            <li>I know the recharging method is not the most important aspect of the razor but there is no stand, no cord just stick the charger on the razor and plug it into the wall.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product delivery faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>My daughters $5 electric razor works more comfortably than this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>SO I need a really safe shaver that also gives me a close smooth shave</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this product but so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this razor and the close shave it offers.  </li>
            <li>Found a reasonably priced, good working razor.  </li>
            <li>And becareful if you have any moles or raise beauty marks, this razor is so good, is shaves them like a straight razor</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as hand shaving with a store bought razor; and a whole lot faster.</li>
            <li>It really does make shaving easier, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge and shaves very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reliable and a good deal</li>
            <li>and I tell you this has really spoiled me in getting a good close shave in a blink of an eye.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, very affordable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, very affordable</li>
            <li>Good shaver, fast service....</li>
            <li>Good product, Fast service.</li>
            <li>Good electric shaver for price!&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well, though I thought it would shave closer.</li>

            <li>Good price and works very well</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave for an electric and is even good for underarms.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who does not want to put a  lot of money into a product, but wants a good working tool.</li>
            <li>The service was fast and the price fair.</li>
            <li>what kind of hair it thought it was useful for</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, but as others have stated, it is better used dry.</li>
            <li>Delivered right to my door!!</li>
            <li>got item super fast and was on time lol</li>
            <li>No lies, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been able to as quickly and efficiently as I am able to with this product.</li>
            <li>Great shave with no mess.</li>
            <li>NOT TOO GOOD - Very surprised so many like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer feature, however, so I can use something else, but since it&#x27;s right there, it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t yelp and make my family come running...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is suitable for those times when a quick shave is needed without a shower.  </li>
            <li>me, the most important aspect of any shaver should be its ability to give you a fine, close shave without leaving stubs.</li>
            <li>Works like a real razor...smooth and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>It gives a very clean and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>While it is not the closest shave in the world, after putting lotion on, I&#x27;m pretty darned pleased!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on getting a higher-end electric shaver, this is a good solution!</li>
            <li>this electric razon has been a dream come true!</li>

            <li>I did some research and found out that electric razors are the best route (other than laser).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other razors but this one is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and painless!</li>

            <li>I got mine September 2014, it is June 2015 and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Would  recommend it if looking for a good shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I could use it to get a decent trim, this isn&#x27;t even a good trimmer.</li>

            <li>The razor in general does a great job.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is pretty much amazing.</li>
            <li>Since I had a great experience with Remington, I bought another of their shavers from their website; it was junk, barely cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li>Works fine,  easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited at the idea, since it said it was great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, use and does a fine shaving job.</li>
            <li>At first this razor was pretty good, I was even able to shave my armpits with it without getting shredded.</li>
            <li>I bought this during my first year of college--apparently, hairy legs, arms, armpits, and sideburns aren&#x27;t popular on campus?</li>
            <li>handy and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I like having a cordless shaver handy when I need a touch-up, but shavers aren&#x27;t my first choice for leg hair removal.</li>
            <li>The instructions it comes with are pretty stright forward, which is nice.</li>
            <li>which may be true, however, I am glad I started them out this way.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the shaver does a good job dry !</li>
            <li>The best thing was the lack of blood trailing down my leg or ankle.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s AWESOME having something I can grab and do a quick dry shave minutes b4 having to be somewhere.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>the best 20$ spent!!</li>
            <li>but as a dry shaver ti does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Kind of surprising that using an inexpensive \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; razor works far better than my men&#x27;s razors that cost 4-5 times as much.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>It works just fine on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>and she likes it just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fine</li>
            <li>I just bought this razor, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade razor, but it is fine with me for what I need now.</li>
            <li>easy fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>But it works just fine out of water.</li>
            <li>Still works fine and keeps a charge.</li>
            <li>It lives up to its claims, providing easy and comfortable hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t yet tried in the shower</li>
            <li>I have been using the shaver for a couple months now and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>I shaved my bikini area and was easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, and for me it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works fine.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job of trimming longer hairs (when I haven&#x27;t shaved downstairs in a while and don&#x27;t want to break out the scissors), but it will not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>This is light weight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It works well on my legs and also fine hair on my face &amp; arms.</li>
            <li>it is light in weight &amp; curved for an easy shave.  </li>
            <li>It was a fine electric razor, for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>

            <li>I have fine hairs</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave but for me it is fine.</li>
            <li>I do just one swipe on my bikini area and arms and works fine.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is so smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This shaver works fine for me, it remove the close hair under my chin.  </li>
            <li>that is easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning</li>
            <li>and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Light and slim design easy to handle.</li>
            <li>but for the price difference it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It is easy for her to use, smooth close save on her legs.</li>
            <li>2 years weekly twice use, it is still working fine and also has never shown wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I found this model to be pretty good and for the price, it is well worth getting.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor about 8mo ago and it worked fine</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>but it was easy to use and the shaving was smooth.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use and comfortable (both on removing hair and being held).</li>
            <li>Glad I did, it works just as awesome as the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I have been super pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>With this, i&#x27;m able to quickly shave my legs</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly, competently, and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super convenient!</li>
            <li>but this does the job when your legs need a quick shave!  </li>
            <li>stuff done downtown and quick!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li>I love that i can use it really quick</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly, and not damaged at all :)</li>
            <li>For a quick shaving fix where you just need to remove visible hair, this is okay</li>
            <li>I was able to shave quickly with no bumps.</li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>Smooth and strong.</li>
            <li>This is a super shaver!</li>
            <li>But for a quick shave of the legs, this is a magical lil thing</li>
            <li>I love the way this razor is extremely quick in giving a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it is exactly as close as a blade shave, but if you keep up with regular shaving, it is certainly very, very good and better than being cut up.  </li>
            <li>While having a waterproof shaver is really cool (and it really is capable of working in the shower), getting fine or sparse hairs with this product is kind of challenging.</li>
            <li>You plug in the plug thing into the outlet and then the shaver goes on top of it, saving very much needed counter space!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have much more to say !</li>
            <li>This shaver is shaped nicely so that it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and really easy to clean.</li>

            <li>It is easy to use and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It is light comfortable in the hands to grasp and cleans easy.</li>
            <li>This shaver is lightweight, has an ergonomic fit for your hand, is easy to charge, and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>shaver is easy to clean, easy to re-charge, the charger comes with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use, light and portable, efficient.</li>
            <li>It seams to work better dry and works great on the face.</li>
            <li>it shaves very close and quick good for travel</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product, because it is light weight and easy to control, it&#x27;s not so noisy</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was super (and pleasantly) surprised with how great a shave I got with this thing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to be able to shave my legs dry and run out of the house.</li>
            <li>not as close of a shave as using a regular shaver, and also isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling when using</li>
            <li>easy to use, works great on even coarse</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Good deal and super fast shipping</li>
            <li>So I was really hesitant about buying any new shaver again, but based on the great reviews for this Panasonic, I took the plunge, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect gift for the budding young lady!  </li>
            <li>this electric razor is so easy to use and leaves me with smooth legs and arms with no pain and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Love this so quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Great price, easy to use, quiet and light weight.</li>
            <li>It works, is easy to clean up, and is easy to fit in the charger.</li>
            <li>It is light and compact and charges quickly!  </li>
            <li>This little shaver is awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>It sure beats sitting in the shower with a straight razor and soap!!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than a certain brand make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before every use</li>
            <li>The extra feature of the trimmer is very nice and easy to set and use, just a flick of the button up and the trimmer is raised.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and ergonomically friendly.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I have to say I am super pleased!</li>
            <li>The shipment date was accurate.  </li>
            <li>Water proof is a huge plus for her.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, works easily and leaves everything smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t a huge deal.  </li>
            <li>This is my 4th shaver from Panasonic and this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth shave and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean &amp; recharge too.</li>
            <li>This razor actually does a great job when it works.</li>
            <li>It is easy to charge, hold, use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is light years ahead of the cordless razors</li>
            <li>Everything felt SO smooth</li>
            <li>It does not give you that smooth silky shave you get from a razor.</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on my underarms.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for myself, and my sister liked it so much</li>
            <li>I also enjoy not having to worry about nicking myself.</li>
            <li>For only 20 bucks, it&#x27;s a GREAT investment.</li>
            <li>That model is replaced with the ES2207 and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable under arms and for bikini area.</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes shavers for women that truly do not pinch or scratch, but leave area smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your legs smooth like from a razor</li>
            <li>but she is not concerned about baby smooth legs at this age.</li>
            <li>It has been smooth since then.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>so I went over it again and the area became smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but close enough for me to be happy.</li>
            <li>After having two Remington Shavers that did not last the Panasonic is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>Great for facial hair.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth the shave was.  </li>
            <li>this is after light use.  </li>
            <li>Smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>If you do that, the shaver will have no problem staying secure on the charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my legs are smooth as I like them..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap that even if it breaks in a month, I would order another.  </li>
            <li>I got this razor a couple of months ago and it works fantastic...</li>
            <li>So I bought this one thinking it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It does everything it claims and gives a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, has pop-up for sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>It is lighter weight than the Remington, shaves closer (amazingly close for an electric shaver) and holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly and never grabs my skin.</li>
            <li>Just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, close shave and works really well for underarms.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a fairly smooth shave and has held its charge well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>but no matter how lightly I pressed it would always end up ripping hairs out.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading everybody talk about the smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>She felt secure with mine</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>I had no chance at getting it smooth that way</li>
            <li>Works great for trimming private areas, without razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li>does all i ask of a razor and is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave smooth to the skin</li>
            <li>The two things I love about it the most are that it&#x27;s (relatively) quiet, and it really does a great job.  </li>
            <li>will get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>So I get a smooth shave from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results were smooth with no problems with ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>the shaver was that we RV camp and don&#x27;t always have water or sewer hook up available</li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which, fortunately I had kept.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Conair LW D375WCSV Satiny Smooth Ladies Wet/Dry rechargeable, charged it and tried it another day.  </li>
            <li>and this is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This shaver is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It works well, is easy to clean, and maintains charge well.  </li>
            <li>so close and smooth smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily for my underarms.  </li>
            <li>and I get a smooth underarm without the burn.  </li>
            <li>Also the flip up shaver, how easy it is to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>It comes handy when you are in hurry and want to shave fast and go after going to work or school.</li>
            <li>Granted, you are not baby smooth after using this, but the shave is so close</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and produces a smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>

            <li>It is comfortable to hold and gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>it came packaged well, with detailed instructions and intact.</li>
            <li>It is gentle when shaving the underarm area, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave if you don&#x27;t want razor.</li>
            <li>Never gave a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>but then when I would turn it on it would just sound worn out and die.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>A close shave, smooth legs and arms.</li>
            <li>Its light</li>
            <li>It goes over your skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy the Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li>Product does not make my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>but it has been worth more than its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>This is great because I can shave while my baby is playing in the same room!</li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I owned several Panasonic and they all performed great.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>, then I use the roller blades to smooth out the skin.  </li>
            <li>still in the drawer and will probably never see the light of day again.</li>
            <li>This one shaves close and so smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is actually smooth when I am done shaving.</li>
            <li>Well made and work fantastic</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy expecting a shave as smooth as a razor because you won&#x27;t get that with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use</li>
            <li>It might as well have been disposable for the light use it had before conking out.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>The light comes on when charging, but that&#x27;s all it does now.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>works great, months later now.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>gives a smooth and close underarm and leg shave, doesn&#x27;t cause any rash or allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You have no indicator (light, etc) to show the remaining charge or when charging is finished.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the charging light.</li>
            <li>I am comfortable recommending this to others.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m still happy with this purchase, but I did want to update my review with my experiences.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important on the journey through recovery.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the storage bag would fit the razor AND the charger, instead of just the razor itself.</li>
            <li>The skin on my legs has never been this smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Panasonic &amp; Amazon.com for making this product available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean  charging is a breeze.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning: It is extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Fits hand and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be cheap</li>
            <li>I always have smooth legs with no stubble after.  </li>
            <li>It is light and compact.  </li>
            <li>She has light brown hair on her legs and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my legs so if that&#x27;s the only area you are using it on</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give me that silky smooth that I want.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Does it come out perfectly smooth?</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best electric razor I have found so far, and what makes it even better is the relatively low price.</li>
            <li>If it had a light on front, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many different foil razors over the years, and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>The only problem my wife experienced was abrasion on underarms presumably from the trimmer head.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It also helped greatly cut back on razor burn on my under arms.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>so I really enjoy having it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that they are much improved.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job...... would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave, and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>it does a great job on my corse italian hair.</li>
            <li>Light weight, not too noisy and</li>
            <li>it gets the job done comfortably.</li>
            <li>I used to get allergies from shaving, since using this I am allergy free.</li>
            <li>Does not give the close shave I am used to with my regular razor but a great time saver when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>This is comfortable to hold and does the job.  </li>
            <li>When it worked it was great, but it only lasted 7 months before it stopped charging.</li>
            <li>I still prefer the close shave of a razor, but this works well for touch-ups and when there isn&#x27;t time for a detailed shave.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I would give the shaver five stars if the light would go off showing that it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and like the styling and the colors.</li>
            <li>Granted, it won&#x27;t get you as smooth as a razor, but you also won&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>She does not complain of razor irritation and her legs are as smooth as can be with this device.  </li>
            <li>Filled out the customer service form on Panasonic&#x27;s website to no avail.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for travel</li>
            <li>I like the way it fits so comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>It works well and easy clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This one makes my legs really smooth.  </li>
            <li>Recommend for everyone who  uses daily or often, great</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth as silk shave, stick to a razor as this shaver doesn&#x27;t get that close.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and effective.</li>
            <li>My mother liked it so much</li>
            <li>Works great and is rather quiet.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried the razor under my arms yet, but honestly that wasn&#x27;t really why I bought the razor.  </li>
            <li>My legs are still smooth just not silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a smooth shave which the product delivers.</li>
            <li>It is not stubble you can see, but you can feel it, so if you want smooth legs, I don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li>It does work best with shaving cream, but I use foamy hand soap as it is cheaper and doesn&#x27;t smell so heavy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, also.</li>
            <li>1 arm pit went smooth as baby bottoms.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and it&#x27;s already saved me money.</li>
            <li>1 arm pit went smooth as baby bottoms.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and it&#x27;s already saved me money.</li>
            <li>great razor for smaller areas of shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great Shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a great bikini razor which I have used for years on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I like the recharging unit, which fits in the wall plug, leaving vanity or counter space free.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean as the top/blades snaps off and can be rinsed/washed under the faucet with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li>The grip is smooth and all one piece, no rubber pads or things to catch on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heave any razor burn but it does practically make you smooth.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic gave a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using cheap razors for</li>
            <li>I gives smooth looks but not feel.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and leave you baby smooth in one swipe and the stubble attachment hurts when using it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my husband would admire how smooth my legs are with this razor, but for day in and out it keeps my legs looking presentable.</li>
            <li>simple product, works great.</li>
            <li>few notes on how I use this product to get the best results:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of experimentation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, why the need for the detailed directions?</li>
            <li>The light on the charger says its going</li>
            <li>This one was cheap and still had what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Great for people who practice lots of sports or just simply work out, it reduces the shaving time by a lot.</li>
            <li>It shaves closely, is easy to clean, and is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last forever, so great for camping or beach trips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent I felt comfortable with it</li>
            <li>Comfortable, &amp; a close shave.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much, she may use it all of the time.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for any lady, especially the preteen girl whom this was purchased for.  </li>
            <li>I like the this unit, it shaves close and charges quickly, easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>No it didn&#x27;t give me the silky smooth finish like a razor in the bathroom</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the battery isn&#x27;t that great after 1 year.</li>
            <li>hold a charge, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second one of these, they are a a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>being a women i want a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make your legs completely smooth to the touch, but makes them hairless.</li>
            <li>you use it daily, it works great....</li>
            <li>She can use this in the shower; it glides over curves, gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t rip it off even though the sound the thing makes tells you otherwise.</li>
            <li>Seems that Phillips knows how to make fantastic men&#x27;s electric shavers, but gets a failing grade on their womens&#x27; models.</li>
            <li>I have a reason to shave all the time and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The design fits your hand comfortably; light-weight.</li>
            <li>Works very well and really handy...</li>
            <li>Smooth, works well.</li>
            <li>This will NOT give you that smooth as a razor shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for younger girls that are getting into the act of shaving without having to worry about accidentally getting cut.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and</li>
            <li>It glides on your legs smoothly.  </li>
            <li>smooth* legs.</li>
            <li>but I do it to avoid razor burn and achieve smooth legs.</li>
            <li>and she did not feel comfortable using a razor for her underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep clean with the brush that comes with</li>
            <li>Smooth, close, comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver,  nice close shave on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It did such a great job that I decided to purchase one.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product as it produces a close shave.</li>
            <li>I filled out a return and shipped it to the Panasonic returns department for a replacement.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and glides over my skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a close, smooth shave with no pulling or discomfort.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a medium strength, light weight ladies razor.</li>
            <li>Works great for me, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back even after I have a shower at home.</li>
            <li>I would say if you&#x27;re in a situation where you need a really smooth shave (honeymoon, beach vacation</li>
            <li>Now I can shave comfortably and in privacy too.</li>
            <li>This does such a great job of taking care of my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Primarily a convenience item.</li>
            <li>The light on the charger is on</li>
            <li>never worked as good s my regular razor, but I&#x27;m on blood thinners and it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Just a good product so far.</li>
            <li>and it is awesome and so much easier than using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive, fair skin like me, and you want a smooth shave without razor burn, BUY THIS RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>(????) I&#x27;m a fair skinned Redhead with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Got it for the wife a couple of weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything can come as close as a good old razor and shaving gel....</li>
            <li>I had an old electric razor that I loved and can no longer get a foil or blades for.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me, used it once</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old Lady Sunbeam that I loved.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised at how good a job it does.</li>
            <li>I do not have thick hair at all and this shaver should have been able to do the job effortlessly if it was even close to the wonderful reviews written about it.</li>
            <li>The shave was nice and smooth (as smooth as you will get without using a real razor in the bath or shower).  </li>
            <li>After losing my old standby, go figure how that happened, I was delighted to find this one here.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t as good as my old one which they don&#x27;t make now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my husband&#x27;s Norelco.</li>
            <li>very close shave, great to keep legs pool ready</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>This is the same brand &amp; style that I had &amp; hope I get just as many good years</li>
            <li>Works best wet in the shower,  but is useful out as well</li>
            <li>For me, besides the skin being clean and dry, it helps when the hair is a bit longer than nub length (when the hair is a bit longer, the shaver gets a better cut), and using a circular motion is also very effective.</li>
            <li>As someone who gets ingrown hairs pretty easily, this is much better than using disposable razors.</li>
            <li>It is handy to have around for quick shave and just to look pretty.  </li>
            <li>Dose  the job well for me; easy to use; stays charged for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I clean it with a little alcohol on a tissue after each use and it has been doing a great job!</li>
            <li>you have to position the razor just right on the charger to make sure its getting charged.</li>
            <li>I love the compact recharging station as well that plugs right into the outlet.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give an electric razor one more</li>
            <li>This thing is just plain convenient and AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>Gets the job done that I seem to not be able to do right in the shower.</li>
            <li>Just the wall brick and the razor sits right on it, cute as can be.  </li>
            <li>It just plugs into the wall, and the razor just sits right on top of the charger.  </li>
            <li>Love the charger, no cord, plugs right into wall.  </li>
            <li>It fits right in my hand, is easy to clean, and was even fully charged when I got it!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am pleased to report that I agree with the positive reviews!</li>
            <li>She really likes that it is rechargeable and so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love it, great close shave simple to use, easy to clean and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>not bad, easy to use and gives an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li>I just received this and have only used it once, but I love it!!  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is extra sturdy and very handy.  </li>
            <li>Anyway,I suggest you to buy this item as it is very useful.</li>
            <li>Very economical use of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well for a nice clean shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my legs feeling smooth, clean, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Works great if you want a clean shave, but if you are buying this to trim and want different lengths, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>I get a clean shave and that is fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li>Durable, clean smooth cut per my wife&#x27;s statement.</li>
            <li>and I like having clean and smooth looking legs as I wear running shorts.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for light clean up shaving.</li>
            <li>Makes a great first shaver for young girls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really pretty happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>If you want to look clean &amp; smooth, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>Took me all of five minutes to get all smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a decent amount of time and options are nice to use.</li>
            <li>Mother in law needed something reliable, and easy to handle, it shipped quickly and she likes the way it works.</li>
            <li>This does what I bought it for: gives me a quick and easy way to touch up legs when I haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully shave.</li>
            <li>So quick &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy and is almost as close as shaving.</li>
            <li>So easy to just break this out and shave really quickly.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing an electric shaver and so far I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy</li>
            <li>This is for day to day quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li>hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My old one cost $75, so the price was almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use that I don&#x27;t find that a problem.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absolutely brilliant for delicate areas n very easy to clean</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>She loves it very much and says it is so much better than a blade and</li>
            <li>this one is great...very pleased and very reasonably priced..</li>
            <li>At this point, I was able to shave my legs (which I had let go for a bit too long-luckily I&#x27;m in a comfortable relationship, lol), my underarms, and the more delicate areas of my body with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My shaver arrived quickly and I was delighted to find it was charged and ready to perform right out the box.  </li>
            <li>It did not perform at all like the smooth, effective new Panasonic</li>
            <li>I find it as others have; that it is good for removing facial hair, and easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use (legs, underarms, and bikini), and holds its charge for many weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used it on dry skin and am pleased with the good job it does on my legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is great for quick shaves for hitting the pool or beach at the last minute.  </li>
            <li>I know you can&#x27;t expect a baby smooth finish from a dry shaver, but when you pass over a leg patch and can see that the hairs weren&#x27;t touched, the product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Although it does not shave as close as a razor it is great for a quick shave and shaves well enough.</li>
            <li>I am in a hurry most of the time and use it dry and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>also, very easy to clean and very compact..</li>
            <li>Also, if it starts to pull your hair, make sure to charge it first.</li>
            <li>I was really excited</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it correctly or not as it felt like it was burning and wasn&#x27;t removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, such a good deal for this price.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with my first one so after some years it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>but we didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with her using a true razor.  </li>
            <li>Seems to get most hairs the first time over.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW (July 2, 2011):</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m no disappointed.</li>
            <li>It has been worth my money!</li>
            <li>Maybe if it popped up a bit higher or was more adjustable.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly around my bikini line when I am on vacation and holy smokes I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I&#x27;ve saved instead of shaving in the shower!</li>
            <li>a unique charging system.</li>
            <li>For some reason this product did not come in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing so much!  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well for what it is, but it seems like it could work better.</li>
            <li>I have 2 in my household now, my brother stole my first one :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I switched to an electric shaver, considering how much money I&#x27;m going to save!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this shaver in April 2014.  </li>
            <li>* Original Review (5 stars)</li>
            <li>They work great, the charge lasts a long time and they continue to recharge after years of use.</li>
            <li>Great product with long life rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>I have small hands and it fits perfect!  </li>
            <li>Be sure you put lotion on first</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver in March and was so excited about using it for the summer season.  </li>
            <li>Works great- holds the charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>but for the most part it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>By the way my original one came in 1 day.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited for this razor to arrive.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the Conair I purchased first.</li>
            <li>It is also great if you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while to get rid of long hair first, and then follow up with a razor for a silky smooth effect!  </li>
            <li>If you are using it on your underarms or bikini line, you will probably want to do those areas first, when the shaver is at its most powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li>it is ok, the price was great shipping was fast, only wished it cut deeper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on the original charge(charge</li>
            <li>I picked one up from a Target for around 22 dollars, and was excited to get started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the exact one I had purchased many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure its used for you downstairs area and your armpits.</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver holds a charge for a long time, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>did absolutely love it the first time</li>
            <li>I dropped the original one on the floor</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure at first and after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have a unique living situation that forces me to take showers at the gym.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first, but now it is doing just a decent job.</li>
            <li>It allows me a nice fine shave despite sensitive skin and a health concern.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic razor which will shave your legs just fine.  </li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s great for the summer though, when I&#x27;m shaving more frequently and it keeps everything smooth and clean in between major shaves.  </li>
            <li>I normally shave my legs with a regular blade and cream, but this shaver is perfect when I am pressed for time and need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job, gives a nice, close shave and goes a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>Great product ,well made ,holds a charge a long time!</li>
            <li>It is a great product and stays charged for a long time!</li>
            <li>Nice to live in an ever growing cordless world.</li>
            <li>Nice choice if anyone&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>Great price too and holds a charge very long too.</li>
            <li>Shaves really great and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Clean shave.  </li>
            <li>great dry and in shower.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Panasonic shaver is a great buy, definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several shavers before and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far..</li>
            <li>It gives a clean and a close shave, without pulling.</li>
            <li>I took it apart to see how to clean it, and that&#x27;s a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>Razor is relatively quiet, no knicks or cuts, smooth shave, good for using on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>For any woman that has gone or is going through menopause; this shaver cleans those unwanted hairs quickly and efficiently....and pain free.  </li>
            <li>It shaves smooth and quickly too.</li>
            <li>LOVE it ,, nice and quiet</li>
            <li>Gives a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Panasonic Ladies Razor and it is the best by far.</li>
            <li>it gives me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>but it does a great job dry.</li>
            <li>It looked clean</li>
            <li>I felt clean shaven and</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a clean close shave skip this razor.</li>
            <li>Could not shave that clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that you can use it dry, this has probably already paid for itself saving me money on my water bill</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 different kinds and this is by far the best model.</li>
            <li>Needs a brush with it to help you clean it out.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, it is washable and it is really okay for using in the shower or outside.</li>
            <li>absolutely clean shave</li>
            <li>This shaver works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>She liked it a lot better, especially at removing longer hairs.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li>I have had the name brand that is the best known, historically, in my opinion, and it is loud and does not shave that well.  </li>
            <li>As for the shave...it is clean and close.  </li>
            <li>I looked there were no cuts or nicks or anything, clean as can be.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy three more as gifts.</li>
            <li>nice-neath and clean...</li>
            <li>Dry great.</li>
            <li>Overall best electric razor I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my daughter last Christmas, she love&#x27;s it, it does the job nicely for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so quick and comfortable to use</li>
            <li>My ladies electric razors before were a snap to clean.</li>
            <li>It says it has 2 lengths, but it is either a clean shave, or what a 5 o clock shadow looks like on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>it cuts clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to clean it out from time to time though.</li>
            <li>how clean it is all contributes to how well this razor works or not.</li>
            <li>how clean it is all contributes to how well this razor works or not.</li>
            <li>I do clean it out after every shave since it&#x27;s loaded with my (gorilla style) leg hair.</li>
            <li>If you have longer hair, you have to clean it between strokes because the bikini adjusted head that pops out gets hair caught in it, and then the bottom blade cannot grip the hairs to cut them.</li>
            <li>The trick to it working for me has been to keep it thoroughly clean after each use and to charge it often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as clean as a razor</li>
            <li>I usually dry shave with it and am quite happy, although I did use it in the shower without any issues as well.</li>
            <li>After using the shaver twice, I removed the head to clean it.</li>
            <li>It comes with a two sided brush to clean the unit as well.</li>
            <li>it is not silky smooth but good enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is much more cost effective than buying disposable raZors on a constant basis.</li>
            <li>It works great dry.  </li>
            <li>like the pop-up trimmer to keep downstairs neat and tidy, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to make sure this is fully charged before attempting it.</li>
            <li>I am able to shave close with this which is great but also have gotten a few ingrown hairs because it does shave so close</li>
            <li>its lightweight a bother to clean.</li>
            <li>This razor is so comfortable to use, quick and convenient.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be good quality and it works better than I expected for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take the high risk on this product that you&#x27;ll be like so many of us and get one that works great until just outside the return period.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy person and this is really nice for a person on the go.</li>
            <li>Gave it a full charge and have used it at least twice a month on legs and arms and is STILL RUNNING on the original charge!It is so smooth you cannot even tell is shaving yet does an excellent</li>
            <li>Very handy and the battery has long life.</li>
            <li>Great for post surgery patients with limited mobility also.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to give up the single edge razor now.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, charge lasts long and good shave.</li>
            <li>This little razor is easy to use, does a really good job leaving me feeling smooth after the shave with no razor burn and no nicking!  </li>
            <li>As an electric razor, it gives a very respectable close shave (not as close as a regular razor) and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic razor for the price, does exactly what I bought it for, easy underarm hair removal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, gets all of my hair in one or two swipes and feels smooth on my body.</li>
            <li>This really cuts well and is very light in the hand.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn like real razors, and the shave is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use, it came charged right out of the box.</li>
            <li>This will travel easily and charges up right at the outlet</li>
            <li>: If you have the right case to carry it in, it&#x27;s easily portable.</li>
            <li>: If you have the right case to carry it in, it&#x27;s easily portable.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver; it is fast, feminine, easy to use, easy to clean, charges well, and</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>nothing special, but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch or for a travel razor.</li>
            <li>So on special occasions, (about once a month), I finish it off with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Get this right now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing another one right now!</li>
            <li>The price was right!</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor it comes pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>I love the shaver I just wish it was much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t give me a clean cut, but it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy and quick that it&#x27;s actually fun.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for such a great product.</li>
            <li>After two months of almost daily use I have to say I am seriously impressed with this amazing little razor.</li>
            <li>This little gem has larger foil holes and is honestly the best &amp;#34;man face shaver&amp;#34; I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Shaving has never been easier and more pleasant without all the mess and fuss.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using the trimmer first if any hair is longer than 1/4 inch or so before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and for an even better shave and to keep it from pulling/tugging any hairs, make sure it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the razor is good to have around for quick touch ups, for instance when you want to go to the gym in shorts or short yoga pants but have significant stubble on your lower legs.</li>
            <li>Battery life is pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>It works great on the first or second pass, and never leaves any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>As long as your in the direct stream of  water it is the best shave I have ever had from an electric.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it wet, but it has worked otherwise just great for me.</li>
            <li>my legs and armpits it worked great, but the trimmer I used for the &#x27;bikini line&#x27; is a bit rough, it pulled out hairs.</li>
            <li>Really a great first shaver for my third grader.</li>
            <li>I have had a pretty good experience with it so far.  </li>
            <li>The wide head is GREAT for carving across your legs and chest, if you happen to have a furry chest you gotta get rid of.</li>
            <li>Really surprised me how great a work it does compared to a normal razor.</li>
            <li>Wet great.</li>
            <li>I liked the first one so much, I bought another.  </li>
            <li>Wet use is a great option and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li>If you have dark hairs than I would just stick with shaving but for those who have light hair this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is, it is waterproof and it works for shower use.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for ladies&#x27; legs, it&#x27;s good enough to keep my head shaved too.</li>
            <li>Her old one was a corded one, so she really liked the fact that this was cordless and rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I buy one very six months:)</li>
            <li>This shaver removed that hair, quickly and cleanly, without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is fitting the need very well.  </li>
            <li>I chose this razor based on the good reviews AND the low price.</li>
            <li>I set out to find the same one for a guaranteed good item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply easy to use, quick to charge, easy on the cleaning and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>But now I love it, and it makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>THESE GOOD AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE BECOME.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a silky smooth result like a traditional razor, but it IS the next best thing!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>Definitely wasn&#x27;t something that was a good replacement for razors.</li>
            <li>To say the least, she is very Happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann</li>
            <li>The shaver sits on the charger saving much need counter top space.  </li>
            <li>Being able to sit in a chair with my feet up and shave makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come to a full stop but the power is noticeably lower within 10 minutes of using it.</li>
            <li>It is a rare find -cheap</li>
            <li>It is cheap, so if we get a year out of it, that would be worth it.</li>
            <li>compare to a straight razor this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I used it on full legs, and underarms with NO issues.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cordless, rechargeable (nice low profile recharger--no cord) and gives me a nice close trim in my intimate areas with no injuries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver especially at this price!</li>
            <li>but this works good enough.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good a shave as a regular razor</li>
            <li>This one truly is the best, even with thick, course</li>
            <li>Honestly, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a non-electric razor, so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised on that count.</li>
            <li>but I will stick to the tried and true method of razor blades for my bikini area or waxing.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic razor we have purchased and find it to be a good , quality , item for the price.</li>
            <li>better than shavers that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>I have to brush it off at some points so it works at full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, but its good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I have learned to be more gentle with.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t even get in a full shave.</li>
            <li>My sister used mine several times and loved it too</li>
            <li>The placement of the buttons is good so that you can start and stop the shaver or open and close the pop trimmer with the thumb of the hand you&#x27;re holding it with.</li>
            <li>The placement of the buttons is good so that you can start and stop the shaver or open and close the pop trimmer with the thumb of the hand you&#x27;re holding it with.</li>
            <li>on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>After reading several good ones on this one, I bought it.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft product&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Loud, but extremely effective.</li>
            <li>Relatively close shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li>Overall it is 4 stars for the product, but 5 stars for doing what I need it to at a good price.</li>
            <li>I still get ingrown hairs, but not painful ones.</li>
            <li>I have been using razors for years until I had hit a vein; so I decided to purchase an electric shaver; I wish I had done it years ago, there is nothing better for my legs and for the price it has real value.</li>
            <li>This works okay for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It makes a for quick clean up before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just ordered 2nd one for the misses, she loves this razor and I loved the price.&lt;br /&gt;1st</li>
            <li>This shaver worked for one battery full and now wont charge.  </li>
            <li>Well, as others have said, it will last a good 5 years.</li>
            <li>, it shaved much closer than I thought it would, I did feel a couple hairs being &#x27;pulled&#x27; out rather than trimmed, but no to many, have not tried the extendable trimming edge yet.</li>
            <li>it does tell you that this does not give a close shave and that is true.  </li>
            <li>I liked my old Remington</li>
            <li>It is ok but does not shave very well.</li>
            <li>So, it works, and I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to go full Brazilian but waxing scares you.</li>
            <li>I figured electric was a good way to start, as the memories of knicking my ankles at her age all came flooding back.  </li>
            <li>Well, not only have they improved, but I swear that I got as good as a shave on my legs as I ever have with a razor.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t save as close as a razer but good enough for me!</li>
            <li>This one was okay but did not give a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve been using them for a good 30 years (various makes).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.  </li>
            <li>Good for day to day and occasional use.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use shaving foam, just clear water in the shower, and it gave a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>, it wouldn&#x60;t work even for 1 full minute.</li>
            <li>It is kind of loud</li>
            <li>Quiet, effective, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really get any better with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>But overall it is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good basic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>For any woman who wants to make the chore of shaving more pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even tried to help me use the devise and we both laughed as he referred my results similar too</li>
            <li>have used a straight razor for many years and wanted to try the electric, again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic I love it.</li>
            <li>The clear protective cap fits snugly and doesn&#x27;t wiggle or come off on its own.</li>
            <li>i love it so much i bought one for my friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic really needs a better charging option. </li>
            <li>It takes care of facial peach fuzz  if I make two passes.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a full on electric shaver</li>
            <li>easy to clean, looks nice and makes short work of shaving hair.</li>
            <li>it is not a bad deal at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering it cost $13, 3 years is not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad shaver but not reliable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty surprised by how good of a job this razor does..</li>
            <li>Not bad although not as close as a shave as I would like.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s good - not stubbly - and it&#x27;s nice and small for the carry-on bag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite product, I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>works fine - not as great as the close shave of a razor in the shower but does a decent enough job for those times when I&#x27;m in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure I hold it at exactly the right angle.</li>
            <li>This product is very handy if you just need to shave because you&#x27;re going out or its a surprisingly nice day outside, however you will start to notice stubble the next day!</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy to use and much quicker on the go.</li>
            <li>Is good for quick touch-ups, but is not a close shave that will last .</li>
            <li>Quick, fast, close shaves that leave me falling in love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i thought i should try this and found it easy, fast, and pain free.</li>
            <li>i bought this and have gotten a clean and super quick shave on my legs.</li>
            <li>so I got it mainly for that, and I have to say this does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>the light will let you know when its in the right position.</li>
            <li>You must have some patience and go over the areas a couple of times, but if you do it right it leaves you with legs as smooth as a razor shave.</li>
            <li>just right for the light to come on, indicating that it is charging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had limited experience with electric shavers but this was, by far, the best one I&#x27;ve purchased and tried.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;d shaved with a blade in the shower, the lighting wasn&#x27;t that good, I went mostly by feel, and would later see hairs, particularly on my knees, that I&#x27;d missed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle&amp;operate, and gentle on my skin-no razor burn!</li>
            <li>This has saved me easily hundreds of dollars and paid for itself after the first couple months.</li>
            <li>My first is still going strong after 5 years, I just forgot it while I&#x27;m away for 4 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, I finally broke down and got this one after seeing so many good reviews and I will definitely say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>When my new razor came with in days of the order i was thrilled and used it right away.  </li>
            <li>You have to go over the spot a few times to get that great close shave, but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t kidding about the wet/dry thing - it works great in both situations, and has never malfunctioned due to water.  </li>
            <li>Works great for me and cheaper than disposable and other manual razors</li>
            <li>I have tried other shavers etc and none have worked as great this.</li>
            <li>This works great even for places other than my legs.</li>
            <li>This is a great item I like it due t the time it takes to shave with a razor and all the nicks/cuts</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a good razor.</li>
            <li>It was completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Amazon has a very good return policy, electronics being returned after 30 days only get 80% reimbursement, and I have to pay for the shipping.</li>
            <li>Powerful clean shave.</li>
            <li>My first rechargeable shaver &amp; it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The first one worked fine for a year and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li>What a powerful unit and a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, just buy this one as it is the best I have seen.</li>
            <li>Luckily I purchased at the store nearby and not online.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED this...until, like so many of the others, it up and quit on me after a few months.</li>
            <li>I also have used this razor wet on my arm pits with great success as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a brush that quickly unclogs the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What women wouldn&#x27;t want a quick option to remove unwanted hair?  </li>
            <li>run down:&lt;br /&gt;(1) gives a close shave quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>It all depends on how quick I can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You basically trade a super close shave for a acceptable shave in exchange for the convenience and cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Fits well in the hand and takes care of my hair removal needs quickly and painlessly, no redness and no bumps afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this purchase since I owned the older version</li>
            <li>She mainly uses it while bathing and has fallen in love with the product.</li>
            <li>It does not matter that much to me, but if really smooth legs are important to you, stick with a blade, or waxing or something like that.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly</li>
            <li>If you would like to have one of these electric razors for those quick trims, I would recommend this as you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES2207P was a tremendous surprise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to recommend it to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>And once the baby is here it means I can do a quick shave without showering if I need to.</li>
            <li>and I never felt it was a super close shave.</li>
            <li>For my daughter just learning how to shave this is a hit - she doesn&#x27;t need a super close shave</li>
            <li>So I got this because I just wanted something I could quickly run over my legs and walk out the door without having to turn the water on, soap up, etc.</li>
            <li>Charges quick.</li>
            <li>I bought this for those times I want to shave but avoid razor burn, particularly in summer when I &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to shave more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>This is a no-brainer every gal should get, esp when you need a quick touch up and can&#x27;t take the time out to get in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received the shaver quickly</li>
            <li>Many years ago I had an older version of this.</li>
            <li>far more convenient and shaves so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what I purchased it for and it is pretty close shave compared to most shavers out there.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li>Provides a quick and close shave</li>
            <li>It is quick</li>
            <li>Very close shave- leaves me smooth &amp; irritation free.</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand well and makes for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Close shave:&lt;br /&gt;I think the main issue most people face with electric shavers is getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>It quickly handles my leg shaving.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try it on my facial hair, Dr. Oz says that is the best way for women to remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Would very well for all areas of the body, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li>so the thing I didn&#x27;t like about this shaver is how quick the battery runs out.</li>
            <li>when im running out and need a quick touch up of my underarms.  </li>
            <li>A great buying and really does the work, especially compared to the prize!</li>
            <li>My legs feel nice and smooth when I shave them, but are stubbly by the next day.</li>
            <li>This shaver &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Close quick shave.</li>
            <li>My last razor was a Panasonic and served me well for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I did not buy the more expensive version and very happy that I did not.  </li>
            <li>I just plug this in and when it&#x27;s charged, I can quickly shave my legs.</li>
            <li>If I was in a hurry I&#x27;d use it to shave my pits quick.</li>
            <li>It does an adequate job.</li>
            <li>It was on sale when I bought it and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I read an earlier review that said to make sure it was fully charged for the better shave and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im one of those many women over 40 who suddenly find hair growing more on their faces</li>
            <li>I wanted this because I wanted something for quick touch ups</li>
            <li>I have stayed away from electric razors for years because they did not do an even adequate job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice if it had a charging light and something to tell you that the charge is running low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first shave I had was perfect: I thought this machine was incredible, as it worked nearly flawlessly (not completely close like disposable ones, but that was to be expected), but it also left no irritation, and I have yet to come across a cut or even the tiniest nick from using it.</li>
            <li>So, I have decided not to give up on Panasonic (which still seems to be acclaimed as the best), and have decided in upgrading to the more expensive ES2216PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was told this was amazing and performed better than expected.</li>
            <li>It does not shave super close (There is no &amp;#34;touchable smooth&amp;#34; here).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to do a quick fix, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Sometimes women just need a quick shave also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a real razor, but it&#x27;s very convenient and nice to use.</li>
            <li>Exceptionally well built and obvious quality.  </li>
            <li>The battery burns out really quickly and then refuses to recharge.</li>
            <li>I thought i would be lucky...</li>
            <li>Do not expect a super close shave....</li>
            <li>The shipping and packaging was excellent and easy and quick shipping, earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver so much, I use it dry and has had it for 9 months and it still cuts good.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>I have had one for a year or two now, I use it for quick touch ups or when I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower with a razor and cream.</li>
            <li>Some may find this more convenient, but in my household as we only have one outlet in the bathroom and many devices to use with that outlet</li>
            <li>Charges quick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons- battery dies quickly as time goes on, leaves stubble, lasts about 6mos- 1 year (pushing it).</li>
            <li>I use a men&#x27;s face razor to quickly go over my legs and get the stubble after I&#x27;m done using this product.</li>
            <li>It works quickly.</li>
            <li>it arrived amazingly quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for several months now and I am surprisingly more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it does a good enough job that I&#x27;m not afraid of going sleeveless.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly</li>
            <li>another one!!!and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient, works fine, comfortable to hold, looks pretty, and works well!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the charger is a single unit plug in (no cord) which allows me to utilize a kind of an out of the way plug when recharging.  </li>
            <li>As long as you hold it correctly (and it even tells you in the instructions) and take your time, you will have a great shave and will enjoy using your new razor!  </li>
            <li>It works smoothly and is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Panasonic ES2207p Close&lt;br /&gt;Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry ladies shaver beginning of June 2011 and enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>High ratings and reviews from the lovely people of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver, Light, fast, easy.</li>
            <li>This gives me a good shave and it&#x27;s always charged because I put it right back on the charger after I use it.</li>
            <li>Being able to shave dry and not itch has lowered my anxiety significantly and now I can feel confident wearing whatever I want.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver for \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and it keeps a good charge that allowed me to shave both my legs entirely on the same charge.</li>
            <li>Also replacment parts are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>bikini bit works well, though it requires more care than using the shaver normally.</li>
            <li>The other reason I love this is because I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>This is my very first lady shaver.</li>
            <li>My Wife has used it several times and is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Thank u very much!  </li>
            <li>first replacement shaver I purchased was a Remington - model WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky.  </li>
            <li>I will have to find another brand that&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I was told that it is the very first shaver that does not nip at your skin when shaving your underarms.  </li>
            <li>This shaver makes my legs feel smooth and ready to go!</li>
            <li>and the wife was really excited to finally get a really nice ladies shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First a heads-up: you will never get quite as smooth with an electric shaver than you will with a razor, but you can get pretty close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married, have had 2 kids, going on 40, I dont need that silky smooth leg anymore.  </li>
            <li>I waited several months to do my review and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and they had no use for it but other family members own and are pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I just received this very recently and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice close shave (surprisingly as close as a razor) without leaving me red bumps the next day.</li>
            <li>Its better then my old shaver but Not as good as the $15 men&#x27;s travel razor I bought at the same time as this one.</li>
            <li>Nice razor, good price, works just as well as more expensive brands and models.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, charge lasts a long time and</li>
            <li>Electric shavers are not known for close shaves and this isn&#x27;t the exception, but it does do a good job as long as one follows the directions provided.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was good while it worked but did not work for long.</li>
            <li>Great razor, very sharp, makes quick work of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>in fact, a good friend of mine gave me the PERFECT silver-colored cosmetic pouch into which this product fits EXTREMELY WELL (much better than the thin white carrying bag that originally came with the packaged product!!).</li>
            <li>but it left me with a nice clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased sooner, just a nice little tool that makes grooming quick &amp; easy !</li>
            <li>: I have extremely sensitive skin and very fine hair</li>
            <li>but I am still keeping the review high because I only paid $20 for this thing, and it has given me over 2 years of great performance.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and using disposable razor blades sucked for me because no matter what i use my skin gets cut easily and very irritated and since this does not produce a super close shave i can shave more often without getting irritated skin and cuts.</li>
            <li>I use the dry mode and it works just great and takes only minutes with easy cleaning!</li>
            <li>Better than the Remington 5000 was when it was new.  </li>
            <li>but everything was brand new in the box &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My new favorite and I don&#x27;t even care</li>
            <li>But this new one, I think, is an even better product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t bother getting any replacement foils or blades, they would cost more than just getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had very many, but this wonder of modern convenience blows the shavers of old out of the water.  </li>
            <li>, one less item for the gift list, lol</li>
            <li>I used to have the previous model, which was great.</li>
            <li>It works really well and easy to use and charge</li>
            <li>Electric shavers won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but the Panasonic is so easy and fast that you don&#x27;t mind grabbing it often.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I used it while pregnant because shaving is too much of a chore at 9 months pregnant but not with this!</li>
            <li>It is the close to getting a close shave and works so easy and was as described and had fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, obviously, but for an electric razor it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li>Much safer than a  throwaway  which easily can nick the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very well built, shaves well, cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>does pretty good with facial but thats it.</li>
            <li>This panasonic razor shaves very well &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This shaver is much quieter and shaves my legs and arms easily.  </li>
            <li>So fast and easy to use and</li>
            <li>Gentle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>makes shaving fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is gentle on the skin and being battery driven makes it easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile and easy to use.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t like it that much cause its not TOO Strong..</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy Thanx to amazon prime and</li>
            <li>It is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li>really close shaves for a electric shaver, easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li>I started on my face and the shaver was very smooth, trouble free and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Great little shaver for when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>really if you like being eco friendly and wanna save some money and don&#x27;t mind if you don&#x27;t get the closest shave ever just smooth enough to feel nice gliding your legs together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to just sit on the couch, no water, no cuts, no shaving cream, no mess to clean up and be done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>No counter space is needed so its a good choice if you have limited space.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t start to grow back for a week or more!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li>I did not realize it had different style trimmers for full shaving and more detailed grooming.</li>
            <li>This one is the first one I have ever had that didn&#x27;t give me razor burn!</li>
            <li>I bought one of these several months ago and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>This is her first one and she loves it!</li>
            <li>None of these will shave as close as a razor but this one is pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>Pretty straightforward to operate.</li>
            <li>Overall I think my men&#x27;s 5 blade razor from king soopers works way better!</li>
            <li>I was able to use it on my thighs which i usually never shave because of the terrrible itching</li>
            <li>but I love it so far!</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have owned and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the very reasonable price for this razor!  </li>
            <li>Gives me pretty close shave!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>it would&#x27;ve been done the first day I got it!</li>
            <li>it worked when i first got it, but now it doesnt, its like i didnt shave at all, im going to just end up throwing it away !</li>
            <li>I got so excited the first time</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I waited all these years to buy one!  </li>
            <li>I have even borrowed it because mine (different brand) wasn&#x27;t charged, and it works better than the one that I have!</li>
            <li>Also, I replaced the head last year and the new blades were great.</li>
            <li>Had the new one for about a month now and so far so good</li>
            <li>I like it more as a dry shaver, for me it works better.</li>
            <li>The shaver does an excellent job, although I have just used the dry mode and for legs only.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can shave dry without getting razor burn :)</li>
            <li>I only use it in the dry setting on my leggs and it works great!</li>
            <li>This is great and fast for a dry shave.</li>
            <li>More so if you&#x27;re a super busy student.</li>
            <li>Though, it really does get pretty close to smooth if you really try, so it may work out for those who have more</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very light and truly cordless: the razor plugs directly into the outlet, so there&#x27;s no cord draping around when re-charging.  </li>
            <li>It works exceptionally well, holds a charge for a long time, and MOSTLY it is easy to use in the most private area that I shave.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this in the mail to try it out, and even though the directions recommend charging it for a full 12 hours it came out of the package fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I first rinse the head, then put a some hand soap in some water in a cup, and leave the head in that to soak while I clean the blades inside.</li>
            <li>It really does get  a super close shave!</li>
            <li>It worked fine for awhile; it didn&#x27;t give me a really close shave, but I prefer that to the hell that is razor burn EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that I can use it wet or dry and that I there replacement parts are available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping this thing lasts, because so far I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>I used it a couple to times ot worked fine but not as close as a real razsor.</li>
            <li>Its predecessor had a large and bulky charger that wouldn&#x27;t fit onto my bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li>but It is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>This little guy is great for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Great little Shaver.</li>
            <li>Great little razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>This little razor does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I had great luck with this little razor.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver .gettinf</li>
            <li>Of course it won&#x27;t get as close a shave as an actual razor, and you have to go over each area more than once, but it&#x27;s just fine for keeping a bikini line neat.  </li>
            <li>Nice little shaver for the money, what more can I say.</li>
            <li>Still leaves a little stubble, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor leaves leg skin completely smooth, so I am reasonable happy with this&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little razor does a nice job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The shaver fits nicely in your hands and the on/off switch is easily reached without needed your other hand.  </li>
            <li>Good shave, not too hard to clean and easy to charge.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using manual razors due to sensitive skin that I cut quite easily and so far, this has been perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, requires one pass over of most areas (and I have very dark, coarse hair), and feels great in hand.</li>
            <li>Now that I have found this product I enjoy not suffering from ingrowns as much anymore.</li>
            <li>Not as close a shave as using a razor, but great for everyday shaving while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES2207P rechargeable gets my underarms shaved very close and smooth, as well as the bikini line, and no irritation.</li>
            <li>well, at least my underarms are smooth and happy.  </li>
            <li>It was working great up until about a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Have used a few times and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It holds the charge, it&#x27;s light weight, and fast.</li>
            <li>It works great and the battery lasts for a few times.</li>
            <li>This worked great while it did work, however, mine also died without any reason after a few months.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and leaves skin smooth without nicks.</li>
            <li>I bought the Remington Ultimate Body and Bikini: and it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s also very inexpensive on the Panasonic website with free shipping, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li>so i was searching for a shaver which will give me a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It charges fast, keeps the charge and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li>I think is really worth to use this money to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Initial quality is great, not too loud of a motor.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Not too happy so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>And for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the most horrendous thing that has ever gotten near my..ahem..bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like it, is worth the $</li>
            <li>/&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: I can go as fast as I like, no nicks, cuts, nothing just safe fast</li>
            <li>So far I have realy enjoyed using this razor.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave (not quite as close as with a wet razor, but good) with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers don&#x27;t necessarily get a razor-close shave, but this electric shaver gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive, no nick,itch-free and my legs were ultra smooth!</li>
            <li>I have one that I&#x27;ve had for years (rarely used it) and I like it, but you can no longer get replacement blades or foils for it.  </li>
            <li>Ok so if the puppy wouldn&#x27;t have chewed the blades on my old electric razor...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers over the years, and have to say that this is by FAR the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric.</li>
            <li>It was worth everything I paid for it which was not a lot.  </li>
            <li>If I had to make a suggestion for improvement, the trimmer does a nice job but sometimes requires multiple passes to cut longer hairs.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my old one</li>
            <li>For under $20, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, powerful, and has a charger that saves space.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many shavers and so far this one is working out.  </li>
            <li>It just takes getting used to, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It really is a good razor and for only $22 (that&#x27;s how much I paid for it)</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time and recharges just as good as it did when I first charged it up.</li>
            <li>Honestly they look almost the same.</li>
            <li>This is her favorite so far, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>This shaver is so much better than the old Lady Remington I had.</li>
            <li>but i dont even know if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to upgrade.</li>
            <li>This is my  second one and loving it.  </li>
            <li>and they last a good while and work really well.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it kind of pulls on my hair every now and then, causing quite some pain.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the cost and so far the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be useful after recovery.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and every time i shaved with a razor blade, for a week or more</li>
            <li>which to me was not a big deal, but it is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The charger plugs directly into the outlet (no cord) and then the shaver plugs into the top of it.</li>
            <li>because it was  priced so reasonabily, I was both surprised and pleased when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>and the charger is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>Not having the pain of shaving is worth it.</li>
            <li>i ordered this for myself and so far it is ok.</li>
            <li>about 2-3 shaves without charging, it does not provide a nice close shave like a regular razor</li>
            <li>Around 3 minutes later, I was startled when the shaver started up on its own and fell to the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>Nice to finally get a deal!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the shaver just sits on top of the plug when charging and it actually charges quite fast.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li>This never does it, and gets close enough to the skin to give that nice used-an-expensive-cream-and-razor look.</li>
            <li>good shipping and product works as expected</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>Got this for myself for Christmas and it is well worth it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for what you get-excellent close shave.</li>
            <li>I have to go over each stroke more than once to completely get all the stubble.</li>
            <li>Worth the money .</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable with her using this instead of a standard razor.  </li>
            <li>trimmer useful too.</li>
            <li>Shaves well and pop up trimmer is useful.</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;A fresh charge is a must.</li>
            <li>I like this as it can be used wet or dry...and give a fairly close shave...</li>
            <li>So after I read the reviews and said for price the value was worth trying this for her.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews of many units, was looking for something that would not irritate sensitive armpit areas, and could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>so far my wife likes it and says it works as good as the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>Is that worth $18?</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of instances of it pulling hairs, but that seems rare.</li>
            <li>If you need your legs to be absolutely smooth &amp; silky to the touch a regular razor might work better for you.</li>
            <li>For the price this is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>not what I expected, it does not work as good as my $5 battery powered shaver.  </li>
            <li>so it just never seemed worth using.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and shaving with a razor hurts when I shave more than once every two weeks (which, of course, leaves me a hairy beast by then!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s useful to have around</li>
            <li>Love it so far, does not leave bumps or leave scars.</li>
            <li>to me, the safety and convenience is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying the shaver so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve nicked my self so many times now, that I have 2 or 3 scars on my legs near the knees because of razer blades</li>
            <li>and I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Better than my old one.</li>
            <li>It gives you a close shave better than my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>Had my old one for about 4 yrs (bought it the day after Christmas on sale) really love the way it works.</li>
            <li>It was so worth the $20.</li>
            <li>it is useful and effective...fini</li>
            <li>It truly does shave as closely as a blade (worth two or three passes).</li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>So far all ok.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better by far.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Shaver of this kind that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>SO FAR, I am in love with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Honestly spend the money and buy something that will last.</li>
            <li>worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>love it arrived early</li>
            <li>Works OK if you are in a hurry, but doesn&#x27;t really get very close unless you go reeeeeeeeal slooooooow.  </li>
            <li>So far it is doing okay.</li>
            <li>quickly,, worth the every penny</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who says it works as advertised for a modest price which by todays standard is great.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is FAR better.</li>
            <li>Because of a review by a male customer that said this shaver was one his wife really liked, is why I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This one works better than the old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver a couple times now and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Kinda bites at my skin in the sensitive areas for sure</li>
            <li>It also comes in a very handy little bag for traveling....</li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty awesome simply because I can use it whilst dry.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s your only option, for example, if your sharing a hotel room with friends and don&#x27;t have the privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrowth: Surprisingly, the regrowth was not as blunt as normal shaving, which is what gave me the confidence to shave my arms!</li>
            <li>If you use it right, you get a nice, close shave, not as close as a disposable razor, but close enough to be a lifesaver when I don&#x27;t have time for a full-on shower.</li>
            <li>Wonder why I waited so long to mald this switch from safety razor to electric, love it so easy and never a nick</li>
            <li>I think the shorter stubby brush is for the blades and the long more easily bendable brush is for the inside of the foil.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little ladies trimmer that won&#x27;t disappoint and its good for a broad range of ages, from a preteen girl on up.</li>
            <li>After purchasing 3 other shavers (which did not work at all) I have finally got one that does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>It works best if used every other day, allowing a bit of hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li>This is possibly the best $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>I use this dry and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I used it dry and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I did look several other places and sites and this was the best price</li>
            <li>Now I do plan on editing this review after some time has passed, because it seems that some other customers didn&#x27;t have the best luck with the product lasting.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you can rinse it clean as well as use the brush if you want to clean it while dry.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it seems to die pretty quickly...</li>
            <li>Charged pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the convenience of having it around for a quick dry shave when I needed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this electric shaver for its very low price and its clean, painless shaving on my underarms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy device, but does not provide as clean a shave on my legs as I expected.  </li>
            <li>It gives a decently close shave (not as close as a blade, but good for an electric), and I don&#x27;t have to go over my legs several times for it to catch the hairs.</li>
            <li>I cut my skin the first time i used on the bikini area, then i realized , i need to use lesser pressure and hold it light and let it glide ,for a better shave.</li>
            <li>It works way better with damp skin, at first I was not happy with it until I used it after my shower and it works great</li>
            <li>This razor gives a very close shave and is powerful!</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is good, use it mostly on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because it got good reviews on Amazon and some other websites.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to press your finger onto the faucet so that it gives out a sharp forceful stream.</li>
            <li>I love the battery lasts as long as it does, and it does a good job overall.</li>
            <li>Good for legs, underarms, and other areas too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it never grabs a hair and gives it a good tug like all the other ones</li>
            <li>It is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Dry is great when I get sudden invites to go swimming or hot-tubbing, and wet is great for in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great shave when completely dry and great shave when completely wet, but don&#x27;t try to shave skin which is tacky or sweaty because it will not glide properly.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe my luck on finding this and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It was shipped right on time</li>
            <li>Well if ain&#x27;t broke why replace it right?</li>
            <li>Right away it ripped my hairs out.</li>
            <li>wish that the charger had a cord rather than plugging right into the wall.</li>
            <li>i waited for years to find the right one</li>
            <li>if you do it RIGHT</li>
            <li>the charger must plug right into the wall - the plug prongs are right on the charger.</li>
            <li>Just received my electric shaver in the mail and used it right away...love it.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but I didn&#x27;t feel right about returning something with torn out hair stuck in it.  </li>
            <li>I like to shave with this right before going somewhere</li>
            <li>Not even close to a razor, but I can use this when I don&#x27;t want to get in the shower, like right before exercise.</li>
            <li>If done right, this can give a close shave.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>Shaved my legs right after taking it out of the box.</li>
            <li>I bought the item when I injured my right hand</li>
            <li>and yet it plugs right in to recharge.</li>
            <li>Priced right</li>
            <li>It does the trick for that purpose, but is not the right razor for someone looking for a trim.</li>
            <li>And the price was right as well.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it would turn on after 5 minutes, but rarely right away.</li>
            <li>The price is right as well.</li>
            <li>It is bulky but it is also just doesn&#x27;t work right for me.</li>
            <li>The price was right, too.</li>
            <li>Right price, too.  </li>
            <li>Priced right.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, too.  </li>
            <li>It is not going to get as close/touchable smooth as a real razor, but it keeps things pretty close.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The total head in general is great at moving with the contours of your legs and body.</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde and fine and easy to cut, too.</li>
            <li>It works great for a quick leg shave at the last minute and gets close enough to give a day after shaving feel.</li>
            <li>This shaver is really good, it&#x27;s easy to handle, i&#x27;ve use it in wet areas and it had works excelent,it&#x27;s bring you a shave complete with just a once, you must to take care of surfering a cut because it&#x27;s powerfull, in my case it happened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several of this exact kind through the years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not bulky and love the fact that it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Fast and clean.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close and clean shave, without cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it in my \\&quot;girl\\&quot; place yet, but I&#x27;ll be lathering up with the sensitive shave cream first :-)</li>
            <li>It also does well if you are using it more frequently than weekly, and seems to consistently cut without pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li>You do have to move the razor in either circular movements or in numerous directions, but that is true with most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>You will feel very stubbly, but you look clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Wow, much better than all the higher end electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>does great dry and in the shower, I love I can use it wet</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this great little electric shaver!  </li>
            <li>Great little unit!</li>
            <li>Great little razor!</li>
            <li>I put it in her Christmas stocking last year, and she just recently revealed to me that it was her favorite (and most practical!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not a very frequent groomer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed that I could get such a smooth shave with such a low cost razor.  </li>
            <li>New Years Day, I asked how she liked it so far.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can replace the heads and don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor just because a part has worn out.</li>
            <li>It works great and takes very little charging.</li>
            <li>As a wet / dry shaver she reports that it working perfectly in the water.</li>
            <li>Works excellent both dry and wet.</li>
            <li>The best wet dry rechargable razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>After struggling for a year and a half with a Remington (which needed multiple passes to shave a hair), I just got this---and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>The pop-up straight blade is helpful and the whole things comes apart easily for washing.  </li>
            <li>, I can use it wet or dry and it was a excellent price</li>
            <li>* Works wet or dry, making it wonderfully flexible.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to have smooth legs when short on time.</li>
            <li>Works best on completely wet or completely dry skin, not in between.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in overnight before using it and was pleasantly surprised at how quick, smooth and close the shave was on my legs.</li>
            <li>Wet or dry - excellent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shaved well, was light weight and pops open for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, it saves me time and makes shaving quick and simple!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite these issues, I keep this around for the times when I need a quick touch-up and don&#x27;t have access to or time to take a shower, simply because I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my old one finally gave out because this one is much better.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d NEVER be able to wear a swim suit which sucks because you can&#x27;t really get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It has retained a full charge very well</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great for the *bushier* areas and when you are a lazy shaver like I am and sometimes wait a couple weeks between</li>
            <li>This Panasonic was actually the 3rd shaver that I bought to replace my old Remington - which was the best rechargeable shaver I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This is never going to give you smooth legs like a normal razor</li>
            <li>I suppose if you bought one of these every year, it&#x27;d be a sufficient way to shave, but is that the legacy you really want to leave to your children, a planet depleted of resources and full of planned obsolescence items like this?</li>
            <li>and it comes with a travel case and small brush, which is great for when she goes to summer camp.  </li>
            <li>Funny, no sooner had I plugged in the shaver to charge, than my husband came to me with a grin on his face and showed me his freshly shaven neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet again, another razor that barely does the job, and leaves more stubble then you started out with.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because of the reviews, but it hasn&#x27;t worked too great for me :/  </li>
            <li>really works well, gives a close shave and the battery stays charged for a full shave</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple razors for those personal areas and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the hand and as long as you shave in segments going one direction up the leg</li>
            <li>The long hair trimmer is also handy.</li>
            <li>but it was quick, and certainly removed hair in areas</li>
            <li>Time will tell, I guess, but so far I&#x27;m pretty excited about this one!</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is just an all-around great little electric</li>
            <li>look but it will get the hair down to a nice clean shaved look.</li>
            <li>After searching a long time for a rechargeable razor that actually works on women with real curves and real hair, this is great!</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a convenient, comfortable shave and wants the look of smooth legs without the hassle and irritation of normal blades.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth if you get the right angle (close to the blade opposite the trimmer for me).  </li>
            <li>My wife needed a new Shaver and this one really filled the bill.</li>
            <li>This razor does not cut any hair at all, it is pure junk!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, whether dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li>keep it short, it&#x27;s nice for a quick shave to wear shorts or a skirt, but if you&#x27;re expecting someone to rub on your silky smooth legs try a regular razor.</li>
            <li>x better than my old shaver, this one shaves really close, keeps its charge and it a lot easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>whether or not I am the best shaver, this should not happen with a razor and of course I&#x27;ve never had trouble like that with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and since no one is touching my legs who cares if you can still feel a really minimal roughness?  </li>
            <li>Second one is same great quality.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care about a super close shave</li>
            <li>I find this razor great to keep up short enough shaving when I&#x27;m wearing pants a majority of the time.  </li>
            <li>I did have to move it over some hairs several times to have them removed, but overall this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose for her 11 year old legs, but I don&#x27;t see it being effective for an adult.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is far superior to the last three shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Quick fast shave and the trimmer works</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>It feels almost as smooth as a razor--no, not as smooth, but close!&lt;br /&gt;I get absolutely no red lines or marks from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>old  shaver worked much better and for much longer.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have sensitive skin and get nicked several times even with good razors like Venus.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use the shaver a great deal, so I suppose if you do not keep charging it up, it might go dead permanently.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far, no problems, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and cuts my shave time in half.  </li>
            <li>Was surprised how easy this was to use.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to purchase one and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>* Easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li>Everything is good, except that the battery need to charge so much longer than expected.</li>
            <li>so maybe someone who has less thicker hair might get good results and would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to tilt it too far to make it glide easily.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to the real thing, but I would recommend this for a quick shave or if you don&#x27;t want to bother with the fuss of using a razor.</li>
            <li>how you can take it apart and clean it with liquid soap and water and it is easy to recharge when the battery runs low.</li>
            <li>Of course, it can&#x27;t possibly shave as close as a good old fashioned razor, no electric shaver will.</li>
            <li>It worked well both dry and in the shower, and the pop-up trimmer came in handy.</li>
            <li>So far it has been really easy to use</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it continuously, but it&#x27;s been frequent enough to know that it&#x27;s a good product with longevity.</li>
            <li>They refunded my money super fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Later in the week I decided to give the Panasonic another try with a dry shave, thinking this might come in handy with travel or camping...</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, this is my second one</li>
            <li>Finally found one as good as my old one..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  well balanced; comfortable in my hand; it&#x27;s quiet and gives a smooth shave....doesn&#x27;t tug the skin.</li>
            <li>The pouch is also handy for hanging it to dry after cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nooks &amp; crannies:  He very gently maneuvers into the most delicate of locations and without pinching can tidy up satisfactorily.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor but its super gentle on sensitive skin and has consistent results and cleans easy</li>
            <li>Now, there&#x27;s no excuse, and I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor based on other Amazon reviews and I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>love that there is no long cord to the charger.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I replaced it with the exact same model.  </li>
            <li>and then surprise, becomes an epilator and yanks out your hair left and right in the most agonizing ways.</li>
            <li>I use a traditional razor on my underarms because I just can&#x27;t seem to get the right angle, but I think it would work for most people.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Make sure that you save the box when this comes so that you can ship it right back to the seller if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>my wife needed a shaver because of a blood condition,  it is light weight and easy to handle, it also holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle when I use it on my arms, armpits and even on my face</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price, also.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable..</li>
            <li>very much thank you</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>If you are cleaning the shaver, you must be very gentle or it will break.  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much because it cuts close to the skin</li>
            <li>Operates very smoothly and is fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Like very much.</li>
            <li>Although a very, very light stubble may remain, it cannot be seen, only felt.</li>
            <li>It is very fast, but the shave is not close at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This was for my wife, and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping??</li>
            <li>While the shave this unit gives isn&#x27;t as close as a disposable razor, it still left my underarms and legs very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is super easy and quick to use though so using it daily doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and works good but won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 89 year old mother and it works fine for her.</li>
            <li>This shaver has done fine as far as shaving my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>Good razor (like any other razor) at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind some little nubs, this is a really good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Good little shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a good little shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, the battery holds its charge for quite a while, and it comes with a little travel bag.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a good shape and with information plus a little brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grab this and seconds later clean, smooth legs.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my skin has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It works great, I hardly have any rash after shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Doing quick touch ups or being able to shave right before going somewhere, dry, is really a bonus to me.</li>
            <li>its pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Spend the few extra bucks for the slightly better version, I asked for it for Christmas and also like all the others have been much happier with it - and most importantly, it&#x27;s KEPT WORKING!</li>
            <li>I threw caution to the wind and committed my $16+change to the possibility of a bloodless shave for the first time in nine months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to get pretty close and didn&#x27;t rip or snag the skin.</li>
            <li>After my first shave with it, I still had hair.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely highly recommend this shaver!!</li>
            <li>Within the first week the pop up blade would no longer retract without alot of effort and then it stopped retracting at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like the shaver!</li>
            <li>What I really like about it is that it gives me NO bumps!</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave from these!</li>
            <li>I get a pretty close shave (comparable to a 3 blade venus razor)</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work you aren&#x27;t out too much!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that I do not have to buy razor refills constantly</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought one sooner, VERY convenient!</li>
            <li>But I find that when I let leg hair grow a week, it actually gives a slightly better shave than just after 1-2 days of stubble.</li>
            <li>This was to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver</li>
            <li>The charging stand is also pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be charged for 12 hours before using the first time.</li>
            <li>I first owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the nippers on the front AND back.</li>
            <li>Economical as replacement blades and foils are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t charge it, haha!)  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to any college girl! :)</li>
            <li>, only God knows for sure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>It was not expensive and seems to shave well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product; it&#x27;s a time saver and it delivered on what it said it does!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now bought 2 thinking that maybe the first one was a quality issue</li>
            <li>The first two times I used it</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was a Remington</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li>the first day the switch to pop up the edger blade broke.</li>
            <li>and it gives a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>I do have to shave more frequently but it really doesn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li>She had been using a similar type shaver and claims this one is better.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i wanted for a close shave without the scratch and irritation.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic, you should be ashamed of yourselves, or many be have your stuff MANUFACTURED BACK IN USA NOT CHINA</li>
            <li>, I have yet to recharge it since the first time (over 3 weeks ago)</li>
            <li>and I use it pretty often.  </li>
            <li>I PURCHASED FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER FOR MORE REASONS</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on my legs</li>
            <li>so if I ever decide to use it on the charger I can just go get one of the many extension cords in the house - it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>First off I have to add I have PCOS</li>
            <li>My first one was four years ago.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>definitely recommended. :)</li>
            <li>I hope they are not discontinued because I expect to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>and FAST!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I read reviews on several razors before making my decision.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it; my last razor had to be kept plugged in all the time and quit working after a year.</li>
            <li>It helps to go with the grain rather than against it at first.</li>
            <li>Not as close has a non-electric, but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>(when I have to remove that unwanted &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li>Can I charge the charger first then charge the razor???</li>
            <li>Remington\\&quot; back in the 1980&#x27;s that got lost in one of my many moves.  </li>
            <li>but they should last more than a year or so....</li>
            <li>I got a pretty close shave with zero nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a similar model by Panasonic and was able to continue using that one almost 2 years before it died.</li>
            <li>I used this shaver for the first time this week.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>im very satisfied,will buy again!</li>
            <li>as *first one disappeared.</li>
            <li>First, a note abut Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This the first electric razor that my wife has had.</li>
            <li>plus I saw it in a local store yesterday for $40 MORE than I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use the trimmer first before you use the close trimming foil.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 3 years and 2 months.  </li>
            <li>The extra flip-up blade at the front works okay,</li>
            <li>I put the order number of the products I ordered, in case you want to check first</li>
            <li>design, pretty color.</li>
            <li>I have to go over the same area more than once.  </li>
            <li>The color is really pretty.</li>
            <li>The trimmer gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>But use a real razor if it is date night!</li>
            <li>It was her first electric razor</li>
            <li>held onto it on the off chance that I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that worked better, and went back to the store and purchased THIS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves shaver.  </li>
            <li>works very well for me!</li>
            <li>I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $20 dollars but it isn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hair pretty darn close to the skin.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>no expensive blades and gels required.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few months ago and it worked pretty good for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>As I expected, its not like using a hand razor,but definately does a nice job if youre in a hurry</li>
            <li>After my first Panasonic ladies, which lasted 10 years, I tried a cheaper (bought in store) Remington.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a hand razor, but gets pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before you use it, don&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s on low battery.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>For my bikini area, it felt like it was pulling my hairs out and after the fact, it was almost like it cut a top layer of skin off as the area was reddened and sore as if the skin was open.  </li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>Seemed to shave pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well and can be used many times prior to a follow on charge.</li>
            <li>So, I guess if you want to keep things trimmed but not totally shaved, this works okay on the extended clipper setting.</li>
            <li>I shave with the cutter first</li>
            <li>but hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid cardio trainer.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I charged it to make sure it had enough battery</li>
            <li>and she likes it much better than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Although not expensive I would not purchase another one of these.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really really waterproof!</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time for my bikini area and I am amazed by how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the value of this product!</li>
            <li>Bought this because razors were the same price or more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it in case I run out of disposable razors but my first choice will not be this.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It works much better for sensitive skin than normal razors.</li>
            <li>Worked well at first.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a light on it that indicated battery level but even directly after charging it won&#x27;t consistently start.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I leave it on for several minutes and it magically begins to work</li>
            <li>This product came fast and well packaged!</li>
            <li>It really allows me to keep up with keeping the hair off!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t nick the skin like disposable razors do and it leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I can shave my underarms without prickly rashes and cuts as a result.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quicker, too, because it cuts well on the first pass</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, especially in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Like most electric shavers, it&#x27;s not the closest shave, but if you use it every couple of days, (instead of waiting until you have a forest), then it works well enough.</li>
            <li>this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>For the first year I could get in about 3ish shaves in between charges.</li>
            <li>it is pretty quite.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty too.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s much better than the products of yesteryear, which is when I last used an electric device on my legs.</li>
            <li>It was her first time shaving and</li>
            <li>well worth the $20- highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I needed a shaver that would give me the ability to quickly get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning brush could be bigger and better bristles.</li>
            <li>I had the first one a bit longer and thought it was error, then again-</li>
            <li>She said it was better than her last and</li>
            <li>Give it a try..;)</li>
            <li>My bride really likes it!</li>
            <li>I wnated a electric razor I could recharge and be able to use with simple cleaning afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am able to get a shave close enough that I can wear shorts or a skirt</li>
            <li>Much better than traditional razors.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a regular blade of course, but faster and more convenient.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first cause</li>
            <li>I asked if she wanted me to help her for the first use she said no</li>
            <li>We did let it fully charge for 24 hrs first by the way.</li>
            <li>I purchased the exact same razor from Target because it was on sale for $17.99 because I wanted to be able to return it if It didn&#x27;t work out for me without paying return shipping since I&#x27;ve never tried an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor !  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Use it several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this razor 2 years ago, and it drastically changed my life.</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly recommend this one to anyone interested in making the switch to electric.</li>
            <li>Finally, make sure that your razor is fully charged each time you use it, or you won&#x27;t be seeing it at 100%.</li>
            <li>I still get quite a bit on the bikini line but overall this razor has been great; the charge lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her first electric shaver</li>
            <li>Her first time shaving</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t bite knee bones or ankles and manages armpits pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The generic razors at Target meet my needs much better than this did.</li>
            <li>I had the same results many of the 1 star raters had.  </li>
            <li>Even then, the final result is still just okay.</li>
            <li>This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor</li>
            <li>Cuts close the first time.</li>
            <li>I did everything that first reviewer said to do</li>
            <li>This razor eliminated that problem from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I had an electric leg shaver many years ago that left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>It is the first</li>
            <li>I love the simple charger.</li>
            <li>this is not for that baby soft smooth shave you get with a razor.</li>
            <li>I have a Remington that cost more and only could be used on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It provided an okay shave but the blades felt like tiny bites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved in the shower with my venus razor and saving cream, but the hot water at the house</li>
            <li>but so much faster!</li>
            <li>If you use the trimmer first and then the shaver, it shouldnt pull.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as an actual razor, but it&#x27;s definitely more convenient.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter as a first razor.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m, also, pleased at how quiet it is and the ease of cleaning the razor after using it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this razor on Amazon, received one for Christmas several years ago and it died on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this shaver!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the shower, a razor takes the same amount of time and works a bajillion times better.</li>
            <li>This is pretty close to me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok if you forgot to shave your legs in the shower, but won&#x27;t replace a traditional razor for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first electronic shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>This razor is equal to the one I replaced and perhaps even better.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I never owned one before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the shape of that armpit, because I have used the razor every night since then and the same spot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the shape of that armpit, because I have used the razor every night since then and the same spot</li>
            <li>Is the exact same shaver that I have purchased in-store for a much higher price - AND the shipping was free which is always an attraction for me!</li>
            <li>If buying the same thing twice in a 1 year span isn&#x27;t convincing, then I don&#x27;t know what is.  </li>
            <li>I got a second one because that was a better buy than just the parts I needed.  </li>
            <li>Was okay, nothing to write home about until the last time.</li>
            <li>I thought I was not charging it properly, so I made sure it was well plugged-in.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver which is why I&#x27;m on my 3rd purchase.  </li>
            <li>The recharger plugs into a wall outlet, if this isn&#x27;t convenient for you, then you most likely won&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Rainy!</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a better shave from a traditional shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love it, getting another for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>My daughter took the first one I bought so</li>
            <li>This was not my first Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>However, the only thing I&#x27;m worried is that there are so many reviews saying how it dies after a while, hopefully that won&#x27;t happen soon.</li>
            <li>That is a big plus. :)</li>
            <li>it for 12 hours before first use).</li>
            <li>This shaver works much better than my last one for legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>It cuts close for an electric shaver, it keeps its charge for long periods of time, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it lasted a long time, so I clearly followed the simple cleaning instructions (and loved the two-sided brush</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;****I recommend using the trimmer first if the hair you are shaving is any longer than 2-3</li>
            <li>The first time was after, instead of cleaning it with a damp rag, I dunked it under a faucet (still don&#x27;t fully understand what happened).</li>
            <li>I have had this for many years and it finally broke.</li>
            <li>Make sure you know what type of tool you need, it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well until it just stopped working one day, within a month of the warranty expiring.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>My first mistake was that I thought it was going to do an amazin job.</li>
            <li>it gets pretty close</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>charger is a small square brick that plugs into a top spot on a power outlet and the razor stands upright on top of it.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Really like this electric razor!  </li>
            <li>and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for weeks and it give a pretty close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>With they being said, I bought this on a whim for myself first.</li>
            <li>Seems like many are having the same problem.  </li>
            <li>First experience with an electric razor</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do the job it said.</li>
            <li>Even though the price is low, I am looking for a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most convenient thing to have, especially when I&#x27;m in a rush.  </li>
            <li>I then got dressed and ran to my nearest department store and purchased this exact shaver.  </li>
            <li>First apply some lubricant like baby oil to the areas you want to shave.  </li>
            <li>So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to foil top once we clipped back the longer hair with the comb end.</li>
            <li>how much faster it is to shave!</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product, just be aware of snipping.</li>
            <li>I used it without charging it for the first time.</li>
            <li>(For the love of all that is holy, if you decide to try this &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34;, please don&#x27;t actually try it except as a razor.</li>
            <li>It actually shaves better than the one I had.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very well worth for its price.</li>
            <li>It initially gives a pretty close shave, but you may have to use it more often than you would a manual razor.</li>
            <li>The last replacement seems to be working better even though I had to reset it by turning the power off twice yesterday alone.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>And because I am having to shave more often my chin is left feeling sore.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted a year.</li>
            <li>Upon my first use with this product I saw the difference in how close it shaved my chin.  </li>
            <li>I use the foil blade first</li>
            <li>This is the third Panasonic Ladies razor I have used over many years.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred a cord leading to the charger from the shaver, rather than having the entire unit perched on top of it on the wall as it charged (and therefore unusable until it was charged).</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it the shaver tickled.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I get for myself</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 more for teenage daughters because they kept taking mine.</li>
            <li>but this was the first that has been consistently reliable.</li>
            <li>My daughter got this for her first razor she likes it</li>
            <li>trimmer works well, but cuts pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>for a first time shave it is alright</li>
            <li>I can get pretty close and</li>
            <li>I bought 2 for step-daughters last Christmas, they love them.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased a Panasonic electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This is my first try</li>
            <li>I like my shave to be pretty close</li>
            <li>HAVE to use my trimmer first and then shave with a man&#x27;s mach 3.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Does the job, easy to clean and charge lasts a long while.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and does not sound like a lawn mower.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, it arrived already charged, and I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO LIVE WITH HAIRY LEGS ANYMORE!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomics: For dry shaving and washing, it&#x27;s very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomics: For dry shaving and washing, it&#x27;s very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>So far this one has remained sharp and is a quick and easy way to buzz off real quick before you go.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do a very good job, only making the hair slightly shorter.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, the razor is a nice pink (great for a girl), light weight and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>He chose this particular one because of all the other good reviews it got</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that despite being less than the cost of replacement blades for my former shaver, it has stood up to the task so far and has done fantastic!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s super durable</li>
            <li>Anyway, a great product and hope my new one lasts me as long as the old one.</li>
            <li>unfortunately it&#x27;s not the kind of shaver where you can simply pull the battery out and buy a new one to insert in.</li>
            <li>It is too large ---- unless one has a very large face.</li>
            <li>This does work well enough that I will continue to use it as long as needed and is good for a quick shave if you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get you super smooth legs like you will get with a regular blade-razor, but it will take all the hair off.</li>
            <li>I love that I can shave real fast, rise it off, and leave it to dry.</li>
            <li>My old one was very bulky and this one is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and since I am an easy bleeder, 4 blade razors kept nicking me and became more trouble.  </li>
            <li>But that is the only thing I would change about this super cheap option</li>
            <li>I use this dry (not in the shower), and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gets a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>I have had previous electric razors but this one really does do a good job.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and highly recommend it for someone looking for a decent electric razor on a thrifty budget.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not shave close, my legs fell like 1-2 days stubble right after a very thorough shave, and it cuts my legs -</li>
            <li>Because of the lympnode dissection I can no longer use real shaver on my right arm or underarm.</li>
            <li>The shaver really does need to be fully charged to work right.</li>
            <li>it does not get a super close shave as would a normal razor blade would.</li>
            <li>Works great so far, only used it a few times, but way better than a razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what any other reviewer says, best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li>But, the price is great for this brand, and so, when my old ones were becoming dull, it is either replace the blades or get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and a lot of it, so it clogs up most razors, but I haven&#x27;t had trouble with this one getting clogged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and has a trimmer on it to do bakkini line which is a bonus, and stays charged for a long period of time</li>
            <li>Im surprised how powerful it is!</li>
            <li>This gets pretty close, definitely not as close as a razor, but good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The item has to be in its complete original packaging-</li>
            <li>Nice to save shower time that used to go for endless rinsing of the cartridge, too.</li>
            <li>I tried other shavers and now my Wahl is catching dust.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about an extremely close shave, I just don&#x27;t want to feel like there is a silky mane of a braidable length on my legs, and it would be nice to go to the gym and not have to warn the trainer to avert his eyes when I have to lift my arms.</li>
            <li>The blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>It does however still work after having the battery completely run down which is more than I can say for the one that handled better.</li>
            <li>This little shaver came up at the top of the list with a decent number of stars and several fairly good reviews.</li>
            <li>I got zero cuts and maybe some very mild hair tugging  on the super long hair, but everything else was a breeze!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was sensitive to my skin and won&#x27;t give me nicks and that itchy feeling after a clean shave.</li>
            <li>worked fine for 4 months, i barely used it, may be once a month or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usable wet or dry, which is nice, but I got much better results when lathered up in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. - While it can be used in the shower (wet), it honestly feels better on your skin dry.</li>
            <li>My old one always had hair in it when I lifted the blades out to clean.</li>
            <li>The entire top of the razor pops off by pushing 2 buttons on the side of the head, making it easy to get to the interior for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works for the most part, but she said a regular razor blade still gives a much closer shave for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, and I thought after buying the others that razor burn was to be expected...</li>
            <li>The trimmer does absolutely nothing, you&#x27;re better off using the actual razor</li>
            <li>It takes AT MOST 2 passes over the same section to have a very smooth/close shave.</li>
            <li>Most razors are so expensive that you would think this won&#x27;t be good for the price.</li>
            <li>I am a very hair female mostly on my legs and neither lands</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but was hoping that in the many years since I had last used an electric razor that they since improved the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.i bought this for my daughtet and she has  used it several different ways</li>
            <li>This is a good little shaver for the price!</li>
            <li>but they do appear to jut out at a higher elevation than the rather large foil head...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, since each successive shaver I&#x27;ve purchased over the years has been less efficient, but I was pleasantly surprised--especially because of the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver for a first time user, like a teen not ready for razors, gentle on skin and shaves close, would buy.</li>
            <li>Found this one highly recommended and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>This is actually my 3rd one, the original Brand I have bought in the past is no longer available &amp; it cost a lot more!</li>
            <li>Having only one useable hand makes shaving a problem;  this shaver does the job - clean underarms!</li>
            <li>If it lasts, I intend on buying more as gifts for my equally lazy friends! :)</li>
            <li>Cuts close - works very well wet, and/or dry - easy to clean - Charges quickly and is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, just as good as when I used a plain razor.  </li>
            <li>no, product is very good, but i want to notify potential european  buyers of this product that it can  work only in USA 110 voltage range.</li>
            <li>there were lots of positive reviews for this razor</li>
            <li>Plenty of positive reviews for the price..</li>
            <li>I am more of a in-the-moment kind of a gal and will just shave my legs when I get in the tub, old habits die hard.</li>
            <li>It can be a great device, but if it&#x27;s not always going to be like that, it&#x27;s just not a good match for me.</li>
            <li>I shave pretty much head to toe</li>
            <li>I have used electric women&#x27;s razors for probably 25-30 years -- and they sure have come a long way over the decades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this razor absolutely gives a shave that feels exactly like I used a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this razor shaved - pretty close.  </li>
            <li>While it worked very well for the first 2 weeks of using it, I could not get the razor to charge at all after that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter weight and gives a closer shave than the first two.</li>
            <li>Great present for any young lady starting to shave her legs.</li>
            <li>Other shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and finally quit charging and didn&#x27;t cut that great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I would recommend this product pretty readily.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to use on my underarms, legs, belly and bikini area and it works well on pretty much all the areas, but not 100%.  </li>
            <li>I have really used it a lot and is nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>I have waited a long time to write this review, since I wanted to be absolutely sure before I gave it the glowing recommendation I felt it deserved.</li>
            <li>catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that the shape of your legs, your skin type and body hair type, how long it&#x27;s charged and</li>
            <li>catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that the shape of your legs, your skin type and body hair type, how long it&#x27;s charged and</li>
            <li>It holds a charge longer than other shavers I bought over the years, the shave is close, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, this is the first time I have bought the 3 blade wet/dry shave, thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far so GREAT!</li>
            <li>this is much better than using a razor, and hopefully it will save some money in the long run.</li>
            <li>and this one is the first one that I really feel does that.  </li>
            <li>There is stubble by the next day, but just a few minutes with this shaver makes my legs as good as smooth</li>
            <li>So far it has been way better than my old one so thanks to the dog</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it would be cheaply made, but it is of better quality than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The shaver fits my hand good, and the charger is small and convenient.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is also far more economical than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>This is good size for your hand (Its small).</li>
            <li>Personally I think it works a bit better on dry skin, but if I forget to do it first thing, I can just as easily bring it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I use it just to shave armpits and probably average about once a week, so not very long, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Right now I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have an older model and was thinking how much better could this possibly be.  </li>
            <li>It does not give you the super close shave of a regular razor but will do for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice and cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li>I have bought more expensive Remington razors and this one by far is the best I have owned and it was only 1/3 of the price of what I paid for the Remington.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have said the same thing that this wet/dry shaver is just OK.</li>
            <li>Although it may be a hassle to clean every couple of weeks, it&#x27;s way better than any plain razor i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I think it works better dry.</li>
            <li>And when it needs it, stick the top under running water and then let it sit on a towel for 12 hours to dry.</li>
            <li>:) it doesn&#x27;t give off that dry leg feeling where you need aloe vera</li>
            <li>I found it does do a better job using shaving cream vs dry.  </li>
            <li>For a long time I was using a men&#x27;s electric shaver, and it worked okay for my underarms, but for legs it was just not efficient and didn&#x27;t even give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that I have super DUPER sensitive skin and there are areas that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain</li>
            <li>goes easily from my face to my legs, and i&#x27;m italian.</li>
            <li>so I could keep an eye on him, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how close of a shave I would get with a dry shaver.</li>
            <li>It worked ok as I guess dry shavers do...</li>
            <li>I quickly get a shave nearly as close a razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used it dry where I have better lighting than in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The shave is smoother, the outlet adapter keeps it constantly charged, and the cleaning is easy.  </li>
            <li>Also it is easy enough for my husband to work, so he can help me shave my legs</li>
            <li>I agree that it cuts better dry</li>
            <li>Easy and simple for her to use.</li>
            <li>I used it dry and was able to sit while doing it.</li>
            <li>(just make sure your legs are actually dry and not damp, otherwise it will hop around).  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin - shaving makes me break out into hives....</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Quiet when using it and easy to recharge it.  </li>
            <li>This one is half the price and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>It worked great at first but after a month or so ,it began to work poorly.</li>
            <li>Better to use the dry feature and not in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of a dry shaver.</li>
            <li>- I love that I can use this item in the shower as well as using it dry -</li>
            <li>Cleaning a breeze with parts that come apart and snap back together easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the charger or that there is no indicator when the charging is complete but for the price I really like it!</li>
            <li>I use it dry just to be safe.</li>
            <li>We used it dry because I feel it has better slip that way.</li>
            <li>The plastic cap to protect the foil does not allow for the drainage of water so be sure to let it dry thoroughly before putting the cap on.</li>
            <li>Cleaning isn&#x27;t easy, bit overall</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin on my legs, so shaving</li>
            <li>If your leg hairs are long then be sure to clip them first before using the main foil &amp; you</li>
            <li>Good for every part of your body, including your delicate lady bits ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>last a good long time&lt;</li>
            <li>The trimmer is good too, and gets the long hairs to a short length that can be shaved.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on past reviews - it really works good.  </li>
            <li>They loved it as it shaves really close without the fear of a cut or nick that could cause excessive bleeding.  </li>
            <li>tells you how long the first one lasted, Impressive- I wouldnt let her take it a second time - other reviews posted.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to friends of mine</li>
            <li>I would buy it again in a heartbeat because of it&#x27;s versatility and smart design.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs in certain areas</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t avoid using it for pain reasons.</li>
            <li>but it certainly wasn&#x27;t mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as I do that, and don&#x27;t mind the shaver knocking off a good bit of the cream on surrounding areas not yet shaved, I get a very smooth and close shave with only minimal tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>where do you purchase something that has hair and fingerprints on it and its suppose to be new?!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, inexpensive to purchase, sount not very loud,  simple to recharge, light weight easy to handle either left or right hand, provides wet or dry shaving (can be used in bath tub or shower)...</li>
            <li>This is the first one that really leaves my skin smooth without having to repeatedly go back over the areas.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for the price as I have sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs, do not experience that anymore using this product now!</li>
            <li>A long time ago I had a nice, expensive electric razor that worked great.</li>
            <li>Gives a consistently closer shave especially when using it wet with a good shave lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried it in both wet and dry conditions, and with shaving creams as well as conditioner and it held up great under all conditions.</li>
            <li>i have not tried it wet but works great dry.</li>
            <li>It gives a great close shave, both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>also tried it myself on my face and does work great wet or dry</li>
            <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s great as both a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great wet and dry, as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great razor, dry or wet</li>
            <li>Thankfully it works great on both wet and dry skin providing a close shave.</li>
            <li>Unless you do a super heavy shaving session, just remove the top and rinse under running water.</li>
            <li>I also really like the convenience of being able to shave when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>product is far superior to my previous shaver which was a Braun.</li>
            <li>The on/off button is much easier to move than the previous model, so that is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin and red hair (pretty much blonde hair on my legs).</li>
            <li>This isnt good for long lasting hair free skin its like a regular razor</li>
            <li>This means shaving the back of my neck of the fine hair that grows there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple of times and its fine.</li>
            <li>only problem is that it takes a bit of maneuvering to shave the nethers with since this model comes with no bikini attachment, but it still did it&#x27;s job fine.</li>
            <li>My mom has the same thing and hers works and charges fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs just barely stubbly, but they look clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I still use a regular razor on my pits but this works fine on my legs.</li>
            <li>It makes my legs presentable and smooth, and better yet, only takes about five minutes for both legs, dry shave.  </li>
            <li>It is starting out just fine.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a more expensive shaver when it died, and like this better!</li>
            <li>I used to use a regular disposable razor and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only quick and convenient, but it gets the job done without any pain, cuts, or burning/itching sensation!</li>
            <li>My wife loves this inexpensive shaver and uses it mainly for her legs!</li>
            <li>It does a pretty decent job of shaving but leaves stubble</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent electric shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>so i will say that first cause it was the main reason i bought the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I actually like using it too as a quick shave option!  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend it very highly.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use a &#x27;ladies&#x27; shaver on my face, but most of what I read seemed to say that if anything ladies razors were simply more advanced and less harsh on the skin than men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li>Its been an amazing little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 14 yr old daughter, this is her first razor ever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think the only think that would make this shaver better is if it came with guards where you can just trim to a certain length(in certain areas where you might not want to be completely hairless ;P)</li>
            <li>Its is pretty simple to clean as well.  </li>
            <li>I have never used this razor while my legs are wet, but it works great on dry legs!</li>
            <li>I have not used this product myself since I bought it as a gift, however, I do own a similar one and it cuts down my time shaving significantly and saves me on having to buy razors and shave gels.  </li>
            <li>Some people would argue it doesn&#x27;t get close enough but to me its perfect because even tho it doesn&#x27;t get all the way to the skin it shaves off unwanted longer or short thick black hairs really quick without having to jump in the shower or get water everywhere, especially if you are rushing out the door and the outfit that looks best after changing 5 times shows legs or underarms a quick trim down and slap some lotion on you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with a little brush and pouch for storage.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver at a terrific price.  </li>
            <li>If you do these things you will have a convenient little gadget you can use on the fly without big productions!</li>
            <li>but this little shaver has really held its own and it was much cheaper than all the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>I have used the ES207P for years, but earlier this year, I decided to try the Panasonic ES2216, which I assumed, because it cost a little more, would be a better razor.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s not the silky smooth shave you get with a real razor, but it&#x27;s totally serviceable in a pinch.</li>
            <li>First of all it detaches from the space-saving charger base/cord, seems to hold a charge for long periods, &amp; works fabulously in the shower or out.  </li>
            <li>Though not as smooth as what can be achieved with a standard razor, it was very close.</li>
            <li>The price for this razor is comparable to what you would pay for a year&#x27;s worth of disposables so if this lasts a year I don&#x27;t feel like I have lost anything, nor have I created more waste than disposables would.  </li>
            <li>After years (and a huge expenditure of cash) of having my legs waxed, the downturn in the economy put such indulgences out of my budget.</li>
            <li>I really would like to have a much shorter charging time, but it does hold a charge through quite a number of shaves and I try to be mindful about charging it so that I have it ready when I need it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself, or run out of battery time and it shaves close enough that my legs and under arms are smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the price and the reviews, but I can&#x27;t quite figure out what blades to use where seeing as all three of them are attached at once and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really expect it to be.</li>
            <li>This works really well....doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I&#x27;d like, but still works well.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it really irritates my skin while leaving a stubble.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been in my possession for an hour, but it has made me have faith in the virtues of smooth legs again.</li>
            <li>I can deal with the bruises on my elbows from shampooing my hair, but my very being protests when I decide the fur level has gotten out-of-control and</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>This has saved me so much money on razors.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t cut ..rolls over but doesn&#x27;t really cut at all.</li>
            <li>&quot; ones really work and I was a guy?)</li>
            <li>I wish that the charger did not take up so much space on my wall outlet.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much in shaving cream and razors though, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>I suppose I could have it replaced, but I&#x27;ve really fallen out of the habit of using it/trying to use it, so I haven&#x27;t done any research on that.  </li>
            <li>This razor left my legs as smooth as could be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned an electric razor, so I really have nothing to compare this to.</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>Just plug it in, charge it up, and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>Really saved me so much embarrassment during swimsuit season.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Shaves very well without pulling hairs.</li>
            <li>The shaver fits in the hand very well and does hug the shape of the legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>in all, I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>I do really like this electric shaver</li>
            <li>There is no cord or real docking station.  </li>
            <li>but maybe I will have better luck with using it to shave wet..</li>
            <li>Shaving with a razor and shaving cream really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>really recommend this as a replacement for the Remmingtons.</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>The feature of cleaning under running water is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Delivery by Amazon was fast.</li>
            <li>The same day I shave with it, my boyfriend thinks my legs are as smooth as a razor-shave.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really save much</li>
            <li>I just bought this one and it really works..</li>
            <li>Of course, if you want a really close shave you need to use a razor</li>
            <li>but this is really close for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to shop for in a ladies shaver</li>
            <li>The Ladies shaver came wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The blades and foils are much easier to change than they were on the Remingtons also.</li>
            <li>Those triple and quadruple razor blades made today shave really, really close.</li>
            <li>Get a really close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I will say that it gets a much closer shave when in the shower and using conditioner</li>
            <li>another just didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always ready to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  </li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>, it provides a close shave without the fear of cuts and the precision tool works very well.  </li>
            <li>i use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and cleans up very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is exited to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It is really reasonable and a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well and took up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>The red light is on</li>
            <li>It was very affordable and lived up to my expectations and hopes.</li>
            <li>but it obviously isn&#x27;t going to get you waxing smooth.</li>
            <li>The Panasponic shaver works well but is not as gentle around my ankles as the Remington shaver.</li>
            <li>I shaved one underarm in the shower with my real shaver.</li>
            <li>It was well shipped and arrived incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought this not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it had been used and repackaged or anything, and I examined it really closely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaved my legs very well.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very close shave without the irritation of razor burn.  </li>
            <li>My experience with Panasonic has been that they make quality stuff so either my shaver is an unusual circumstance or this is the result of purchasing one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; lady shavers...</li>
            <li>and I really needed to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>It works very well on me.</li>
            <li>and I like it very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth as a regular razor</li>
            <li>I could actually FEEL that I was getting a closer shave, and now my legs feel so smooth</li>
            <li>It does tend to catch your skin if you go too fast, but it doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or razor burn on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping time was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>When you actually factor in the cost of buying disposable razors and blades this shaver is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I found it to work very well.</li>
            <li>but smooth enough to shave underarms.</li>
            <li>While it worked, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The last electric razor I bought was 10 years + ago in Germany in duty free....</li>
            <li>It is absolutely a five-star produce.</li>
            <li>However it does not give a very close shave</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t have to give her much instruction.</li>
            <li>But it worked really really well.</li>
            <li>She says that it works better than she expected.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>We are back to the cheap plastic ones.</li>
            <li>Handles very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my legs</li>
            <li>it is a very well working shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>I need to replace the charger but then decided to get the whole unit since it it cheaper that way.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is fully wet and it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>Two of the products which I really like so much</li>
            <li>I really apologized with all of you.</li>
            <li>It really works well</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>None have meet her expectations in confort and closeness but this very inexpensive Ladies razor.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold its charge very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>She says it works very well.</li>
            <li>charging stand is cordless and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>second replacement I purchased was another Remington - model WDF4830 Smooth &amp; Silky.  </li>
            <li>AND it is much quieter -</li>
            <li>okay, you do need to be careful and watch the direction so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair.</li>
            <li>very Eco -pack n go.</li>
            <li>The price was also very competitive.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li>Not only did it work fantastic, I didnt have to be concerned about cuts and razor burns from which was a concern after surgery.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive and works just as well as the one that I paid twice as much for....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to charge for me, the light stayed red.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell how close of a shave it provided</li>
            <li>I really like the longer shape.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this electric shaver!</li>
            <li>Having just had surgery and cannot use a blade razor for 3 months, I was bummed because it is unusual to find an electric that works wee.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works very well, however, when it did work.</li>
            <li>So - I don&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for my legs since it is much easier than shaving with a razor blade and will probably continue using it for my underarms</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a closer shave</li>
            <li>Just OK..not very powful</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I really like that the charger is compact.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving you legs so much easier</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable and I think I&#x27;ve already made up for the razors I would have bought.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate its charging station.</li>
            <li>It does get overwhelmed if too much hair is lingering on the head.</li>
            <li>fast shipment of product.</li>
            <li>From the shining reviews I guess I just expected more from this razor.</li>
            <li>Tried alot of razors, happy to finally one that works for such a low price!</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>but my leg hair grows fast</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you read the instructions about hair length and settings to maximize it&#x27;s effectiveness and so far no crazy bumps either....</li>
            <li>It is always charged and ready for use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>only way I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this is if you have no problem with razors and like having really really smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now, and I use it maybe twice a week, and find that it shaves me very close.</li>
            <li>For the price it works better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Close Curves Ladies Shaver works very well for under arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was not able to find it on Target store shelves as I had before, so I was very pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li>Ya know sometimes you just need a fast shave..  </li>
            <li>Really pulls on the hair when it clips.  </li>
            <li>I my wife is very please, and loves the convenience of shaving with out water.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get close</li>
            <li>Now, this may be too much to share</li>
            <li>It cut the leg hair REALLY close and did not cause any abrasions or rashes.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten as much use out of this as I&#x27;d like, but when I do use it, it works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very durable because I&#x27;ve dropped it a number of times without damage.</li>
            <li>The red light never turns off or changes color or nothing</li>
            <li>However, the blades &amp; the set cost almost as much as the whole razor.  </li>
            <li>in fact much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>razor shaves well,and closely and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>Recommended to friends including the parents of a daughter who wants to start shaving.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth as an actual blade.  </li>
            <li>I do have a fast growing course beard.</li>
            <li>I followed the charging directions but for some reason it won&#x27;t turn on even though the light on the wall charger says it is connected properly.</li>
            <li>but, really, those aren&#x27;t the ones I&#x27;m worried about.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Works fast when you don&#x27;t have time to shave.</li>
            <li>My wife charged it and tried it and said it comparied very well against hers</li>
            <li>She is very hairy and has been teased at school</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times because I have missed spots and it seems to do a very acceptable job.</li>
            <li>It just neatly sits in the cradle ready to be used.  </li>
            <li>No, my legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I use a blade, but they are close enough if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Much like a nightlight is set-up.  </li>
            <li>This, like all electric shavers I have tried do not shave legs nor arms very well.  </li>
            <li>Holds its charge and is always ready to go.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that much wight hanging on an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor shaves really close.  </li>
            <li>My daughter says this is working very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>Even if I sweat just a bit, or have too much lotion on, it clogs</li>
            <li>Very convenient to grip, maneuver, and charge.</li>
            <li>This has really saved me so much time.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this razor</li>
            <li>it is durable and very usable</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a very close shave on whatever body part it is applied to.</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Such a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li>This electric razor has saved me from so much</li>
            <li>So YES highly recommend this, matter of fact I might even get one for myself!</li>
            <li>I have some short hairs around my belly button and it does get rid of those and leave me smooth there</li>
            <li>and i really cant spend that much time in the shower</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>but i can&#x27;t handle it, it hurts too much to use</li>
            <li>It is very practical.</li>
            <li>Works very well, holds a charge, and gives my legs a close shave.</li>
            <li>It was fully charged and ready to go .</li>
            <li>Tons of power,  smooth shave with almost zero chance of cuts, holds charge for several shaves</li>
            <li>This shaver has made summer (and shaving) so much easier for me</li>
            <li>my experience no electric shaver gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to have polka-dotted legs at my brother&#x27;s wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whole thing pulls out if additional cleaning is needed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>(haha).</li>
            <li>I think I saved that much on shaving cream alone by using it.</li>
            <li>Very please with it.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>then you will be really</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember much of the results.</li>
            <li>Works well, light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>Visually no hair, but not as smooth of course as a blade.</li>
            <li>I just wanted something reasonable to use for 8 weeks pre and post surgery, but the shaver works so well</li>
            <li>and it took all the hair off and left a smooth leg.  </li>
            <li>, I like it that way, it saves much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor does, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to.</li>
            <li>Fast shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but the shave wasn&#x27;t quite as close as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>and it is fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Does everything that the manufacturer said it does and does it very well.</li>
            <li>that is why this shaver is really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are one that wants a really really close shave, this would not be for you.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>This one has a much smoother shave.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t understand is why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as the whole shaver costs.</li>
            <li>and it proved very functional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always ready to use when kept on the charger.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>This shaver holds the charge very well.  </li>
            <li>I used to have the remington straight head shaver like this.  </li>
            <li>Very feminine looking.  </li>
            <li>She says it works very well</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>This takes all of about 10 seconds but leaves my skin smooth without any red marks.</li>
            <li>but this shaver works really well.</li>
            <li>Was a Christmas gift, she really likes it a lot, it was what she was looking for.  </li>
            <li>But it took forever, and it hurt, and a old-fashioned twin-blade manual razor works much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read some reviews that it doesn&#x27;t really give you that &amp;#34;close</li>
            <li>I get that close shave experience, it does it job fast</li>
            <li>now I won&#x27;t have to do that nearly as much..</li>
            <li>Perhaps for others with lighter or thinner hair this would be enough to use as a primary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Rechargable, so no batteries and is ready when I need it.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to a real razor.</li>
            <li>This razor really pulled my hairs when I used it.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and does the job, but always feels like the day after a shave with a razor for me, I never get that just shaved smoothness feeling.</li>
            <li>I tend not to ever trust someone when they claim a product is water proof, as it never truly is really.</li>
            <li>When the blades spin fast, friction is reduced.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor because you can use it in the shower or not.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is so much quicker in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>So after probably hundreds of hours of use, I don&#x27;t really blame it for dying without any notice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found using electric shavers to be very convenient.  </li>
            <li>This one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Comparing to how much I spend on razors a week/two weeks</li>
            <li>that really did the job</li>
            <li>but it no longer does its job very well.  </li>
            <li>just received it yesterday and tried it out straight away.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like my shaver</li>
            <li>A reasonable price</li>
            <li>When I use this, my legs are smooth enough that they do not feel prickly when they touch in bed.</li>
            <li>and it works really well on under arms.</li>
            <li>Works great on my bikini and underarms, but I have relatively thin hair on my legs, so it didn&#x27;t work so well for that.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see scratching your legs up</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t need a bikini attachment.</li>
            <li>Very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>but if you go with the hair it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much.</li>
            <li>Does not make legs as smooth as regular shaving</li>
            <li>It was truly much more than I expected</li>
            <li>My wife really really really really really really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li>I recommend it so highly that I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for my mother!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I decided that the 12 dollars that I might spend trying to replace the one part that may not be the answer would be better spent in another shaver.</li>
            <li>I really like this,easy and fast...</li>
            <li>Works very well but haven&#x27;t used it in &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li>Gives you a very close shave without burning.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well bit plugging it to recharge uses a whole strip.</li>
            <li>with absolutely none of the resulting irritation.</li>
            <li>Both times I thought it was a goner for real.</li>
            <li>Has not been used much as of now.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this item.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;ve shaved with a razor and that&#x27;s all I really care about.</li>
            <li>and now she wants one too.</li>
            <li>fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is always ready.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Almost did not purchase because price was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>When I called the warranty department, they said I had to mail the whole shaver to their MCAllen, TX, store at MY expense.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really messed up about that is what woman wants to receive hair removal products for Christmas?</li>
            <li>So why these things are available only at Christmas is beyond me.</li>
            <li>i absolutely feel hope.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>so I picked one up for her on amazon too and her shaving experience was the same but closer to a smooth finish since she used hers in the shower.</li>
            <li>It shaves close to the skin but is not abrasive and is much quieter.</li>
            <li>However, speaking on behalf of men using this product, it does not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I really like the shave this razor gives.  </li>
            <li>Much quicker.  </li>
            <li>i have too much hair on my face.</li>
            <li>felt no stubble and left my face smooth</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s way too much of a hassle for an $18 shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a Remington shaver but did not want to spend that much.</li>
            <li>Think he enjoys my shaver as much as I do</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>Very close shave, almost as close as a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>You plug the whole thing into the wall and wait like over night for it to charge.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted it.</li>
            <li>I was ready to cry my heart</li>
            <li>and now I just really really like it</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and a straight blade causes a blood bath</li>
            <li>Rechargeable and wet safe.</li>
            <li>Very close shave too</li>
            <li>Very have with the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Very close shave and gentle.</li>
            <li>Very goog deal.</li>
            <li>This is very embarrassing for women.</li>
            <li>Wife&#x27;s intimate groomer.  </li>
            <li>But I WILL say that the shave is really close considering its not razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really course hair on my chin and it literally becomes a beard if I don&#x27;t remove the hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I feel that it works very well.</li>
            <li>It still charges because the red light goes on when I plug it in but doesnt work...</li>
            <li>I always use this in the shower, so definitely glad it is usable in wet conditions.  </li>
            <li>(idk how much it was charged)</li>
            <li>Works very well for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used to really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>So much easier.  </li>
            <li>I may razor shave throughout the summer for that smooth shiny look and feel (even if brief),</li>
            <li>Too much skin nicking</li>
            <li>If you do it wet, make dang sure you use soap or shaving cream, not just water.</li>
            <li>I get a fast, close shave.  </li>
            <li>The bikini area trimmer that pops up also works very well.  </li>
            <li>Shaves real well and close.</li>
            <li>Only problem is there is not a base with a cord.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot as yet.</li>
            <li>Very compact to store.  </li>
            <li>Works even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It really works well on my hair and skin type.</li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t get a really close shave</li>
            <li>but it is so much easier on your skin than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job.  </li>
            <li>I have a vein problem and can never use a straight edge again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is very compact - holds a charge for days (as I don&#x27;t leave it</li>
            <li>plugged into an outlet all the time) - and provides a very close shave on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>becAUse that really helps to give you a cleaner and smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>it is really cheap and gross</li>
            <li>all in all I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>It does not shave very closely or handle contour changes very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter too much since I&#x27;m in my thirties and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow like it did in my teens.  </li>
            <li>was really expecting this thing to choke and die on my leg hair (never mind my bikini line), but here it is ready to go again.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This razor really provides a close shave when pressed for time.</li>
            <li>I got this not expecting to really like it .</li>
            <li>Gives A Very Close Shave..</li>
            <li>They never cut very close, and it always felt like I needed to shave.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So when the battery finally gave out after several years I bought another Remington, the closest model I could find to the one I liked which was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it&#x27;s doing pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>so if anything changes in the near future, I&#x27;ll be sure to change my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I need to be extremely careful as far as picking any kind of product.</li>
            <li>Needed to replace my old shaver - this one was only one I could find with most of the features I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I guess it is OK but not like my old one that finally died after 35 years</li>
            <li>But, she refuses to use it on more sensitive areas because it pulls hair occasionally.  </li>
            <li>I have used other brand names, but, Panasonic makes electric razors giving, by far, the most smoothest shaves ever!  </li>
            <li>will use it now as I spent the money but will go back to use disposable shavers in summer when I need a good shaving result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few electric razors over the years, and none have worked liked this one.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a good deal for at least 2 yr.</li>
            <li>It works well but is kind of heavy; I like the rechargeable feature which is the reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li>Its a good razor😊 for everyone who used it as a regular razor for their legs are not really thinking💁</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got sturdy construction and a nice contoured, heavy feel in hand.</li>
            <li>I Will Be Buying Two More In The Near Future..</li>
            <li>If it starts to pull or run slow I plug it in for 24 hours and it shaves good again.</li>
            <li>And I guess it would be nice if the surface area of the shaver was larger in order to do legs more quickly, but I guess it&#x27;s comparable to a regular razor, so I&#x27;m probably getting a little greedy here!</li>
            <li>I am disappointed, I thought if I try a new band name maybe it just  may  work as good or better than my old one I had for so many years(for years)</li>
            <li>Obviously the wet method will shave closer, but most of the time the dry works just fine!!</li>
            <li>Razor burn, pulling, and pinching on any surface that isn&#x27;t basically flat and any hair that isn&#x27;t fine.</li>
            <li>Our 90 year old recipient loves it for her chin!!!</li>
            <li>so I saw this and tried it and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely use my regular razor or wax anymore.</li>
            <li>I have a very rare condition called aquagenic pruritus, which is essentially an allergy to water, or to water drying on the skin.</li>
            <li>great for sensitive skin is quick and easy to use the only downside its the weird charger that is a square instead of a cable so that takes space in the wall outlet</li>
            <li>I have only used it dry, but have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re sure your skin is either completely dry, or wet and lathered (in other words, damp skin causes pulling) this shaver is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not a very powerful shaver, it works better when it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is not very expensive.</li>
            <li>You definitely can not compare it to one of the high end shavers and if you have fine hairs like i do on my legs</li>
            <li>shaved well and easily even when the hair was quite long, ~2 weeks of no shaving.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, close shave, and keeps a charge for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>Shaver is really easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>so long I forgot what its like to have easy time shaving.</li>
            <li>You can use it dry or wet, easy to use, and safe.</li>
            <li>so long it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know how long it will keep a charge but is easy to recharge</li>
            <li>I love this shaver for a quick dry touch up shave, especially on my legs.  </li>
            <li>After trying many other brands, this one really did the JOB.</li>
            <li>Many companies today seem to make things smaller or not as sturdy as the old versions,  that is why it is so good to see the new Panasonic has the same quality that I expected.</li>
            <li>It cuts down so much time in the shower and while it may not be the suuuuuper smooth shave you get with a manual razor, it&#x27;s pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>It did my underarms even better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been safe with sharp objects.  </li>
            <li>This works better than other shavers I tried.  </li>
            <li>My original 5 star review would have remained had it not died on me after only 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>It was close enough of a shave to feel smooth and soft the first day.  </li>
            <li>and she said she likes this much better than her other one.  </li>
            <li>I guess I agree with most of the other reviews here.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t have any experience with other shavers to be able to compare it.</li>
            <li>few notes on usage: If you have anything more than stubble on your legs, you&#x27;re really going to want to use the pop-up trimmer first.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this Panasonic, especially when compared to the Remington I have been using for the past several years.  </li>
            <li>My underarms are a little more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and the first time I used it on my pits, I used soap and water.....</li>
            <li>For me, this is an advantage because I can shave more often and avoid razor burn, but if you have dark hair and light skin where every tiny bit of stubble shows, then you may want to stick with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decide to wait a while to see how long it would last and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I do think it pulls more than other electric razors, and misses a lot.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic, largely due to the cheap price, but gave it a shot anyway!</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t use the top outlet (of the two) because the plug will not plug into the outlet due to the shaver hitting the medicine cabinet up there.</li>
            <li>Has great little motor and holds charge an exceptionally long time.</li>
            <li>Very long battery life and love the way it makes your skin feel soft and barren of hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a small brush, protective cap for the head, charger, and a small travel pouch, which it and all the accessories fit into easily and nicely.</li>
            <li>B000KQJNNO Remington WDF-5000 Smooth and Silky ladies shaver]] started becoming dull</li>
            <li>The razor cleaned easily and the charge is so long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, a small brush is included.</li>
            <li>This is easy &amp; comfortable to hold &amp; actually DOES work as well as it does wet &amp; lathered.</li>
            <li>Such a great everyday electric razor!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this long, but so far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>When attempting to clean item with the brush that came with the kit, the inside blade fell off and I could not get it back.</li>
            <li>The first few shaves were lovely, but the cutters lost their edge.</li>
            <li>It really was decent while it worked</li>
            <li>Very convenient, gives a decent shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it (on clean, dry skin), the shave was so close that it &#x27;almost&#x27; felt like I&#x27;d used a blade.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to get a smooth shave with this electric shaver, either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>When I first got this shaver I thought I was really going to like it because it seemed to shave my chin a lot faster than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>There are no great lady&#x27;s&#x27; razors, but this one is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have thick dark hair on my legs and this shaver does as good of a job as my husbands $150 shaver!!!!</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have the family gift me a few extra dollars to spend on my own gifts.</li>
            <li>The shaver has no problems doing close shaves for little hairs and it also trims the long hairs very nicely.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a very long time - right out of the box I was able to save my entire legs, bikini, underarms, and arms and still have charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if it is still red when I wake up Tuesday morning, I will try using it anyway, but am not too confident that the problem is only the charger light and that it will actually work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one to anybody who wants a close shave without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Priced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried some other decent and mildly pricey razors and after going through 2 of them and being really dissapointed, I tried about 2 more of the lesser priced ones (under $30).</li>
            <li>it was cheap enough that I could just order a new one.</li>
            <li>But on special nights with hubby I definitely use the gillette...</li>
            <li>It is a small 1 1/2 inch cube that plugs into the wall, and you can put the razor right on top of it.</li>
            <li>Same as any electric razor.....does an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job...nothing special</li>
            <li>I have used it both wet and dry and in all honesty they both give just as good of a shave.</li>
            <li>I have NOT tried it wet, but its so good dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it does a good enough job to get rid of the appearance of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as traditional razors, but is very convenient for a quick job.</li>
            <li>I loved my previous Remington which had an actual cord on the charger</li>
            <li>These work fairly well, but they last less than a year before the quality is severely compromised.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the job it does, I like to use it better dry then in the shower.</li>
            <li>tried it wet yet, but dry it does a good job on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have never gone 3 days, but I&#x27;m sure it would do at least a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It give a very close shave for an electric razor, definitely does the trick for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Perfect for times like winter or other times when you are in a big hurry and just need a little touch up or if you don&#x27;t care much.</li>
            <li>I had a little trouble finding a good place to plug it in to recharge but other than that it is as good as any electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>Other than that this shaver gives a close shave, is easy to use, and cheap enough to throw away in a year or so when the battery stops working, which it will.</li>
            <li>Will do 2 long sessions and will need a recharge, but will last many more sessions for limited areas and time.</li>
            <li>It shaves so close and so comfortable, and it stays charged up for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have had it only for a few weeks and used it 3-4 times, and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have had it only for a few weeks and used it 3-4 times, and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Comfort handle shape in design, long battery holding charge and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>I just use it dry, but it has worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor at my daughter&#x27;s request, and so far she says it&#x27;s exactly what she had been looking for.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver has worked pretty well for me so far.</li>
            <li>My daughter now uses my old shaver which is much duller!  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to go slow for the closest shave possible, and make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before used.</li>
            <li>After a full charge and body shave, it still last for 2 weeks without charging.</li>
            <li>Not ultra-smooth like you&#x27;d expect from a regular razor or from waxing, but good enough to last a day or two depending on how picky you are about prickly legs.</li>
            <li>This shaver doesn&#x27;t pull, shaves well the first time over, and offers a closer shave to boot.</li>
            <li>You could land a prize winning bass with those whiskers.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps it needed charging, even though it&#x27;d been recently charged, so I&#x27;d give it a full charge</li>
            <li>I am a cyclist and we like to keep our legs smooth for no particular reason than making it easy for our masseuse to take care of us after long rides.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it work great, but it holds a charge for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not as completely 100% smooth as a razor it is very close and the hair seems to take longer to grow back than when using a razor.  </li>
            <li>For the price it does a better than average job.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Schick Intuition and absolutely abhor the process of shaving my legs in the shower, even without having to use shaving cream with the Intuition.</li>
            <li>It offers a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>and it works pretty well as far as electric razors go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this and especially for the low cost compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li>good if you have irritation with the razor, for me does not last suffiencient enough for my both legs, wish it could last longer or have the corded option.</li>
            <li>Even with a full charge I&#x27;ve often run out of power with only one leg shaved.</li>
            <li>One charge lasts several shaves before losing full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>one full charge can be used multiple times.</li>
            <li>So far -- the aforementioned is fine.</li>
            <li>: Ok, this product went from 5 stars down to 1 star.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many electric shavers and they all let me down.</li>
            <li>but this time pressing down a bit more.</li>
            <li>It really is good wet or dry!</li>
            <li>I tried the little trimmer feature on the more heartily furred part of my thigh that I&#x27;d been avoiding while the wounds healed, and it removed the hair readily.</li>
            <li>So I put on some shaving cream in the shower and it worked a little better, but it still didn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li>Would buy again if it wears out/dulls in a year or so (with the price of blades, might as well get a new unit!)</li>
            <li>Came brand new and fully charged!  </li>
            <li>The important fact to note here is that I&#x27;m male and finding this shaver just as effective (if not more so) than my old one.</li>
            <li>This razor DOES NOT get you the super smooth feel like traditional razors, nor does the results last as long as a traditional razor, but you get the look of smoothness that most women want.</li>
            <li>I may just buy a whole new shaver ($18.00 here)</li>
            <li>Not travel like to see a new boss that you really need to impress.</li>
            <li>Well, this is the new product that I just ordered online and what I really want.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new cordless razor and this one does the job well for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I call in and they sent a new one out that very day.</li>
            <li>Even hand razors will cut you if you&#x27;re not careful, right?</li>
            <li>This razor, for about half the price, works much better and works with just one pass.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than the corded razor, it takes up less space and is out of the way when charging.  </li>
            <li>Used to use a cheapo less than $10 drugstore Clio razor which was okay</li>
            <li>but the dry is smooth, glides over what ever you want to shave &amp; it fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li>It can be used wet with gel or dry -- I&#x27;ve now used it both ways and got the best shave possible next to using the Venus Embrace manual razor.</li>
            <li>and it did a much better job in a lot less time.</li>
            <li>I used it dry and hope to save time this summer by having this available.</li>
            <li>If the warranty comes through and it&#x27;s replaced, maybe I&#x27;ll improve my rating again, but the hassle of having to do this makes it not worthy of any more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, even when wet.</li>
            <li>I shave my legs dry and it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>My previous Panasonic lasted many years, I should have replaced it before it died.</li>
            <li>For less than $20, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Relatively less noisy than most razors, but still buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to use in those quick situations where I may need o shave my legs or arm pits at the last minute when I want to throw on a dress or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had more expensive one , but this one work better.</li>
            <li>The Remington has always done a decent job but was looking for a closer shave quicker.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to replace my Remington 5000, which was good, but the replacement heads and blades have become too expensive to be worth purchasing to rebuild it.</li>
            <li>I want to add that you also need to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>She tried my electric razor which is a Panasonic but an older version.  </li>
            <li>I had this shaver for 2 years but used it only a handful of times for quick jobs.</li>
            <li>and that is why is decided to order this particular shaver for my wife.  </li>
            <li>My main purpose&lt;</li>
            <li>Seems to hold a decent charge also.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shaver if your looking for a quick hair removal mechanism.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m inclined to agree and will recommend this (particularly for the 20$ price point I found it at) to anyone looking for a decent replacement.</li>
            <li>, that is my main issues.</li>
            <li>and we have a super tiny shower, so</li>
            <li>This shaver works much better than more expensive razors.</li>
            <li>The last two times I used it I would have to give it a few good smacks to get her going.</li>
            <li>It works well especially when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to run into the shower.  </li>
            <li>Decent razor for the price</li>
            <li>I purchased it mainly to get rid of the &#x27;chin hairs.&#x27;</li>
            <li>She loves being able to use it dry for a quick touch up or using it wet while relaxing in the bath.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I had an older version and lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet seeing the ingrown hairs I usually get, so maybe this is FINALLY the method that doesn&#x27;t cut the hair below skin level to where the hair can&#x27;t grow out of it successfully.</li>
            <li>The older I get the lazier</li>
            <li>but the main reason i gave it 2 stars was because i have had it for maybe 6 to 7 months and the shaver just stopped working out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs, on those stubborn chin hairs that plague older women, and on the nape between trips to the stylist.  </li>
            <li>She had an older model of this</li>
            <li>Shave is close enough for public viewing of shaved areas (pits and legs) but needs to be shaved more often than using manual razor.</li>
            <li>Better than some more expensive shavers tried.</li>
            <li>After my older shaver [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This shaver gave a decent shave when it worked.  </li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t have to go back over the same spot more than once,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on longer hair without first using the trimmer, and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling or pain at all, though I would recommend following the instructions, and first using the trimmer on longer hair before shaving it closer.</li>
            <li>Considering that my hair grows relatively fast, shaving gets really old, really fast.</li>
            <li>I use this on my upper legs where the hair is not so thick and it works great there, too.  </li>
            <li>However, I needed something I could shave quickly with when I didn&#x27;t have enough time to use a razor.  </li>
            <li>It always seemed to me that the focus was on men&#x27;s razors and the ladies were left with few good options.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent wet/dry shaver, although sometimes I feel like you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I am getting older and could not keep plucking</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this shaver based on the positive reviews and because it is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a small white plastic-ish bag to put it in (the charger doesn&#x27;t fit with it in there), so that was better than nothing which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better than razors and water and mess.</li>
            <li>I originally used hair removing creme and razors, but it either takes too long or hurts my skin.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to charge though (12 hours) and only last 10 good minutes until it weakens.</li>
            <li>not charging properly (you HAVE to make sure it is properly seated in the charger, charger light ON); the charge lasts for at least 2 shaves (I haven&#x27;t tried to do it longer, I just recharge); it does not damage my skin at all; it is easily cleaned; it is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>A great dry shaving option (though I would recommend moisturizing beforehand, not too heavily!)</li>
            <li>tried it wet once and gave up pretty quickly on that.  </li>
            <li>It does a really good job without pushing very hard.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a very nice ladyshave for legs and arms, but definitely not recommended for the delicate bikini area.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but took much longer time to clear up than my former phillip one (around same price).</li>
            <li>Because I am older and don&#x27;t have to shave my legs very often, this works great on my legs and no more nicks from a regular razor and much easier doing it outside of the shower than trying to bend in shower.  </li>
            <li>so far it has been working pretty good,charge fast and easy to clean,came with a little bag where you can store it.</li>
            <li>I again did not see that much in the ladies&#x27; market (as compared to the options available for men and aside from the new crop of epilators that I was not ready to try).  </li>
            <li>I have went through a few, because I&#x27;d rather just buy a new one than replace parts since it is such a good price.</li>
            <li>My previous razor cost more than twice as much and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My legs are hard to get a clean smooth shave thus the nicks.</li>
            <li>It is also a plus that it can be used wet or dry and that it is easily rinsed to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Does a great job - I only use it when dry, not on wet skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but it works extremely well, gets a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 4 other electric trimmers and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this razor for my thirteen year old daughter as I knew it would be safer for her than a hand-held razor.  </li>
            <li>I am overall happy with my purchase as it wasn&#x27;t super expensive and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver is perfect for me because my skin is thin and other shavers cause nicks this one does not.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying new blades, I buy a new machine every year or so because the blades I found online for this are almost as much as the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a safety razor now that I have bifocals &amp; couldn&#x27;t see my underarms clearly!!  </li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother, who needed a replacement for her old one (which was bought in 1965!!).</li>
            <li>This little gem gets almost as close to a razor shave as I have ever been able to manage, and I don&#x27;t get any of the resulting skin irritations that I once had.</li>
            <li>Some times it can pull hairs a little but for the most part I am in LOVE with this little thing.</li>
            <li>The shave could be a LITTLE better, but it is, after all, an electric....</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I used to get so many little bumps on my legs from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li>It costs a little more</li>
            <li>For you guys, spend a little more and get a Remington product instead.</li>
            <li>Many people talked about the battery that stopped recharging after little time.</li>
            <li>This product stopped working a little more than a month after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>but so far not complaining!!</li>
            <li>The shaver sits directly on top of the little square charger which plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li>the contour makes it easy to use the blades will stay sharp for the life of the battery.</li>
            <li>The size does not exactly make it easy to shave your bikini area.</li>
            <li>Nice pop up trimmer for the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>Nice little unit!!</li>
            <li>I needed a new blade but the new shaver was cheaper than the blade!</li>
            <li>This shaver is quiet, holds a charge for several dry leg shaves, easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great shave, however I might try something different to see if it will last a little longer.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer cuts if you move it VERY, VERY slowly, but still pulls the hair more than it should and it takes multiple passes to get an okay cut.</li>
            <li>the one I had previously worked great until the battery finally played out which is the weak link with most rechargeable devices</li>
            <li>I had two older Remington lady shavers and needed a new shaver as my cord had deteriorated</li>
            <li>It worked OK on my dry hair, but it got very hot on my skin and was not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave and proved to be too much for her sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and it was done dry</li>
            <li>So far I really like this.</li>
            <li>I tried it with clean dry legs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily surprised that this cuts fast and is as close as I think you&#x27;ll ever get from an electric razor -</li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;ve always used this wet with shaving cream and still the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s ready when I need it.</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave even in the sensitive areas :</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t have much hope when I ordered this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>However, as far as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, this works really well.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than my old Remington shaver.</li>
            <li>My mother  of 80 years old said she wanted one, my caregiver saw it and said she wants  one</li>
            <li>dual action clipper and shaver combo makes fast work of longer stubble.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 12 year old daughter because I wasn&#x27;t quite ready for her to start using a razor.</li>
            <li>Someone really needs to get on developing a sarcastic font...)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few months, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the weight, the feel of it in the hand and the appearance.</li>
            <li>I have been using the $9.99 trimmers which dont last long, this is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it over a month now, but I think the convenience for this time in my life has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>Of course if you use it everyday, I would plug it in more often.</li>
            <li>I think this is a better shaver than one I had a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>After using razor for few weeks I ordered two more for family members.</li>
            <li>It would charge like normal</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for many years and it has not given me one bit of trouble.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, from the first second I tried it I could tell there was no way it was going to irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I have owned several different brands of electric shavers and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This helps remove the heavy hair safely.  </li>
            <li>Not as close cutting or as smooth as a real razor but a great thing to have for missed spots or for young girls just starting to shave.</li>
            <li>No negative issues.</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter who is a bit bothered by normal razors.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it dry, but tried it wet and liked it.</li>
            <li>Mostly I shave my underarms and legs, but it seems the motors like to burn out after a few months.</li>
            <li>I have also tried everything short of expensive laser hair removal, and this razor, so far, is wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought the first one back in October 2012 and it lasted a whole 5 months before it acted as though it was going to die and</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use I do love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how many shaves I can get on one charge.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the few extra dollars for the better model</li>
            <li>It is not cheap in quality, like a lot of shavers are and it does shave to a smooth, baby bottom feel!</li>
            <li>I normally shave in the shower, but after developing a blood clot and being on blood thinner for 6 months, I had to come up with something else.  </li>
            <li>Nice shave for my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>so I have no complaint there.</li>
            <li>It too pinched and gave a good but not great shave.</li>
            <li>Good thing I got tired . .</li>
            <li>Just used it dry for the first time (after a 12 hour charge) and it is very smooth and painless due mainly to the curved head.</li>
            <li>As with any other electric shaver, you DO need to open the top and clean out the hairs regularly with the brush that is supplied...</li>
            <li>Very convenient for those quick &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and much faster than a conventional shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought this may help other folks in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;As usual with Amazon, a great price and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Safe to use wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first tried out this product that I bought my little sister one for her birthday.</li>
            <li>It is especially quiet, nice shape for holding and does a fine job shaving (a little slower than using a razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
            <li>Right out of the box it barely dry-shaved as well as the Remington when it was old.</li>
            <li>I always used it dry &amp; it gave a decent, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>(i do it on dry skin), get a close enough shave that even if you&#x27;re up close/ touching me</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; yet, but it does a far better job than my previous elec razor.</li>
            <li>and I think it gives a nice close shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Simple design, totally reliable and easy to use, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get, but it&#x27;s so easy to use that if you want to shave again the next day it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>Relatively simple and easy to open with no-nonsense instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simple easy and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many complaints about this and other electric shavers that I thought I ought to clarify a few things and help everyone get a smooth, non-injurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right handed and left handed people.</li>
            <li>right handed and left handed people.</li>
            <li>Holds a super long change as well.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not major Because it does get get pretty close (closer than shick manual razors!</li>
            <li>I like the more narrow head being that I&#x27;m working around legs and arms that are not flat boards. ;)</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a normal razor.</li>
            <li>Recharging too much, or when there is a lot of charge left, will lower battery longevity seriously, (especially with nickel batteries.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get this shipped to north of the 49th parallel, (Canada,) but the shipping cost</li>
            <li>I think it is also important to note that I previously tried the Norelco Bodygroom shaver due to the many positive reviews, however I got razor burn from that shaver and also got cut quite badly in several places.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to be able to use it forever, but I hoped to get at least a year out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you angle it right with all areas of the razor head flat against your skin and press down, you can get a pretty close shave quickly.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I should mention that I am a GUY, yet I firmly believe the only place hair belongs is on top of our heads.  </li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers noted, it stopped working after 9 months of light use.  </li>
            <li>Not like other cheap ones that run out of charge in 15 mins.</li>
            <li>It does such an amazing job and does it so much quicker that the usual razor.  </li>
            <li>had been when new during that time.  </li>
            <li>I always do research before trying a new product, so I ordered this one based upon reviews as well as price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to keep buying a new electric razor every 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life used anything but a blade razor on my legs and underarms, so this was a totally new experience.  </li>
            <li>Then I dropped and broke it, and had to get something new.</li>
            <li>I immediately had to go on a five-day trip, so my new razor hit the trail with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Concerning the seller: The electric razor was new and in sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>Even brand new</li>
            <li>I may have to buy a new cutter.  </li>
            <li>new age is here!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Before I even tried it I new</li>
            <li>live the color</li>
            <li>As a lot of new moms can probably understand I have been struggling to find 5 minutes for a shower let alone time to shave my legs while I&#x27;m in there.</li>
            <li>At that time I should buy new shaver blades.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even need to shop around when I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Then it needs new blades.  </li>
            <li>So I end up just getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get a new blade head for it.  </li>
            <li>Also couldn&#x27;t find a new Remington that matched my new qualifications.  </li>
            <li>...and Buy New $19.88 new, $19.99 for blade set</li>
            <li>I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>I went and bought a new one because I have faith.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought a new one on July 26th</li>
            <li>Works well when it is new.  </li>
            <li>I got a new one because my Remington was getting worn out/dull</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver to someone who is totally new to electric shaving.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get a new cord for my Remington.  </li>
            <li>I have used others and decided it was time to try something new.  </li>
            <li>but you probably new that.  </li>
            <li>It would be cheaper for me to just buy a new foil.</li>
            <li>This new version has a one-piece charger/plug instead of a charger stand attached to a cord.</li>
            <li>With this new one however I found it comes with a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Owned for a year and still works like new.</li>
            <li>Why buy replacements when buying a new unit is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Panasonic ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was going to spend hundreds on a new razor because mine was kaput.  </li>
            <li>The representative said they were out at the warehouse and after receiving a new shipment in 2 weeks they would ship us a replacement.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is the brand of rechargeable I&#x27;ve had 20 +years, still works, needs new head, cheaper to buy a new one of these and these are prettier.</li>
            <li>In Stores Where I Live Anymore</li>
            <li>The foil and blade seem to be top notch and not likely to go dull quickly.</li>
            <li>My coworker swears by dry shavers, so I decided to try this one out, not wanting to drop a ton of cash before being comfortable with the whole idea of shaving outside the</li>
            <li>The box says wet or dry, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job on my wet hair.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to all ladies young and older.</li>
            <li>The red light lit up to signal that it was charging, so I left it there for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It barely keeps enough charge to do one full leg anymore.</li>
            <li>here it is Monday evening TWO DAYS later, and the charger light is still showing red!  </li>
            <li>Have only used once so far but shaved smoothly, not as close as a razor, but quick and easy for touch ups.</li>
            <li>So far, the rechargeability of this particular model is also working well.</li>
            <li>in use &amp; no complaints,the older model(3 years old) is also too by my duaghter,  </li>
            <li>It cuts close enough to be smooth, but not close enough to give me ingrown hairs or razor burn.</li>
            <li>i thought of this item only after getting a very precocious snowshoe siamese who gets into absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li>I found that pulling the skin as taut as possible, changing the direction of the shaver path repeatedly, reapplying whatever soap/shaving cream/lubricant you use multiple times, and doing about a million passes did, eventually get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I use it on dry legs for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s so quick and can be used dry.</li>
            <li>Then I go back over the same area LIGHTLY GLIDING along my skin with the foil.</li>
            <li>The shaver sits upright directly on the plug, which is much nicer as far a storage (</li>
            <li>I dont use this as often as I thought, mainly because it is so LOUD.</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll do a wet shave with shaving gel to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>A close shave with out a blade, safer for the young and older lady.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than my much older and much more expensive razor (which recently died).</li>
            <li>This cute little shaver is a trooper!</li>
            <li>You do need to go over the same spot several times, but as someone who has very sensitive skin I can honestly say I have NO irritation and my legs are not as dry since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.</li>
            <li>This is a very good little shaver, for a very small price.  </li>
            <li>Good enough that I&#x27;ve repurchased this exact same shaver knowing that it will become dull within a year</li>
            <li>This time though, I definitely wasted my money as this may serve better as a vibrator than a razor since it doesn&#x27;t cut / trim / razor anything the first 6 times, either with the pop-up trimmer or flat.</li>
            <li>for a year even... don&#x27;t expect it to stay as good if you use it for any other areas or for it to last a really long time...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and legs</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so cannot use a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and the hypo-allergenic blades and foils</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I experience no pulling or irritation after using it, and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and works especially you are in hurry.</li>
            <li>He suggested that I give it a try, we both have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Dry shaving that area sounds like a nightmare, but this shaver is a dream come true for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So, for the general user who has a larger body canvas this might be worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Very clumsy to use and didn&#x27;t give near as good a results as her 35 year  old Remington, which gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t give as close as a shave as a razor obviously, but it gets pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I was so happily surprised by this razor!  </li>
            <li>pretty quiet, if you care about noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone, first time user or otherwise.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for as a present for my wife.</li>
            <li>My husband gave it to me last year, and at first I was hesitant.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has worked pretty well in the short time I have had it.  </li>
            <li>I recently had to start taking blood thinners after a medical event, and this was the product that I saw recommended most often for folks who have to avoid regular razors.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works for men&#x27;s parts as well, I&#x27;m told by the males in my household who requested their own, and well enough that they didn&#x27;t care that it only came in pink.</li>
            <li>I had pretty low expectations, but after reading tons of reviews I decided to try the Panasonic Curves...</li>
            <li>Like several of the other reviewers here...I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say!</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to anyone no more razor blade cuts from shavers</li>
            <li>Okay, not sure whose fault it was</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks it completely stopped working!</li>
            <li>I was willing to take a chance because of the low price</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend this; beats out the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li>I used it for several months and thought it shaved pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It also has a wall charger that you plug directly into a socket, with no cord!</li>
            <li>and it does this the first time, without having to shave the same spot again and again.</li>
            <li>It gets a pretty close shave, but of course, not quite as close as a regular razor with shaving cream and water.</li>
            <li>I was never able to get a close shave that lasted more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hair removal products that has actually worked on my bikini area without causing irritation (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews said that this razor pinches but that has not been my experience even though most razors I have used in the past have done that.  </li>
            <li>Only works the first day</li>
            <li>I only got hair bumps the first 2 shaves, probably because I let the hair grow out fully for a week without shaving again to see hat happens, but now I&#x27;m shaving every 3/4 days I get no problems.</li>
            <li>She can shave daily with no ill result.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>I like that the charger plugs directly into the outlet - no cord to bundle!</li>
            <li>The shave, of course, isn&#x27;t nearly as close as it would be if you were to use a blade, but hello, I don&#x27;t want to use a blade!  </li>
            <li>I generally use a straight razor but was told post hip surgery to use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>will say it seemed to work better on my &#x27;other&#x27; bits than on my legs, so maybe its just that my legs aren&#x27;t curvey enough.  </li>
            <li>This unit has fixed my problem!  </li>
            <li>but I have to over the same area MANY times to get it as short as I&#x27;d like - even with regular shaving.</li>
            <li>I only use it as a wet shaver and must say that it takes by far more time to shave than with a disposable one and</li>
            <li>I took the first one apart and cleaned it regularly...</li>
            <li>I am able to go over these areas and not get the usual blood letting that a razor causes.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave in the shower and only breaks when I drop it ;-)</li>
            <li>Holds the charge for many shaves and has a small plug in adapter that fits in any plug.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised at the close shave it gave!</li>
            <li>also this takes up no counter space at all the charger is a small maybe 1 1/2 inch square that the trimmer itself just sits on top of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned so far!</li>
            <li>When it does reach the end of its life, I will not hesitate to buy the exact same model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave this to my daughter as a first razor and it works as intended and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Has a charger so no more batteries, even better #</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 4 years and then finally died.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product like I did!</li>
            <li>The replacement charger costs more than the shaver cost and also not sure that is the problem.....</li>
            <li>It actually shaves pretty close considering it&#x27;s electric.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased my second of this model after the first wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after years of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store in the little fabric pouch that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this razor and I am actually going to buy one for a friend of mine who has tried most methods of bikini hair removal with little success.</li>
            <li>If using it dry, make sure the skin is really, really dry - not damp.</li>
            <li>She is a busy college student and says that she loves that she can use this shaver dry and for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>If you do it dry, make sure you are really really dry...</li>
            <li>Overall, it did a very smooth job down there--</li>
            <li>Other than that, if you read the manual, follow the instructions, keep it clean and charge it timely, you&#x27;re doing everything on your side to maintain the product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, if you read the manual, follow the instructions, keep it clean and charge it timely, you&#x27;re doing everything on your side to maintain the product.</li>
            <li>It is sharp and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li>The first one died, but the second one has been going strong for a few months now.  </li>
            <li>will be buying more when my other two girls gets old enough to shave !</li>
            <li>I first rinse the blades in the sharp stream, then I dunk the blade only in the cup full of soap water and swish it around, and then rinse both the head and the blades.</li>
            <li>I must say, the Panasonic new does not sufficiently surpass the Remington old in terms of shave closeness.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is completely removable they may make new blades to replace</li>
            <li>I buy a new one about every three years after I drop the old one and tear the foil up.</li>
            <li>My skin is not super smooth, so I would always have razor rash (ouch).  </li>
            <li>I heard an odd buzzing sound from our front-loading washer one afternoon.</li>
            <li>I thought I would get this shaver from Panasonic because the previous model was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>He uses it as an everyday easy shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and not able to shave my legs with razor any more.  </li>
            <li>After I first charged it I shaved for maybe a total of 30 minutes so far</li>
            <li>The charger is small and much more convenient than the old rechargeable shaver I had before.</li>
            <li>I shaves very close and is exactly every thing that I expected out of a shaver.</li>
            <li>It performs exactly the same as my old razor (that took a nose dive from the shower shelf and broke)</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Amazon a few years ago and it&#x27;s still running strong.  </li>
            <li>Even the trimmer, which normally hurts more than the blades on other electrics if you&#x27;re not careful enough with it, doesn&#x27;t pinch, pull, or even scrape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all these many years, I finally broke down and got an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This is teh second wet dry eletric I have own (the first one was a different brand)</li>
            <li>so I bought this one based on numerous positive reviews on Amazon and on QVC.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charged it over 24hrs for the first time and the red light never went off or turned green.</li>
            <li>Do a final shave with the razor and then use the electric shaver gently for a few days in a row before you tackle any major stubble; it should feel a lot better.</li>
            <li>... I pretty much settled for only shaving once or twice a week and only wears tank tops and swimsuits based off when I could shave.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a true blade, but closer than other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li>Have used this product more than once thru the years, this is the first one that blades only stayed sharp about 2 months and it won&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  </li>
            <li>I like how this shaves better dry than wet</li>
            <li>I like being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re either completely dry or completely wet when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you are either completely wet or completely dry.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, wet or dry</li>
            <li>results!make sure you use it on completely dry skin or extremely wet skin, otherwise you can get cuts.</li>
            <li>I have only used it dry but always get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>So make sure your skin is either totally wet or totally dry.</li>
            <li>Better dry than wet, I think.</li>
            <li>Had the previous same  issue for many years.</li>
            <li>What can I say, she loves it having clippers and shaver in one - and wither wet or dry (mostly used in the shower).  </li>
            <li>Now, I can do a quick 1 minute shave in the mornings after my shower if I need to and wear whatever I want, especially since it&#x27;s getting warmer outside.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to someone starting out or someone who is looking for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>LIghtweight really close shave, and pretty dusty rose pink.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use the stiff bristles on the foil since foils are easily torn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used electric in the past, but back then no matter how much money I threw at it, I always had issues with stubble and hair catching (I have very thick and coarse stands which can be hell on any kind of blade...</li>
            <li>Other reviewers complained about it catching and pulling the hair quite a bit which I noticed as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, performs decently as I was not expected a close shave, and it&#x27;s rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine, sparse leg hair; nothing heavy duty.)  </li>
            <li>The instructions say it can be used wet or dry, but I recommend wet with a good shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I received the new Panasonic, It had a larger curved head and much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor because I am a woman of a certain age,and unfortunately,with the aging comes the facial hair.</li>
            <li>I liked my old one better where you could switch them out, less complicated.</li>
            <li>It shaves well with a little stubble its pain free and does the job well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always shave as closely as I would like, but it&#x27;s super-easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and is very simple to clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it wet yet but love using it dry!  </li>
            <li>Women have a need for shaving too, in fact, they likely shave more area than men, and yet there is so little attention paid to the quality of their electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>A little better than a standard razor</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m usually the one to ignore the most extreme best or worst reviews, reasoning that some people love a brand no matter what you put in front of them</li>
            <li>Oddly, I was using the original one and thought I should get a backup for when it eventually dies and</li>
            <li>Now if I can keep the other household member from trying to sneak a quick shave</li>
            <li>I even feel comfortable enough to use this razor to go to the gym, but then again, I really don&#x27;t care if a little stubble is on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy with its buzzing sound but not enough to really bother me.</li>
            <li>I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than other shavers, not bulky, easy to hold, handle, and</li>
            <li>When I need a quick shave when wearing shorts, I&#x27;d normally do it in the sink and make a mess.  </li>
            <li>Over the last 10 months the pop up trimmer blades have become so dull that they no longer remove hair effectively.</li>
            <li>The protective plastic cover on top of the shaver had a short hair plainly on the inside &amp; stubble near the blades!</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s were NOT too happy about having to take cold showers.</li>
            <li>But, there is one thing that isn&#x27;t clear in the description that might be helpful to know: the charger plugs into the socket, rather than sitting on the countertop (and plugging in with a cord).</li>
            <li>I get clear, wiry whiskers on my chin that are like 100 pound test fishing line.</li>
            <li>This unit is clearly heavier, thicker which makes maneuvering around your knees a bit tricky.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are nearly the same price as the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li>Always a bit hesitant to write a review after only using a product three or four times, but the shaver works well on underarms and legs so far and is much quieter than the Remington that it is replacing.</li>
            <li>Not a perfect shave, but great for a pre teen.</li>
            <li>I am uploading pictures so that people can clearly see what they market.</li>
            <li>and it keeps the counter clear.</li>
            <li>Found I do prefer to use it with pre shave oil for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive legs</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s to the point when I can&#x27;t finish ONE LEG without it completely dying.</li>
            <li>I am about to turn 40 years old and I have been dealing with ingrown issues on my armpits all my life.</li>
            <li>No trouble since then.</li>
            <li>and when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>It does a relatively close shave, especially as far as electric shavers go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is nothing like a real shave w/a razor, and know i know why.. depating on sending this back, but at $19.95 i may just keep it for &#x27;emergency&#x27; purposes on the run.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t always have time for that long hot shower.</li>
            <li>I love this sucker -</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m wondering if I should have let it run completely out of juice before re-charging?  </li>
            <li>As far as I know, she likes it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use a blade on my legs, so I have always used an electric.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I can recommend this without reservation.</li>
            <li>A few relevant facts</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect razor-close shaves, but the Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves Shaver was darn near razor-close.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has completely resolved that dilemma.</li>
            <li>Fast and simple.</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver to replace about a 5 year old Conair Electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Then, it shaves so close, almost nearly like a razor.  </li>
            <li>even a year old and</li>
            <li>I find that these razors last much longer this way.</li>
            <li>An electric razor will never give you a shave as close as a regular razor but so much easier.</li>
            <li>Fast with no burns or bumps or stubble left.</li>
            <li>This one so far is way ahead.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for my daughter because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li>I surprised my grand-daughter with this shaver for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year now and replaced the blades/foil once so far.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a complete klutz and have dropped it once or twice with no issues)</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking it, although you do not get a shave nearly as close as with a blade.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how well it removes leg hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve done a lot with this razor since my old one</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old girl.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS MUCH SAFER THEN A REGULAR SHAVER.</li>
            <li>so it can be a pain to find products that work for me but don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No cord for charging, it has a plug for the razor that plugs directly into socket.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old electric razor this one is heaven.  </li>
            <li>now I have an infected gash.&lt;br /&gt;I would not get hurt any more than this with a blade razor, and at least I would get a close shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, this has worked well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was  pleasantly surprised with the results from this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Surprised by how well it has performed.</li>
            <li>After 12 hours of charging I took it out, only to discover that it did absolutely NOTHING when I put the power switch on.</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes I&#x27;ve got smooth legs and don&#x27;t feel like chewbacca when I go to my OB appointments.</li>
            <li>Seven months and two weeks after I bought it, it died completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that the price is so reasonable is also a definite bonus, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for an old women it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;i like the fact that they give parts ordering info leaflet also..</li>
            <li>Some razors I have tried in the past do not do well with more than a day&#x27;s worth of hair growth but this one cuts the long and short hairs with ease and no pulling.  </li>
            <li>I dug out my daughters old charger, but that did nothing either.</li>
            <li>no need so far</li>
            <li>and I have completely given up on using it under my arms because it shaves NOTHING.</li>
            <li>She had no trouble at all using it</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both used it several times and got really discouraged: this thing doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I just checked, and the battery is under warranty, but what a pain to mail in a $20 piece of equipment and prepay for shipping to have it fixed.</li>
            <li>and so far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Got this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>The old one lasted about 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>Or you can always go old school and use some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>So far, the charge is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>My old one (emphasis on old) would often pull or snag on the hair</li>
            <li>I havent heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for my 11 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The last three Remingtons had  only lasted about a year each and Remington replaced them free of charge until the last one.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave my legs as close as I&#x27;d like, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I assumed that because it had the Remington name, it would work as well as my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>THIS ONE WORKS LIKE MY OLD SHAVER.  </li>
            <li>It is so very close to the same shave I get with my manual razor that I don&#x27;t mind using it instead</li>
            <li>Like the product so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it works for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather sleep than get up earlier to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the recharging stand  </li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li>A woman&#x27;s needs vacillate as much as the wind does and I am, with pleasure, no different.  </li>
            <li>I miss the old shavers that you just plug in and they continue to work for years and years.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a birthday gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it works really well until it dies.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use a razor.</li>
            <li>I have always had problems with my legs because they are way to sensitive and they hurt to shave,wax,pluck.</li>
            <li>and she has been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s done as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>It makes loud noise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as loud as the man shavers.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving my legs the old fashion way for years.  </li>
            <li>shave nowhere near as often as people would like me to--</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Panasonic Ladies shaver that I had for 30 years before it broke.  </li>
            <li>The charger sits directly against the electrical wall plug and every time I put the shaver on the charger it pops out.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how close a shave</li>
            <li>Got this to replace and old remington that died.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>then my old one and</li>
            <li>This shaver is so much gentler than a regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>With a regualr razor I used to get cut quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>I used it one time, I had it charging the whole time after that, and, when I went to use it the second time, it did not turn on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that becomes irritated and gets ingrown hairs (yuck) whenever I use shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for a young lady in my home.</li>
            <li>It works well for at least 6 to 9 months on my legs - maybe more.  </li>
            <li>Threw away my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at the performance.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I had tried an electric razor several years ago and was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I have had my old Remington electric shaver for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Like the razor/trimmer itself, but seriousl dislike the charger - IT MUST PLUG DIRECTLY TO A WALL.  </li>
            <li>I was terrified for my 11 year old to use a razor, so I bought her this</li>
            <li>When my old razor broke, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my 11 year old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer blades aren&#x27;t as scratchy as my old razor.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>had this issue with my old shaver when I used it under the arms, but this one cuts close</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beside, it makes my legs look even smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work really well for her, especially since she can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>And it will help me get a closer shave but not remove my completely.</li>
            <li>I bought this April 2013, so it is just 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin is so sensitive, that no matter what brand of razor or product used, she breaks out in a rash.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my old one died.</li>
            <li>Much easier and faster than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter to shave with so that she does not have to deal with a razor that might cut her.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it, just realize that you&#x27;re getting an electric razor and they can only do so much.</li>
            <li>like with my old razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Small enough to store, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require frequent charging and doesn&#x27;t snag your skin or pull as it is shaving.</li>
            <li>Not as loud as my old shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried it on my dog, a Lhasa Apso, but it didn&#x27;t work - need a tougher clipper for that.&lt;br /&gt;For about $20 I can buy one a year if necessary and still not pay as much as it would cost for a presumably high-end shaver.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Got this as a starter shaver for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li>Does not give a close shave, but works well enough for a quickie shave in between shaving with a real brazor.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and no problems thus far</li>
            <li>But wow.  </li>
            <li>No issues thus far.</li>
            <li>I can only say that I really like it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those women in their 40s who have those wild hormones.</li>
            <li>I had this shaver since I was 16 or 17 years old.</li>
            <li>The charger plugs directly into an outlet.  </li>
            <li>, I might never go back to my straight razor.</li>
            <li>a must have for busy young women { mothers</li>
            <li>Overall it works to my needs and it very convenient.</li>
            <li>and no complains so far.</li>
            <li>The close shave does come very close to an actual razor but at the pain of plucking or waxing.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like</li>
            <li>Plus, I really like getting to shave outside of the shower.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife to replace a 20 year old corded one.</li>
            <li>After about 9 months I frequently need to shake this one to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li>and it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>So much easier than trying to balance in the shower and shave at the same time.</li>
            <li>I will be surprised if I even use my razor on my legs in the shower again for the rest of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect anywhere near to a close shave.</li>
            <li>Definitely not as close a shave as a razor, even from the very beginning.</li>
            <li>I have never had overly sensitive skin and this hurt.</li>
            <li>nowhere near a razor-close shave, though it&#x27;s never cut myself with this one.  </li>
            <li>shaves so far before charging.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had a problem with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old fashioned lady shavers from the 1970&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>wish i had not wasted my money</li>
            <li>Does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; or nick and gives a closer shave, unlike my old electric one.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver gives a close shave, so far, non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.  </li>
            <li>This works very well and is quiet.  </li>
            <li>As far as problems plugging it into a wall socket, just use an extension cord.  </li>
            <li>When it came to shaving it seems like it does not get the hair completely.</li>
            <li>I have to wake up early for work</li>
            <li>Replaced an old electric shaver that I had for years.</li>
            <li>Definitely pleasantly surprised by this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>She has commented on how much she loves it several times.</li>
            <li>time, I let the shaver go completely out before I charged it.</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic because I thought that the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how it holds a charge.</li>
            <li>It is SO much easier and quicker than traditional shaving and just all around BETTER.&lt;br</li>
            <li>**completely</li>
            <li>I normally do not care for this kind of shaver but needed something due to having back surgery.</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin i give it 5 stars</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin and want something inexpensive this is the one.</li>
            <li>thought that if it worked on a women&#x27;s legs and sensitive &#x27;bikini&#x27; area, that it would work on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for the money I paid.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer than my old shaver did, and that one probably cost over $50.</li>
            <li>Since this was a recent purchase I&#x27;ve not had a chance to use it much (the reason for only 4 stars), but so far I am very</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter because I did not want her using a reg razor.</li>
            <li>no messy looking tangled cord).</li>
            <li>My old electric shaver cut my skin this ones does not.</li>
            <li>I completely understand why.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money... bought two as gifts</li>
            <li>and this razor would not  even rid me of my nearly transparent arm hairs, let alone my 3 underarm hairs, or anything below that.</li>
            <li>just pinches and pulls on longer soft hair..</li>
            <li>it has never given me a problem so far.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t completely close,like getting a wax but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I used to use my husbands old Norelco</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to buy this than get replacement blades for my old shaver.</li>
            <li>like I had to with my old one.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, I am liking this razor...</li>
            <li>(I feel so old saying that).  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Some people complained that you had to go over an area more than once.  </li>
            <li>charger doesn&#x27;t have a cord and plugs directly into the outlet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old razor that broke )-:  </li>
            <li>Charger is convenient and the razor holds a charge for a complete leg shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend for a young lady beginning to shave</li>
            <li>and my skin is incredibly sensitive</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I leave it on the charger 24/7 except when I&#x27;m using it, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the battery holding a charge.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 10 year old and I ended up using it also.</li>
            <li>And wow.....</li>
            <li>The price was very affordable and I would recommend it for women who don&#x27;t require a daily shave.</li>
            <li>I am very tempted to buy another to have for the future since companies are always changing models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far they have held up well as far as recharging goes</li>
            <li>Pulls hair too much, even with initial use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it so far.  </li>
            <li>My old one cracked to which is why I purchased this.</li>
            <li>So far used this twice</li>
            <li>But it was definitely worth the $$ spent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be charging it up anyway just to be safe for my next shave in a few</li>
            <li>its kind of weird having my razor standing straight up from my outlet</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would last more than a few years.</li>
            <li>But I really like the shaver works well, worth the trouble of a reorder.</li>
            <li>Well, if this is the best, I&#x27;d hate to see what all the others are like.</li>
            <li>, if you have sensitive skin, make sure you shave slowly with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I should be glad the Remington quit holding a charge and forced me to buy something to replace it.  </li>
            <li>and I was tired of waiting for it to warm up before I could even start trimming hairs.</li>
            <li>It is a good shaver,but not perfect for arms.</li>
            <li>I was contemplating which model to get but then decided to give the least expensive one a try since it had gotten so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I must have tried at least 10 different electric razors, including some that were designed for the guys...and this one is the best HANDS DOWN!!!</li>
            <li>Only minor down thing has been catching or pulling on stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase for such a small amount of money!</li>
            <li>I had been hesitant to get a new electric razor - even though my old one (also panasonic) was on the fritz after about 8yrs of semi-regular use - because my first one never really got that close a shave</li>
            <li>No need for lotions or shaving creams or having to clean up the mess</li>
            <li>I did have some slight discomfort after the first use or so, but I think I was applying too much pressure, because with my old razor I had to, in order to get results.</li>
            <li>But sometimes it leaves a red mark on my right arm at the same spot.  </li>
            <li>This razor works so that no hair is visible, but it does not give as close a shave as an actual razor (that should be obvious right).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life: Even though it said that it needs to be charged for 12 hours before the first use and between every use, I used it right out of the box to test it out on a small patch.</li>
            <li>I come right back and wonder why I left.</li>
            <li>with this razor that was the easiest hair removal ever, I only use it dry before I&#x27;m about to shower, and it worked perfectly on my full legs, fore arms, armpit and bikini area.</li>
            <li>also suffer from eczema and very sensitive skin; four days after my first shave with this device, my legs didn&#x27;t feel nearly as itchy or dry as they normally do after shaving with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>The Close shave and no little bumps.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of this wet/dry razor for a lazy girl like me!</li>
            <li>I decided to wait 24 hours just to make sure I&#x27;m not getting any reaction, and charged it in the mean time.</li>
            <li>if you PRIME what i Mean :)</li>
            <li>OK, I have one small problem, my box arrived with hair already on the inside of the box!</li>
            <li>I was willing to put up with that, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li>My thighs will get painful shaving burn with a normal razor, and this is the perfect solution, and I can do it dry without problems!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to charge using the small plug/dock.</li>
            <li>This might sound weird, but because of this shaver, I am now excited when it is time to shave.</li>
            <li>You may have to go over the same spot many times, and I found that getting a clean shave with this product often meant tolerating razor burn and a tedious process.</li>
            <li>Bought this when I was VERY pregnant and not able to see my toes.</li>
            <li>I used it dry for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver because I&#x27;ve spent years with my leg in the bathroom sink trying to balance on the other leg and shave.</li>
            <li>The changer unit is small and easy to use with the razor attached.  </li>
            <li>As an extremely hairy lady also gifted with pale and sensitive skin I have spent a significant amount of my life worrying about hair removal.</li>
            <li>but this left me pretty smooth and no real lasting itching, just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little brush that is included to clean the blades with.</li>
            <li>She uses it with a little body soap, can manage it herself and can clean it herself as well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and maneuver when shaver is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>so uh.. stick to your legs and other flat surfaces and you should be fine....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This got the job done, though it did start to drag toward the last part of the session even though I stopped frequently to clean &#x27;er out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think you will like it, especially if you are an older adult.</li>
            <li>Bought this particular product because my old shaver was the same brand.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought it was dead, so I attempted to charge it by plugging it into the wall</li>
            <li>It caused me extreme anxiety, so I would rarely ever shave, and could not wear shorts or dresses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking high and low to find a shaver that combines 1)a close shave 2) ease of use 3) safety in highly sensitive areas -</li>
            <li>I guess the only con now is that since it&#x27;s a shaver, I&#x27;ll have to shave every 2-3 days, because the hair grows back very fast.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old one was - getting a new one makes my legs as smooth as shaving it with a razor.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and actually didn&#x27;t shave my legs for several years because the red bumps, stinging, and itching weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to wet shave when I&#x27;m getting very good results shaving it dry</li>
            <li>For years she always uses a razor but after convincing her to try this shaver that can be used wet or dry, she hasn&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li>-- I can get a VERY close shave on my legs - almost as if i shaved for real (maybe 1 day of growth?) - in about half the time it took me with my old razor.</li>
            <li>, I am not an especially &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; person to begin with, but, I think this makes it even more difficult to shave those fine hairs rather than coarse</li>
            <li>It definitely works better dry than wet though it does specify that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I went back to regular razors they worked better and less often.</li>
            <li>I have only tried this dry, but assume the wet use will be even better.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave- waste of money</li>
            <li>I like it better than my previous more expensive brand of rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done if you&#x27;re willing to go over your shaving areas a few times and thoroughly clean the blades and take it apart to do that especially, while you&#x27;re in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li>Shaving my legs with a regular razor has become detrimental and never fails to leave several nicks and bleeding.</li>
            <li>so I prefer to shave dry, but the shaver seemed to do fine on wet skin the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li>Overall: Decent product.</li>
            <li>No complaints, except that my hair grows back - I hate shaving, and this razor makes it a pleasurable and quick experience, with great results.</li>
            <li>I have tried the more expensive dual head shavers and I don&#x27;t feel that they get any closer of a shave than this one; and this one is much quieter!</li>
            <li>and you can get several shaves of decent length before having to recharge it.</li>
            <li>razor battery lasted me less than a year before it would just drain quickly after being charged.</li>
            <li>Decent razor, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing is as close as a razor, but this does a decent enough job in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I always used a typical razor I decided to get this because I needed something I could use quickly while on vacation</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and the battery is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first lasting about 3 years before it died.</li>
            <li>I only use it for my underarms, but I like it better than my shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s never going to provide the exact same shave as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>bought as a replacement for my daughter who stole my first one (was a replacement for another brand 6-8 years ago) when she went to college three years ago which then husband bought my second one, so this is the third one,</li>
            <li>As with previous comments and reviews I have read I would recommend not moving the razor to quickly to avoid your skin catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had and the first was about 20 years ago..</li>
            <li>I replaced a different brand with this shaver because the older electric shaver fell apart.  </li>
            <li>I have thick dark hair and fair skin</li>
            <li>I tried a cheap wet/dry from a big box store which helped cut down on my buying of disposables.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a higher standard for shaving her legs than with other shavers</li>
            <li>This one is very good and much less expensive than the mens model.</li>
            <li>I received a new shaver not long after.  </li>
            <li>Buy this shaver for my wife, because with normal razors was much irritated skin, after reading several reviews and see that most reviews spoke highly of this model, I decided to buy it and try it, I can say that the finish is almost Similar to manual razors, without the annoying irritation, lasts about 20 minutes running, which has reached me to shave all my wife&#x27;s body: legs, underarms, vagina, and also is easy to wash</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and for only $20 plus shipping!!!</li>
            <li>and I can only shave using the high level</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my old Remington for around ten years and is tried many times to replace it with a few recent model, but everything is tried has been returned or thrown away after one shave.</li>
            <li>reviews, Good Housekeeping, and product claims seemed to tout it as a best-in-class razor for a gentle shave, close as possible with as near zero chance of cutting oneself as presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver wet or dry.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and silky after each shave either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>comfortably and can be used dry and wet</li>
            <li>I figured I would try a cheap wet dry razor.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to do everyday that it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to me</li>
            <li>Following other reviews on Amazon, I always do a dry shave and make sure that it&#x27;s fully charged to prevent tugging at hairs.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: a pretty decent little shaver.</li>
            <li>Again, a huge waste of time!</li>
            <li>If it really lasts as long as the manufacture says.</li>
            <li>have had now for nearly a month.slight crack in one side, barely noticeable, but not affect how it works.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a gift from my hubby mid winter, after letting my natural beauty grow far too wild.  </li>
            <li>Not good for bikini area at all, does okay for legs.</li>
            <li>Very reliable and keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is not a good as I hoped but better than the alternative.</li>
            <li>I can get a smooth shave in a few minutes!</li>
            <li>charges quickly,keeps a charge,and is comfortable in my small hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shaver holds charge for a long time and it shaves really well.  </li>
            <li>The case that comes with it is too small to fit both the shaver and the charger.</li>
            <li>The case that comes with it is too small to fit both the shaver and the charger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I didn&#x27;t find any other suitable options for a starter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dream around the bikini line--so much easier and cheaper than waxing, and (as long as you exfoliate afterward)</li>
            <li>I actually have gone back to the old shaving cream and razor because this did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small to fit shaver and battery</li>
            <li>Works really well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>and she has fine soft blond hair with hardly any ingrowns.</li>
            <li>, this really does the trick to get all that long hair off the legs.</li>
            <li>It is light years ahead of razor blade shaving, but I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>But really, how long does it take to shave your underarms..</li>
            <li>I normally use handheld eyebrow trimmers from beauty supply stores to trim facial, underarm and bikini hair.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it higher except that I haven&#x27;t tried it wet.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product like this and got exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I generally used it on my bikini area and if you&#x27;re careful, it can actually be used for a full brazillian</li>
            <li>This is not a fault of the product of course, rather this is pretty much to be expected.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected from a foil razor.</li>
            <li>Now there is no dark spots anymore.</li>
            <li>The shave is good enough, not great, takes multiple passes but does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Now it dies within about 5 minutes after a full charge ( it takes me about a minute to do under my arms, and a few minutes for each leg).</li>
            <li>I can feel and see more stubble than my old (OLD) Remington wet/dry shaver used to leave behind.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve said ouch a few times, but it&#x27;s not really painful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving the country is a few months and will need a shaver that works on 220v, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a new one right now.</li>
            <li>It shaves okay in certain places, such as my legs, but I have to go over an area a few times to shave it all the way down.</li>
            <li>About ten years ago I finally upgraded to a Venus which was mediocre, then a Schick several years later [which I still love], but then after stealing my brother&#x27;s beard trimmer I realized that electric razors are WAY better.</li>
            <li>While this may not shave as close as a regular razor, in my opinion, it&#x27;s certainly close enough!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was remarkably easy to use, and the pop-up attachment for longer hair makes getting hard to reach areas a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have coarse dark hair and found that the shaver works much better on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t go with an electric shaver because I have such thick, course hair and all other ones I&#x27;ve tried did not do a good enough job.</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers have weak motors, don&#x27;t shave closely, require far too many pass overs of one area, or are simply so frustrating that I throw them away and return to my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Works very well - too new to evaluate the charging complaints found in other comments.  </li>
            <li>There is a pop up feature that allows you to shave longer hair and then just push it back down to get a clean shave to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge really well, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and has a trimmer feature for that hair you haven&#x27;t kept up with and got a bit too long!</li>
            <li>But instead of throwing it out right away, I let it sit for a while (not in the charging stand) and both times, 24-48 hours later, when I tried the power switch it magically turned back on like it was never ever mad at me in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and as well the new product which I recently order</li>
            <li>I have only used the new one a couple of times, and this week after charging it overnight, I turned it on and again, nothing.  </li>
            <li>So sometimes, I simply get a new razor.</li>
            <li>purchased for my teen new to shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After owning it for 6 months the battery only let me shave one leg before needing a new charge.</li>
            <li>A new foil is only $9.95.</li>
            <li>Although it has a 2 year warranty, I would have to ship it to California or New York for service, since those are the only two places that have service centers for this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Had another brand that was constantly needing new screens and foils.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very long time and it shaves really well.</li>
            <li>Been busy with other things in life, but felt I needed to post a positive about this shaver.</li>
            <li>For the unforseeable future, I cannot use disposable razors (too great a risk of cutting self and bleeding).</li>
            <li>However, during dry shaving, if I go to fast my skin catches in the razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver does not work very well when you use it dry.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave for an electric and so far the battery lasts longer than expected between charges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the dry option doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I use it dry and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is my second one - used the first until battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore (quite a long time).</li>
            <li>So worth trying for less than $20.</li>
            <li>The shave lasts much longer than regular razor shaving, and without the hazard of potential nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>The only drawback with this shaver is that it has no cord - you plug the recharger directly into the socket and the shaver directly into the recharger.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because after several years of use, my last razor (another brand) broke and this seemed reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>If your hair is long enough to be cut by the clippers, you need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razor shaving made my skin really sore and irritating but using this shaver leavers my skin smooth and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>This allows me to at least get rid of visible hair until I can get back to do a better job with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product worked very well when it actually did, I just can&#x27;t get over the battery/outer frame issues enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does cut things pretty close -- closer than I would have chosen, but it keeps the hair long enough that ingrowns aren&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s razors for as long as I remember because I like getting a close shave but didn&#x27;t realize that it was possible to get a pretty close shave with an electric razor with none of the razor burn and pain and ingrowns.</li>
            <li>This is my second Panasonic as I lost my first one after long use.  </li>
            <li>I think that if you need something that will leave your legs really smoothe you might need to get a more expensive product.  </li>
            <li>These reviews have helped me so many times that I am really finding it difficult to buy things in the store without someone telling me about it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that prevents me from using a regular razor on the bikini and underarm areas.  </li>
            <li>No issues, made by a major manufacturer, and seems to be well made.  </li>
            <li>My longest lasting razor thus far!</li>
            <li>Major letdown and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this on my face, which may make me a little pickier than if I were using this on my legs, but still, all the other razors I&#x27;ve owned were better than this.</li>
            <li>shaving my legs was a major annoyance.  </li>
            <li>Dont know how it would have worked if I had not used that other shaver first though.  </li>
            <li>Barely works!</li>
            <li>Charges well and can get plenty of time to shave all major areas without battery dying out.  </li>
            <li>not extremely close shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 joyous weeks-no scratchy stubble if I take an extra minute or two, zero ouches or burns, and it gets my bumpy underarms completely!</li>
            <li>Finally something that works to shave legs arms etc for my 12 year old!  </li>
            <li>I was able to quickly shave both my legs while sitting down, using the dry setting -- it cut my shaving time at least in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud, so if you&#x27;re looking for a super quiet trimmer, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>Usually not painful unless I was being quick and careless</li>
            <li>first dry exfoliate then shower with aveeno shower oil,dry off then dust over with baby powder that seems to give me an extra close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product dry, and it gives a VERY close shave!</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t run out of power half way through a shave (presently it is only powered by wall charge and a full re-charge</li>
            <li>I am sad to report that the basic Schick double blades were more powerful than this shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver doesn&#x27;t leave stubble behind - very smooth results.</li>
            <li>But enough to do some little clean</li>
            <li>I use the adjustable extending single blade only and it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>4 FL OZ, Super Size.]], which puts back the moisture and calms down the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would agree with those that said this isn&#x27;t ideal for the bikini area, it is a bit large to get into tight areas and it does tend to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hair when on the trim setting, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, the shave left my legs less smooth than they are 3 days after a shave with a traditional razor blade in the shower.  </li>
            <li>sure, wet and dry, but does almost nothing when wet.</li>
            <li>shaved with it, yes it left me partially smooth but left yucky black dots all over my legs like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>Even if it only lasts 6 months like the other reviewers said, I still think it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this shaver, I&#x27;m one of those individuals who cannot handle nickel and other metals, and the Close Curves shaver is one of the few I can use without getting a reaction.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one as the whole shaver cost less then replacing just the blades</li>
            <li>the other day.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was my first and only so far.</li>
            <li>When I use the shaver, every few minutes I have to stop and clean it, personally I don&#x27;t mind,</li>
            <li>and I had to make several passes over the same area in order to get a decent result.</li>
            <li>It is a quick shave on my legs and can be used either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>When I would get out of the shower, I would experience mild itching, especially on my arms and legs for about a half hour.</li>
            <li>After a year of light use the blades have become too dull to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to fit the shaver &amp; charger togather in it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shave smooth like it advertised, I had &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my legs and the blade seems dull.</li>
            <li>The charger is nice and small and takes up little space.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for an electric razor that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Blade got dull pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something I could use on the front of my shins and down by my Achilles tendon where I&#x27;m starting to have problems with nicks since my skin is getting thinner as I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is a little difficult but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I agree that you need to be sure that your skin is either wet or extremely dry when using it.</li>
            <li>Hair should be about 1/4&amp;#34; or it&#x27;s difficult to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it hasn&#x27;t been an absolutely amazing experience..</li>
            <li>old one went bad and replaced it with the same model and happy with it.</li>
            <li>The least comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>There is also a clipper feature, which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but I don&#x27;t generally use the clippers anyway.  </li>
            <li>Generally this shaver works well.  </li>
            <li>This shaver generally did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Have an indicator that tells you when it is charged, or at least just have the light go</li>
            <li>This razor does have the pop up feature, but it did seem like it has a tendency to pull the hairs, so I generally don&#x27;t use the pop-up feature.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I avoid the general nicks that I would get with a razor.</li>
            <li>Mind you, this one may not last as long, but unless it dies in a year I am very impressed!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to be hairy in the final stages, and at first I was using cheapo $10 electrics because honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between them and the note expensive ones I used in the past, plus at $10 a pop</li>
            <li>The charging time of 12 hours is a bit much, but it seems to last a long time between charging times.</li>
            <li>I tried this electric shaver on my legs and take about 10 times longer than it would take with a regular old shaver.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to work near as well as a regular razor.</li>
            <li>it caught and removed all the old lady poker hairs with only a couple trips across my chin/neck area.</li>
            <li>Please buy this product if you have sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle a regular shave.</li>
            <li>Over the years, she has developed a lot of facial hair on her cheeks, neck, and under her chin.</li>
            <li>The only possible negative is the charger-it&#x27;s just not the most convenient type for me.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m very cautious not to get it wet</li>
            <li>She has such sensitive skin that the dermatologist recommended getting an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Christmas shopping on the net kept me busy</li>
            <li>the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it plugs directly into the charger that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li>Know going in that it will not replace a bare razor and it will work for you.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shave as close as I had expected, but I used it again after a shower and got a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and it gets rid of the light blonde peach fuzz-like hair, which the Remington had trouble with.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I get severe razor burn from shaving my legs when wet, and I always thought it would be so much easier to find a way to &amp;#34;dry shave.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>that you can barely tell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well and absolutely no knicks whatsoever.</li>
            <li>works well, only issue is the light on the charger is always red and never turns green.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this shaver when my old purple Remington shaver went kaput.  </li>
            <li>I am still practicing and hope to get to where I won&#x27;t mind shaving, but I will admit I fall back to the old plastic shaver as I know what to expect.</li>
            <li>This replaced my old shaver because its battery gave up the ghost after several years.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife because her old Remington model finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>my needs are simple and this Panasonic ES2207P fills those needs completely.  </li>
            <li>Has a tendency to pull hairs at times even though it&#x27;s only a two weeks old.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin on the legs.</li>
            <li>This replaces one that was about ten years old.  </li>
            <li>Only design flaw thus far.  </li>
            <li>The battery, so far, holds its charge for several sessions.</li>
            <li>I sent it in to Panasonic for repairs nearly 2 months ago, but still haven&#x27;t heard anything back from them.</li>
            <li>waxed professionally once a month, back when I was in India.</li>
            <li>I had the same model and owned it for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very flexible,  nor am I very stable...</li>
            <li>I can barely get both legs below the knee done before it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li>Also, as expected, it doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave</li>
            <li>so far I have used it several times and it does not pull or cut my skin...</li>
            <li>but I had alot of irritation and a rash, so the next time I lathered up with sensitive shaving cream and had no rash or \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I hoped this would work for facial hair near chin</li>
            <li>Wish I could find my old Remington ladies personal trimmer again -</li>
            <li>no problems, does a decent job for dry shaving when you don&#x27;t have time to use a razer in the shower.</li>
            <li>My grandmother had given me an old one back in the 1990s that never did a thing, but I was hoping that maybe ladies electric razors had improved a bit since then.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this only once or twice so far</li>
            <li>Today, the razor barely cuts my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Although only used once so far, it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>If you have like 2-3 day old stubble on your legs and try to use this shaver, I don&#x27;t even think it works on hair that short.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so I don&#x27;t like having to pass the same area twice.  </li>
            <li>Had to finally replace my old rechargeable shaver and got this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far</li>
            <li>I recently replaced my old Remington with this Panasonic version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything--shaving with razors that cost a fortune, waxing, hair removal creams for sensitive areas--and everything has left my bikini line stinging, bumpy, even pimply no matter</li>
            <li>My buttons near the shaver head got stuck the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>And for 1/3 of the price of this Phillips Ladyshave Sensitive HP6366 that I bought from Walmart, that&#x27;s going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li>It stays charged much longer than I expected it would.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it three times to far, and the battery seems to be holding power well.</li>
            <li>Back to my old razor.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Left me feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I frequently forget to throw it on the charger, but it doesn&#x27;t hesitate to work just as well the next day.  </li>
            <li>NATURALLY IT DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A REGULAR RAZOR...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the close shave this gave, for such an inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li>the only reason that i even bought this was because her remington had just completely worn out.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy this model for myself in the near future.</li>
            <li>The airlines don&#x27;t like razor blades, apparently.  </li>
            <li>This razor cuts much closer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for a few years now and this one is pretty close to the old Remmington</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to watch with this shaver is that it does cut pretty close, so you have to be careful not to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>As long as you trim long hairs first, there is no pulling when you try to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to constantly shave like I did with my disappointed shavers, this Panasonic worked good the first time like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Not a great shave, but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>(but it did a good job even on his chicken</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but not great.</li>
            <li>: I would recommend this razor for ladies with light to medium thick body hair.</li>
            <li>: I would recommend this razor for ladies with light to medium thick body hair.</li>
            <li>I am one of those rare women who have to shave everyday just like a man.</li>
            <li>There are other areas that we are expected now to keep clean shaven, and I have yet to find a razor that does that job, on such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but at first i was just moving it up and down like i shaved my legs.</li>
            <li>no little red</li>
            <li>Product is adequate for shaving however it has failed in less than a year of very light</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold a charge, and even with brand new blades it grabbed the skin under my arms leaving red marks and left stubble on my legs.</li>
            <li>if you live outside USA or will be travel in future in europe dont plug it in electric source, it will be burnt immediately.</li>
            <li>As usual Amazon  shipped it right out, it was a day early.</li>
            <li>but it did not work very well nor last very long.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it dry but get a very close shave....</li>
            <li>I mean it glides smoothly on my skin while leaving my legs hairless.</li>
            <li>The ddirections do say to secure the shaver to the stand after use; but what they mean, but</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin, so regular razors or male shavers are not in the cards.  </li>
            <li>( You only have to clean it out every few minutes on first uses, or you have to do that after you have&#x27;t shaved in a few days.)</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t gotten a new razor in a long time and was nervous about ordering one on-line.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt matter if the hair is just 1 inch long or just newly growed haired</li>
            <li>I live in UK and didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that you plug the razor right directly into the charging plug so it has no long ugly cord laying around on my counter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why this one, with less blades and less movement, does such a better job...</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak for those with normal skin, or even just dry skin, but my skin does not like this shaver at all.</li>
            <li>I use it without the water (dry), hence my reason for wanting to use an electric razor instead of a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>After lots of research, this was one that could be used wet or dry, had a quick charger and that I could actually afford.</li>
            <li>Battery charge is not long enough to complete shaving needs as needed by customer.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for dry shaving mainly of my neck/hairline so don&#x27;t have a review for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super lazy when it comes to shaving</li>
            <li>I wanted to get an electric to shave my legs only now that I am older (62) and showering and shaving my legs is more difficult.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Braun it has a light that blinks red when battery is red and solid green when charged.</li>
            <li>Shaver is the right size and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a personal shaver for a long time and settled on a cheapy one that hardly worked (costing me about $8)</li>
            <li>I could not clean it the way I did when I used it wet, but when cleaning it with water, as recommended, I saw no hair again, nor were my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every ladies trimmer at my local walmart they all sucked compared to this i had to hunt it back down after old one i had i believe was destroyed by an old roomate, forget to shave your legs no problem this will get you out the door and save you an extra day or two, underarms no problem i wouldnt go for that too frequently tho as you will get irritation if you use it one your underarms too often, i only use the pop up trimmer for shaping my bikini area so i dont know to much about that</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said it wont be as close as a real shaver</li>
            <li>Works extremely well, and fast.  </li>
            <li>Mine stays charged much longer than other reviews stated.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re really set on an electric razor, buy one that either has a removable batteries, or a razor with a company other than Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>which I still use in case of needing to wear a bathing suit or other events, but, this keeps me from having to take the shower shave nearly as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li>I end up having to shave ever other day since my hair grows rather fast.</li>
            <li>I first used it dry and then cleaned it -- only to see no hair at all on the white paper towel as I brushed off the blade and tapped the foil on the paper.  </li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews on this razor I had high hopes, but was extremely disappointed after using it, both dry and in the shower with shave gel.  </li>
            <li>: Not a single issue.</li>
            <li>: Not a single issue.</li>
            <li>But since I liked it so much before it stopped working, I decided I&#x27;d try another to see if I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li>I have heard these are amazing but would love to know why mine didn&#x27;t work :&#x27;(</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the charger light never indicates that it is charged, even when it&#x27;s been charging for hours.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is ridiculous, I actually had to use an old tooth brush to get it clean.</li>
            <li>To dry off, I sort of shake both the parts vigorously so that the water falls out, put the top back on to protect the blade, and leave it to air dry for a few hours.</li>
            <li>To dry off, I sort of shake both the parts vigorously so that the water falls out, put the top back on to protect the blade, and leave it to air dry for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Future buyers beware, they clearly send back items people used &amp; returned (gross)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>battery lasts long, really shaves and softly, not like others pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>(only really got it wet when rinsing it)</li>
            <li>I happen to have extra sensitive skin and coarse hair that tends to become ingrown.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can only shave about once a week with traditional shavers.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on dry skin but barely works at all on wet skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and since I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure or go over the same spot several times to get a close shave</li>
            <li>big disadvantage is that the razor casing developed a crack shortly after I began using it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work very well on wet skin, as described in the description of the product.</li>
            <li>At that time I was trying to decide on a more expensive razor for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lady who is over 60 years old and when women start to age their tissue in the face some times start to produce testosterone (or so my doctor tells me) and when this happens you grow hair on your face--especially around the chin area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As long as you follow the instructions carefully, this device here should make shaving so much easier!</li>
            <li>think the idea of a stranger spreading things, putting warm wax there then ripping it off is horrifying, so I was seeking an alternative to get the area smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li>Does a decent job, but by no means as close as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Despite this, I found this product to be quit disappointing, especially after reading many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Also, go slowly, especially if your hair is longer, to avoid getting pulled on and to consistently trim the hairs down.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little puzzled as to getting a razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver a lot, but it does tend to pull just a little when I first start using it.</li>
            <li>After running it across my legs multiple times to barely remove any hair, I got fed up and threw it in the trash this morning!</li>
            <li>First a little background.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to charge it this first time on the little charger that came with it.....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a woman who shaves everyday, or every other day this will work fine.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to women who have sensitive skin, dark and coarse hair, or who simply want to try an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The pop-out cutter pulls slightly so is not used much; if there is a need to cut hair shorter (in less sensitive areas) a light partial blade shave &amp;#34;with&amp;#34; the grain usually gets it short enough; but can&#x27;t get longer growth.  </li>
            <li>I decided on this shaver after reading a few reviews, and I definitely made the right choice.</li>
            <li>I have extremely long, course, and dark leg hair and this just wipes that right out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first (and only) electric razor I had before this was this little purple Remmington that used batteries that I purchased from Dollar General.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d found this long ago, it works very well as a dry shaver -</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a wet / dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>a loyal Amazon customer for many years, I am thoroughly disappointed about the negligence on the seller &amp; marketplace&#x27;s part on this transaction.</li>
            <li>It hurts my skin and is not very user friendly, both with wet and dry functions.</li>
            <li>that of a porcupine.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very loud and embarrassing considering how long it takes going over the same area</li>
            <li>I really doubt there would be that much difference in performance, at least for me, between this one and the next step up</li>
            <li>This razor generally gets the job done in one pass, and when a second pass is needed, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>EXTREMELY well designed - fits your hand like a glove, and the head glides over even the most delicate parts of you.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>it gives a close enough shave where you can barely feel stubble.</li>
            <li>I bought the only one I could find, a Remington, &amp; it barely shaved at all &amp; tore up my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had the shaver long, but so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time a few hours ago and am still in pain-</li>
            <li>but could have been designed a bit better for using on curves of delicate areas and better at cutting longer hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty thorough about shaving and go over areas a few times to get the closeness that I like.</li>
            <li>The wet option does a much better job for me, but only when I use a thick shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll invest in a higher quality razor so that I don&#x27;t have to replace it every few months.</li>
            <li>Although it was not expensive, still a waste of money.</li>
            <li>This razor gives an OK shave (not great but not horrible), but it is uncomfortable on my skin -- pulls and scrapes.  </li>
            <li>(dry only) back in high school.</li>
            <li>On my bikini area I cant really say if it worked well or not, as I did use another product down there before but needed to bring in some reinforcement as I didnt get the close shave i wanted with that product.  </li>
            <li>but I put that down to moving the razor to fast over the area.</li>
            <li>The head is small enough to quickly wipe out unwanted facial hair as well.</li>
            <li>had an older version of this model, which I had to replace due to the battery</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far!  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t slow you down too much though, since you can just do some quick swipes and then switch to the foil.</li>
            <li>This razor work very well, shaves close but will never be equal to that of a conventional bladed razor.</li>
            <li>I would have thrown out my old shaver a long time ago!</li>
            <li>This razor works very well, however it is the 3rd razor I have purchased because the other brands only lasted 2 or 3 months and quit shaving.  </li>
            <li>the only plus over a hand shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t give you as much razor rash as a hand razor does, that is the only reason I still use it VERY CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li>I could not find this Panasonic in stores or any other brand that was highly rated.</li>
            <li>It worked slightly better if the skin was wet, but oil did no good.</li>
            <li>Or for periods of time when I just have been working too much and have less time to manage the legs.</li>
            <li>And the shave is much closer than the previous one too.</li>
            <li>I have used it dry so far</li>
            <li>Just ordered this wet/dry one to replace the old dry one I dropped in water and broke.  </li>
            <li>It took less than 7 days from ordering to arrival, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li>I got this for my young daughter who is too young to shave with a razor but was worried about teasing at school for her dark hairy legs.</li>
            <li>And so far the charge is long lasting!</li>
            <li>&gt; If you are curious, my armpits are actually quite normal.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Panasonic ES2207P - the first one lasted a few years until the battery stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>so my hair is thick and dark, and I LOVE his thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Small things like not being able to take care of basic hygiene issues are a little demoralizing.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product and thus far it has held up to every single one.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high hopes due to how coarse everything tends to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have horribly dry, sensitive skin, and I can finally shave my legs without pain.  </li>
            <li>I have used this razor on wet and dry legs and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it dry so far.  </li>
            <li>Works very well both wet n dry</li>
            <li>So far i have only used it dry</li>
            <li>I really like wet dry shavers, but this one died and the one before that in just one year.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the close curves wet and dry shaver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried it wet, but dry is just so much easier</li>
            <li>Have only used as dry shaver so far</li>
            <li>far I have only tried it dry</li>
            <li>If your legs are DRY when you dry shave, he quickly and efficiently mows down all the stubble in one pass.  </li>
            <li>If I pressed REALLY hard--hard enough to leave bruises--and went over every spot three or four times, I could finally get down to a day-old stubble.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly cuts down on my shaving with a razor time!</li>
            <li>So, I accessed support online, and spent 20-30 minutes talking to three different people, only to be told I would have to purchase a new charger.  </li>
            <li>It attaches right the the plugin to charge so you have no bulky base taking up space on the counter or long cords to get tangled which is really nice.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as a wet shaver, only as a dry one - but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Look I mainly got this because I wanted to use it for my naughty bits.  </li>
            <li>and there are certain areas that work with a blade, others that work with an electric shaver, and some that are not comfortable regardless of what you are using.  </li>
            <li>Nifty little shaver, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Finding this razor really lifted my spirits as I can now shave my legs, and with a little help, my armpits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and realized that maybe my other one may just need new parts.</li>
            <li>I am new to using an electric shaver, so I cannot compare this with any other shavers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go back to shaving because it takes so much time, wastes so much water in the shower, and inevitably I cut myself almost every time (typically around my ankles).</li>
            <li>It would be great if it also came with a base type charger and a better case for travel (comes with a very thin drawstring bag and small cleaning brush), but for 16 bucks, it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of shaving my legs because my skin is very dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of a spring action, so that you can, very gently, press it down on your skin, giving a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was a little skeptical, but so far this has been doing the job nicely.  </li>
            <li>she has a hard time using straight edge blades and her old electric shaver wore out.</li>
            <li>Though next time I will spend a little more and upgrade to the next one up because I have such thick course hair.</li>
            <li>Due to very sensitive skin I can&#x27;t use a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is hard to maintain a good grip on it when my hands are wet.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad one either, but after many years with this razor, I&#x27;m ready to upgrade.</li>
            <li>Too bad because I had a different Panasonic razor that I loved and never pulled my hairs.  </li>
            <li>only bad thing is it is kind of loud, but it is an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin when it comes to regular razors and get really bad razor burn, but honestly, I&#x27;d rather have razor burn than use this electric one.</li>

            <li> Did an excellent job and my legs feel very smooth.</li>

            <li> THIS one is so awesome - love it.  </li>
            <li> It works great, good battery life and no issues.</li>
            <li> I am soooo thrilled!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 4 in 1 Braun epilator/shaver which I really liked!</li>
            <li> It also has the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval and that means a great deal to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a great day! :)to get into the corners of the plastic inside.</li>
            <li> Have a great day! :)</li>
            <li> so glad that I did, this shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li> Not the best, but OK between shower shaves</li>
            <li> It shaves remarkably close for an electric razor and the charge holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent, works better than any one I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> SHE wanted one :) perfect gift for the ladies!</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it does a much better job than any of the others.  </li>
            <li> I gifted my sister with one just like it, she needs it cause she has to be on blood thinners, and this is a great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> very happy, find it does a better job using shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Before buying this, I tried a cheaper electric shaver to see if this route would be successful and it broke within two months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shaver, very impressed with results and</li>
            <li> Best cheap, electric shaver out there!  </li>
            <li> This is a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I thought this price was great and it recieved good reviews so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Good starter rechargeable razor for teens, also great for women who like an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> If it works for a year, it will be a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> what a pleasant surprise when I decided to try this one....</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to hear that She was so happy to have this</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say that this shaver works great on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> It really is easy to handle amd shaves perfectly.</li>
            <li> i wanted something TOO strong :D</li>
            <li> It was great when it worked but an item should work for more than 9 months!</li>
            <li> best electric razor I have ever had and great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> For the good points, it appears well made, is easy to hold, and does a very good job with no nicks or cuts!  </li>
            <li> beautiful to look at and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I took very good care of it, cleaned in between shaves, always put it away in a safe place,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get cuts like on a razor though on the bright side.</li>
            <li> What a great price for an amazing Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a good product for the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why a lady&#x27;s razor can&#x27;t be as good as a man&#x27;s razor, but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This one is as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is good product.</li>
            <li> Good shaver.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> and they gave the 2206 a good rating.  </li>
            <li> Shave is fairly close, probably as good as you can get with an electric.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> She likes it and was a good gift</li>
            <li> And best of all, it&#x27;s about 95% of razor smooth and</li>
            <li> She loved it -</li>
            <li> This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Of all the Ladies Shavers I had, this is the best one, gives a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it provides a good shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but it won&#x27;t replace my razor.</li>
            <li> so price wise -</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a good product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Great for travel too (like vacation, where you will never see those people again) kind of thing.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s this good and at this price.</li>
            <li> For the money, its seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> i have had good results</li>
            <li> it was a really good product</li>
            <li> Works good on legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li> Really Good Rechargeable Razor.</li>
            <li> The razor was a good price and it does the job without any problems.</li>
            <li> It is good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Shaves close, holds charge for a while, good price.  </li>
            <li> I loved the close shave.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find a good shaver in the stores and have to buy on line.</li>
            <li> This one works well on legs, not so good for underarms as it will bite.</li>
            <li> so I decided to ditch razors all together and get this instead after I saw it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Recommended was a good purchase</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product for the value.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> I loved my Remington until I bought this.  </li>
            <li> cause i think is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Very impressed, smooth shave considering it&#x27;s an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well and gives a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it seemed really good.</li>
            <li> you decide to buy this, good luck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all around a good item.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I&#x27;d say it is a good value.</li>
            <li> a THATS good.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an electric razor that shaves as good as a blade, I like the MACH III TURBO.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as good as a blade</li>
            <li> Good item and</li>
            <li> It does a good job with the armpit hair.  </li>
            <li> The battery is still good</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> She loves the fact that it can be used in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good price, good quality</li>
            <li> The razor was good in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a good wet/dry shaver...</li>
            <li> The shape was good for handling it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ES2216PC that gets a closer shave, but it does the job</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved the results I got from this, but the battery stopped holding a charge after fewer than six months.</li>
            <li> like the way it&#x27;s shaped ,fits good in your hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;stays clogged and hence cant do a good job at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> , just charge for a bit an you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.  </li>
            <li> It works good for trimming hair and keeping it neat.</li>
            <li> It holds charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Loved it until it died out.</li>
            <li> The price was fair</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> veeeerry good.</li>
            <li> Good product but would not recomend using it in the shower</li>
            <li> It does a fair job, just have to keep going over the areas, it doesn&#x27;t chafe or pull.</li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> This works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one for $20 since it had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> but it does a good job without irritation.</li>
            <li> Good to buy two and have both fully charged.</li>
            <li> good charge and works well</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a good brand for shavers.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as good as with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product it...</li>
            <li> I guess if you can afford to replace it every 3 months, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> It works good for an electric shaver but not as close as a blade razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it does the job fairly well.  </li>
            <li> It works great and it nice to not have to buy razors all the time.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, works well, great price</li>
            <li> I loved the pop up razor</li>
            <li> no issues and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> But will be good for travel.</li>
            <li> Item received as advertised in good time.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave and the trimmer is good also I take it in the shower it gives a close shave</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> it is good price, good</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a good product for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Good price and did the job-</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is almost as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> For being a $20 shaver, it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> It was also a surprisingly closer shave than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The shaver works good for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> It was as good as shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> Deliver was prompt and good.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps a nice charge.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> So I believe it&#x27;s a good idea to charge it between shaves.</li>
            <li> , however, I feel it&#x27;s a good feature to have in case</li>
            <li> I believe the design is good for both,</li>
            <li> The blade and the foil are replaceable, so that&#x27;s a good think.</li>
            <li> I believe the design is good for both,</li>
            <li> The blade and the foil are replaceable, so that&#x27;s a good think.</li>
            <li> She used it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> and it is good for legs but not underarms.</li>
            <li> Good for the bikini zone.</li>
            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> The good news?  </li>
            <li> all good.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a good razor</li>
            <li> I loved my remmington</li>
            <li> styling, fits good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good quality, doesn&#x27;t nick my legs</li>
            <li> I have been searching for over a year for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> the wife says it good for her legs ...  </li>
            <li> 2Stars...&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good for legs ,arms,and pits</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get, and a 2 year warranty for parts and labor.</li>
            <li> she loved it when she opened it and uses it with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good close shave on legs.</li>
            <li> It indeed did not irritate, so it fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a good shaver, works well all over.  </li>
            <li> Of course the Es2205 is still working, my daughter loved it too and took it to college, my wife whined for weeks when it was gone.....</li>
            <li> rips my hair out, hurts, i was hoping it would be good</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs was longer than I would like to admit and this did a really good job.</li>
            <li> Good price...</li>
            <li> The shaver holds its charge well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> (Michael Ham&#x27;s book on shaving is a good beginner&#x27;s resource).  </li>
            <li> Good product and uneventful service.</li>
            <li> * Surprisingly durable.  </li>
            <li> Either way, you&#x27;re going to be getting about 2 years of good shaves out of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This razor works really good.</li>
            <li> so if this is what you want, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> you name it ) and none has worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how good it did on a never before shaved leg.  </li>
            <li> All the good stuff.</li>
            <li> then I saw this one and read the reviews which are mostly good.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it does in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for 10 or so 3 minutes session.</li>
            <li> The price seemed like a good value and the ratings were good.  </li>

            <li> and it did good</li>
            <li> Even so, this product represents good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this shaver is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> Seems to be made of good quality but just doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> good in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Good for legs and underarms.  </li>

            <li> Ordered this shaver because it seemed the best option available.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it had a lot of good reviews</li>

            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good shaver.  </li>
            <li> This went on for 2 years until it stopped working for good</li>
            <li> It did its job fairly well.</li>
            <li> The price and quality is superior.  </li>
            <li> I use on my armpits, but not as good on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s shaped, you get a good gripe, no slips.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!...until it came time to charge it and it would not charge.</li>

            <li> Arrived promptly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> The item looks to be of good quality materials.  </li>

            <li> Fair warning...</li>
            <li> Good for hip/knee replacement/broken bones shaving of legs....</li>

            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a fair number of razors and never stuck with one.  </li>
            <li> Bummer because when it was working I loved the results.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic for men for years and really loved it.</li>
            <li> It will never be as good as a disposable</li>
            <li> problem is that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving my head</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> good value for money</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> if you can shave in that amount of time your good..</li>
            <li> It gives you the basics and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Does a good job in the bakini area.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and a good travel item.  </li>
            <li> Price is good too.</li>
            <li> Its too good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>

            <li> Does good job.</li>
            <li> you can get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> Good investment.  </li>
            <li> Works well and at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I get a good close shave on my legs and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> All the reviews said the item was good, but how will I ever know.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be so good for the price</li>
            <li> So I got this thing out of the box and it worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> This one is a good choice.</li>
            <li> This does a good job to *closely trim* without leaving razor burn ....</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> but if you want a good close shave guess you got to deal with that part.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> battery life is also good, I managed to do both legs up to my bikini line and both arms without running out of power.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good prodict for the price.</li>
            <li> A bit bulky but does a good job.</li>

            <li> This shaver hurts AND didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving either.</li>

            <li> Not a heavyweight or close shaver but perfect for quick whisks to keep my legs looking neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave for something at this price point is exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it works like a charm, and not only did it work wonderfully on my legs but also under my arms, so I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does a great job, very close shave.  </li>
            <li> but i kind of had to struggle a bit at first to find the best way to get a close shave on my nether regions, lol. .</li>
            <li> But it works great and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> How quick is that!!!</li>

            <li> This electric shaver gets me incredibly smooth skin (ALMOST as close as a razor!!)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother giving her the instructions I laid out here because after all, she did insult my favorite product of all time!</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my technique wasn&#x27;t the best (pulled some hair, missed some hair, etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, always wear a helmet when riding a bicycle!</li>
            <li> It did not shave any of my hair off, and I got more scratches than anything!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really glad I got this backup!</li>

            <li> I Love It!..</li>
            <li> and I love  it!  </li>
            <li> Great value &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li> easy to use and works great</li>
            <li> It works great and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> works great, easy to charge and hold while using</li>
            <li> This razor does exactly what I want it to do and is a great tool for a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> and this is the first electric shaver that I have been able to use on my underarms without any cuts or reactions!!!</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, Light and easy to use, Keeps good charge.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers, and I try to stay loyal to the brand since it&#x27;s a great value for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great shaver.....</li>
            <li> Works fine and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> if you have fine hair it doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
            <li> This shaver is very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> All I have to say now is that this razor was amazing while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Great price and function smooth.</li>
            <li> You have to use it to believe how great it is to shave  any  part  and see how smooth it is .</li>
            <li> The shaving blades are extremely smooth and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> Then I got this, and it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing ...</li>
            <li> It does a great job and is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> (Plus, this is a great, cheap shaver to try</li>
            <li> But it works great, giving me smooth legs without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Electric never gives as smooth a shave as a razor, but it&#x27;s a great touch-up tool.</li>
            <li> And I have never cut myself using this which is amazing.</li>
            <li> After months struggling with Remington&#x27;s Smooth and Silky, I am supremely happy with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> Under $20 is an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Razor worked great until it stopped charging after 6 months of light use.</li>
            <li> Great light weight electric razor.</li>
            <li> This really is great for both in shower and out of shower (i primarily use it out of the shower).</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver, but on a day I needed it the most, it did not work.  </li>
            <li> Liked the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I have to use this with water running in shower to keep my skin warm</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic, for another great product!</li>
            <li> I also like that there&#x27;s a nice compact place for it on my electrical outlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it kept catching my hair and not cutting/shaving it off..</li>
            <li> I use the razor on it&#x27;s own without any sort of cream or soap.</li>
            <li> Works ok but doesn&#x27;t do a good close shave.</li>
            <li> in all, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, I am very impresses with it.</li>
            <li> Delivers a nice close shave without irritation</li>
            <li> Nice electric shaver for women.</li>
            <li> Re-charges nicely.</li>
            <li> So this is perfect for those times, when you don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;Wax\\&quot; kind of closeness but don&#x27;t want to go around looking all beastly either.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to get my own</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;d be nice to have that option.  </li>
            <li> A cord would be nice but take up space</li>
            <li> Shaves nice.</li>
            <li> The design is nice.</li>
            <li> The fact that this device is water proof is also nice.</li>
            <li> Now that the box has been opened and the razor used by her, I can tell you it&#x27;s a nice razor.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way it worked</li>
            <li> She had a razor but would complain about it catching and not getting as close.  </li>
            <li> I used my husbands electric razor a couple of times and decided to get my own.</li>
            <li> you are an experienced electric razor user -- then this is one of the best models I&#x27;ve used at a surprisingly low price.  </li>
            <li> I am kind of scared to bring it in the shower though.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one of these handy shavers years ago.  </li>
            <li> it was so nice</li>
            <li> My wife needed a good rechargable shaver and she is quite pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> And be sure to use a good serum to rub all over after you shave.</li>
            <li> I feel it was really the best from the multitude offered by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now that my daughter has one of her own</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, close shave for legs.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, its great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors and they were as effective as running a paper towel over my legs.  </li>
            <li> pop up trimmer is a nice feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about razor cuts but you still get a nice shave.</li>
            <li> It looks nice.</li>
            <li> , I feel like it&#x27;s more work to get a good shave that way.</li>
            <li> It is nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so well</li>
            <li> The charging unit is nice, there&#x27;s no cord, it just sits in the electrical socket.</li>
            <li> and it does a really nice job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a ladies razor that has been made as sturdy as a mans.</li>
            <li> My shaver will not charge on her charging dock or my own.</li>
            <li> It shaves very closely, it does so rapidly, and I hope you will be as happy with it as I am!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew it could be this nice-</li>
            <li> Razor is effective if shaving arms.  </li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> Its shaves the closest, but of course not as nice as a razor.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and allows her to safely shave her legs.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> But it always works a fair amount of time and does a lovely job.</li>
            <li> What a nice razor.</li>
            <li> Would have liked charge cord that plugs into the wall and sits on the end table where the shaver sits in a charge cradle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Better than some shavers, not as good as others.</li>
            <li> It has a handy plug in recharging station</li>
            <li> I liked this shaver while it was working.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave with no nicks or pinches.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t use it without charging for a good 10-15 minutes just to be safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice and lightweight and the sleek design and color is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving my legs</li>
            <li> It really does a great job on leg hair!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest razor, but for my needs it has worked great &amp; cleaning it is very simple.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave with one swipe.  </li>
            <li> and she did it on her own.</li>
            <li> for me -- I&#x27;m thrilled to have an electric shaver again</li>
            <li> It is more convenient for me to shave this way than in the shower, though, so it is a good option for me.</li>
            <li> I had one before and liked it, but the battery did not keep the charge .Since</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll always keep one of these handy for years to come.</li>
            <li> For the price of this razor, I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> I also own a beard trimmer with attachments.  </li>
            <li> : I love this razor, it still holds a good charge</li>
            <li> Neither of my daughters liked this.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried it on legs yet but am sure it will do just as good a job there also.</li>
            <li> Liked this one</li>
            <li> Satisfied and price was good.</li>
            <li> Handy to use in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> Nice qulity.</li>
            <li> nice performance and also nice price.</li>
            <li> it is so nice</li>
            <li> Handle fits nicely in my hands.  </li>
            <li> A nice design</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to shave a bit more often, but if you don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I wish there was way to return for any kind of money.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice color.  </li>
            <li> Nice grip, too.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not used to this kind of shaver</li>
            <li> Really pulls on hairs and hurts unless it&#x27;s at the PERFECT angle.</li>
            <li> 1.) Perfectly and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Arrived really fast--four days; packaged perfect.</li>
            <li> It is okay but not as good as it could be.  </li>
            <li> Has handy attachments.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave for an auto shaver.</li>
            <li> shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is nice</li>
            <li> Perfect shave when you don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li> Would also be nice if you could use it corded as well, in case you run out of juice during a shave.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I came on to buy another ands a gift for my mother-in-law as she also liked it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a no star because honestly, it did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> In the shower and with the addition of shaving cream, it&#x27;s effective and close.</li>
            <li> Of all the hundreds of purchases I have made on Amazon, this is my absolute FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice marketing strategy by Panasonic .</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Chargeable, sleek, sturdy, effective.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the shape and design of the shaver head.</li>
            <li> This is nice and sturdy but it does not shave close.</li>
            <li> It has a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li> Good product, glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> i am loving this.</li>
            <li> It arrived really fast and was very well packaged - Excellent service and an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering her her own</li>
            <li> Works nicely on him.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The best part was the charger, I no longer have to search for a place to stand the charger unit on, I just plug it in to the socket and there it perches until ready...</li>
            <li> pop up trimmer is a nice touch though.</li>
            <li> Will travel nicely in the travel bag included.</li>
            <li> Real blades are the best....</li>
            <li> Very close shave and very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Probably not as good as a razor shave, but not an appropriate expectation.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to clean and very attractive.</li>
            <li> would even pay more to have these changes, as this is an unbelievably good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Does a nice close shave on your legs.</li>
            <li> I had no choice but to use my Gillette Venus Breeze (which I now love even more lol) and reshave!&lt;br</li>
            <li> really nice, just what I wanted I am going to have knee surgery, so this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> It has excellent battery life and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Originally, I really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice pouch.</li>
            <li> I own a Remington that I have had to replace the blades twice already.</li>
            <li> Handles underarm curves with no pulling or catching.  </li>
            <li> Shaving legs gets a good shave, albeit, not terribly close.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> and it does a really nice job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that it does work in the water as well.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy construction, nice feel, weight in your hand.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because the product came so quickly in the mail and works beautifully in the shower.</li>
            <li> But this is a very nice and comfortable shaver to use</li>
            <li> My legs are very appreciative of the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Cleans super easy and great too!!</li>
            <li> It is fairly sturdy, does a pretty good job, and the battery carries a good charge.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and packing  was very good.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned, it is fast and works perfectly, I cannot live without it</li>
            <li> Works great, good for the first timer and for the lady shaving for years.</li>
            <li> Perfect option for first time Pre-teen shavers:).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure my boyfriend is going to think this is the best Valentines Day gift ever</li>

            <li> own shaver stopped working-and I was kind of glad because even though I paid almost $40 for it, it would scratch me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great when I need a quick shave before wearing a skirt.</li>
            <li> The we/dry feature is especially nice since many of us use our shavers when we are bathing or getting ready to go out.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as good as shaving, but it&#x27;s the next best thing</li>
            <li> This razor is great for those days you do not want to get in the shower to shave but just want a quick shave or maintenance in between.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor but great for a quick touch up when needed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a perfect shave like a traditional razor, but works good when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>

            <li> Fits well in your hand, easy to use and good result.  </li>

            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far and affordable!</li>

            <li> If you have fine hair, this one should work good for you with no problem.</li>
            <li> Good for me with fine motor issues, but doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> (I bought it for 14.99, the original price is 29.99, which is still great if it lasts for more than a year), it does the job well without nicks and cuts, and it is</li>

            <li> Nice and safe and works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, lasts quite a while and is a good, forgiving shaver to start with.</li>

            <li> It believe most women with normal skin/hair would be very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> This had some great settings, allowing for me to first trim the longer hair, then give myself a nice close shave for the remainder.</li>

            <li> Going backwards is more to catch the strays in my observance.</li>

            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>

            <li> My legs have never looked more fabulous!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li> What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I have tried many ladies electric shavers...and they were lousey...</li>
            <li> OK for this price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased I tried this one this time.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and comfortable, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> and i love that i can shave on the go</li>
            <li> I love the easier wall plug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> She is so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love the charger.  </li>
            <li> so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li> So, when I was put on anticoagulants, my clumsiness became something more than an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> This razor provides a close, safe shave.  </li>
            <li> Great deal, fast delivery as always with Prime.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love love love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this shaver for trimming my husband&#x27;s neck hair and shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> So much better than giving my daughter a razor.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am SO glad i got this though.</li>
            <li> My search for the best personal electric shaver ended when I purchased this Panasonic series.</li>
            <li> When that died, I thought there must be a better brand out there, so I looked at Amazon reviews and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts, I&#x27;ll be very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> This works way better than the one I was using.  </li>
            <li> which I guess is okay since I&#x27;m not using it to shave anywhere else</li>
            <li> And, if your bathroom sockets are sideways, you&#x27;re not going to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several over the years, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is no power cord on the recharger.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results this shaver provides.</li>
            <li> It does not give you a smooth feeling at all!</li>
            <li> This shaver just stopped being able to charge, and died within a year.  </li>
            <li> Love this wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Glad to be rid of it now.</li>
            <li> She wanted to be able to sit safely in a chair and take her time shaving.</li>
            <li> The shave is close, but not always perfect (especially when I don&#x27;t take my time).</li>
            <li> The one fix I&#x27;d like to see is to be able to replace the trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> It was better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve bought over the years</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers for women do not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> Most leave a stubble.  </li>
            <li> 2 Years would have been a better review if I had used it more</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a great razor!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I like it but the Remington WDF 7000 is better, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is much better (and price is lower) than the Panasonic shavers with heads (razor part)</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this one on line.</li>
            <li> My beauty routine has changed &amp; I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews of electric razors, I found that this one was considered the best.</li>
            <li> On top of that, no matter where I shave it tugs on the hairs and hurts.</li>
            <li> It is okay for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely satisfied with the many types of Panasonic products that I have purchased over the years</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I could stick with it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver, and I LOVE</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and the shaver stands on top of charger that plugs into the wall</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I use this more then a razor.</li>
            <li> I love the cordless wall charger design.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to have better results with that based on the reviews I had read before deciding to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I like that so many of the parts are replaceable.</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for an excellent shaver, look no further than the Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors and none help with this problem.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Just got this razor last night, and for the price I am Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any</li>
            <li> Love this one.  </li>
            <li> Love the wall charger that comes with it too.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It gets my legs just as smooth as disposable razors with NO razor burn!  </li>
            <li> received my Panasonic ES2207P a couple weeks ago, and am truly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> love the compact charger:  </li>
            <li> ok....</li>
            <li> Besides that though I love it.</li>
            <li> light and nice.</li>
            <li> I will love it</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my daughter a year ago, and was pleased by the design.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this changed my life.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this Shaver.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!</li>
            <li> :) You&#x27;ll not regret it.</li>
            <li> We read many reviews before selecting this one.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair, so it&#x27;s not the best closest shave.</li>
            <li> Works great and charges really fast.  </li>
            <li> Mostly in between shaves with this razor.</li>
            <li> Daughter love the way this works</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works OK, not as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of these and this one works as well as any of them, and better than most.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite</li>
            <li> and I love that amazon still carries this version.  </li>
            <li> I have had this item for years and really love it.  </li>
            <li> They were gifts to my daughters and they simply love them too.</li>
            <li> Love it and in my opinion for an electric razor -</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> if I’m able to return them, could you please tell me how to do it or give me the address where I can send the package?</li>
            <li> I like that my legs don&#x27;t get nicks any more.  </li>
            <li> I like that better.  </li>
            <li> Can anyone suggest a better option for under the arms?</li>
            <li> Love the fact</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers most of my life and most of them have been Remington.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many electric shavers for my wife over our 40 year+ marriage ranging.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is set up for charging.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with price, shipping, etc.</li>
            <li> I am very happy not having any bumps on my legs, especially the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Much better than adding disposables to the landfills.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I tried the $40 Remington side by side to the Panasonic - and the Panasonic is 150% better at getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> but mostly I use the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> tried the Panasonic with the pivoting head, which I assumed would be better.  </li>
            <li> Love that is rechargeable, plugs into outlet</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t make things like they used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good quality and powerful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to get in the shower to shave</li>
            <li> but okay.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I had read a bunch of reviews before purchasing this, so I make sure to have my razor fully charged before use, to limit the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;es that can occur (just like with a &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; razor).</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this shaver.</li>
            <li> LOVE this one.</li>
            <li> it my wife is in love with it</li>
            <li> Make sure the unit is FULLY CHARGED before using and it will work well.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this brand  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had it about a year now and still love it.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets very close shave, but not as close as shaving in the shower with my intuition razor.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love how it charges on the wall...</li>
            <li> The faster the blades move, the better and closer the shave.</li>
            <li> also love that this is a wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be able to give a better review.</li>
            <li> and the charger is a lot more compact.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love the shaver however the metal tore</li>
            <li> Ok I just purchased the shaver and already I need to replace the shaver.</li>
            <li> If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the money!</li>
            <li> not as close a shave as desired, but better than a blade shaver for my touchy skin</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Love having an option not to be &#x27;gorilla girl&#x27; forever.</li>
            <li> Sure some places it does not get as close like a razor.</li>
            <li> Besides my husband,this is the second best thing that has ever happened to me.</li>
            <li> and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Off to find something better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace two battery operated shavers that I used for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to get it to start again but have to wait around 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is ok.  </li>
            <li> Works better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 2 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> However, as with all electric razors, your are not going to get that nice silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> but I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> i wish it worked better to get the hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> When that one finally quit I did an internet search for best leg shavers and this one came to the top.  </li>
            <li> The price is outstanding and it does the job in 1/4 the time without the emptying.  </li>
            <li> The charger is positioned so that it sits on top of the outlet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite pleased for the 3 months I did get to use it, however.  </li>
            <li> To date, I am completely satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and dont require me to change batteries.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job removing hair on both legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> but I love this waterproof razor.</li>
            <li> The contours are great and the shave works really well under arms or at the bikini line, using the pop up head.  </li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m not expecting it to last forever, but for now it is great!</li>
            <li> The price of shipping is going to end up costing me more than the price of the razor.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, I find I have to shave more often with this shaver</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon was excellent in their customer service and the second shaver</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you applied more pressure you might get a closer shave</li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say and dislike the minimum number of words required in order to give you feedback.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my shaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more for my daughters!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable value.</li>
            <li> love it....</li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep it fully charged</li>
            <li> We are well pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I bought a 1 to 3 GE adapter because the razor charger takes one more outlet than I had available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many reviewers here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it works....</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that I can&#x27;t get hurt with the guard.  </li>
            <li> It an ok shaver.  </li>
            <li> works ok not as close a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> I love this razor</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this razor, especially for the price I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I also do not like the base/charger that has to be plugged into the socket with the razor sitting on top of the wall socket.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does a good job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> This razor works better than any women&#x27;s (or men&#x27;s) razor I have ever used and</li>
            <li> I downgraded the review because I had hoped to get more out of this</li>
            <li> This is one the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to a razor shave and you will not be able to obtain that with any electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use when in a hurry</li>
            <li> I especially love this razor because I can now shave any time of day, versus only when I shower.</li>
            <li> am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Mostly for the bikini area and sometimes legs.</li>
            <li> For a $20.00 shaver, it does ok.</li>
            <li> But, overall does a great job like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after learning I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave my legs in the shower before and after knee surgery for fear of infection.</li>
            <li> And when it would work, let&#x27;s just say it acted more as an epillator than a shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave many product reviews, but I must for this item.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Lovely shaver, a must have.</li>
            <li> but I have not been able to find another the even comes close.  </li>
            <li> You need to plug it upright into an outlet and stand the shaver on top.  </li>
            <li> I solely use this shaver for my \\&quot;woman area\\&quot; and I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> and so pleased with how well it works.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite travel razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have one and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this more than my Gillette Quatro.</li>
            <li> Was a worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li> She said it is one of the better razors she has had.</li>
            <li> the charger has no cord just box plugs into outlet and the razor sitting on top of box.</li>
            <li> I use this razor mostly for my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> and it works better if you use about 15 mins after bathing before using lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> just make sure you fully charge it the 1st time</li>
            <li> This brand is better.</li>
            <li> hold the shaver perpendicular to the surface, so that the foil and both side of the trimmer are touching your skin.</li>
            <li> I think 20 minutes is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, there&#x27;s a ton of it.</li>
            <li> I know I will enjoy for years to come!  </li>
            <li> and she love it</li>
            <li> and I glad I did get this one</li>
            <li> It offers a great trimmer and produces a nice close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> It works as described and love the cordless charger</li>
            <li> So glad I bought</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> , I make sure I apply the Vitaville</li>
            <li> For her it is perfect to use in between using a traditional razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Although I followed the directions and make sure it&#x27;s charged up before using.</li>
            <li> I look forward to having it for many years.</li>
            <li> My mother and my mom are both satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> the battery - works well for both of us :)</li>
            <li> and may not be able to get it to function again.  </li>
            <li> Much better than disposals.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> so I anticipate more than a year&#x27;s usage.  </li>
            <li> Still love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> This does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> Love this E razor.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would never be able to shave my legs again.</li>
            <li> more nicks, cuts, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy</li>
            <li> Nice size and shape but does not give a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues to date after many months of ownership.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice now, but am impressed by how well it shaves.  </li>
            <li> Even better?</li>
            <li> Have been quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> For my underarms, it works well though it does leave some stubble that i can feel more than see so</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> Unlike most shavers, it can go forward and backward and still cut hair; it doesn&#x27;t matter which way you hold it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very close but for just trimming it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for me and gives a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> it is so cheap&amp;#34; and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I also put it on the charger every day after I use it (mostly so I know where it is), so I have never had a problem with the battery dying mid-shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve told most of my friends about using an electric shaver, and after feeling how smooth my legs are, almost all of them want to try it!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is OK.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor in many years.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that I can shave off unwanted hair and not start to bleed.</li>
            <li> My legs were smooth and there wasn&#x27;t a bump or burn in sight!</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s OK, that happens</li>
            <li> (It does not work as well on skin fresh out of the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;* Good battery.</li>
            <li> No hairs pulled and it still runs like a top.  </li>
            <li> We both agree that mine is the better razor.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t use batteries that just have to be thrown away and cause more garbage.</li>
            <li> There are not that many budget priced rechargeable wet/dry shavers out there</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for legs if you are pressed for time or missed some hairs in the shower around the ankles.</li>
            <li> it so much I bought one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Works Great</li>
            <li> glad I bought it</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t remember much then I guess it&#x27;s not all that great.</li>
            <li> a WIn Win..thank you so much....</li>
            <li> It is well build and guaranteed safe for use, even by the novice.</li>
            <li> but glad I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I love it.....</li>
            <li> We are both very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone of our female friends.</li>
            <li> nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I should have read more of the 1 star reviews before purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> it did the job better than a razor</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> I love the design and the punch.</li>
            <li> The charge is OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It does the job for sure, but not the close shave as a razor would.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite electric razor.  </li>
            <li> And not that the product is defective, it is just been on the market many years now</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried on my legs and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works well, much more efficient than blades</li>
            <li> It felt more like plucking than shaving.</li>
            <li> and it has been a lot more than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see through them any way).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review if that happens to me.</li>
            <li> Better than a razor.</li>
            <li> After looking at many of these types of shavers and going through their reviews, I chose this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li> Okay gals, so here&#x27;s the scoop on this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite feature is the wet/dry feature.  </li>
            <li> Love my razor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shave and runs very quiet.</li>
            <li> that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you check ship date.  </li>
            <li> and I shave my neck mostly about once a month</li>
            <li> Ive ordered 2 more for friends that tried out  the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have taken it on trips, use it at home and can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Sure misses a lot of hairs to the point</li>
            <li> I also love the pop up shaver for my courser hair.</li>
            <li> I love it because I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> We both would buy again and we do recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Everything it said , and better.  </li>
            <li> Charge has not run out after more than 7 uses.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t like something or the site of purchase, I am more than glad to write a book.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pay that much more for it either.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver</li>
            <li> , This is my 2nd one I have ordered they are so  nice!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about this shaver when I bought it because so many people were giving semi-bad reviews or saying that it hurt...</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I am sure I will have it for many years.</li>
            <li> Better cut, trimmer catches the longer hair better.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and have been using it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and it fits well in my hand and love the color.</li>
            <li> the result is not all satisfying.</li>
            <li> Love this, doesn&#x27;t get as close as razor shaving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for keeping the bikini area under control!</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand and is effective in shaving.  </li>
            <li> Close smooth shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li> I prefer men razors because they work better</li>
            <li> The shaver head pulled and rugged at hair and didn&#x27;t even get most of them.</li>
            <li> The shaver I have from the 1970s works better.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure after seeing it (even in box still).</li>
            <li> , I will purchase something more like a Clio palm-size shaver.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure your shaver is fully charged before you use it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> But for my purposes (namely my legs), I&#x27;m 100% satisfied (and then some).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the razor twice and have been extremely pleased with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is great and really does work for longer or stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and so she stayed with the same model and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped it on the floor and it magically sprung to life.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I only paid $12 for this through Amazon Warehouse deals, and I am very happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of passes to become hair-free, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many Elec.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Even the best of razors left me with razor bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> I guess its ok for shaving your legs...</li>
            <li> I think my husband will be glad im no longer having to use his shaver :)</li>
            <li> in all, this product comes as described :]</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver.</li>
            <li> Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love that it has no cord.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington ladies shavers for years and based on the reviews decided to try this one and it shaves much better.</li>
            <li> As my three stars attest to, it is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> So  glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> I have had one for a year or more.  </li>
            <li> but they look like they cost more than another razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great razor considering I have tried many others, and wax kits too.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Glad that Amazon displayed a reminder on the web page of the date that I had purchased this item through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great to keep the chin hairs to a minimum when I am in too much of a rush in the morning to use tweezers.  </li>
            <li> No time to shave I just use it and head out the door. :)</li>
            <li> Gave to someone as a gift,not sure what to rate it yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t give you a finish like that of shaving cream and a razor, but it made me feel better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with this razor, though I didn&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with it then and use it regularly at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by how well this razor works, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I stayed with Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just madly in love with this thing.</li>
            <li> It cuts closer and more thoroughly than all the others.  </li>
            <li> However, it does work and my girls love it</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite model.</li>
            <li> I want more of a trimmer than a shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I can just pop the top off and rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Low maintenance at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> U get a more temporary effect than if you use a disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> finally i found this and iam now very happy that it gave me a close shave without burns.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure which to get.  </li>
            <li> I will say I have never been to any store or site that carries so many</li>
            <li> you Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;  :):):)</li>
            <li> :):):):</li>
            <li> Okay nevermind the name here, its the wife writing the review.  </li>
            <li> I got this about a year ago and still love it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more; it&#x27;s everything that I needed it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the above aspects, I&#x27;m most impressed with the ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> Never owned one before, but glad I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> Would expect this to cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li> use it in water just to be on the safe side, but it still came up with problems.</li>
            <li> It plugs into the wall; the razor plugs into the top of the charger.</li>
            <li> Bought one for me and one for my best friend, she and I both have 2 different types of hair and growth.</li>
            <li> , I use my finances amazon account to buy stuff :-)</li>
            <li> I love this razor, but.</li>
            <li> Overall, best razor ever.</li>
            <li> Need 6 more words ok all done.</li>
            <li> Its even better when im in a hurry</li>
            <li> i love this razor</li>
            <li> I was able to return this item</li>
            <li> and I love the fact you can place it on the charger and don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li> It holds its charge much better than most.</li>
            <li> and I think I am in Love.</li>
            <li> Used mostly on my bikini area</li>
            <li> I love the hell out of this razor.</li>
            <li> Also it does not give as close a shave as a razor, but for the cost and safety compared to a razor I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit more close of a shave</li>
            <li> but most of you results will turn out wrong👎</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Spend more money and get a useable shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am glad</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this!!  </li>
            <li> definitely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I have last minute outfit changes into skirts and shorts and haven&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li> I opted for the Panasonic shaver and love its sleek design and charger.  </li>
            <li> This morning I said to myself that there HAD to be a better way.  </li>
            <li> This purchase was more to do with water conservation than expecting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> That I have to shave more often</li>
            <li> semi-Bad&lt;br /&gt;It sits directly on top of the plug charger.</li>
            <li> His health care aids say the razor works better</li>
            <li> That lift up is great on the area under his chin and it really gets in close.  </li>
            <li> Not having to buy batteries anymore makes this an even better value.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The price makes it even more</li>
            <li> This is okay...</li>
            <li> I have had a Panasonic for many years and it just stopped working .</li>
            <li> Love this Panasonic cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading so many people saying this stops working and stuff.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews on different brands and decided on this one and very very happy with it!  </li>
            <li> SHOPPED AROUND A LOT FOR A SHAVER FOR MY WIFE, MOST WERE BATTERY OPERATED.</li>
            <li> OK to trim, but not close at all.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I try this shaver.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide quite as close a shave as a manual razor, but then I didn&#x27;t expect it to, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> How many times are you going to ask people to review the items they order.  </li>
            <li> What I have used &amp; read got a better preview.  </li>
            <li> It can be used several times without charging and works best in the shower or tub.</li>
            <li> I love this rechargeable razor.  </li>
            <li> This is more like 4.5 stars.  </li>
            <li> For an inexpensive razor, it sure works.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my legs and NO irritation!</li>
            <li> It does shaves my legs OK, no problem there, and that is why I gave it 3 stars--it just does not work for my chin.</li>
            <li> I love that its rechargeable and in my experience I do not have to charge it between uses every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and let it charge overnight because I wanted to make sure that it was fully powered.</li>
            <li> That came from using a trimmer on my face for many years.  </li>
            <li> Had I not been wearing mine, my injuries would have been much more severe.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.  </li>
            <li> Use it in the shower, and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this shaver will perform as well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the design fits my hand great.</li>
            <li> There are many like it</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s how most products are nowadays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> It does shave the hair close, invisible to the eye, but it, like most electric razors, do not get razor close.</li>
            <li> Just love it.  </li>
            <li> It has been more than a month, and I am ineligible for a return.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this item.</li>
            <li> I think it is better than my disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it ...</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind saying, I try to get the best deal possible</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally satisfied, I&#x27;d give it a 10 of 10.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that this has caused no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , anything else would raise the price, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> this product and better than they used to make them.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> If somebody&#x27;s going to be super-close (or touching)</li>
            <li> This would be a much better product if it had an optional electric cord</li>
            <li> have to rest it on top of something just in case.</li>
            <li> :) .  </li>
            <li> I love shopping with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I decided I&#x27;d call customer service to make sure we&#x27;d receive another.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> and the razer stands on top of it</li>
            <li> i love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is just one more thing to clutter up  your living space.</li>
            <li> A bit more curved.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting a disposable.</li>
            <li> However, it fit nicely in my hand, &amp; glided over my legs with ease.</li>
            <li> If the charger had been better, I would have given this shaver 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that many reviews for this item mention the shaver dying after 8 months or so.</li>
            <li> Safe, fast and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I decided to buy this razor.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> and I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love that it is rechargeable and waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  </li>
            <li> My latest one died after 1 year.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m not going to lie...</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it in water</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also love the charger.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> A must have for all ladies who don&#x27;t like to get their underarms waxed more than once a month..</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave...very, very close.</li>
            <li> usually most of electric product here in amazon do have 110-220v range, but this doesnt.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t going to find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li> Love That It&#x27;s Rechargeable</li>
            <li> Does a great job, really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t cut her self any more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to practice more and see if that improves with user-experience.</li>
            <li> , I found this razor, and, after some research, decided it would be the right choice, based on many good reviews</li>
            <li> Shipped here quickly and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My legs feel very smooth after shaving and the armpits are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> I love that it can be rinsed under the water to keep it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> she shaved with a razor in the shower, she would be in there well over a 1/2 hour and drain our 80 gallon hot water tank!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to be very powerful, so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus for someone whose skin can handle it!</li>
            <li> That being said it must be effective and user friendly.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> Have used it twice and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> So far , so good !  </li>
            <li> features all around havent got sstuck better than any raor ive tried its great highly recommended</li>
            <li> Ladies, this works perfectly for those &#x27;special&#x27; sensitive areas that need a close shave.</li>
            <li> Good product especially when you have very fine leg hair,  maintains a charge for a good time, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> No, you&#x27;ll never get as close as a normal razor, but it&#x27;s great for in the summer when you have to shave more often.</li>
            <li> biggest qualm with the shaver is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for like and hour depending on how many areas you are going to shave, but the battery holds charge pretty good.</li>
            <li> I had the first for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a nice clean shave I have tried others</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean shave</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice clean shave</li>
            <li> It has smooth result and is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> Very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Hands down best electric razor ever and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> A great product, I highly recomented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> i need nickel-free since i&#x27;m highly allergic, so it&#x27;s great for underarms.</li>
            <li> and it has worked fine, still going strong battery and all!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever, super easy-to-use, and looks so cute too!</li>
            <li> Special longer hair razor head should be handy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there were so many excellent dry shavers like this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and shave more often because it is so easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits easily in my hands though I think some sort of gripping material would be better on the sides as it can get slippery.  </li>
            <li> Gives a very clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked mine so much that I ordered a spare plus 3 more for gifts!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> But if you use it correctly and keep it charged, it can be a pretty good substitute.  </li>
            <li> Not as close/smooth of a shave as a straight razor, but easier &amp; more convenient to use, resulting in an attractive and comfortable shave anywhere &amp; anytime its needed.</li>
            <li> This razor is so good, and shaves so closely, it&#x27;s now my first choice every time.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Razor works perfectly and has a long battery life once fully charged.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had a good 3 days growth going on... which isn&#x27;t much...and every once in awhile</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a good charge and is not complicated to use.</li>
            <li> However, the shaver does a pretty good job of delivering the close shave one always hopes to get with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...</li>
            <li> This panasonic gives you a close shave, battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It hold a pretty good charge...</li>
            <li> so im very happy with that, although there is some minor itching for about a day or so.  </li>
            <li> I think this item is the best It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your skin I wish I had purchased it long ago</li>
            <li> Does a good job consistently.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job for an electric.</li>
            <li> Pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> works pretty good ...</li>
            <li> If you are one that wants a good enough close shave, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can keep my legs looking pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but pretty good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The first time it didn&#x27;t turn on I thought it was done for good.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and works great!</li>
            <li> Just got this product yesterday as my very first ladies shaver, I love it!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good</li>
            <li> that is a pretty good buy</li>
            <li> I gave this item 5 stars because it is the most comfortable razor to hold and gives such a close and perfect shave  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this seller again... as long as they have the best deal.</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on another review where someone had bought these as a safe option for new shaver and so glad!!  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a very good product and will buy more as I need them.</li>
            <li> Once again, I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> For this price it is TOTALLY worth it!!</li>
            <li> But it worth of its price!!</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy my friend introduced me to this product because now I can&#x27;t see how I would ever live without it.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new shaver, and this one is doing great.  </li>
            <li> It works great on all areas, from legs and arms to the more sensitive areas like underarms and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Love it, so easy</li>
            <li> The top snaps on and off for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Everything can be totally dry, and it removes the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have something where I can just do a quick touch up and go.</li>
            <li> I mostly just use it on my legs and it glides easily across my skin and cuts the hairs quite closely.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold, has not pulled any hairs, and is water safe.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever bought for the under arms on dry</li>
            <li> it is safe and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, all that aside, this is still an excellent dry leg shaver, which is what I use it for.  </li>
            <li> Just turn and shave dry legs for an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> I love the razor and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I love that its rechargeable and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is rechargeable and so easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Handy for quick touch ups</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to work</li>
            <li> Top comes off for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> So in terms of using it dry, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts anymore it does an awesome job shaving dry.</li>
            <li> Safe and easy to use .  </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve used it dry, both work perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I bought one for my daughter a couple years ago and it is still going strong</li>
            <li> I found that it works best if you shave dry.</li>
            <li> After returning a shaver from another manufacturer, I was a bit hesitant to use this, but it is wonderful - shaves closely and does not scrap or burn even when used dry</li>
            <li> just wonderful must better that I expected at the price paid.</li>
            <li> I LOVED using this razor &amp; bought it in February because of the low cost &amp; good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave that I get to enjoy too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the grand kid will enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works better if you grow your leg hair out for a week or more, but I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of not having fairly smooth legs, so that&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
            <li> Light and comfortable in my hand, it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> No electric shaver will ever be as good as a manual shaver but at full full charge it comes close.</li>
            <li> It remains charged and is very easy to manipulate, shave and clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and happy to receive these items before Christmas after the promised date was after.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very easy to use and to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Works great.  </li>
            <li> Great price, offers convenience with charger and it works well with unsightly and thicker hair!</li>
            <li> This razor gives a beautifully close shave, leaving me far more smooth feeling than I had anticipated, and leaving not a trace of stubble to be seen.</li>
            <li> do like how easy it is, how good it is with my skin (no cuts or anything) and how fast I can shave now!</li>
            <li> It has a smooth shave, it has a very comfortable handling and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Once I get up to the fine hairs on top of my thigh, it doesn&#x27;t get it 100%</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure how well a shaver would work.</li>
            <li> For me, it seems to glide best when used dry and no bumps or irritation to speak of!  </li>
            <li> I had the older version of this too, the blue/green one, which I liked but bought this one when I lost the charger (I&#x27;d had that for years, and it still works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been very happy with any of them and most of them &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; the skin to some degree or other and cause pain and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Works great so far and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Not the closest shave, but is very good at getting the job done in one pass rather than shaving the same area repeatedly.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very easy to use, and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I found that it works best in the shower with shaving cream and hair length is a major factor in the success of the shave.</li>
            <li> I am now using the shaver and like it very much - I find it much more effective</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purchase, it works just fine on my legs, and is very easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> As with most electric razors, the shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I would have liked, but it certainly was better than not being able to shave at all.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and at a great price that arrived right to my door!</li>
            <li> And for those of us with skin issues and have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors without a skin reaction, this alternative is great.</li>
            <li> I  love how it it gives  a  smooth and  </li>
            <li> Still feels smooth but not as smooth as a 5 blade disposable shave!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge and has so far lived up to its name because I have been able to successfully maneuver it closely over all my curves...</li>
            <li> Best $20 I have spent in a while-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ES2207P since early 2013, and let me tell you, after having used this WONDERFUL product dozens of times, it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using a disposable razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Love the close shave and how smooth it is on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I think the most important things to remember when using this is:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> so far it works great.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of getting her lady bits smooth.</li>
            <li> She never complains about it, so I&#x27;m giving it Great Star Action.</li>
            <li> Works great for this 63 year old.</li>
            <li> So far it works great.</li>
            <li> so far a great product.  </li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t happy with her old electric shaver (also a panasonic shaver)</li>
            <li> But I checked the aggregate site (free) Consumer Search and this was the top women&#x27;s shaver</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job, although I must say I have never used it wet, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> Giving great relief to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I was happy that she was not self conscious anymore.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this to me and so far, have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had to do three or more passes to get my legs really smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the pop up trimmer blade and the close shave blade leaves my skin feeling smooth all day.</li>
            <li> over all I happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> While it says it is available to use in the shower, I will use my blade razor for that, as it gives the closest shave, even better than this.  </li>
            <li> I am hair free and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.</li>
            <li> but it works great in the shower and seems to be completely water-tight.  </li>
            <li> Original charger &amp; original battery, amazingly.</li>
            <li> I love the design, light weight,, ease of operation.  </li>
            <li> far it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great option for a young girl to learn to shave her legs without having to worry about cuts  &amp; nicks from shaving.  </li>
            <li> This razor has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver, and it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I imagine you have to use it more often for a really smooth leg</li>
            <li> She says it does a great job and is completely waterproof and holds a charge well.  </li>
            <li> i recommend  this product for women who like a smooth, close shave and don&#x27;t like getting cut by their shavers. :3</li>
            <li> This is great for young and elderly ladies.</li>
            <li> and I really love how light it is.  </li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> and I feel more comfortable with her using an electric than a blade.</li>
            <li> I know the recharging method is not the most important aspect of the razor but there is no stand, no cord just stick the charger on the razor and plug it into the wall.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product delivery faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> My daughters $5 electric razor works more comfortably than this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> SO I need a really safe shaver that also gives me a close smooth shave</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product but so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this razor and the close shave it offers.  </li>
            <li> Found a reasonably priced, good working razor.  </li>
            <li> And becareful if you have any moles or raise beauty marks, this razor is so good, is shaves them like a straight razor</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as hand shaving with a store bought razor; and a whole lot faster.</li>
            <li> It really does make shaving easier, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reliable and a good deal</li>
            <li> and I tell you this has really spoiled me in getting a good close shave in a blink of an eye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, very affordable</li>

            <li> The service was fast and the price fair.</li>
            <li> what kind of hair it thought it was useful for</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but as others have stated, it is better used dry.</li>
            <li> Delivered right to my door!!</li>
            <li> got item super fast and was on time lol</li>
            <li> No lies, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been able to as quickly and efficiently as I am able to with this product.</li>
            <li> Great shave with no mess.</li>
            <li> NOT TOO GOOD - Very surprised so many like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer feature, however, so I can use something else, but since it&#x27;s right there, it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t yelp and make my family come running...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is suitable for those times when a quick shave is needed without a shower.  </li>
            <li> me, the most important aspect of any shaver should be its ability to give you a fine, close shave without leaving stubs.</li>
            <li> Works like a real razor...smooth and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> It gives a very clean and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> While it is not the closest shave in the world, after putting lotion on, I&#x27;m pretty darned pleased!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on getting a higher-end electric shaver, this is a good solution!</li>

            <li> I got mine September 2014, it is June 2015 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Would  recommend it if looking for a good shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I could use it to get a decent trim, this isn&#x27;t even a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done though which is good, shave is decently close but its not like shaving with a razor blade.</li>

            <li> This gives a super close shave which leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> The razor in general does a great job.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is pretty much amazing.</li>
            <li> Since I had a great experience with Remington, I bought another of their shavers from their website; it was junk, barely cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Works fine,  easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited at the idea, since it said it was great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, use and does a fine shaving job.</li>
            <li> At first this razor was pretty good, I was even able to shave my armpits with it without getting shredded.</li>
            <li> I bought this during my first year of college--apparently, hairy legs, arms, armpits, and sideburns aren&#x27;t popular on campus?</li>
            <li> handy and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I like having a cordless shaver handy when I need a touch-up, but shavers aren&#x27;t my first choice for leg hair removal.</li>
            <li> The instructions it comes with are pretty stright forward, which is nice.</li>
            <li> which may be true, however, I am glad I started them out this way.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the shaver does a good job dry !</li>
            <li> The best thing was the lack of blood trailing down my leg or ankle.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s AWESOME having something I can grab and do a quick dry shave minutes b4 having to be somewhere.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> the best 20$ spent!!</li>
            <li> but as a dry shaver ti does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Kind of surprising that using an inexpensive \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; razor works far better than my men&#x27;s razors that cost 4-5 times as much.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> It works just fine on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> and she likes it just fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fine</li>
            <li> I just bought this razor, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade razor, but it is fine with me for what I need now.</li>
            <li> easy fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> But it works just fine out of water.</li>
            <li> Still works fine and keeps a charge.</li>
            <li> It lives up to its claims, providing easy and comfortable hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t yet tried in the shower</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for a couple months now and it still works fine.</li>
            <li> I shaved my bikini area and was easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, and for me it works fine.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works fine.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job of trimming longer hairs (when I haven&#x27;t shaved downstairs in a while and don&#x27;t want to break out the scissors), but it will not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is light weight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It works well on my legs and also fine hair on my face &amp; arms.</li>
            <li> it is light in weight &amp; curved for an easy shave.  </li>
            <li> It was a fine electric razor, for a couple months.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> It has been working just fine</li>
            <li> No problems, charges fine, light weight, cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if your in a pinch</li>
            <li> I have fine hairs</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave but for me it is fine.</li>
            <li> I do just one swipe on my bikini area and arms and works fine.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is so smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shaver works fine for me, it remove the close hair under my chin.  </li>
            <li> that is easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning</li>
            <li> and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Light and slim design easy to handle.</li>
            <li> but for the price difference it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It is easy for her to use, smooth close save on her legs.</li>
            <li> 2 years weekly twice use, it is still working fine and also has never shown wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I found this model to be pretty good and for the price, it is well worth getting.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor about 8mo ago and it worked fine</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> but it was easy to use and the shaving was smooth.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to use and comfortable (both on removing hair and being held).</li>
            <li> Glad I did, it works just as awesome as the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I have been super pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> With this, i&#x27;m able to quickly shave my legs</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly, competently, and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super convenient!</li>
            <li> but this does the job when your legs need a quick shave!  </li>
            <li> stuff done downtown and quick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li> I love that i can use it really quick</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly, and not damaged at all :)</li>
            <li> For a quick shaving fix where you just need to remove visible hair, this is okay</li>
            <li> I was able to shave quickly with no bumps.</li>
            <li> Super!</li>
            <li> Smooth and strong.</li>
            <li> This is a super shaver!</li>
            <li> But for a quick shave of the legs, this is a magical lil thing</li>
            <li> I love the way this razor is extremely quick in giving a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it is exactly as close as a blade shave, but if you keep up with regular shaving, it is certainly very, very good and better than being cut up.  </li>
            <li> While having a waterproof shaver is really cool (and it really is capable of working in the shower), getting fine or sparse hairs with this product is kind of challenging.</li>
            <li> You plug in the plug thing into the outlet and then the shaver goes on top of it, saving very much needed counter space!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have much more to say !</li>
            <li> This shaver is shaped nicely so that it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As far as performance and ease of use and cleaning, it&#x27;s super great.  </li>
            <li> Great product that is easy to charge and holds the charge for several uses.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and also easy to clean .  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and so far, so good.</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was super (and pleasantly) surprised with how great a shave I got with this thing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to be able to shave my legs dry and run out of the house.</li>

            <li> It works, is easy to clean up, and is easy to fit in the charger.</li>

            <li> This little shaver is awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> It sure beats sitting in the shower with a straight razor and soap!!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than a certain brand make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before every use</li>
            <li> The extra feature of the trimmer is very nice and easy to set and use, just a flick of the button up and the trimmer is raised.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and ergonomically friendly.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have to say I am super pleased!</li>
            <li> The shipment date was accurate.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, works easily and leaves everything smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t a huge deal.  </li>
            <li> This is my 4th shaver from Panasonic and this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li> It is a smooth shave and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean &amp; recharge too.</li>
            <li> This razor actually does a great job when it works.</li>
            <li> It is easy to charge, hold, use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is light years ahead of the cordless razors</li>
            <li> Everything felt SO smooth</li>
            <li> It does not give you that smooth silky shave you get from a razor.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself, and my sister liked it so much</li>
            <li> I also enjoy not having to worry about nicking myself.</li>
            <li> For only 20 bucks, it&#x27;s a GREAT investment.</li>
            <li> That model is replaced with the ES2207 and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable under arms and for bikini area.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes shavers for women that truly do not pinch or scratch, but leave area smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your legs smooth like from a razor</li>
            <li> but she is not concerned about baby smooth legs at this age.</li>
            <li> It has been smooth since then.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> so I went over it again and the area became smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but close enough for me to be happy.</li>
            <li> After having two Remington Shavers that did not last the Panasonic is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li> Great for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth the shave was.  </li>
            <li> this is after light use.  </li>
            <li> Smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> If you do that, the shaver will have no problem staying secure on the charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my legs are smooth as I like them..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap that even if it breaks in a month, I would order another.  </li>
            <li> I got this razor a couple of months ago and it works fantastic...</li>
            <li> So I bought this one thinking it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It does everything it claims and gives a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, has pop-up for sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight than the Remington, shaves closer (amazingly close for an electric shaver) and holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly and never grabs my skin.</li>
            <li> Just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice, close shave and works really well for underarms.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a fairly smooth shave and has held its charge well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> but no matter how lightly I pressed it would always end up ripping hairs out.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading everybody talk about the smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> She felt secure with mine</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> I had no chance at getting it smooth that way</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming private areas, without razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li> does all i ask of a razor and is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave smooth to the skin</li>
            <li> The two things I love about it the most are that it&#x27;s (relatively) quiet, and it really does a great job.  </li>
            <li> will get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So I get a smooth shave from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results were smooth with no problems with ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> the shaver was that we RV camp and don&#x27;t always have water or sewer hook up available</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which, fortunately I had kept.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Conair LW D375WCSV Satiny Smooth Ladies Wet/Dry rechargeable, charged it and tried it another day.  </li>
            <li> and this is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It works well, is easy to clean, and maintains charge well.  </li>
            <li> so close and smooth smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily for my underarms.  </li>
            <li> and I get a smooth underarm without the burn.  </li>
            <li> Also the flip up shaver, how easy it is to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> It comes handy when you are in hurry and want to shave fast and go after going to work or school.</li>
            <li> Granted, you are not baby smooth after using this, but the shave is so close</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and produces a smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>

            <li> Does a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave if you don&#x27;t want razor.</li>
            <li> Never gave a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> but then when I would turn it on it would just sound worn out and die.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> A close shave, smooth legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Its light</li>
            <li> It goes over your skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy the Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> Product does not make my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> but it has been worth more than its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> This is great because I can shave while my baby is playing in the same room!</li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I owned several Panasonic and they all performed great.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> , then I use the roller blades to smooth out the skin.  </li>
            <li> still in the drawer and will probably never see the light of day again.</li>
            <li> This one shaves close and so smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is actually smooth when I am done shaving.</li>
            <li> Well made and work fantastic</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy expecting a shave as smooth as a razor because you won&#x27;t get that with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use</li>
            <li> It might as well have been disposable for the light use it had before conking out.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand.</li>

            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> works great, months later now.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> gives a smooth and close underarm and leg shave, doesn&#x27;t cause any rash or allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You have no indicator (light, etc) to show the remaining charge or when charging is finished.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the charging light.</li>
            <li> I am comfortable recommending this to others.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m still happy with this purchase, but I did want to update my review with my experiences.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important on the journey through recovery.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the storage bag would fit the razor AND the charger, instead of just the razor itself.</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs has never been this smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, Panasonic &amp; Amazon.com for making this product available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean  charging is a breeze.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning: It is extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Fits hand and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be cheap</li>
            <li> I always have smooth legs with no stubble after.  </li>
            <li> It is light and compact.  </li>
            <li> She has light brown hair on her legs and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my legs so if that&#x27;s the only area you are using it on</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t give me that silky smooth that I want.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Does it come out perfectly smooth?</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best electric razor I have found so far, and what makes it even better is the relatively low price.</li>
            <li> If it had a light on front, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many different foil razors over the years, and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> The only problem my wife experienced was abrasion on underarms presumably from the trimmer head.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It also helped greatly cut back on razor burn on my under arms.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> so I really enjoy having it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that they are much improved.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job...... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave, and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> it does a great job on my corse italian hair.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not too noisy and</li>
            <li> it gets the job done comfortably.</li>
            <li> I used to get allergies from shaving, since using this I am allergy free.</li>
            <li> Does not give the close shave I am used to with my regular razor but a great time saver when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is comfortable to hold and does the job.  </li>
            <li> When it worked it was great, but it only lasted 7 months before it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the close shave of a razor, but this works well for touch-ups and when there isn&#x27;t time for a detailed shave.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I would give the shaver five stars if the light would go off showing that it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and like the styling and the colors.</li>
            <li> Granted, it won&#x27;t get you as smooth as a razor, but you also won&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> She does not complain of razor irritation and her legs are as smooth as can be with this device.  </li>
            <li> Filled out the customer service form on Panasonic&#x27;s website to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for travel</li>
            <li> I like the way it fits so comfortably in my hand.</li>

            <li> This one makes my legs really smooth.  </li>
            <li> Recommend for everyone who  uses daily or often, great</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth as silk shave, stick to a razor as this shaver doesn&#x27;t get that close.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and effective.</li>
            <li> My mother liked it so much</li>
            <li> Works great and is rather quiet.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the razor under my arms yet, but honestly that wasn&#x27;t really why I bought the razor.  </li>
            <li> My legs are still smooth just not silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a smooth shave which the product delivers.</li>
            <li> It is not stubble you can see, but you can feel it, so if you want smooth legs, I don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> It does work best with shaving cream, but I use foamy hand soap as it is cheaper and doesn&#x27;t smell so heavy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, also.</li>
            <li> 1 arm pit went smooth as baby bottoms.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth and it&#x27;s already saved me money.</li>

            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean as the top/blades snaps off and can be rinsed/washed under the faucet with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> The grip is smooth and all one piece, no rubber pads or things to catch on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heave any razor burn but it does practically make you smooth.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gave a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using cheap razors for</li>
            <li> I gives smooth looks but not feel.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and leave you baby smooth in one swipe and the stubble attachment hurts when using it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my husband would admire how smooth my legs are with this razor, but for day in and out it keeps my legs looking presentable.</li>
            <li> simple product, works great.</li>
            <li> few notes on how I use this product to get the best results:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of experimentation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, why the need for the detailed directions?</li>
            <li> The light on the charger says its going</li>
            <li> This one was cheap and still had what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Great for people who practice lots of sports or just simply work out, it reduces the shaving time by a lot.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely, is easy to clean, and is rechargeable.</li>

            <li> I like the this unit, it shaves close and charges quickly, easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t give me the silky smooth finish like a razor in the bathroom</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the battery isn&#x27;t that great after 1 year.</li>
            <li> hold a charge, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these, they are a a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> being a women i want a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your legs completely smooth to the touch, but makes them hairless.</li>
            <li> you use it daily, it works great....</li>
            <li> She can use this in the shower; it glides over curves, gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t rip it off even though the sound the thing makes tells you otherwise.</li>
            <li> Seems that Phillips knows how to make fantastic men&#x27;s electric shavers, but gets a failing grade on their womens&#x27; models.</li>
            <li> I have a reason to shave all the time and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The design fits your hand comfortably; light-weight.</li>
            <li> Works very well and really handy...</li>
            <li> Smooth, works well.</li>
            <li> This will NOT give you that smooth as a razor shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for younger girls that are getting into the act of shaving without having to worry about accidentally getting cut.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and</li>
            <li> It glides on your legs smoothly.  </li>
            <li> smooth* legs.</li>
            <li> but I do it to avoid razor burn and achieve smooth legs.</li>
            <li> and she did not feel comfortable using a razor for her underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keep clean with the brush that comes with</li>
            <li> Smooth, close, comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver,  nice close shave on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It did such a great job that I decided to purchase one.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product as it produces a close shave.</li>
            <li> I filled out a return and shipped it to the Panasonic returns department for a replacement.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and glides over my skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a close, smooth shave with no pulling or discomfort.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a medium strength, light weight ladies razor.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back even after I have a shower at home.</li>
            <li> I would say if you&#x27;re in a situation where you need a really smooth shave (honeymoon, beach vacation</li>
            <li> Now I can shave comfortably and in privacy too.</li>
            <li> This does such a great job of taking care of my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Primarily a convenience item.</li>
            <li> The light on the charger is on</li>
            <li> never worked as good s my regular razor, but I&#x27;m on blood thinners and it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Just a good product so far.</li>
            <li> and it is awesome and so much easier than using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive, fair skin like me, and you want a smooth shave without razor burn, BUY THIS RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> (????) I&#x27;m a fair skinned Redhead with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife a couple of weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything can come as close as a good old razor and shaving gel....</li>
            <li> I had an old electric razor that I loved and can no longer get a foil or blades for.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me, used it once</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Lady Sunbeam that I loved.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised at how good a job it does.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair at all and this shaver should have been able to do the job effortlessly if it was even close to the wonderful reviews written about it.</li>
            <li> The shave was nice and smooth (as smooth as you will get without using a real razor in the bath or shower).  </li>
            <li> After losing my old standby, go figure how that happened, I was delighted to find this one here.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t as good as my old one which they don&#x27;t make now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my husband&#x27;s Norelco.</li>
            <li> very close shave, great to keep legs pool ready</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> This is the same brand &amp; style that I had &amp; hope I get just as many good years</li>
            <li> Works best wet in the shower,  but is useful out as well</li>
            <li> For me, besides the skin being clean and dry, it helps when the hair is a bit longer than nub length (when the hair is a bit longer, the shaver gets a better cut), and using a circular motion is also very effective.</li>
            <li> As someone who gets ingrown hairs pretty easily, this is much better than using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> It is handy to have around for quick shave and just to look pretty.  </li>
            <li> Dose  the job well for me; easy to use; stays charged for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I clean it with a little alcohol on a tissue after each use and it has been doing a great job!</li>
            <li> you have to position the razor just right on the charger to make sure its getting charged.</li>
            <li> I love the compact recharging station as well that plugs right into the outlet.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give an electric razor one more</li>
            <li> This thing is just plain convenient and AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done that I seem to not be able to do right in the shower.</li>
            <li> Just the wall brick and the razor sits right on it, cute as can be.  </li>
            <li> It just plugs into the wall, and the razor just sits right on top of the charger.  </li>
            <li> Love the charger, no cord, plugs right into wall.  </li>
            <li> It fits right in my hand, is easy to clean, and was even fully charged when I got it!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am pleased to report that I agree with the positive reviews!</li>
            <li> She really likes that it is rechargeable and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love it, great close shave simple to use, easy to clean and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> not bad, easy to use and gives an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> I just received this and have only used it once, but I love it!!  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is extra sturdy and very handy.  </li>
            <li> Anyway,I suggest you to buy this item as it is very useful.</li>
            <li> Very economical use of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well for a nice clean shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my legs feeling smooth, clean, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Works great if you want a clean shave, but if you are buying this to trim and want different lengths, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I get a clean shave and that is fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li> Durable, clean smooth cut per my wife&#x27;s statement.</li>
            <li> and I like having clean and smooth looking legs as I wear running shorts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for light clean up shaving.</li>
            <li> Makes a great first shaver for young girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really pretty happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> If you want to look clean &amp; smooth, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Took me all of five minutes to get all smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a decent amount of time and options are nice to use.</li>
            <li> Mother in law needed something reliable, and easy to handle, it shipped quickly and she likes the way it works.</li>
            <li> This does what I bought it for: gives me a quick and easy way to touch up legs when I haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully shave.</li>
            <li> So quick &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy and is almost as close as shaving.</li>
            <li> So easy to just break this out and shave really quickly.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing an electric shaver and so far I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy</li>
            <li> This is for day to day quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li> hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My old one cost $75, so the price was almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use that I don&#x27;t find that a problem.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absolutely brilliant for delicate areas n very easy to clean</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> She loves it very much and says it is so much better than a blade and</li>
            <li> this one is great...very pleased and very reasonably priced..</li>
            <li> At this point, I was able to shave my legs (which I had let go for a bit too long-luckily I&#x27;m in a comfortable relationship, lol), my underarms, and the more delicate areas of my body with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My shaver arrived quickly and I was delighted to find it was charged and ready to perform right out the box.  </li>
            <li> It did not perform at all like the smooth, effective new Panasonic</li>
            <li> I find it as others have; that it is good for removing facial hair, and easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use (legs, underarms, and bikini), and holds its charge for many weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used it on dry skin and am pleased with the good job it does on my legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is great for quick shaves for hitting the pool or beach at the last minute.  </li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t expect a baby smooth finish from a dry shaver, but when you pass over a leg patch and can see that the hairs weren&#x27;t touched, the product isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Although it does not shave as close as a razor it is great for a quick shave and shaves well enough.</li>
            <li> I am in a hurry most of the time and use it dry and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> also, very easy to clean and very compact..</li>
            <li> Also, if it starts to pull your hair, make sure to charge it first.</li>
            <li> I was really excited</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it correctly or not as it felt like it was burning and wasn&#x27;t removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, such a good deal for this price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my first one so after some years it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> but we didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with her using a true razor.  </li>
            <li> Seems to get most hairs the first time over.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW (July 2, 2011):</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m no disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has been worth my money!</li>
            <li> Maybe if it popped up a bit higher or was more adjustable.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly around my bikini line when I am on vacation and holy smokes I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I&#x27;ve saved instead of shaving in the shower!</li>
            <li> a unique charging system.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product did not come in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing so much!  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well for what it is, but it seems like it could work better.</li>
            <li> I have 2 in my household now, my brother stole my first one :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I switched to an electric shaver, considering how much money I&#x27;m going to save!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver in April 2014.  </li>
            <li> * Original Review (5 stars)</li>
            <li> They work great, the charge lasts a long time and they continue to recharge after years of use.</li>
            <li> Great product with long life rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it fits perfect!  </li>
            <li> Be sure you put lotion on first</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in March and was so excited about using it for the summer season.  </li>
            <li> Works great- holds the charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> but for the most part it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> By the way my original one came in 1 day.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited for this razor to arrive.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Conair I purchased first.</li>
            <li> It is also great if you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while to get rid of long hair first, and then follow up with a razor for a silky smooth effect!  </li>
            <li> If you are using it on your underarms or bikini line, you will probably want to do those areas first, when the shaver is at its most powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> it is ok, the price was great shipping was fast, only wished it cut deeper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still on the original charge(charge</li>
            <li> I picked one up from a Target for around 22 dollars, and was excited to get started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the exact one I had purchased many years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure its used for you downstairs area and your armpits.</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver holds a charge for a long time, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> did absolutely love it the first time</li>
            <li> I dropped the original one on the floor</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure at first and after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have a unique living situation that forces me to take showers at the gym.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but now it is doing just a decent job.</li>
            <li> It allows me a nice fine shave despite sensitive skin and a health concern.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic razor which will shave your legs just fine.  </li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s great for the summer though, when I&#x27;m shaving more frequently and it keeps everything smooth and clean in between major shaves.  </li>
            <li> I normally shave my legs with a regular blade and cream, but this shaver is perfect when I am pressed for time and need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job, gives a nice, close shave and goes a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Great product ,well made ,holds a charge a long time!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and stays charged for a long time!</li>
            <li> Nice to live in an ever growing cordless world.</li>
            <li> Nice choice if anyone&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> Great price too and holds a charge very long too.</li>
            <li> Shaves really great and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Clean shave.  </li>
            <li> great dry and in shower.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Panasonic shaver is a great buy, definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several shavers before and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far..</li>
            <li> It gives a clean and a close shave, without pulling.</li>
            <li> I took it apart to see how to clean it, and that&#x27;s a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> Razor is relatively quiet, no knicks or cuts, smooth shave, good for using on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> For any woman that has gone or is going through menopause; this shaver cleans those unwanted hairs quickly and efficiently....and pain free.  </li>
            <li> It shaves smooth and quickly too.</li>
            <li> LOVE it ,, nice and quiet</li>
            <li> Gives a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic Ladies Razor and it is the best by far.</li>
            <li> it gives me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> but it does a great job dry.</li>
            <li> It looked clean</li>
            <li> I felt clean shaven and</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clean close shave skip this razor.</li>
            <li> Could not shave that clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great that you can use it dry, this has probably already paid for itself saving me money on my water bill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 different kinds and this is by far the best model.</li>
            <li> Needs a brush with it to help you clean it out.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, it is washable and it is really okay for using in the shower or outside.</li>
            <li> absolutely clean shave</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> She liked it a lot better, especially at removing longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li> I have had the name brand that is the best known, historically, in my opinion, and it is loud and does not shave that well.  </li>
            <li> As for the shave...it is clean and close.  </li>
            <li> I looked there were no cuts or nicks or anything, clean as can be.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to buy three more as gifts.</li>
            <li> nice-neath and clean...</li>
            <li> Dry great.</li>
            <li> Overall best electric razor I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter last Christmas, she love&#x27;s it, it does the job nicely for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so quick and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> My ladies electric razors before were a snap to clean.</li>
            <li> It says it has 2 lengths, but it is either a clean shave, or what a 5 o clock shadow looks like on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> it cuts clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to clean it out from time to time though.</li>
            <li> how clean it is all contributes to how well this razor works or not.</li>
            <li> how clean it is all contributes to how well this razor works or not.</li>
            <li> I do clean it out after every shave since it&#x27;s loaded with my (gorilla style) leg hair.</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair, you have to clean it between strokes because the bikini adjusted head that pops out gets hair caught in it, and then the bottom blade cannot grip the hairs to cut them.</li>
            <li> The trick to it working for me has been to keep it thoroughly clean after each use and to charge it often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as clean as a razor</li>
            <li> I usually dry shave with it and am quite happy, although I did use it in the shower without any issues as well.</li>
            <li> After using the shaver twice, I removed the head to clean it.</li>
            <li> It comes with a two sided brush to clean the unit as well.</li>
            <li> it is not silky smooth but good enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is much more cost effective than buying disposable raZors on a constant basis.</li>
            <li> It works great dry.  </li>
            <li> like the pop-up trimmer to keep downstairs neat and tidy, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to make sure this is fully charged before attempting it.</li>
            <li> I am able to shave close with this which is great but also have gotten a few ingrown hairs because it does shave so close</li>
            <li> its lightweight a bother to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor is so comfortable to use, quick and convenient.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be good quality and it works better than I expected for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take the high risk on this product that you&#x27;ll be like so many of us and get one that works great until just outside the return period.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy person and this is really nice for a person on the go.</li>
            <li> Gave it a full charge and have used it at least twice a month on legs and arms and is STILL RUNNING on the original charge!It is so smooth you cannot even tell is shaving yet does an excellent</li>
            <li> Very handy and the battery has long life.</li>
            <li> Great for post surgery patients with limited mobility also.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to give up the single edge razor now.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, charge lasts long and good shave.</li>
            <li> This little razor is easy to use, does a really good job leaving me feeling smooth after the shave with no razor burn and no nicking!  </li>
            <li> As an electric razor, it gives a very respectable close shave (not as close as a regular razor) and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic razor for the price, does exactly what I bought it for, easy underarm hair removal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, gets all of my hair in one or two swipes and feels smooth on my body.</li>
            <li> This really cuts well and is very light in the hand.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn like real razors, and the shave is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use, it came charged right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This will travel easily and charges up right at the outlet</li>
            <li> : If you have the right case to carry it in, it&#x27;s easily portable.</li>
            <li> : If you have the right case to carry it in, it&#x27;s easily portable.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver; it is fast, feminine, easy to use, easy to clean, charges well, and</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> nothing special, but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch or for a travel razor.</li>
            <li> So on special occasions, (about once a month), I finish it off with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Get this right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purchasing another one right now!</li>
            <li> The price was right!</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor it comes pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> I love the shaver I just wish it was much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t give me a clean cut, but it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy and quick that it&#x27;s actually fun.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> After two months of almost daily use I have to say I am seriously impressed with this amazing little razor.</li>
            <li> This little gem has larger foil holes and is honestly the best &amp;#34;man face shaver&amp;#34; I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Shaving has never been easier and more pleasant without all the mess and fuss.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the trimmer first if any hair is longer than 1/4 inch or so before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and for an even better shave and to keep it from pulling/tugging any hairs, make sure it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the razor is good to have around for quick touch ups, for instance when you want to go to the gym in shorts or short yoga pants but have significant stubble on your lower legs.</li>
            <li> Battery life is pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> It works great on the first or second pass, and never leaves any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> As long as your in the direct stream of  water it is the best shave I have ever had from an electric.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet, but it has worked otherwise just great for me.</li>
            <li> my legs and armpits it worked great, but the trimmer I used for the &#x27;bikini line&#x27; is a bit rough, it pulled out hairs.</li>
            <li> Really a great first shaver for my third grader.</li>
            <li> I have had a pretty good experience with it so far.  </li>
            <li> The wide head is GREAT for carving across your legs and chest, if you happen to have a furry chest you gotta get rid of.</li>
            <li> Really surprised me how great a work it does compared to a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Wet great.</li>
            <li> I liked the first one so much, I bought another.  </li>
            <li> Wet use is a great option and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hairs than I would just stick with shaving but for those who have light hair this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say is, it is waterproof and it works for shower use.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for ladies&#x27; legs, it&#x27;s good enough to keep my head shaved too.</li>
            <li> Her old one was a corded one, so she really liked the fact that this was cordless and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I buy one very six months:)</li>
            <li> This shaver removed that hair, quickly and cleanly, without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is fitting the need very well.  </li>
            <li> I chose this razor based on the good reviews AND the low price.</li>
            <li> I set out to find the same one for a guaranteed good item.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply easy to use, quick to charge, easy on the cleaning and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> But now I love it, and it makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> THESE GOOD AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE BECOME.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a silky smooth result like a traditional razor, but it IS the next best thing!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> Definitely wasn&#x27;t something that was a good replacement for razors.</li>
            <li> To say the least, she is very Happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann</li>
            <li> The shaver sits on the charger saving much need counter top space.  </li>
            <li> Being able to sit in a chair with my feet up and shave makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come to a full stop but the power is noticeably lower within 10 minutes of using it.</li>
            <li> It is a rare find -cheap</li>
            <li> It is cheap, so if we get a year out of it, that would be worth it.</li>
            <li> compare to a straight razor this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I used it on full legs, and underarms with NO issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cordless, rechargeable (nice low profile recharger--no cord) and gives me a nice close trim in my intimate areas with no injuries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver especially at this price!</li>
            <li> but this works good enough.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good a shave as a regular razor</li>
            <li> This one truly is the best, even with thick, course</li>
            <li> Honestly, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a non-electric razor, so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised on that count.</li>
            <li> but I will stick to the tried and true method of razor blades for my bikini area or waxing.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic razor we have purchased and find it to be a good , quality , item for the price.</li>
            <li> better than shavers that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> I have to brush it off at some points so it works at full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, but its good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I have learned to be more gentle with.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t even get in a full shave.</li>
            <li> My sister used mine several times and loved it too</li>
            <li> The placement of the buttons is good so that you can start and stop the shaver or open and close the pop trimmer with the thumb of the hand you&#x27;re holding it with.</li>
            <li> The placement of the buttons is good so that you can start and stop the shaver or open and close the pop trimmer with the thumb of the hand you&#x27;re holding it with.</li>
            <li> on a full charge.  </li>
            <li> After reading several good ones on this one, I bought it.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft product&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Loud, but extremely effective.</li>
            <li> Relatively close shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li> Overall it is 4 stars for the product, but 5 stars for doing what I need it to at a good price.</li>
            <li> I still get ingrown hairs, but not painful ones.</li>
            <li> I have been using razors for years until I had hit a vein; so I decided to purchase an electric shaver; I wish I had done it years ago, there is nothing better for my legs and for the price it has real value.</li>
            <li> This works okay for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It makes a for quick clean up before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just ordered 2nd one for the misses, she loves this razor and I loved the price.&lt;br /&gt;1st</li>
            <li> This shaver worked for one battery full and now wont charge.  </li>
            <li> Well, as others have said, it will last a good 5 years.</li>
            <li> , it shaved much closer than I thought it would, I did feel a couple hairs being &#x27;pulled&#x27; out rather than trimmed, but no to many, have not tried the extendable trimming edge yet.</li>
            <li> it does tell you that this does not give a close shave and that is true.  </li>
            <li> I liked my old Remington</li>
            <li> It is ok but does not shave very well.</li>
            <li> So, it works, and I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to go full Brazilian but waxing scares you.</li>
            <li> I figured electric was a good way to start, as the memories of knicking my ankles at her age all came flooding back.  </li>
            <li> Well, not only have they improved, but I swear that I got as good as a shave on my legs as I ever have with a razor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t save as close as a razer but good enough for me!</li>
            <li> This one was okay but did not give a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using them for a good 30 years (various makes).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.  </li>
            <li> Good for day to day and occasional use.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use shaving foam, just clear water in the shower, and it gave a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> , it wouldn&#x60;t work even for 1 full minute.</li>
            <li> It is kind of loud</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really get any better with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> But overall it is a good one.</li>
            <li> Good basic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> For any woman who wants to make the chore of shaving more pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even tried to help me use the devise and we both laughed as he referred my results similar too</li>
            <li> have used a straight razor for many years and wanted to try the electric, again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic I love it.</li>
            <li> The clear protective cap fits snugly and doesn&#x27;t wiggle or come off on its own.</li>
            <li> i love it so much i bought one for my friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic really needs a better charging option. </li>
            <li> It takes care of facial peach fuzz  if I make two passes.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a full on electric shaver</li>
            <li> easy to clean, looks nice and makes short work of shaving hair.</li>
            <li> it is not a bad deal at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering it cost $13, 3 years is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver but not reliable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised by how good of a job this razor does..</li>
            <li> Not bad although not as close as a shave as I would like.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s good - not stubbly - and it&#x27;s nice and small for the carry-on bag.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite product, I love it so much!  </li>
            <li> works fine - not as great as the close shave of a razor in the shower but does a decent enough job for those times when I&#x27;m in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure I hold it at exactly the right angle.</li>
            <li> This product is very handy if you just need to shave because you&#x27;re going out or its a surprisingly nice day outside, however you will start to notice stubble the next day!</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy to use and much quicker on the go.</li>
            <li> Is good for quick touch-ups, but is not a close shave that will last .</li>
            <li> Quick, fast, close shaves that leave me falling in love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i thought i should try this and found it easy, fast, and pain free.</li>
            <li> i bought this and have gotten a clean and super quick shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> so I got it mainly for that, and I have to say this does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> the light will let you know when its in the right position.</li>
            <li> You must have some patience and go over the areas a couple of times, but if you do it right it leaves you with legs as smooth as a razor shave.</li>
            <li> just right for the light to come on, indicating that it is charging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had limited experience with electric shavers but this was, by far, the best one I&#x27;ve purchased and tried.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;d shaved with a blade in the shower, the lighting wasn&#x27;t that good, I went mostly by feel, and would later see hairs, particularly on my knees, that I&#x27;d missed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle&amp;operate, and gentle on my skin-no razor burn!</li>
            <li> This has saved me easily hundreds of dollars and paid for itself after the first couple months.</li>
            <li> My first is still going strong after 5 years, I just forgot it while I&#x27;m away for 4 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, I finally broke down and got this one after seeing so many good reviews and I will definitely say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> When my new razor came with in days of the order i was thrilled and used it right away.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over the spot a few times to get that great close shave, but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding about the wet/dry thing - it works great in both situations, and has never malfunctioned due to water.  </li>
            <li> Works great for me and cheaper than disposable and other manual razors</li>
            <li> I have tried other shavers etc and none have worked as great this.</li>
            <li> This works great even for places other than my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a great item I like it due t the time it takes to shave with a razor and all the nicks/cuts</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a good razor.</li>
            <li> It was completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Amazon has a very good return policy, electronics being returned after 30 days only get 80% reimbursement, and I have to pay for the shipping.</li>
            <li> Powerful clean shave.</li>
            <li> My first rechargeable shaver &amp; it works fine.  </li>
            <li> The first one worked fine for a year and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> What a powerful unit and a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, just buy this one as it is the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> Luckily I purchased at the store nearby and not online.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this...until, like so many of the others, it up and quit on me after a few months.</li>
            <li> I also have used this razor wet on my arm pits with great success as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a brush that quickly unclogs the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What women wouldn&#x27;t want a quick option to remove unwanted hair?  </li>
            <li> run down:&lt;br /&gt;(1) gives a close shave quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> It all depends on how quick I can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You basically trade a super close shave for a acceptable shave in exchange for the convenience and cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Fits well in the hand and takes care of my hair removal needs quickly and painlessly, no redness and no bumps afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this purchase since I owned the older version</li>
            <li> She mainly uses it while bathing and has fallen in love with the product.</li>
            <li> It does not matter that much to me, but if really smooth legs are important to you, stick with a blade, or waxing or something like that.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly</li>
            <li> If you would like to have one of these electric razors for those quick trims, I would recommend this as you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2207P was a tremendous surprise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to recommend it to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> And once the baby is here it means I can do a quick shave without showering if I need to.</li>
            <li> and I never felt it was a super close shave.</li>
            <li> For my daughter just learning how to shave this is a hit - she doesn&#x27;t need a super close shave</li>
            <li> So I got this because I just wanted something I could quickly run over my legs and walk out the door without having to turn the water on, soap up, etc.</li>
            <li> Charges quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this for those times I want to shave but avoid razor burn, particularly in summer when I &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to shave more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> This is a no-brainer every gal should get, esp when you need a quick touch up and can&#x27;t take the time out to get in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received the shaver quickly</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had an older version of this.</li>
            <li> far more convenient and shaves so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I purchased it for and it is pretty close shave compared to most shavers out there.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li> Provides a quick and close shave</li>
            <li> It is quick</li>
            <li> Very close shave- leaves me smooth &amp; irritation free.</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand well and makes for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Close shave:&lt;br /&gt;I think the main issue most people face with electric shavers is getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> It quickly handles my leg shaving.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it on my facial hair, Dr. Oz says that is the best way for women to remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Would very well for all areas of the body, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li> so the thing I didn&#x27;t like about this shaver is how quick the battery runs out.</li>
            <li> when im running out and need a quick touch up of my underarms.  </li>
            <li> A great buying and really does the work, especially compared to the prize!</li>
            <li> My legs feel nice and smooth when I shave them, but are stubbly by the next day.</li>
            <li> This shaver &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Close quick shave.</li>
            <li> My last razor was a Panasonic and served me well for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I did not buy the more expensive version and very happy that I did not.  </li>
            <li> I just plug this in and when it&#x27;s charged, I can quickly shave my legs.</li>
            <li> If I was in a hurry I&#x27;d use it to shave my pits quick.</li>
            <li> It does an adequate job.</li>
            <li> It was on sale when I bought it and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I read an earlier review that said to make sure it was fully charged for the better shave and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im one of those many women over 40 who suddenly find hair growing more on their faces</li>
            <li> I wanted this because I wanted something for quick touch ups</li>
            <li> I have stayed away from electric razors for years because they did not do an even adequate job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice if it had a charging light and something to tell you that the charge is running low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first shave I had was perfect: I thought this machine was incredible, as it worked nearly flawlessly (not completely close like disposable ones, but that was to be expected), but it also left no irritation, and I have yet to come across a cut or even the tiniest nick from using it.</li>
            <li> So, I have decided not to give up on Panasonic (which still seems to be acclaimed as the best), and have decided in upgrading to the more expensive ES2216PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was told this was amazing and performed better than expected.</li>
            <li> It does not shave super close (There is no &amp;#34;touchable smooth&amp;#34; here).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to do a quick fix, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes women just need a quick shave also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a real razor, but it&#x27;s very convenient and nice to use.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally well built and obvious quality.  </li>
            <li> The battery burns out really quickly and then refuses to recharge.</li>
            <li> I thought i would be lucky...</li>
            <li> Do not expect a super close shave....</li>
            <li> The shipping and packaging was excellent and easy and quick shipping, earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver so much, I use it dry and has had it for 9 months and it still cuts good.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> I have had one for a year or two now, I use it for quick touch ups or when I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower with a razor and cream.</li>
            <li> Some may find this more convenient, but in my household as we only have one outlet in the bathroom and many devices to use with that outlet</li>
            <li> Charges quick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons- battery dies quickly as time goes on, leaves stubble, lasts about 6mos- 1 year (pushing it).</li>
            <li> I use a men&#x27;s face razor to quickly go over my legs and get the stubble after I&#x27;m done using this product.</li>
            <li> It works quickly.</li>
            <li> it arrived amazingly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for several months now and I am surprisingly more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it does a good enough job that I&#x27;m not afraid of going sleeveless.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly</li>
            <li> another one!!!and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient, works fine, comfortable to hold, looks pretty, and works well!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the charger is a single unit plug in (no cord) which allows me to utilize a kind of an out of the way plug when recharging.  </li>
            <li> As long as you hold it correctly (and it even tells you in the instructions) and take your time, you will have a great shave and will enjoy using your new razor!  </li>
            <li> It works smoothly and is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic ES2207p Close&lt;br /&gt;Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry ladies shaver beginning of June 2011 and enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> High ratings and reviews from the lovely people of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver, Light, fast, easy.</li>
            <li> This gives me a good shave and it&#x27;s always charged because I put it right back on the charger after I use it.</li>
            <li> Being able to shave dry and not itch has lowered my anxiety significantly and now I can feel confident wearing whatever I want.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver for \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and it keeps a good charge that allowed me to shave both my legs entirely on the same charge.</li>
            <li> Also replacment parts are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> bikini bit works well, though it requires more care than using the shaver normally.</li>
            <li> The other reason I love this is because I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> This is my very first lady shaver.</li>
            <li> My Wife has used it several times and is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Thank u very much!  </li>
            <li> first replacement shaver I purchased was a Remington - model WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky.  </li>
            <li> I will have to find another brand that&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I was told that it is the very first shaver that does not nip at your skin when shaving your underarms.  </li>
            <li> This shaver makes my legs feel smooth and ready to go!</li>
            <li> and the wife was really excited to finally get a really nice ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First a heads-up: you will never get quite as smooth with an electric shaver than you will with a razor, but you can get pretty close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married, have had 2 kids, going on 40, I dont need that silky smooth leg anymore.  </li>
            <li> I waited several months to do my review and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they had no use for it but other family members own and are pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I just received this very recently and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice close shave (surprisingly as close as a razor) without leaving me red bumps the next day.</li>
            <li> Its better then my old shaver but Not as good as the $15 men&#x27;s travel razor I bought at the same time as this one.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, good price, works just as well as more expensive brands and models.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, charge lasts a long time and</li>
            <li> Electric shavers are not known for close shaves and this isn&#x27;t the exception, but it does do a good job as long as one follows the directions provided.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was good while it worked but did not work for long.</li>
            <li> Great razor, very sharp, makes quick work of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> in fact, a good friend of mine gave me the PERFECT silver-colored cosmetic pouch into which this product fits EXTREMELY WELL (much better than the thin white carrying bag that originally came with the packaged product!!).</li>
            <li> but it left me with a nice clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased sooner, just a nice little tool that makes grooming quick &amp; easy !</li>
            <li> : I have extremely sensitive skin and very fine hair</li>
            <li> but I am still keeping the review high because I only paid $20 for this thing, and it has given me over 2 years of great performance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and using disposable razor blades sucked for me because no matter what i use my skin gets cut easily and very irritated and since this does not produce a super close shave i can shave more often without getting irritated skin and cuts.</li>
            <li> I use the dry mode and it works just great and takes only minutes with easy cleaning!</li>
            <li> Better than the Remington 5000 was when it was new.  </li>
            <li> but everything was brand new in the box &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My new favorite and I don&#x27;t even care</li>
            <li> But this new one, I think, is an even better product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t bother getting any replacement foils or blades, they would cost more than just getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had very many, but this wonder of modern convenience blows the shavers of old out of the water.  </li>
            <li> , one less item for the gift list, lol</li>
            <li> I used to have the previous model, which was great.</li>
            <li> It works really well and easy to use and charge</li>
            <li> Electric shavers won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but the Panasonic is so easy and fast that you don&#x27;t mind grabbing it often.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I used it while pregnant because shaving is too much of a chore at 9 months pregnant but not with this!</li>
            <li> It is the close to getting a close shave and works so easy and was as described and had fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, obviously, but for an electric razor it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li> Much safer than a  throwaway  which easily can nick the skin.  </li>
            <li> Very well built, shaves well, cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> does pretty good with facial but thats it.</li>
            <li> This panasonic razor shaves very well &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much quieter and shaves my legs and arms easily.  </li>
            <li> So fast and easy to use and</li>
            <li> Gentle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> makes shaving fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is gentle on the skin and being battery driven makes it easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like it that much cause its not TOO Strong..</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy Thanx to amazon prime and</li>
            <li> It is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li> really close shaves for a electric shaver, easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li> I started on my face and the shaver was very smooth, trouble free and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great little shaver for when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> really if you like being eco friendly and wanna save some money and don&#x27;t mind if you don&#x27;t get the closest shave ever just smooth enough to feel nice gliding your legs together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to just sit on the couch, no water, no cuts, no shaving cream, no mess to clean up and be done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> No counter space is needed so its a good choice if you have limited space.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t start to grow back for a week or more!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize it had different style trimmers for full shaving and more detailed grooming.</li>
            <li> This one is the first one I have ever had that didn&#x27;t give me razor burn!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several months ago and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> This is her first one and she loves it!</li>
            <li> None of these will shave as close as a razor but this one is pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward to operate.</li>
            <li> Overall I think my men&#x27;s 5 blade razor from king soopers works way better!</li>
            <li> I was able to use it on my thighs which i usually never shave because of the terrrible itching</li>
            <li> but I love it so far!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well worth the very reasonable price for this razor!  </li>
            <li> Gives me pretty close shave!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> it would&#x27;ve been done the first day I got it!</li>
            <li> it worked when i first got it, but now it doesnt, its like i didnt shave at all, im going to just end up throwing it away !</li>
            <li> I got so excited the first time</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I waited all these years to buy one!  </li>
            <li> I have even borrowed it because mine (different brand) wasn&#x27;t charged, and it works better than the one that I have!</li>
            <li> Also, I replaced the head last year and the new blades were great.</li>
            <li> Had the new one for about a month now and so far so good</li>
            <li> I like it more as a dry shaver, for me it works better.</li>
            <li> The shaver does an excellent job, although I have just used the dry mode and for legs only.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can shave dry without getting razor burn :)</li>
            <li> I only use it in the dry setting on my leggs and it works great!</li>
            <li> This is great and fast for a dry shave.</li>
            <li> More so if you&#x27;re a super busy student.</li>
            <li> Though, it really does get pretty close to smooth if you really try, so it may work out for those who have more</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very light and truly cordless: the razor plugs directly into the outlet, so there&#x27;s no cord draping around when re-charging.  </li>
            <li> It works exceptionally well, holds a charge for a long time, and MOSTLY it is easy to use in the most private area that I shave.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this in the mail to try it out, and even though the directions recommend charging it for a full 12 hours it came out of the package fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I first rinse the head, then put a some hand soap in some water in a cup, and leave the head in that to soak while I clean the blades inside.</li>
            <li> It really does get  a super close shave!</li>
            <li> It worked fine for awhile; it didn&#x27;t give me a really close shave, but I prefer that to the hell that is razor burn EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that I can use it wet or dry and that I there replacement parts are available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this thing lasts, because so far I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> I used it a couple to times ot worked fine but not as close as a real razsor.</li>
            <li> Its predecessor had a large and bulky charger that wouldn&#x27;t fit onto my bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li> but It is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> This little guy is great for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Great little Shaver.</li>
            <li> Great little razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> This little razor does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I had great luck with this little razor.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver .gettinf</li>
            <li> Of course it won&#x27;t get as close a shave as an actual razor, and you have to go over each area more than once, but it&#x27;s just fine for keeping a bikini line neat.  </li>
            <li> Nice little shaver for the money, what more can I say.</li>
            <li> Still leaves a little stubble, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor leaves leg skin completely smooth, so I am reasonable happy with this&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little razor does a nice job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver fits nicely in your hands and the on/off switch is easily reached without needed your other hand.  </li>
            <li> Good shave, not too hard to clean and easy to charge.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using manual razors due to sensitive skin that I cut quite easily and so far, this has been perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, requires one pass over of most areas (and I have very dark, coarse hair), and feels great in hand.</li>
            <li> Now that I have found this product I enjoy not suffering from ingrowns as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as using a razor, but great for everyday shaving while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2207P rechargeable gets my underarms shaved very close and smooth, as well as the bikini line, and no irritation.</li>
            <li> well, at least my underarms are smooth and happy.  </li>
            <li> It was working great up until about a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Have used a few times and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It holds the charge, it&#x27;s light weight, and fast.</li>
            <li> It works great and the battery lasts for a few times.</li>
            <li> This worked great while it did work, however, mine also died without any reason after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and leaves skin smooth without nicks.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Ultimate Body and Bikini: and it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s also very inexpensive on the Panasonic website with free shipping, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> so i was searching for a shaver which will give me a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It charges fast, keeps the charge and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li> I think is really worth to use this money to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Initial quality is great, not too loud of a motor.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Not too happy so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> And for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrendous thing that has ever gotten near my..ahem..bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like it, is worth the $</li>
            <li> /&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: I can go as fast as I like, no nicks, cuts, nothing just safe fast</li>
            <li> So far I have realy enjoyed using this razor.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave (not quite as close as with a wet razor, but good) with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers don&#x27;t necessarily get a razor-close shave, but this electric shaver gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive, no nick,itch-free and my legs were ultra smooth!</li>
            <li> I have one that I&#x27;ve had for years (rarely used it) and I like it, but you can no longer get replacement blades or foils for it.  </li>
            <li> Ok so if the puppy wouldn&#x27;t have chewed the blades on my old electric razor...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers over the years, and have to say that this is by FAR the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric.</li>
            <li> It was worth everything I paid for it which was not a lot.  </li>
            <li> If I had to make a suggestion for improvement, the trimmer does a nice job but sometimes requires multiple passes to cut longer hairs.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my old one</li>
            <li> For under $20, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, powerful, and has a charger that saves space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many shavers and so far this one is working out.  </li>
            <li> It just takes getting used to, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It really is a good razor and for only $22 (that&#x27;s how much I paid for it)</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and recharges just as good as it did when I first charged it up.</li>
            <li> Honestly they look almost the same.</li>
            <li> This is her favorite so far, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This shaver is so much better than the old Lady Remington I had.</li>
            <li> but i dont even know if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to upgrade.</li>
            <li> This is my  second one and loving it.  </li>
            <li> and they last a good while and work really well.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it kind of pulls on my hair every now and then, causing quite some pain.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the cost and so far the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be useful after recovery.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and every time i shaved with a razor blade, for a week or more</li>
            <li> which to me was not a big deal, but it is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The charger plugs directly into the outlet (no cord) and then the shaver plugs into the top of it.</li>
            <li> because it was  priced so reasonabily, I was both surprised and pleased when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> and the charger is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> Not having the pain of shaving is worth it.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for myself and so far it is ok.</li>
            <li> about 2-3 shaves without charging, it does not provide a nice close shave like a regular razor</li>
            <li> Around 3 minutes later, I was startled when the shaver started up on its own and fell to the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> Nice to finally get a deal!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the shaver just sits on top of the plug when charging and it actually charges quite fast.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li> This never does it, and gets close enough to the skin to give that nice used-an-expensive-cream-and-razor look.</li>
            <li> good shipping and product works as expected</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> Got this for myself for Christmas and it is well worth it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money for what you get-excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> I have to go over each stroke more than once to completely get all the stubble.</li>
            <li> Worth the money .</li>
            <li> I feel more comfortable with her using this instead of a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> trimmer useful too.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and pop up trimmer is useful.</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;A fresh charge is a must.</li>
            <li> I like this as it can be used wet or dry...and give a fairly close shave...</li>
            <li> So after I read the reviews and said for price the value was worth trying this for her.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews of many units, was looking for something that would not irritate sensitive armpit areas, and could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> so far my wife likes it and says it works as good as the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> Is that worth $18?</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of instances of it pulling hairs, but that seems rare.</li>
            <li> If you need your legs to be absolutely smooth &amp; silky to the touch a regular razor might work better for you.</li>
            <li> For the price this is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected, it does not work as good as my $5 battery powered shaver.  </li>
            <li> so it just never seemed worth using.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and shaving with a razor hurts when I shave more than once every two weeks (which, of course, leaves me a hairy beast by then!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s useful to have around</li>
            <li> Love it so far, does not leave bumps or leave scars.</li>
            <li> to me, the safety and convenience is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the shaver so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nicked my self so many times now, that I have 2 or 3 scars on my legs near the knees because of razer blades</li>
            <li> and I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Better than my old one.</li>
            <li> It gives you a close shave better than my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> Had my old one for about 4 yrs (bought it the day after Christmas on sale) really love the way it works.</li>
            <li> It was so worth the $20.</li>
            <li> it is useful and effective...fini</li>
            <li> It truly does shave as closely as a blade (worth two or three passes).</li>
            <li> Worth the $$</li>
            <li> So far all ok.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better by far.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Shaver of this kind that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> SO FAR, I am in love with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Honestly spend the money and buy something that will last.</li>
            <li> worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> love it arrived early</li>
            <li> Works OK if you are in a hurry, but doesn&#x27;t really get very close unless you go reeeeeeeeal slooooooow.  </li>
            <li> So far it is doing okay.</li>
            <li> quickly,, worth the every penny</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who says it works as advertised for a modest price which by todays standard is great.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is FAR better.</li>
            <li> Because of a review by a male customer that said this shaver was one his wife really liked, is why I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This one works better than the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver a couple times now and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Kinda bites at my skin in the sensitive areas for sure</li>
            <li> It also comes in a very handy little bag for traveling....</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty awesome simply because I can use it whilst dry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s your only option, for example, if your sharing a hotel room with friends and don&#x27;t have the privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrowth: Surprisingly, the regrowth was not as blunt as normal shaving, which is what gave me the confidence to shave my arms!</li>
            <li> If you use it right, you get a nice, close shave, not as close as a disposable razor, but close enough to be a lifesaver when I don&#x27;t have time for a full-on shower.</li>
            <li> Wonder why I waited so long to mald this switch from safety razor to electric, love it so easy and never a nick</li>
            <li> I think the shorter stubby brush is for the blades and the long more easily bendable brush is for the inside of the foil.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little ladies trimmer that won&#x27;t disappoint and its good for a broad range of ages, from a preteen girl on up.</li>
            <li> After purchasing 3 other shavers (which did not work at all) I have finally got one that does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> It works best if used every other day, allowing a bit of hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li> This is possibly the best $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> I use this dry and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used it dry and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I did look several other places and sites and this was the best price</li>
            <li> Now I do plan on editing this review after some time has passed, because it seems that some other customers didn&#x27;t have the best luck with the product lasting.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that you can rinse it clean as well as use the brush if you want to clean it while dry.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it seems to die pretty quickly...</li>
            <li> Charged pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the convenience of having it around for a quick dry shave when I needed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this electric shaver for its very low price and its clean, painless shaving on my underarms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy device, but does not provide as clean a shave on my legs as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It gives a decently close shave (not as close as a blade, but good for an electric), and I don&#x27;t have to go over my legs several times for it to catch the hairs.</li>
            <li> I cut my skin the first time i used on the bikini area, then i realized , i need to use lesser pressure and hold it light and let it glide ,for a better shave.</li>
            <li> It works way better with damp skin, at first I was not happy with it until I used it after my shower and it works great</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave and is powerful!</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is good, use it mostly on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because it got good reviews on Amazon and some other websites.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to press your finger onto the faucet so that it gives out a sharp forceful stream.</li>
            <li> I love the battery lasts as long as it does, and it does a good job overall.</li>
            <li> Good for legs, underarms, and other areas too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it never grabs a hair and gives it a good tug like all the other ones</li>
            <li> It is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Dry is great when I get sudden invites to go swimming or hot-tubbing, and wet is great for in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great shave when completely dry and great shave when completely wet, but don&#x27;t try to shave skin which is tacky or sweaty because it will not glide properly.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe my luck on finding this and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It was shipped right on time</li>
            <li> Well if ain&#x27;t broke why replace it right?</li>
            <li> Right away it ripped my hairs out.</li>
            <li> wish that the charger had a cord rather than plugging right into the wall.</li>
            <li> i waited for years to find the right one</li>
            <li> if you do it RIGHT</li>
            <li> the charger must plug right into the wall - the plug prongs are right on the charger.</li>
            <li> Just received my electric shaver in the mail and used it right away...love it.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> I would have returned it, but I didn&#x27;t feel right about returning something with torn out hair stuck in it.  </li>
            <li> I like to shave with this right before going somewhere</li>
            <li> Not even close to a razor, but I can use this when I don&#x27;t want to get in the shower, like right before exercise.</li>
            <li> If done right, this can give a close shave.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> Shaved my legs right after taking it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I bought the item when I injured my right hand</li>
            <li> and yet it plugs right in to recharge.</li>
            <li> Priced right</li>
            <li> It does the trick for that purpose, but is not the right razor for someone looking for a trim.</li>
            <li> And the price was right as well.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it would turn on after 5 minutes, but rarely right away.</li>
            <li> The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> It is bulky but it is also just doesn&#x27;t work right for me.</li>
            <li> The price was right, too.</li>
            <li> Right price, too.  </li>
            <li> Priced right.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, too.  </li>
            <li> It is not going to get as close/touchable smooth as a real razor, but it keeps things pretty close.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The total head in general is great at moving with the contours of your legs and body.</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde and fine and easy to cut, too.</li>
            <li> It works great for a quick leg shave at the last minute and gets close enough to give a day after shaving feel.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good, it&#x27;s easy to handle, i&#x27;ve use it in wet areas and it had works excelent,it&#x27;s bring you a shave complete with just a once, you must to take care of surfering a cut because it&#x27;s powerfull, in my case it happened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of this exact kind through the years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not bulky and love the fact that it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Fast and clean.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close and clean shave, without cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it in my \\&quot;girl\\&quot; place yet, but I&#x27;ll be lathering up with the sensitive shave cream first :-)</li>
            <li> It also does well if you are using it more frequently than weekly, and seems to consistently cut without pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li> You do have to move the razor in either circular movements or in numerous directions, but that is true with most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> You will feel very stubbly, but you look clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Wow, much better than all the higher end electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> does great dry and in the shower, I love I can use it wet</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this great little electric shaver!  </li>
            <li> Great little unit!</li>
            <li> Great little razor!</li>
            <li> I put it in her Christmas stocking last year, and she just recently revealed to me that it was her favorite (and most practical!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not a very frequent groomer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed that I could get such a smooth shave with such a low cost razor.  </li>
            <li> New Years Day, I asked how she liked it so far.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can replace the heads and don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor just because a part has worn out.</li>
            <li> It works great and takes very little charging.</li>
            <li> As a wet / dry shaver she reports that it working perfectly in the water.</li>
            <li> Works excellent both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> The best wet dry rechargable razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> After struggling for a year and a half with a Remington (which needed multiple passes to shave a hair), I just got this---and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> The pop-up straight blade is helpful and the whole things comes apart easily for washing.  </li>
            <li> , I can use it wet or dry and it was a excellent price</li>
            <li> * Works wet or dry, making it wonderfully flexible.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to have smooth legs when short on time.</li>
            <li> Works best on completely wet or completely dry skin, not in between.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in overnight before using it and was pleasantly surprised at how quick, smooth and close the shave was on my legs.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry - excellent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaved well, was light weight and pops open for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it saves me time and makes shaving quick and simple!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite these issues, I keep this around for the times when I need a quick touch-up and don&#x27;t have access to or time to take a shower, simply because I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my old one finally gave out because this one is much better.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d NEVER be able to wear a swim suit which sucks because you can&#x27;t really get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It has retained a full charge very well</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great for the *bushier* areas and when you are a lazy shaver like I am and sometimes wait a couple weeks between</li>
            <li> This Panasonic was actually the 3rd shaver that I bought to replace my old Remington - which was the best rechargeable shaver I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> This is never going to give you smooth legs like a normal razor</li>
            <li> I suppose if you bought one of these every year, it&#x27;d be a sufficient way to shave, but is that the legacy you really want to leave to your children, a planet depleted of resources and full of planned obsolescence items like this?</li>
            <li> and it comes with a travel case and small brush, which is great for when she goes to summer camp.  </li>
            <li> Funny, no sooner had I plugged in the shaver to charge, than my husband came to me with a grin on his face and showed me his freshly shaven neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet again, another razor that barely does the job, and leaves more stubble then you started out with.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of the reviews, but it hasn&#x27;t worked too great for me :/  </li>
            <li> really works well, gives a close shave and the battery stays charged for a full shave</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple razors for those personal areas and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the hand and as long as you shave in segments going one direction up the leg</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer is also handy.</li>
            <li> but it was quick, and certainly removed hair in areas</li>
            <li> Time will tell, I guess, but so far I&#x27;m pretty excited about this one!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is just an all-around great little electric</li>
            <li> look but it will get the hair down to a nice clean shaved look.</li>
            <li> After searching a long time for a rechargeable razor that actually works on women with real curves and real hair, this is great!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who wants a convenient, comfortable shave and wants the look of smooth legs without the hassle and irritation of normal blades.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth if you get the right angle (close to the blade opposite the trimmer for me).  </li>
            <li> My wife needed a new Shaver and this one really filled the bill.</li>
            <li> This razor does not cut any hair at all, it is pure junk!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, whether dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li> keep it short, it&#x27;s nice for a quick shave to wear shorts or a skirt, but if you&#x27;re expecting someone to rub on your silky smooth legs try a regular razor.</li>
            <li> x better than my old shaver, this one shaves really close, keeps its charge and it a lot easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> whether or not I am the best shaver, this should not happen with a razor and of course I&#x27;ve never had trouble like that with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and since no one is touching my legs who cares if you can still feel a really minimal roughness?  </li>
            <li> Second one is same great quality.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care about a super close shave</li>
            <li> I find this razor great to keep up short enough shaving when I&#x27;m wearing pants a majority of the time.  </li>
            <li> I did have to move it over some hairs several times to have them removed, but overall this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose for her 11 year old legs, but I don&#x27;t see it being effective for an adult.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is far superior to the last three shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Quick fast shave and the trimmer works</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> It feels almost as smooth as a razor--no, not as smooth, but close!&lt;br /&gt;I get absolutely no red lines or marks from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> old  shaver worked much better and for much longer.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have sensitive skin and get nicked several times even with good razors like Venus.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use the shaver a great deal, so I suppose if you do not keep charging it up, it might go dead permanently.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far, no problems, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and cuts my shave time in half.  </li>
            <li> Was surprised how easy this was to use.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to purchase one and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> * Easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li> Everything is good, except that the battery need to charge so much longer than expected.</li>
            <li> so maybe someone who has less thicker hair might get good results and would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to tilt it too far to make it glide easily.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to the real thing, but I would recommend this for a quick shave or if you don&#x27;t want to bother with the fuss of using a razor.</li>
            <li> how you can take it apart and clean it with liquid soap and water and it is easy to recharge when the battery runs low.</li>
            <li> Of course, it can&#x27;t possibly shave as close as a good old fashioned razor, no electric shaver will.</li>
            <li> It worked well both dry and in the shower, and the pop-up trimmer came in handy.</li>
            <li> So far it has been really easy to use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it continuously, but it&#x27;s been frequent enough to know that it&#x27;s a good product with longevity.</li>
            <li> They refunded my money super fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later in the week I decided to give the Panasonic another try with a dry shave, thinking this might come in handy with travel or camping...</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, this is my second one</li>
            <li> Finally found one as good as my old one..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  well balanced; comfortable in my hand; it&#x27;s quiet and gives a smooth shave....doesn&#x27;t tug the skin.</li>
            <li> The pouch is also handy for hanging it to dry after cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nooks &amp; crannies:  He very gently maneuvers into the most delicate of locations and without pinching can tidy up satisfactorily.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but its super gentle on sensitive skin and has consistent results and cleans easy</li>
            <li> Now, there&#x27;s no excuse, and I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor based on other Amazon reviews and I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> love that there is no long cord to the charger.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I replaced it with the exact same model.  </li>
            <li> and then surprise, becomes an epilator and yanks out your hair left and right in the most agonizing ways.</li>
            <li> I use a traditional razor on my underarms because I just can&#x27;t seem to get the right angle, but I think it would work for most people.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Make sure that you save the box when this comes so that you can ship it right back to the seller if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> my wife needed a shaver because of a blood condition,  it is light weight and easy to handle, it also holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle when I use it on my arms, armpits and even on my face</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, also.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable..</li>
            <li> very much thank you</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> If you are cleaning the shaver, you must be very gentle or it will break.  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much because it cuts close to the skin</li>
            <li> Operates very smoothly and is fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Like very much.</li>
            <li> Although a very, very light stubble may remain, it cannot be seen, only felt.</li>
            <li> It is very fast, but the shave is not close at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife, and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping??</li>
            <li> While the shave this unit gives isn&#x27;t as close as a disposable razor, it still left my underarms and legs very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is super easy and quick to use though so using it daily doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works good but won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 89 year old mother and it works fine for her.</li>
            <li> This shaver has done fine as far as shaving my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> Good razor (like any other razor) at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind some little nubs, this is a really good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, the battery holds its charge for quite a while, and it comes with a little travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a good shape and with information plus a little brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grab this and seconds later clean, smooth legs.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It works great, I hardly have any rash after shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Doing quick touch ups or being able to shave right before going somewhere, dry, is really a bonus to me.</li>
            <li> its pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Spend the few extra bucks for the slightly better version, I asked for it for Christmas and also like all the others have been much happier with it - and most importantly, it&#x27;s KEPT WORKING!</li>
            <li> I threw caution to the wind and committed my $16+change to the possibility of a bloodless shave for the first time in nine months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to get pretty close and didn&#x27;t rip or snag the skin.</li>
            <li> After my first shave with it, I still had hair.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely highly recommend this shaver!!</li>
            <li> Within the first week the pop up blade would no longer retract without alot of effort and then it stopped retracting at all.  </li>
            <li> I really like the shaver!</li>
            <li> What I really like about it is that it gives me NO bumps!</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave from these!</li>
            <li> I get a pretty close shave (comparable to a 3 blade venus razor)</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work you aren&#x27;t out too much!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love that I do not have to buy razor refills constantly</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought one sooner, VERY convenient!</li>
            <li> But I find that when I let leg hair grow a week, it actually gives a slightly better shave than just after 1-2 days of stubble.</li>
            <li> This was to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver</li>
            <li> The charging stand is also pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be charged for 12 hours before using the first time.</li>
            <li> I first owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the nippers on the front AND back.</li>
            <li> Economical as replacement blades and foils are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t charge it, haha!)  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to any college girl! :)</li>
            <li> , only God knows for sure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> It was not expensive and seems to shave well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; it&#x27;s a time saver and it delivered on what it said it does!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now bought 2 thinking that maybe the first one was a quality issue</li>
            <li> The first two times I used it</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a Remington</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li> the first day the switch to pop up the edger blade broke.</li>
            <li> and it gives a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> I do have to shave more frequently but it really doesn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li> She had been using a similar type shaver and claims this one is better.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted for a close shave without the scratch and irritation.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic, you should be ashamed of yourselves, or many be have your stuff MANUFACTURED BACK IN USA NOT CHINA</li>
            <li> , I have yet to recharge it since the first time (over 3 weeks ago)</li>
            <li> and I use it pretty often.  </li>
            <li> I PURCHASED FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER FOR MORE REASONS</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on my legs</li>
            <li> so if I ever decide to use it on the charger I can just go get one of the many extension cords in the house - it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> First off I have to add I have PCOS</li>
            <li> My first one was four years ago.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> definitely recommended. :)</li>
            <li> I hope they are not discontinued because I expect to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> and FAST!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I read reviews on several razors before making my decision.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it; my last razor had to be kept plugged in all the time and quit working after a year.</li>
            <li> It helps to go with the grain rather than against it at first.</li>
            <li> Not as close has a non-electric, but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> (when I have to remove that unwanted &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> Can I charge the charger first then charge the razor???</li>
            <li> Remington\\&quot; back in the 1980&#x27;s that got lost in one of my many moves.  </li>
            <li> but they should last more than a year or so....</li>
            <li> I got a pretty close shave with zero nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a similar model by Panasonic and was able to continue using that one almost 2 years before it died.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for the first time this week.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> im very satisfied,will buy again!</li>
            <li> as *first one disappeared.</li>
            <li> First, a note abut Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This the first electric razor that my wife has had.</li>
            <li> plus I saw it in a local store yesterday for $40 MORE than I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use the trimmer first before you use the close trimming foil.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 3 years and 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The extra flip-up blade at the front works okay,</li>
            <li> I put the order number of the products I ordered, in case you want to check first</li>
            <li> design, pretty color.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same area more than once.  </li>
            <li> The color is really pretty.</li>
            <li> The trimmer gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> But use a real razor if it is date night!</li>
            <li> It was her first electric razor</li>
            <li> held onto it on the off chance that I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that worked better, and went back to the store and purchased THIS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves shaver.  </li>
            <li> works very well for me!</li>
            <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $20 dollars but it isn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair pretty darn close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> no expensive blades and gels required.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and it worked pretty good for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> As I expected, its not like using a hand razor,but definately does a nice job if youre in a hurry</li>
            <li> After my first Panasonic ladies, which lasted 10 years, I tried a cheaper (bought in store) Remington.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a hand razor, but gets pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before you use it, don&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s on low battery.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> For my bikini area, it felt like it was pulling my hairs out and after the fact, it was almost like it cut a top layer of skin off as the area was reddened and sore as if the skin was open.  </li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> Seemed to shave pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well and can be used many times prior to a follow on charge.</li>
            <li> So, I guess if you want to keep things trimmed but not totally shaved, this works okay on the extended clipper setting.</li>
            <li> I shave with the cutter first</li>
            <li> but hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid cardio trainer.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I charged it to make sure it had enough battery</li>
            <li> and she likes it much better than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Although not expensive I would not purchase another one of these.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really really waterproof!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time for my bikini area and I am amazed by how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the value of this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this because razors were the same price or more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it in case I run out of disposable razors but my first choice will not be this.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works much better for sensitive skin than normal razors.</li>
            <li> Worked well at first.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a light on it that indicated battery level but even directly after charging it won&#x27;t consistently start.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I leave it on for several minutes and it magically begins to work</li>
            <li> This product came fast and well packaged!</li>
            <li> It really allows me to keep up with keeping the hair off!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t nick the skin like disposable razors do and it leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I can shave my underarms without prickly rashes and cuts as a result.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker, too, because it cuts well on the first pass</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, especially in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Like most electric shavers, it&#x27;s not the closest shave, but if you use it every couple of days, (instead of waiting until you have a forest), then it works well enough.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> For the first year I could get in about 3ish shaves in between charges.</li>
            <li> it is pretty quite.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty too.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s much better than the products of yesteryear, which is when I last used an electric device on my legs.</li>
            <li> It was her first time shaving and</li>
            <li> well worth the $20- highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I needed a shaver that would give me the ability to quickly get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning brush could be bigger and better bristles.</li>
            <li> I had the first one a bit longer and thought it was error, then again-</li>
            <li> She said it was better than her last and</li>
            <li> Give it a try..;)</li>
            <li> My bride really likes it!</li>
            <li> I wnated a electric razor I could recharge and be able to use with simple cleaning afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am able to get a shave close enough that I can wear shorts or a skirt</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a regular blade of course, but faster and more convenient.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> first cause</li>
            <li> I asked if she wanted me to help her for the first use she said no</li>
            <li> We did let it fully charge for 24 hrs first by the way.</li>
            <li> I purchased the exact same razor from Target because it was on sale for $17.99 because I wanted to be able to return it if It didn&#x27;t work out for me without paying return shipping since I&#x27;ve never tried an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor !  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Use it several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this razor 2 years ago, and it drastically changed my life.</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend this one to anyone interested in making the switch to electric.</li>
            <li> Finally, make sure that your razor is fully charged each time you use it, or you won&#x27;t be seeing it at 100%.</li>
            <li> I still get quite a bit on the bikini line but overall this razor has been great; the charge lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her first electric shaver</li>
            <li> Her first time shaving</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bite knee bones or ankles and manages armpits pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The generic razors at Target meet my needs much better than this did.</li>
            <li> I had the same results many of the 1 star raters had.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the final result is still just okay.</li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor</li>
            <li> Cuts close the first time.</li>
            <li> I did everything that first reviewer said to do</li>
            <li> This razor eliminated that problem from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had an electric leg shaver many years ago that left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> It is the first</li>
            <li> I love the simple charger.</li>
            <li> this is not for that baby soft smooth shave you get with a razor.</li>
            <li> I have a Remington that cost more and only could be used on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It provided an okay shave but the blades felt like tiny bites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved in the shower with my venus razor and saving cream, but the hot water at the house</li>
            <li> but so much faster!</li>
            <li> If you use the trimmer first and then the shaver, it shouldnt pull.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as an actual razor, but it&#x27;s definitely more convenient.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a first razor.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m, also, pleased at how quiet it is and the ease of cleaning the razor after using it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this razor on Amazon, received one for Christmas several years ago and it died on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this shaver!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the shower, a razor takes the same amount of time and works a bajillion times better.</li>
            <li> This is pretty close to me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok if you forgot to shave your legs in the shower, but won&#x27;t replace a traditional razor for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first electronic shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This razor is equal to the one I replaced and perhaps even better.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I never owned one before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the shape of that armpit, because I have used the razor every night since then and the same spot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the shape of that armpit, because I have used the razor every night since then and the same spot</li>
            <li> Is the exact same shaver that I have purchased in-store for a much higher price - AND the shipping was free which is always an attraction for me!</li>
            <li> If buying the same thing twice in a 1 year span isn&#x27;t convincing, then I don&#x27;t know what is.  </li>
            <li> I got a second one because that was a better buy than just the parts I needed.  </li>
            <li> Was okay, nothing to write home about until the last time.</li>
            <li> I thought I was not charging it properly, so I made sure it was well plugged-in.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver which is why I&#x27;m on my 3rd purchase.  </li>
            <li> The recharger plugs into a wall outlet, if this isn&#x27;t convenient for you, then you most likely won&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Rainy!</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a better shave from a traditional shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love it, getting another for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> My daughter took the first one I bought so</li>
            <li> This was not my first Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> A real winner!</li>
            <li> However, the only thing I&#x27;m worried is that there are so many reviews saying how it dies after a while, hopefully that won&#x27;t happen soon.</li>
            <li> That is a big plus. :)</li>
            <li> it for 12 hours before first use).</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than my last one for legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> It cuts close for an electric shaver, it keeps its charge for long periods of time, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it lasted a long time, so I clearly followed the simple cleaning instructions (and loved the two-sided brush</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;****I recommend using the trimmer first if the hair you are shaving is any longer than 2-3</li>
            <li> The first time was after, instead of cleaning it with a damp rag, I dunked it under a faucet (still don&#x27;t fully understand what happened).</li>
            <li> I have had this for many years and it finally broke.</li>
            <li> Make sure you know what type of tool you need, it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well until it just stopped working one day, within a month of the warranty expiring.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> My first mistake was that I thought it was going to do an amazin job.</li>
            <li> it gets pretty close</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> charger is a small square brick that plugs into a top spot on a power outlet and the razor stands upright on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Really like this electric razor!  </li>
            <li> and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for weeks and it give a pretty close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> With they being said, I bought this on a whim for myself first.</li>
            <li> Seems like many are having the same problem.  </li>
            <li> First experience with an electric razor</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do the job it said.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is low, I am looking for a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most convenient thing to have, especially when I&#x27;m in a rush.  </li>
            <li> I then got dressed and ran to my nearest department store and purchased this exact shaver.  </li>
            <li> First apply some lubricant like baby oil to the areas you want to shave.  </li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to foil top once we clipped back the longer hair with the comb end.</li>
            <li> how much faster it is to shave!</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product, just be aware of snipping.</li>
            <li> I used it without charging it for the first time.</li>
            <li> (For the love of all that is holy, if you decide to try this &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34;, please don&#x27;t actually try it except as a razor.</li>
            <li> It actually shaves better than the one I had.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very well worth for its price.</li>
            <li> It initially gives a pretty close shave, but you may have to use it more often than you would a manual razor.</li>
            <li> The last replacement seems to be working better even though I had to reset it by turning the power off twice yesterday alone.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> And because I am having to shave more often my chin is left feeling sore.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted a year.</li>
            <li> Upon my first use with this product I saw the difference in how close it shaved my chin.  </li>
            <li> I use the foil blade first</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic Ladies razor I have used over many years.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a cord leading to the charger from the shaver, rather than having the entire unit perched on top of it on the wall as it charged (and therefore unusable until it was charged).</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it the shaver tickled.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I get for myself</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 more for teenage daughters because they kept taking mine.</li>
            <li> but this was the first that has been consistently reliable.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for her first razor she likes it</li>
            <li> trimmer works well, but cuts pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> for a first time shave it is alright</li>
            <li> I can get pretty close and</li>
            <li> I bought 2 for step-daughters last Christmas, they love them.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased a Panasonic electric razor.  </li>
            <li> This is my first try</li>
            <li> I like my shave to be pretty close</li>
            <li> HAVE to use my trimmer first and then shave with a man&#x27;s mach 3.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Does the job, easy to clean and charge lasts a long while.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and does not sound like a lawn mower.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, it arrived already charged, and I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO LIVE WITH HAIRY LEGS ANYMORE!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomics: For dry shaving and washing, it&#x27;s very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomics: For dry shaving and washing, it&#x27;s very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> So far this one has remained sharp and is a quick and easy way to buzz off real quick before you go.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a very good job, only making the hair slightly shorter.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, the razor is a nice pink (great for a girl), light weight and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> He chose this particular one because of all the other good reviews it got</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that despite being less than the cost of replacement blades for my former shaver, it has stood up to the task so far and has done fantastic!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s super durable</li>
            <li> Anyway, a great product and hope my new one lasts me as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it&#x27;s not the kind of shaver where you can simply pull the battery out and buy a new one to insert in.</li>
            <li> It is too large ---- unless one has a very large face.</li>
            <li> This does work well enough that I will continue to use it as long as needed and is good for a quick shave if you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get you super smooth legs like you will get with a regular blade-razor, but it will take all the hair off.</li>
            <li> I love that I can shave real fast, rise it off, and leave it to dry.</li>
            <li> My old one was very bulky and this one is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and since I am an easy bleeder, 4 blade razors kept nicking me and became more trouble.  </li>
            <li> But that is the only thing I would change about this super cheap option</li>
            <li> I use this dry (not in the shower), and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gets a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> I have had previous electric razors but this one really does do a good job.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and highly recommend it for someone looking for a decent electric razor on a thrifty budget.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not shave close, my legs fell like 1-2 days stubble right after a very thorough shave, and it cuts my legs -</li>
            <li> Because of the lympnode dissection I can no longer use real shaver on my right arm or underarm.</li>
            <li> The shaver really does need to be fully charged to work right.</li>
            <li> it does not get a super close shave as would a normal razor blade would.</li>
            <li> Works great so far, only used it a few times, but way better than a razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what any other reviewer says, best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li> But, the price is great for this brand, and so, when my old ones were becoming dull, it is either replace the blades or get a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and a lot of it, so it clogs up most razors, but I haven&#x27;t had trouble with this one getting clogged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and has a trimmer on it to do bakkini line which is a bonus, and stays charged for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Im surprised how powerful it is!</li>
            <li> This gets pretty close, definitely not as close as a razor, but good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The item has to be in its complete original packaging-</li>
            <li> Nice to save shower time that used to go for endless rinsing of the cartridge, too.</li>
            <li> I tried other shavers and now my Wahl is catching dust.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about an extremely close shave, I just don&#x27;t want to feel like there is a silky mane of a braidable length on my legs, and it would be nice to go to the gym and not have to warn the trainer to avert his eyes when I have to lift my arms.</li>
            <li> The blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> It does however still work after having the battery completely run down which is more than I can say for the one that handled better.</li>
            <li> This little shaver came up at the top of the list with a decent number of stars and several fairly good reviews.</li>
            <li> I got zero cuts and maybe some very mild hair tugging  on the super long hair, but everything else was a breeze!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was sensitive to my skin and won&#x27;t give me nicks and that itchy feeling after a clean shave.</li>
            <li> worked fine for 4 months, i barely used it, may be once a month or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usable wet or dry, which is nice, but I got much better results when lathered up in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - While it can be used in the shower (wet), it honestly feels better on your skin dry.</li>
            <li> My old one always had hair in it when I lifted the blades out to clean.</li>
            <li> The entire top of the razor pops off by pushing 2 buttons on the side of the head, making it easy to get to the interior for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works for the most part, but she said a regular razor blade still gives a much closer shave for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin, and I thought after buying the others that razor burn was to be expected...</li>
            <li> The trimmer does absolutely nothing, you&#x27;re better off using the actual razor</li>
            <li> It takes AT MOST 2 passes over the same section to have a very smooth/close shave.</li>
            <li> Most razors are so expensive that you would think this won&#x27;t be good for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a very hair female mostly on my legs and neither lands</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but was hoping that in the many years since I had last used an electric razor that they since improved the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.i bought this for my daughtet and she has  used it several different ways</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver for the price!</li>
            <li> but they do appear to jut out at a higher elevation than the rather large foil head...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, since each successive shaver I&#x27;ve purchased over the years has been less efficient, but I was pleasantly surprised--especially because of the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver for a first time user, like a teen not ready for razors, gentle on skin and shaves close, would buy.</li>
            <li> Found this one highly recommended and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is actually my 3rd one, the original Brand I have bought in the past is no longer available &amp; it cost a lot more!</li>
            <li> Having only one useable hand makes shaving a problem;  this shaver does the job - clean underarms!</li>
            <li> If it lasts, I intend on buying more as gifts for my equally lazy friends! :)</li>
            <li> Cuts close - works very well wet, and/or dry - easy to clean - Charges quickly and is easy to store.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, just as good as when I used a plain razor.  </li>
            <li> no, product is very good, but i want to notify potential european  buyers of this product that it can  work only in USA 110 voltage range.</li>
            <li> there were lots of positive reviews for this razor</li>
            <li> Plenty of positive reviews for the price..</li>
            <li> I am more of a in-the-moment kind of a gal and will just shave my legs when I get in the tub, old habits die hard.</li>
            <li> It can be a great device, but if it&#x27;s not always going to be like that, it&#x27;s just not a good match for me.</li>
            <li> I shave pretty much head to toe</li>
            <li> I have used electric women&#x27;s razors for probably 25-30 years -- and they sure have come a long way over the decades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this razor absolutely gives a shave that feels exactly like I used a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this razor shaved - pretty close.  </li>
            <li> While it worked very well for the first 2 weeks of using it, I could not get the razor to charge at all after that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter weight and gives a closer shave than the first two.</li>
            <li> Great present for any young lady starting to shave her legs.</li>
            <li> Other shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and finally quit charging and didn&#x27;t cut that great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I would recommend this product pretty readily.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use on my underarms, legs, belly and bikini area and it works well on pretty much all the areas, but not 100%.  </li>
            <li> I have really used it a lot and is nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to write this review, since I wanted to be absolutely sure before I gave it the glowing recommendation I felt it deserved.</li>
            <li> catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that the shape of your legs, your skin type and body hair type, how long it&#x27;s charged and</li>
            <li> catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that the shape of your legs, your skin type and body hair type, how long it&#x27;s charged and</li>
            <li> It holds a charge longer than other shavers I bought over the years, the shave is close, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> , this is the first time I have bought the 3 blade wet/dry shave, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far so GREAT!</li>
            <li> this is much better than using a razor, and hopefully it will save some money in the long run.</li>
            <li> and this one is the first one that I really feel does that.  </li>
            <li> There is stubble by the next day, but just a few minutes with this shaver makes my legs as good as smooth</li>
            <li> So far it has been way better than my old one so thanks to the dog</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would be cheaply made, but it is of better quality than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The shaver fits my hand good, and the charger is small and convenient.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is also far more economical than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This is good size for your hand (Its small).</li>
            <li> Personally I think it works a bit better on dry skin, but if I forget to do it first thing, I can just as easily bring it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it just to shave armpits and probably average about once a week, so not very long, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Right now I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have an older model and was thinking how much better could this possibly be.  </li>
            <li> It does not give you the super close shave of a regular razor but will do for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> Nice and cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive Remington razors and this one by far is the best I have owned and it was only 1/3 of the price of what I paid for the Remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have said the same thing that this wet/dry shaver is just OK.</li>
            <li> Although it may be a hassle to clean every couple of weeks, it&#x27;s way better than any plain razor i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I think it works better dry.</li>
            <li> And when it needs it, stick the top under running water and then let it sit on a towel for 12 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> :) it doesn&#x27;t give off that dry leg feeling where you need aloe vera</li>
            <li> I found it does do a better job using shaving cream vs dry.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I was using a men&#x27;s electric shaver, and it worked okay for my underarms, but for legs it was just not efficient and didn&#x27;t even give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that I have super DUPER sensitive skin and there are areas that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain</li>
            <li> goes easily from my face to my legs, and i&#x27;m italian.</li>
            <li> so I could keep an eye on him, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how close of a shave I would get with a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> It worked ok as I guess dry shavers do...</li>
            <li> I quickly get a shave nearly as close a razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it dry where I have better lighting than in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The shave is smoother, the outlet adapter keeps it constantly charged, and the cleaning is easy.  </li>
            <li> Also it is easy enough for my husband to work, so he can help me shave my legs</li>
            <li> I agree that it cuts better dry</li>
            <li> Easy and simple for her to use.</li>
            <li> I used it dry and was able to sit while doing it.</li>
            <li> (just make sure your legs are actually dry and not damp, otherwise it will hop around).  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin - shaving makes me break out into hives....</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Quiet when using it and easy to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> This one is half the price and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> It worked great at first but after a month or so ,it began to work poorly.</li>
            <li> Better to use the dry feature and not in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> - I love that I can use this item in the shower as well as using it dry -</li>
            <li> Cleaning a breeze with parts that come apart and snap back together easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the charger or that there is no indicator when the charging is complete but for the price I really like it!</li>
            <li> I use it dry just to be safe.</li>
            <li> We used it dry because I feel it has better slip that way.</li>
            <li> The plastic cap to protect the foil does not allow for the drainage of water so be sure to let it dry thoroughly before putting the cap on.</li>
            <li> Cleaning isn&#x27;t easy, bit overall</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin on my legs, so shaving</li>
            <li> If your leg hairs are long then be sure to clip them first before using the main foil &amp; you</li>
            <li> Good for every part of your body, including your delicate lady bits ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last a good long time&lt;</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good too, and gets the long hairs to a short length that can be shaved.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on past reviews - it really works good.  </li>
            <li> They loved it as it shaves really close without the fear of a cut or nick that could cause excessive bleeding.  </li>
            <li> tells you how long the first one lasted, Impressive- I wouldnt let her take it a second time - other reviews posted.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to friends of mine</li>
            <li> I would buy it again in a heartbeat because of it&#x27;s versatility and smart design.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs in certain areas</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t avoid using it for pain reasons.</li>
            <li> but it certainly wasn&#x27;t mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I do that, and don&#x27;t mind the shaver knocking off a good bit of the cream on surrounding areas not yet shaved, I get a very smooth and close shave with only minimal tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> where do you purchase something that has hair and fingerprints on it and its suppose to be new?!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, inexpensive to purchase, sount not very loud,  simple to recharge, light weight easy to handle either left or right hand, provides wet or dry shaving (can be used in bath tub or shower)...</li>
            <li> This is the first one that really leaves my skin smooth without having to repeatedly go back over the areas.  </li>
            <li> Worth it for the price as I have sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs, do not experience that anymore using this product now!</li>
            <li> A long time ago I had a nice, expensive electric razor that worked great.</li>
            <li> Gives a consistently closer shave especially when using it wet with a good shave lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried it in both wet and dry conditions, and with shaving creams as well as conditioner and it held up great under all conditions.</li>
            <li> i have not tried it wet but works great dry.</li>
            <li> It gives a great close shave, both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> also tried it myself on my face and does work great wet or dry</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s great as both a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great wet and dry, as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great razor, dry or wet</li>
            <li> Thankfully it works great on both wet and dry skin providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> Unless you do a super heavy shaving session, just remove the top and rinse under running water.</li>
            <li> I also really like the convenience of being able to shave when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> product is far superior to my previous shaver which was a Braun.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is much easier to move than the previous model, so that is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin and red hair (pretty much blonde hair on my legs).</li>
            <li> This isnt good for long lasting hair free skin its like a regular razor</li>
            <li> This means shaving the back of my neck of the fine hair that grows there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple of times and its fine.</li>
            <li> only problem is that it takes a bit of maneuvering to shave the nethers with since this model comes with no bikini attachment, but it still did it&#x27;s job fine.</li>
            <li> My mom has the same thing and hers works and charges fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs just barely stubbly, but they look clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I still use a regular razor on my pits but this works fine on my legs.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs presentable and smooth, and better yet, only takes about five minutes for both legs, dry shave.  </li>
            <li> It is starting out just fine.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a more expensive shaver when it died, and like this better!</li>
            <li> I used to use a regular disposable razor and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only quick and convenient, but it gets the job done without any pain, cuts, or burning/itching sensation!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this inexpensive shaver and uses it mainly for her legs!</li>
            <li> It does a pretty decent job of shaving but leaves stubble</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent electric shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> so i will say that first cause it was the main reason i bought the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I actually like using it too as a quick shave option!  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use a &#x27;ladies&#x27; shaver on my face, but most of what I read seemed to say that if anything ladies razors were simply more advanced and less harsh on the skin than men&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> Its been an amazing little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my 14 yr old daughter, this is her first razor ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think the only think that would make this shaver better is if it came with guards where you can just trim to a certain length(in certain areas where you might not want to be completely hairless ;P)</li>
            <li> Its is pretty simple to clean as well.  </li>
            <li> I have never used this razor while my legs are wet, but it works great on dry legs!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product myself since I bought it as a gift, however, I do own a similar one and it cuts down my time shaving significantly and saves me on having to buy razors and shave gels.  </li>
            <li> Some people would argue it doesn&#x27;t get close enough but to me its perfect because even tho it doesn&#x27;t get all the way to the skin it shaves off unwanted longer or short thick black hairs really quick without having to jump in the shower or get water everywhere, especially if you are rushing out the door and the outfit that looks best after changing 5 times shows legs or underarms a quick trim down and slap some lotion on you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with a little brush and pouch for storage.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver at a terrific price.  </li>
            <li> If you do these things you will have a convenient little gadget you can use on the fly without big productions!</li>
            <li> but this little shaver has really held its own and it was much cheaper than all the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> I have used the ES207P for years, but earlier this year, I decided to try the Panasonic ES2216, which I assumed, because it cost a little more, would be a better razor.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s not the silky smooth shave you get with a real razor, but it&#x27;s totally serviceable in a pinch.</li>
            <li> First of all it detaches from the space-saving charger base/cord, seems to hold a charge for long periods, &amp; works fabulously in the shower or out.  </li>
            <li> Though not as smooth as what can be achieved with a standard razor, it was very close.</li>
            <li> The price for this razor is comparable to what you would pay for a year&#x27;s worth of disposables so if this lasts a year I don&#x27;t feel like I have lost anything, nor have I created more waste than disposables would.  </li>
            <li> After years (and a huge expenditure of cash) of having my legs waxed, the downturn in the economy put such indulgences out of my budget.</li>
            <li> I really would like to have a much shorter charging time, but it does hold a charge through quite a number of shaves and I try to be mindful about charging it so that I have it ready when I need it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut myself, or run out of battery time and it shaves close enough that my legs and under arms are smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the price and the reviews, but I can&#x27;t quite figure out what blades to use where seeing as all three of them are attached at once and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really expect it to be.</li>
            <li> This works really well....doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I&#x27;d like, but still works well.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it really irritates my skin while leaving a stubble.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been in my possession for an hour, but it has made me have faith in the virtues of smooth legs again.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the bruises on my elbows from shampooing my hair, but my very being protests when I decide the fur level has gotten out-of-control and</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This has saved me so much money on razors.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t cut ..rolls over but doesn&#x27;t really cut at all.</li>
            <li> &quot; ones really work and I was a guy?)</li>
            <li> I wish that the charger did not take up so much space on my wall outlet.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much in shaving cream and razors though, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could have it replaced, but I&#x27;ve really fallen out of the habit of using it/trying to use it, so I haven&#x27;t done any research on that.  </li>
            <li> This razor left my legs as smooth as could be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric razor, so I really have nothing to compare this to.</li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> Just plug it in, charge it up, and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> Really saved me so much embarrassment during swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Shaves very well without pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> The shaver fits in the hand very well and does hug the shape of the legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> in all, I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> I do really like this electric shaver</li>
            <li> There is no cord or real docking station.  </li>
            <li> but maybe I will have better luck with using it to shave wet..</li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor and shaving cream really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> really recommend this as a replacement for the Remmingtons.</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> The feature of cleaning under running water is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Delivery by Amazon was fast.</li>
            <li> The same day I shave with it, my boyfriend thinks my legs are as smooth as a razor-shave.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really save much</li>
            <li> I just bought this one and it really works..</li>
            <li> Of course, if you want a really close shave you need to use a razor</li>
            <li> but this is really close for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to shop for in a ladies shaver</li>
            <li> The Ladies shaver came wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> The blades and foils are much easier to change than they were on the Remingtons also.</li>
            <li> Those triple and quadruple razor blades made today shave really, really close.</li>
            <li> Get a really close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I will say that it gets a much closer shave when in the shower and using conditioner</li>
            <li> another just didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always ready to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  </li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> , it provides a close shave without the fear of cuts and the precision tool works very well.  </li>
            <li> i use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and cleans up very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is exited to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It is really reasonable and a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well and took up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> The red light is on</li>
            <li> It was very affordable and lived up to my expectations and hopes.</li>
            <li> but it obviously isn&#x27;t going to get you waxing smooth.</li>
            <li> The Panasponic shaver works well but is not as gentle around my ankles as the Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> I shaved one underarm in the shower with my real shaver.</li>
            <li> It was well shipped and arrived incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think it had been used and repackaged or anything, and I examined it really closely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaved my legs very well.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very close shave without the irritation of razor burn.  </li>
            <li> My experience with Panasonic has been that they make quality stuff so either my shaver is an unusual circumstance or this is the result of purchasing one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; lady shavers...</li>
            <li> and I really needed to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> It works very well on me.</li>
            <li> and I like it very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as smooth as a regular razor</li>
            <li> I could actually FEEL that I was getting a closer shave, and now my legs feel so smooth</li>
            <li> It does tend to catch your skin if you go too fast, but it doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or razor burn on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping time was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> When you actually factor in the cost of buying disposable razors and blades this shaver is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> I found it to work very well.</li>
            <li> but smooth enough to shave underarms.</li>
            <li> While it worked, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The last electric razor I bought was 10 years + ago in Germany in duty free....</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a five-star produce.</li>
            <li> However it does not give a very close shave</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have to give her much instruction.</li>
            <li> But it worked really really well.</li>
            <li> She says that it works better than she expected.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> We are back to the cheap plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Handles very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my legs</li>
            <li> it is a very well working shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I need to replace the charger but then decided to get the whole unit since it it cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is fully wet and it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Two of the products which I really like so much</li>
            <li> I really apologized with all of you.</li>
            <li> It really works well</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> None have meet her expectations in confort and closeness but this very inexpensive Ladies razor.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold its charge very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> She says it works very well.</li>
            <li> charging stand is cordless and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> second replacement I purchased was another Remington - model WDF4830 Smooth &amp; Silky.  </li>
            <li> AND it is much quieter -</li>
            <li> okay, you do need to be careful and watch the direction so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair.</li>
            <li> very Eco -pack n go.</li>
            <li> The price was also very competitive.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Not only did it work fantastic, I didnt have to be concerned about cuts and razor burns from which was a concern after surgery.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive and works just as well as the one that I paid twice as much for....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to charge for me, the light stayed red.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell how close of a shave it provided</li>
            <li> I really like the longer shape.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this electric shaver!</li>
            <li> Having just had surgery and cannot use a blade razor for 3 months, I was bummed because it is unusual to find an electric that works wee.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works very well, however, when it did work.</li>
            <li> So - I don&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for my legs since it is much easier than shaving with a razor blade and will probably continue using it for my underarms</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a closer shave</li>
            <li> Just OK..not very powful</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I really like that the charger is compact.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving you legs so much easier</li>
            <li> The price is quite reasonable and I think I&#x27;ve already made up for the razors I would have bought.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate its charging station.</li>
            <li> It does get overwhelmed if too much hair is lingering on the head.</li>
            <li> fast shipment of product.</li>
            <li> From the shining reviews I guess I just expected more from this razor.</li>
            <li> Tried alot of razors, happy to finally one that works for such a low price!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> but my leg hair grows fast</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you read the instructions about hair length and settings to maximize it&#x27;s effectiveness and so far no crazy bumps either....</li>
            <li> It is always charged and ready for use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> only way I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this is if you have no problem with razors and like having really really smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now, and I use it maybe twice a week, and find that it shaves me very close.</li>
            <li> For the price it works better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Close Curves Ladies Shaver works very well for under arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was not able to find it on Target store shelves as I had before, so I was very pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li> Ya know sometimes you just need a fast shave..  </li>
            <li> Really pulls on the hair when it clips.  </li>
            <li> I my wife is very please, and loves the convenience of shaving with out water.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get close</li>
            <li> Now, this may be too much to share</li>
            <li> It cut the leg hair REALLY close and did not cause any abrasions or rashes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten as much use out of this as I&#x27;d like, but when I do use it, it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very durable because I&#x27;ve dropped it a number of times without damage.</li>
            <li> The red light never turns off or changes color or nothing</li>
            <li> However, the blades &amp; the set cost almost as much as the whole razor.  </li>
            <li> in fact much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> razor shaves well,and closely and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended to friends including the parents of a daughter who wants to start shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not as smooth as an actual blade.  </li>
            <li> I do have a fast growing course beard.</li>
            <li> I followed the charging directions but for some reason it won&#x27;t turn on even though the light on the wall charger says it is connected properly.</li>
            <li> but, really, those aren&#x27;t the ones I&#x27;m worried about.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Works fast when you don&#x27;t have time to shave.</li>
            <li> My wife charged it and tried it and said it comparied very well against hers</li>
            <li> She is very hairy and has been teased at school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times because I have missed spots and it seems to do a very acceptable job.</li>
            <li> It just neatly sits in the cradle ready to be used.  </li>
            <li> No, my legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I use a blade, but they are close enough if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Much like a nightlight is set-up.  </li>
            <li> This, like all electric shavers I have tried do not shave legs nor arms very well.  </li>
            <li> Holds its charge and is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that much wight hanging on an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor shaves really close.  </li>
            <li> My daughter says this is working very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> Even if I sweat just a bit, or have too much lotion on, it clogs</li>
            <li> Very convenient to grip, maneuver, and charge.</li>
            <li> This has really saved me so much time.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this razor</li>
            <li> it is durable and very usable</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a very close shave on whatever body part it is applied to.</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> Such a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li> This electric razor has saved me from so much</li>
            <li> So YES highly recommend this, matter of fact I might even get one for myself!</li>
            <li> I have some short hairs around my belly button and it does get rid of those and leave me smooth there</li>
            <li> and i really cant spend that much time in the shower</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t handle it, it hurts too much to use</li>
            <li> It is very practical.</li>
            <li> Works very well, holds a charge, and gives my legs a close shave.</li>
            <li> It was fully charged and ready to go .</li>
            <li> Tons of power,  smooth shave with almost zero chance of cuts, holds charge for several shaves</li>
            <li> This shaver has made summer (and shaving) so much easier for me</li>
            <li> my experience no electric shaver gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to have polka-dotted legs at my brother&#x27;s wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whole thing pulls out if additional cleaning is needed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> (haha).</li>
            <li> I think I saved that much on shaving cream alone by using it.</li>
            <li> Very please with it.</li>
            <li> but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> then you will be really</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember much of the results.</li>
            <li> Works well, light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li> Visually no hair, but not as smooth of course as a blade.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something reasonable to use for 8 weeks pre and post surgery, but the shaver works so well</li>
            <li> and it took all the hair off and left a smooth leg.  </li>
            <li> , I like it that way, it saves much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor does, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to.</li>
            <li> Fast shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but the shave wasn&#x27;t quite as close as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> and it is fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Does everything that the manufacturer said it does and does it very well.</li>
            <li> that is why this shaver is really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are one that wants a really really close shave, this would not be for you.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> This one has a much smoother shave.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t understand is why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as the whole shaver costs.</li>
            <li> and it proved very functional.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always ready to use when kept on the charger.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> This shaver holds the charge very well.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the remington straight head shaver like this.  </li>
            <li> Very feminine looking.  </li>
            <li> She says it works very well</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> This takes all of about 10 seconds but leaves my skin smooth without any red marks.</li>
            <li> but this shaver works really well.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas gift, she really likes it a lot, it was what she was looking for.  </li>
            <li> But it took forever, and it hurt, and a old-fashioned twin-blade manual razor works much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that it doesn&#x27;t really give you that &amp;#34;close</li>
            <li> I get that close shave experience, it does it job fast</li>
            <li> now I won&#x27;t have to do that nearly as much..</li>
            <li> Perhaps for others with lighter or thinner hair this would be enough to use as a primary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Rechargable, so no batteries and is ready when I need it.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to a real razor.</li>
            <li> This razor really pulled my hairs when I used it.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient and does the job, but always feels like the day after a shave with a razor for me, I never get that just shaved smoothness feeling.</li>
            <li> I tend not to ever trust someone when they claim a product is water proof, as it never truly is really.</li>
            <li> When the blades spin fast, friction is reduced.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor because you can use it in the shower or not.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is so much quicker in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> So after probably hundreds of hours of use, I don&#x27;t really blame it for dying without any notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found using electric shavers to be very convenient.  </li>
            <li> This one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Comparing to how much I spend on razors a week/two weeks</li>
            <li> that really did the job</li>
            <li> but it no longer does its job very well.  </li>
            <li> just received it yesterday and tried it out straight away.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like my shaver</li>
            <li> A reasonable price</li>
            <li> When I use this, my legs are smooth enough that they do not feel prickly when they touch in bed.</li>
            <li> and it works really well on under arms.</li>
            <li> Works great on my bikini and underarms, but I have relatively thin hair on my legs, so it didn&#x27;t work so well for that.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see scratching your legs up</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t need a bikini attachment.</li>
            <li> Very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> but if you go with the hair it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much.</li>
            <li> Does not make legs as smooth as regular shaving</li>
            <li> It was truly much more than I expected</li>
            <li> My wife really really really really really really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li> I recommend it so highly that I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for my mother!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I decided that the 12 dollars that I might spend trying to replace the one part that may not be the answer would be better spent in another shaver.</li>
            <li> I really like this,easy and fast...</li>
            <li> Works very well but haven&#x27;t used it in &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li> Gives you a very close shave without burning.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well bit plugging it to recharge uses a whole strip.</li>
            <li> with absolutely none of the resulting irritation.</li>
            <li> Both times I thought it was a goner for real.</li>
            <li> Has not been used much as of now.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this item.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve shaved with a razor and that&#x27;s all I really care about.</li>
            <li> and now she wants one too.</li>
            <li> fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is always ready.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Almost did not purchase because price was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> When I called the warranty department, they said I had to mail the whole shaver to their MCAllen, TX, store at MY expense.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really messed up about that is what woman wants to receive hair removal products for Christmas?</li>
            <li> So why these things are available only at Christmas is beyond me.</li>
            <li> i absolutely feel hope.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> so I picked one up for her on amazon too and her shaving experience was the same but closer to a smooth finish since she used hers in the shower.</li>
            <li> It shaves close to the skin but is not abrasive and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> However, speaking on behalf of men using this product, it does not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I really like the shave this razor gives.  </li>
            <li> Much quicker.  </li>
            <li> i have too much hair on my face.</li>
            <li> felt no stubble and left my face smooth</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s way too much of a hassle for an $18 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have always used a Remington shaver but did not want to spend that much.</li>
            <li> Think he enjoys my shaver as much as I do</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> Very close shave, almost as close as a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> You plug the whole thing into the wall and wait like over night for it to charge.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted it.</li>
            <li> I was ready to cry my heart</li>
            <li> and now I just really really like it</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and a straight blade causes a blood bath</li>
            <li> Rechargeable and wet safe.</li>
            <li> Very close shave too</li>
            <li> Very have with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and gentle.</li>
            <li> Very goog deal.</li>
            <li> This is very embarrassing for women.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s intimate groomer.  </li>
            <li> But I WILL say that the shave is really close considering its not razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really course hair on my chin and it literally becomes a beard if I don&#x27;t remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I feel that it works very well.</li>
            <li> It still charges because the red light goes on when I plug it in but doesnt work...</li>
            <li> I always use this in the shower, so definitely glad it is usable in wet conditions.  </li>
            <li> (idk how much it was charged)</li>
            <li> Works very well for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used to really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> So much easier.  </li>
            <li> I may razor shave throughout the summer for that smooth shiny look and feel (even if brief),</li>
            <li> Too much skin nicking</li>
            <li> If you do it wet, make dang sure you use soap or shaving cream, not just water.</li>
            <li> I get a fast, close shave.  </li>
            <li> The bikini area trimmer that pops up also works very well.  </li>
            <li> Shaves real well and close.</li>
            <li> Only problem is there is not a base with a cord.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot as yet.</li>
            <li> Very compact to store.  </li>
            <li> Works even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It really works well on my hair and skin type.</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t get a really close shave</li>
            <li> but it is so much easier on your skin than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Really does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have a vein problem and can never use a straight edge again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is very compact - holds a charge for days (as I don&#x27;t leave it</li>
            <li> plugged into an outlet all the time) - and provides a very close shave on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> becAUse that really helps to give you a cleaner and smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> it is really cheap and gross</li>
            <li> all in all I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not shave very closely or handle contour changes very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter too much since I&#x27;m in my thirties and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow like it did in my teens.  </li>
            <li> was really expecting this thing to choke and die on my leg hair (never mind my bikini line), but here it is ready to go again.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This razor really provides a close shave when pressed for time.</li>
            <li> I got this not expecting to really like it .</li>
            <li> Gives A Very Close Shave..</li>
            <li> They never cut very close, and it always felt like I needed to shave.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So when the battery finally gave out after several years I bought another Remington, the closest model I could find to the one I liked which was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it&#x27;s doing pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> so if anything changes in the near future, I&#x27;ll be sure to change my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I need to be extremely careful as far as picking any kind of product.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace my old shaver - this one was only one I could find with most of the features I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I guess it is OK but not like my old one that finally died after 35 years</li>
            <li> But, she refuses to use it on more sensitive areas because it pulls hair occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brand names, but, Panasonic makes electric razors giving, by far, the most smoothest shaves ever!  </li>
            <li> will use it now as I spent the money but will go back to use disposable shavers in summer when I need a good shaving result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few electric razors over the years, and none have worked liked this one.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a good deal for at least 2 yr.</li>
            <li> It works well but is kind of heavy; I like the rechargeable feature which is the reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li> Its a good razor😊 for everyone who used it as a regular razor for their legs are not really thinking💁</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got sturdy construction and a nice contoured, heavy feel in hand.</li>
            <li> I Will Be Buying Two More In The Near Future..</li>
            <li> If it starts to pull or run slow I plug it in for 24 hours and it shaves good again.</li>
            <li> And I guess it would be nice if the surface area of the shaver was larger in order to do legs more quickly, but I guess it&#x27;s comparable to a regular razor, so I&#x27;m probably getting a little greedy here!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, I thought if I try a new band name maybe it just  may  work as good or better than my old one I had for so many years(for years)</li>
            <li> Obviously the wet method will shave closer, but most of the time the dry works just fine!!</li>
            <li> Razor burn, pulling, and pinching on any surface that isn&#x27;t basically flat and any hair that isn&#x27;t fine.</li>
            <li> Our 90 year old recipient loves it for her chin!!!</li>
            <li> so I saw this and tried it and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely use my regular razor or wax anymore.</li>
            <li> I have a very rare condition called aquagenic pruritus, which is essentially an allergy to water, or to water drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin is quick and easy to use the only downside its the weird charger that is a square instead of a cable so that takes space in the wall outlet</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry, but have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re sure your skin is either completely dry, or wet and lathered (in other words, damp skin causes pulling) this shaver is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not a very powerful shaver, it works better when it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is not very expensive.</li>
            <li> You definitely can not compare it to one of the high end shavers and if you have fine hairs like i do on my legs</li>
            <li> shaved well and easily even when the hair was quite long, ~2 weeks of no shaving.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, close shave, and keeps a charge for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> Shaver is really easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> so long I forgot what its like to have easy time shaving.</li>
            <li> You can use it dry or wet, easy to use, and safe.</li>
            <li> so long it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how long it will keep a charge but is easy to recharge</li>
            <li> I love this shaver for a quick dry touch up shave, especially on my legs.  </li>
            <li> After trying many other brands, this one really did the JOB.</li>
            <li> Many companies today seem to make things smaller or not as sturdy as the old versions,  that is why it is so good to see the new Panasonic has the same quality that I expected.</li>
            <li> It cuts down so much time in the shower and while it may not be the suuuuuper smooth shave you get with a manual razor, it&#x27;s pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> It did my underarms even better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been safe with sharp objects.  </li>
            <li> This works better than other shavers I tried.  </li>
            <li> My original 5 star review would have remained had it not died on me after only 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> It was close enough of a shave to feel smooth and soft the first day.  </li>
            <li> and she said she likes this much better than her other one.  </li>
            <li> I guess I agree with most of the other reviews here.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t have any experience with other shavers to be able to compare it.</li>
            <li> few notes on usage: If you have anything more than stubble on your legs, you&#x27;re really going to want to use the pop-up trimmer first.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this Panasonic, especially when compared to the Remington I have been using for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> My underarms are a little more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and the first time I used it on my pits, I used soap and water.....</li>
            <li> For me, this is an advantage because I can shave more often and avoid razor burn, but if you have dark hair and light skin where every tiny bit of stubble shows, then you may want to stick with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decide to wait a while to see how long it would last and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I do think it pulls more than other electric razors, and misses a lot.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, largely due to the cheap price, but gave it a shot anyway!</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t use the top outlet (of the two) because the plug will not plug into the outlet due to the shaver hitting the medicine cabinet up there.</li>
            <li> Has great little motor and holds charge an exceptionally long time.</li>
            <li> Very long battery life and love the way it makes your skin feel soft and barren of hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a small brush, protective cap for the head, charger, and a small travel pouch, which it and all the accessories fit into easily and nicely.</li>
            <li> B000KQJNNO Remington WDF-5000 Smooth and Silky ladies shaver]] started becoming dull</li>
            <li> The razor cleaned easily and the charge is so long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, a small brush is included.</li>
            <li> This is easy &amp; comfortable to hold &amp; actually DOES work as well as it does wet &amp; lathered.</li>
            <li> Such a great everyday electric razor!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long, but so far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> When attempting to clean item with the brush that came with the kit, the inside blade fell off and I could not get it back.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves were lovely, but the cutters lost their edge.</li>
            <li> It really was decent while it worked</li>
            <li> Very convenient, gives a decent shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it (on clean, dry skin), the shave was so close that it &#x27;almost&#x27; felt like I&#x27;d used a blade.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to get a smooth shave with this electric shaver, either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver I thought I was really going to like it because it seemed to shave my chin a lot faster than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> There are no great lady&#x27;s&#x27; razors, but this one is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair on my legs and this shaver does as good of a job as my husbands $150 shaver!!!!</li>
            <li> I was lucky to have the family gift me a few extra dollars to spend on my own gifts.</li>
            <li> The shaver has no problems doing close shaves for little hairs and it also trims the long hairs very nicely.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time - right out of the box I was able to save my entire legs, bikini, underarms, and arms and still have charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it is still red when I wake up Tuesday morning, I will try using it anyway, but am not too confident that the problem is only the charger light and that it will actually work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one to anybody who wants a close shave without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Priced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried some other decent and mildly pricey razors and after going through 2 of them and being really dissapointed, I tried about 2 more of the lesser priced ones (under $30).</li>
            <li> it was cheap enough that I could just order a new one.</li>
            <li> But on special nights with hubby I definitely use the gillette...</li>
            <li> It is a small 1 1/2 inch cube that plugs into the wall, and you can put the razor right on top of it.</li>
            <li> Same as any electric razor.....does an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job...nothing special</li>
            <li> I have used it both wet and dry and in all honesty they both give just as good of a shave.</li>
            <li> I have NOT tried it wet, but its so good dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it does a good enough job to get rid of the appearance of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as traditional razors, but is very convenient for a quick job.</li>
            <li> I loved my previous Remington which had an actual cord on the charger</li>
            <li> These work fairly well, but they last less than a year before the quality is severely compromised.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the job it does, I like to use it better dry then in the shower.</li>
            <li> tried it wet yet, but dry it does a good job on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have never gone 3 days, but I&#x27;m sure it would do at least a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It give a very close shave for an electric razor, definitely does the trick for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Perfect for times like winter or other times when you are in a big hurry and just need a little touch up or if you don&#x27;t care much.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble finding a good place to plug it in to recharge but other than that it is as good as any electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> Other than that this shaver gives a close shave, is easy to use, and cheap enough to throw away in a year or so when the battery stops working, which it will.</li>
            <li> Will do 2 long sessions and will need a recharge, but will last many more sessions for limited areas and time.</li>
            <li> It shaves so close and so comfortable, and it stays charged up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have had it only for a few weeks and used it 3-4 times, and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have had it only for a few weeks and used it 3-4 times, and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Comfort handle shape in design, long battery holding charge and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> I just use it dry, but it has worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor at my daughter&#x27;s request, and so far she says it&#x27;s exactly what she had been looking for.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver has worked pretty well for me so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter now uses my old shaver which is much duller!  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to go slow for the closest shave possible, and make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before used.</li>
            <li> After a full charge and body shave, it still last for 2 weeks without charging.</li>
            <li> Not ultra-smooth like you&#x27;d expect from a regular razor or from waxing, but good enough to last a day or two depending on how picky you are about prickly legs.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t pull, shaves well the first time over, and offers a closer shave to boot.</li>
            <li> You could land a prize winning bass with those whiskers.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it needed charging, even though it&#x27;d been recently charged, so I&#x27;d give it a full charge</li>
            <li> I am a cyclist and we like to keep our legs smooth for no particular reason than making it easy for our masseuse to take care of us after long rides.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it work great, but it holds a charge for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not as completely 100% smooth as a razor it is very close and the hair seems to take longer to grow back than when using a razor.  </li>
            <li> For the price it does a better than average job.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Schick Intuition and absolutely abhor the process of shaving my legs in the shower, even without having to use shaving cream with the Intuition.</li>
            <li> It offers a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> and it works pretty well as far as electric razors go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with this and especially for the low cost compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> good if you have irritation with the razor, for me does not last suffiencient enough for my both legs, wish it could last longer or have the corded option.</li>
            <li> Even with a full charge I&#x27;ve often run out of power with only one leg shaved.</li>
            <li> One charge lasts several shaves before losing full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> one full charge can be used multiple times.</li>
            <li> So far -- the aforementioned is fine.</li>
            <li> : Ok, this product went from 5 stars down to 1 star.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many electric shavers and they all let me down.</li>
            <li> but this time pressing down a bit more.</li>
            <li> It really is good wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I tried the little trimmer feature on the more heartily furred part of my thigh that I&#x27;d been avoiding while the wounds healed, and it removed the hair readily.</li>
            <li> So I put on some shaving cream in the shower and it worked a little better, but it still didn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li> Would buy again if it wears out/dulls in a year or so (with the price of blades, might as well get a new unit!)</li>
            <li> Came brand new and fully charged!  </li>
            <li> The important fact to note here is that I&#x27;m male and finding this shaver just as effective (if not more so) than my old one.</li>
            <li> This razor DOES NOT get you the super smooth feel like traditional razors, nor does the results last as long as a traditional razor, but you get the look of smoothness that most women want.</li>
            <li> I may just buy a whole new shaver ($18.00 here)</li>
            <li> Not travel like to see a new boss that you really need to impress.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the new product that I just ordered online and what I really want.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new cordless razor and this one does the job well for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I call in and they sent a new one out that very day.</li>
            <li> Even hand razors will cut you if you&#x27;re not careful, right?</li>
            <li> This razor, for about half the price, works much better and works with just one pass.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than the corded razor, it takes up less space and is out of the way when charging.  </li>
            <li> Used to use a cheapo less than $10 drugstore Clio razor which was okay</li>
            <li> but the dry is smooth, glides over what ever you want to shave &amp; it fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet with gel or dry -- I&#x27;ve now used it both ways and got the best shave possible next to using the Venus Embrace manual razor.</li>
            <li> and it did a much better job in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I used it dry and hope to save time this summer by having this available.</li>
            <li> If the warranty comes through and it&#x27;s replaced, maybe I&#x27;ll improve my rating again, but the hassle of having to do this makes it not worthy of any more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, even when wet.</li>
            <li> I shave my legs dry and it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic lasted many years, I should have replaced it before it died.</li>
            <li> For less than $20, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Relatively less noisy than most razors, but still buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to use in those quick situations where I may need o shave my legs or arm pits at the last minute when I want to throw on a dress or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had more expensive one , but this one work better.</li>
            <li> The Remington has always done a decent job but was looking for a closer shave quicker.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to replace my Remington 5000, which was good, but the replacement heads and blades have become too expensive to be worth purchasing to rebuild it.</li>
            <li> I want to add that you also need to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> She tried my electric razor which is a Panasonic but an older version.  </li>
            <li> I had this shaver for 2 years but used it only a handful of times for quick jobs.</li>
            <li> and that is why is decided to order this particular shaver for my wife.  </li>
            <li> My main purpose&lt;</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a decent charge also.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaver if your looking for a quick hair removal mechanism.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m inclined to agree and will recommend this (particularly for the 20$ price point I found it at) to anyone looking for a decent replacement.</li>
            <li> , that is my main issues.</li>
            <li> and we have a super tiny shower, so</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> The last two times I used it I would have to give it a few good smacks to get her going.</li>
            <li> It works well especially when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to run into the shower.  </li>
            <li> Decent razor for the price</li>
            <li> I purchased it mainly to get rid of the &#x27;chin hairs.&#x27;</li>
            <li> She loves being able to use it dry for a quick touch up or using it wet while relaxing in the bath.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet seeing the ingrown hairs I usually get, so maybe this is FINALLY the method that doesn&#x27;t cut the hair below skin level to where the hair can&#x27;t grow out of it successfully.</li>
            <li> The older I get the lazier</li>
            <li> but the main reason i gave it 2 stars was because i have had it for maybe 6 to 7 months and the shaver just stopped working out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, on those stubborn chin hairs that plague older women, and on the nape between trips to the stylist.  </li>
            <li> She had an older model of this</li>
            <li> Shave is close enough for public viewing of shaved areas (pits and legs) but needs to be shaved more often than using manual razor.</li>
            <li> Better than some more expensive shavers tried.</li>
            <li> After my older shaver [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This shaver gave a decent shave when it worked.  </li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t have to go back over the same spot more than once,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on longer hair without first using the trimmer, and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling or pain at all, though I would recommend following the instructions, and first using the trimmer on longer hair before shaving it closer.</li>
            <li> Considering that my hair grows relatively fast, shaving gets really old, really fast.</li>
            <li> I use this on my upper legs where the hair is not so thick and it works great there, too.  </li>
            <li> However, I needed something I could shave quickly with when I didn&#x27;t have enough time to use a razor.  </li>
            <li> It always seemed to me that the focus was on men&#x27;s razors and the ladies were left with few good options.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent wet/dry shaver, although sometimes I feel like you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and could not keep plucking</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this shaver based on the positive reviews and because it is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a small white plastic-ish bag to put it in (the charger doesn&#x27;t fit with it in there), so that was better than nothing which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better than razors and water and mess.</li>
            <li> I originally used hair removing creme and razors, but it either takes too long or hurts my skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge though (12 hours) and only last 10 good minutes until it weakens.</li>
            <li> not charging properly (you HAVE to make sure it is properly seated in the charger, charger light ON); the charge lasts for at least 2 shaves (I haven&#x27;t tried to do it longer, I just recharge); it does not damage my skin at all; it is easily cleaned; it is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> A great dry shaving option (though I would recommend moisturizing beforehand, not too heavily!)</li>
            <li> tried it wet once and gave up pretty quickly on that.  </li>
            <li> It does a really good job without pushing very hard.</li>

            <li> Looks like a very nice ladyshave for legs and arms, but definitely not recommended for the delicate bikini area.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but took much longer time to clear up than my former phillip one (around same price).</li>
            <li> Because I am older and don&#x27;t have to shave my legs very often, this works great on my legs and no more nicks from a regular razor and much easier doing it outside of the shower than trying to bend in shower.  </li>
            <li> so far it has been working pretty good,charge fast and easy to clean,came with a little bag where you can store it.</li>
            <li> I again did not see that much in the ladies&#x27; market (as compared to the options available for men and aside from the new crop of epilators that I was not ready to try).  </li>
            <li> I have went through a few, because I&#x27;d rather just buy a new one than replace parts since it is such a good price.</li>
            <li> My previous razor cost more than twice as much and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs are hard to get a clean smooth shave thus the nicks.</li>
            <li> It is also a plus that it can be used wet or dry and that it is easily rinsed to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Does a great job - I only use it when dry, not on wet skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but it works extremely well, gets a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 other electric trimmers and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor for my thirteen year old daughter as I knew it would be safer for her than a hand-held razor.  </li>
            <li> I am overall happy with my purchase as it wasn&#x27;t super expensive and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is perfect for me because my skin is thin and other shavers cause nicks this one does not.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying new blades, I buy a new machine every year or so because the blades I found online for this are almost as much as the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a safety razor now that I have bifocals &amp; couldn&#x27;t see my underarms clearly!!  </li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother, who needed a replacement for her old one (which was bought in 1965!!).</li>
            <li> This little gem gets almost as close to a razor shave as I have ever been able to manage, and I don&#x27;t get any of the resulting skin irritations that I once had.</li>
            <li> Some times it can pull hairs a little but for the most part I am in LOVE with this little thing.</li>
            <li> The shave could be a LITTLE better, but it is, after all, an electric....</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I used to get so many little bumps on my legs from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It costs a little more</li>
            <li> For you guys, spend a little more and get a Remington product instead.</li>
            <li> Many people talked about the battery that stopped recharging after little time.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working a little more than a month after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> but so far not complaining!!</li>
            <li> The shaver sits directly on top of the little square charger which plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li> the contour makes it easy to use the blades will stay sharp for the life of the battery.</li>
            <li> The size does not exactly make it easy to shave your bikini area.</li>
            <li> Nice pop up trimmer for the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> Nice little unit!!</li>
            <li> I needed a new blade but the new shaver was cheaper than the blade!</li>
            <li> This shaver is quiet, holds a charge for several dry leg shaves, easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great shave, however I might try something different to see if it will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer cuts if you move it VERY, VERY slowly, but still pulls the hair more than it should and it takes multiple passes to get an okay cut.</li>
            <li> the one I had previously worked great until the battery finally played out which is the weak link with most rechargeable devices</li>
            <li> I had two older Remington lady shavers and needed a new shaver as my cord had deteriorated</li>
            <li> It worked OK on my dry hair, but it got very hot on my skin and was not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave and proved to be too much for her sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and it was done dry</li>
            <li> So far I really like this.</li>
            <li> I tried it with clean dry legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happily surprised that this cuts fast and is as close as I think you&#x27;ll ever get from an electric razor -</li>
            <li> Oh, and I&#x27;ve always used this wet with shaving cream and still the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s ready when I need it.</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave even in the sensitive areas :</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t have much hope when I ordered this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> However, as far as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, this works really well.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than my old Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> My mother  of 80 years old said she wanted one, my caregiver saw it and said she wants  one</li>
            <li> dual action clipper and shaver combo makes fast work of longer stubble.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old daughter because I wasn&#x27;t quite ready for her to start using a razor.</li>
            <li> Someone really needs to get on developing a sarcastic font...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few months, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the weight, the feel of it in the hand and the appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using the $9.99 trimmers which dont last long, this is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it over a month now, but I think the convenience for this time in my life has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> Of course if you use it everyday, I would plug it in more often.</li>
            <li> I think this is a better shaver than one I had a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> After using razor for few weeks I ordered two more for family members.</li>
            <li> It would charge like normal</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for many years and it has not given me one bit of trouble.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle, from the first second I tried it I could tell there was no way it was going to irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I have owned several different brands of electric shavers and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This helps remove the heavy hair safely.  </li>
            <li> Not as close cutting or as smooth as a real razor but a great thing to have for missed spots or for young girls just starting to shave.</li>
            <li> No negative issues.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who is a bit bothered by normal razors.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it dry, but tried it wet and liked it.</li>
            <li> Mostly I shave my underarms and legs, but it seems the motors like to burn out after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have also tried everything short of expensive laser hair removal, and this razor, so far, is wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought the first one back in October 2012 and it lasted a whole 5 months before it acted as though it was going to die and</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I do love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how many shaves I can get on one charge.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the few extra dollars for the better model</li>
            <li> It is not cheap in quality, like a lot of shavers are and it does shave to a smooth, baby bottom feel!</li>
            <li> I normally shave in the shower, but after developing a blood clot and being on blood thinner for 6 months, I had to come up with something else.  </li>
            <li> Nice shave for my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> so I have no complaint there.</li>
            <li> It too pinched and gave a good but not great shave.</li>
            <li> Good thing I got tired . .</li>
            <li> Just used it dry for the first time (after a 12 hour charge) and it is very smooth and painless due mainly to the curved head.</li>
            <li> As with any other electric shaver, you DO need to open the top and clean out the hairs regularly with the brush that is supplied...</li>
            <li> Very convenient for those quick &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and much faster than a conventional shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought this may help other folks in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;As usual with Amazon, a great price and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Safe to use wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first tried out this product that I bought my little sister one for her birthday.</li>
            <li> It is especially quiet, nice shape for holding and does a fine job shaving (a little slower than using a razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
            <li> Right out of the box it barely dry-shaved as well as the Remington when it was old.</li>
            <li> I always used it dry &amp; it gave a decent, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> (i do it on dry skin), get a close enough shave that even if you&#x27;re up close/ touching me</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; yet, but it does a far better job than my previous elec razor.</li>
            <li> and I think it gives a nice close shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Simple design, totally reliable and easy to use, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get, but it&#x27;s so easy to use that if you want to shave again the next day it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> Relatively simple and easy to open with no-nonsense instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple easy and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many complaints about this and other electric shavers that I thought I ought to clarify a few things and help everyone get a smooth, non-injurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right handed and left handed people.</li>
            <li> right handed and left handed people.</li>
            <li> Holds a super long change as well.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not major Because it does get get pretty close (closer than shick manual razors!</li>
            <li> I like the more narrow head being that I&#x27;m working around legs and arms that are not flat boards. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Recharging too much, or when there is a lot of charge left, will lower battery longevity seriously, (especially with nickel batteries.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get this shipped to north of the 49th parallel, (Canada,) but the shipping cost</li>
            <li> I think it is also important to note that I previously tried the Norelco Bodygroom shaver due to the many positive reviews, however I got razor burn from that shaver and also got cut quite badly in several places.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to be able to use it forever, but I hoped to get at least a year out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you angle it right with all areas of the razor head flat against your skin and press down, you can get a pretty close shave quickly.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I should mention that I am a GUY, yet I firmly believe the only place hair belongs is on top of our heads.  </li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers noted, it stopped working after 9 months of light use.  </li>
            <li> Not like other cheap ones that run out of charge in 15 mins.</li>
            <li> It does such an amazing job and does it so much quicker that the usual razor.  </li>
            <li> had been when new during that time.  </li>
            <li> I always do research before trying a new product, so I ordered this one based upon reviews as well as price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to keep buying a new electric razor every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life used anything but a blade razor on my legs and underarms, so this was a totally new experience.  </li>
            <li> Then I dropped and broke it, and had to get something new.</li>
            <li> I immediately had to go on a five-day trip, so my new razor hit the trail with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Concerning the seller: The electric razor was new and in sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> Even brand new</li>
            <li> I may have to buy a new cutter.  </li>
            <li> new age is here!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before I even tried it I new</li>
            <li> live the color</li>
            <li> As a lot of new moms can probably understand I have been struggling to find 5 minutes for a shower let alone time to shave my legs while I&#x27;m in there.</li>
            <li> At that time I should buy new shaver blades.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even need to shop around when I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Then it needs new blades.  </li>
            <li> So I end up just getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get a new blade head for it.  </li>
            <li> Also couldn&#x27;t find a new Remington that matched my new qualifications.  </li>
            <li> ...and Buy New $19.88 new, $19.99 for blade set</li>
            <li> I can live with it.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought a new one because I have faith.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought a new one on July 26th</li>
            <li> Works well when it is new.  </li>
            <li> I got a new one because my Remington was getting worn out/dull</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver to someone who is totally new to electric shaving.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get a new cord for my Remington.  </li>
            <li> I have used others and decided it was time to try something new.  </li>
            <li> but you probably new that.  </li>
            <li> It would be cheaper for me to just buy a new foil.</li>
            <li> This new version has a one-piece charger/plug instead of a charger stand attached to a cord.</li>
            <li> With this new one however I found it comes with a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Owned for a year and still works like new.</li>
            <li> Why buy replacements when buying a new unit is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Panasonic ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was going to spend hundreds on a new razor because mine was kaput.  </li>
            <li> The representative said they were out at the warehouse and after receiving a new shipment in 2 weeks they would ship us a replacement.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is the brand of rechargeable I&#x27;ve had 20 +years, still works, needs new head, cheaper to buy a new one of these and these are prettier.</li>
            <li> In Stores Where I Live Anymore</li>
            <li> The foil and blade seem to be top notch and not likely to go dull quickly.</li>
            <li> My coworker swears by dry shavers, so I decided to try this one out, not wanting to drop a ton of cash before being comfortable with the whole idea of shaving outside the</li>
            <li> The box says wet or dry, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to all ladies young and older.</li>
            <li> The red light lit up to signal that it was charging, so I left it there for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> It barely keeps enough charge to do one full leg anymore.</li>
            <li> here it is Monday evening TWO DAYS later, and the charger light is still showing red!  </li>
            <li> Have only used once so far but shaved smoothly, not as close as a razor, but quick and easy for touch ups.</li>
            <li> So far, the rechargeability of this particular model is also working well.</li>
            <li> in use &amp; no complaints,the older model(3 years old) is also too by my duaghter,  </li>
            <li> It cuts close enough to be smooth, but not close enough to give me ingrown hairs or razor burn.</li>
            <li> i thought of this item only after getting a very precocious snowshoe siamese who gets into absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li> I found that pulling the skin as taut as possible, changing the direction of the shaver path repeatedly, reapplying whatever soap/shaving cream/lubricant you use multiple times, and doing about a million passes did, eventually get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry legs for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s so quick and can be used dry.</li>
            <li> Then I go back over the same area LIGHTLY GLIDING along my skin with the foil.</li>
            <li> The shaver sits upright directly on the plug, which is much nicer as far a storage (</li>
            <li> I dont use this as often as I thought, mainly because it is so LOUD.</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;ll do a wet shave with shaving gel to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> A close shave with out a blade, safer for the young and older lady.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than my much older and much more expensive razor (which recently died).</li>
            <li> This cute little shaver is a trooper!</li>
            <li> You do need to go over the same spot several times, but as someone who has very sensitive skin I can honestly say I have NO irritation and my legs are not as dry since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.</li>
            <li> This is a very good little shaver, for a very small price.  </li>
            <li> Good enough that I&#x27;ve repurchased this exact same shaver knowing that it will become dull within a year</li>
            <li> This time though, I definitely wasted my money as this may serve better as a vibrator than a razor since it doesn&#x27;t cut / trim / razor anything the first 6 times, either with the pop-up trimmer or flat.</li>
            <li> for a year even... don&#x27;t expect it to stay as good if you use it for any other areas or for it to last a really long time...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and legs</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so cannot use a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and the hypo-allergenic blades and foils</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I experience no pulling or irritation after using it, and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and works especially you are in hurry.</li>
            <li> He suggested that I give it a try, we both have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving that area sounds like a nightmare, but this shaver is a dream come true for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, for the general user who has a larger body canvas this might be worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very clumsy to use and didn&#x27;t give near as good a results as her 35 year  old Remington, which gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t give as close as a shave as a razor obviously, but it gets pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised by this razor!  </li>
            <li> pretty quiet, if you care about noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone, first time user or otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for as a present for my wife.</li>
            <li> My husband gave it to me last year, and at first I was hesitant.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has worked pretty well in the short time I have had it.  </li>
            <li> I recently had to start taking blood thinners after a medical event, and this was the product that I saw recommended most often for folks who have to avoid regular razors.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works for men&#x27;s parts as well, I&#x27;m told by the males in my household who requested their own, and well enough that they didn&#x27;t care that it only came in pink.</li>
            <li> I had pretty low expectations, but after reading tons of reviews I decided to try the Panasonic Curves...</li>
            <li> Like several of the other reviewers here...I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say!</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to anyone no more razor blade cuts from shavers</li>
            <li> Okay, not sure whose fault it was</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks it completely stopped working!</li>
            <li> I was willing to take a chance because of the low price</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this; beats out the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li> I used it for several months and thought it shaved pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It also has a wall charger that you plug directly into a socket, with no cord!</li>
            <li> and it does this the first time, without having to shave the same spot again and again.</li>
            <li> It gets a pretty close shave, but of course, not quite as close as a regular razor with shaving cream and water.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get a close shave that lasted more than an hour.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hair removal products that has actually worked on my bikini area without causing irritation (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews said that this razor pinches but that has not been my experience even though most razors I have used in the past have done that.  </li>
            <li> Only works the first day</li>
            <li> I only got hair bumps the first 2 shaves, probably because I let the hair grow out fully for a week without shaving again to see hat happens, but now I&#x27;m shaving every 3/4 days I get no problems.</li>
            <li> She can shave daily with no ill result.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> I like that the charger plugs directly into the outlet - no cord to bundle!</li>
            <li> The shave, of course, isn&#x27;t nearly as close as it would be if you were to use a blade, but hello, I don&#x27;t want to use a blade!  </li>
            <li> I generally use a straight razor but was told post hip surgery to use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> will say it seemed to work better on my &#x27;other&#x27; bits than on my legs, so maybe its just that my legs aren&#x27;t curvey enough.  </li>
            <li> This unit has fixed my problem!  </li>
            <li> but I have to over the same area MANY times to get it as short as I&#x27;d like - even with regular shaving.</li>
            <li> I only use it as a wet shaver and must say that it takes by far more time to shave than with a disposable one and</li>
            <li> I took the first one apart and cleaned it regularly...</li>
            <li> I am able to go over these areas and not get the usual blood letting that a razor causes.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave in the shower and only breaks when I drop it ;-)</li>
            <li> Holds the charge for many shaves and has a small plug in adapter that fits in any plug.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised at the close shave it gave!</li>
            <li> also this takes up no counter space at all the charger is a small maybe 1 1/2 inch square that the trimmer itself just sits on top of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned so far!</li>
            <li> When it does reach the end of its life, I will not hesitate to buy the exact same model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter as a first razor and it works as intended and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Has a charger so no more batteries, even better #</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 4 years and then finally died.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product like I did!</li>
            <li> The replacement charger costs more than the shaver cost and also not sure that is the problem.....</li>
            <li> It actually shaves pretty close considering it&#x27;s electric.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased my second of this model after the first wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after years of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store in the little fabric pouch that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this razor and I am actually going to buy one for a friend of mine who has tried most methods of bikini hair removal with little success.</li>
            <li> If using it dry, make sure the skin is really, really dry - not damp.</li>
            <li> She is a busy college student and says that she loves that she can use this shaver dry and for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> If you do it dry, make sure you are really really dry...</li>
            <li> Overall, it did a very smooth job down there--</li>
            <li> Other than that, if you read the manual, follow the instructions, keep it clean and charge it timely, you&#x27;re doing everything on your side to maintain the product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, if you read the manual, follow the instructions, keep it clean and charge it timely, you&#x27;re doing everything on your side to maintain the product.</li>
            <li> It is sharp and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li> The first one died, but the second one has been going strong for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> will be buying more when my other two girls gets old enough to shave !</li>
            <li> I first rinse the blades in the sharp stream, then I dunk the blade only in the cup full of soap water and swish it around, and then rinse both the head and the blades.</li>
            <li> I must say, the Panasonic new does not sufficiently surpass the Remington old in terms of shave closeness.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head is completely removable they may make new blades to replace</li>
            <li> I buy a new one about every three years after I drop the old one and tear the foil up.</li>
            <li> My skin is not super smooth, so I would always have razor rash (ouch).  </li>
            <li> I heard an odd buzzing sound from our front-loading washer one afternoon.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get this shaver from Panasonic because the previous model was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> He uses it as an everyday easy shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and not able to shave my legs with razor any more.  </li>
            <li> After I first charged it I shaved for maybe a total of 30 minutes so far</li>
            <li> The charger is small and much more convenient than the old rechargeable shaver I had before.</li>
            <li> I shaves very close and is exactly every thing that I expected out of a shaver.</li>
            <li> It performs exactly the same as my old razor (that took a nose dive from the shower shelf and broke)</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon a few years ago and it&#x27;s still running strong.  </li>
            <li> Even the trimmer, which normally hurts more than the blades on other electrics if you&#x27;re not careful enough with it, doesn&#x27;t pinch, pull, or even scrape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all these many years, I finally broke down and got an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> This is teh second wet dry eletric I have own (the first one was a different brand)</li>
            <li> so I bought this one based on numerous positive reviews on Amazon and on QVC.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charged it over 24hrs for the first time and the red light never went off or turned green.</li>
            <li> Do a final shave with the razor and then use the electric shaver gently for a few days in a row before you tackle any major stubble; it should feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> ... I pretty much settled for only shaving once or twice a week and only wears tank tops and swimsuits based off when I could shave.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a true blade, but closer than other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Have used this product more than once thru the years, this is the first one that blades only stayed sharp about 2 months and it won&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  </li>
            <li> I like how this shaves better dry than wet</li>
            <li> I like being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;re either completely dry or completely wet when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you are either completely wet or completely dry.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, wet or dry</li>
            <li> results!make sure you use it on completely dry skin or extremely wet skin, otherwise you can get cuts.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry but always get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> So make sure your skin is either totally wet or totally dry.</li>
            <li> Better dry than wet, I think.</li>
            <li> Had the previous same  issue for many years.</li>
            <li> What can I say, she loves it having clippers and shaver in one - and wither wet or dry (mostly used in the shower).  </li>
            <li> Now, I can do a quick 1 minute shave in the mornings after my shower if I need to and wear whatever I want, especially since it&#x27;s getting warmer outside.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to someone starting out or someone who is looking for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> LIghtweight really close shave, and pretty dusty rose pink.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use the stiff bristles on the foil since foils are easily torn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used electric in the past, but back then no matter how much money I threw at it, I always had issues with stubble and hair catching (I have very thick and coarse stands which can be hell on any kind of blade...</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complained about it catching and pulling the hair quite a bit which I noticed as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, performs decently as I was not expected a close shave, and it&#x27;s rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> (I have fine, sparse leg hair; nothing heavy duty.)  </li>
            <li> The instructions say it can be used wet or dry, but I recommend wet with a good shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I received the new Panasonic, It had a larger curved head and much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because I am a woman of a certain age,and unfortunately,with the aging comes the facial hair.</li>
            <li> I liked my old one better where you could switch them out, less complicated.</li>
            <li> It shaves well with a little stubble its pain free and does the job well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always shave as closely as I would like, but it&#x27;s super-easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and is very simple to clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it wet yet but love using it dry!  </li>
            <li> Women have a need for shaving too, in fact, they likely shave more area than men, and yet there is so little attention paid to the quality of their electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> A little better than a standard razor</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m usually the one to ignore the most extreme best or worst reviews, reasoning that some people love a brand no matter what you put in front of them</li>
            <li> Oddly, I was using the original one and thought I should get a backup for when it eventually dies and</li>
            <li> Now if I can keep the other household member from trying to sneak a quick shave</li>
            <li> I even feel comfortable enough to use this razor to go to the gym, but then again, I really don&#x27;t care if a little stubble is on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy with its buzzing sound but not enough to really bother me.</li>
            <li> I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than other shavers, not bulky, easy to hold, handle, and</li>
            <li> When I need a quick shave when wearing shorts, I&#x27;d normally do it in the sink and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> Over the last 10 months the pop up trimmer blades have become so dull that they no longer remove hair effectively.</li>
            <li> The protective plastic cover on top of the shaver had a short hair plainly on the inside &amp; stubble near the blades!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s were NOT too happy about having to take cold showers.</li>
            <li> But, there is one thing that isn&#x27;t clear in the description that might be helpful to know: the charger plugs into the socket, rather than sitting on the countertop (and plugging in with a cord).</li>
            <li> I get clear, wiry whiskers on my chin that are like 100 pound test fishing line.</li>
            <li> This unit is clearly heavier, thicker which makes maneuvering around your knees a bit tricky.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are nearly the same price as the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li> Always a bit hesitant to write a review after only using a product three or four times, but the shaver works well on underarms and legs so far and is much quieter than the Remington that it is replacing.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect shave, but great for a pre teen.</li>
            <li> I am uploading pictures so that people can clearly see what they market.</li>
            <li> and it keeps the counter clear.</li>
            <li> Found I do prefer to use it with pre shave oil for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive legs</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s to the point when I can&#x27;t finish ONE LEG without it completely dying.</li>
            <li> I am about to turn 40 years old and I have been dealing with ingrown issues on my armpits all my life.</li>
            <li> No trouble since then.</li>
            <li> and when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> It does a relatively close shave, especially as far as electric shavers go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a real shave w/a razor, and know i know why.. depating on sending this back, but at $19.95 i may just keep it for &#x27;emergency&#x27; purposes on the run.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t always have time for that long hot shower.</li>
            <li> I love this sucker -</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering if I should have let it run completely out of juice before re-charging?  </li>
            <li> As far as I know, she likes it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use a blade on my legs, so I have always used an electric.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I can recommend this without reservation.</li>
            <li> A few relevant facts</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect razor-close shaves, but the Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves Shaver was darn near razor-close.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has completely resolved that dilemma.</li>
            <li> Fast and simple.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver to replace about a 5 year old Conair Electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Then, it shaves so close, almost nearly like a razor.  </li>
            <li> even a year old and</li>
            <li> I find that these razors last much longer this way.</li>
            <li> An electric razor will never give you a shave as close as a regular razor but so much easier.</li>
            <li> Fast with no burns or bumps or stubble left.</li>
            <li> This one so far is way ahead.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for my daughter because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li> I surprised my grand-daughter with this shaver for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year now and replaced the blades/foil once so far.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a complete klutz and have dropped it once or twice with no issues)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it, although you do not get a shave nearly as close as with a blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how well it removes leg hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve done a lot with this razor since my old one</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old girl.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS MUCH SAFER THEN A REGULAR SHAVER.</li>
            <li> so it can be a pain to find products that work for me but don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No cord for charging, it has a plug for the razor that plugs directly into socket.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old electric razor this one is heaven.  </li>
            <li> now I have an infected gash.&lt;br /&gt;I would not get hurt any more than this with a blade razor, and at least I would get a close shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, this has worked well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was  pleasantly surprised with the results from this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Surprised by how well it has performed.</li>
            <li> After 12 hours of charging I took it out, only to discover that it did absolutely NOTHING when I put the power switch on.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes I&#x27;ve got smooth legs and don&#x27;t feel like chewbacca when I go to my OB appointments.</li>
            <li> Seven months and two weeks after I bought it, it died completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that the price is so reasonable is also a definite bonus, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for an old women it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;i like the fact that they give parts ordering info leaflet also..</li>
            <li> Some razors I have tried in the past do not do well with more than a day&#x27;s worth of hair growth but this one cuts the long and short hairs with ease and no pulling.  </li>
            <li> I dug out my daughters old charger, but that did nothing either.</li>
            <li> no need so far</li>
            <li> and I have completely given up on using it under my arms because it shaves NOTHING.</li>
            <li> She had no trouble at all using it</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both used it several times and got really discouraged: this thing doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I just checked, and the battery is under warranty, but what a pain to mail in a $20 piece of equipment and prepay for shipping to have it fixed.</li>
            <li> and so far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Got this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> The old one lasted about 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> Or you can always go old school and use some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> So far, the charge is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> My old one (emphasis on old) would often pull or snag on the hair</li>
            <li> I havent heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my 11 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The last three Remingtons had  only lasted about a year each and Remington replaced them free of charge until the last one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave my legs as close as I&#x27;d like, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I assumed that because it had the Remington name, it would work as well as my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> THIS ONE WORKS LIKE MY OLD SHAVER.  </li>
            <li> It is so very close to the same shave I get with my manual razor that I don&#x27;t mind using it instead</li>
            <li> Like the product so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it works for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather sleep than get up earlier to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the recharging stand  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li> A woman&#x27;s needs vacillate as much as the wind does and I am, with pleasure, no different.  </li>
            <li> I miss the old shavers that you just plug in and they continue to work for years and years.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it works really well until it dies.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use a razor.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with my legs because they are way to sensitive and they hurt to shave,wax,pluck.</li>
            <li> and she has been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s done as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> It makes loud noise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as loud as the man shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving my legs the old fashion way for years.  </li>
            <li> shave nowhere near as often as people would like me to--</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Panasonic Ladies shaver that I had for 30 years before it broke.  </li>
            <li> The charger sits directly against the electrical wall plug and every time I put the shaver on the charger it pops out.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how close a shave</li>
            <li> Got this to replace and old remington that died.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> then my old one and</li>
            <li> This shaver is so much gentler than a regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> With a regualr razor I used to get cut quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> I used it one time, I had it charging the whole time after that, and, when I went to use it the second time, it did not turn on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that becomes irritated and gets ingrown hairs (yuck) whenever I use shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a young lady in my home.</li>
            <li> It works well for at least 6 to 9 months on my legs - maybe more.  </li>
            <li> Threw away my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the performance.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I had tried an electric razor several years ago and was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I have had my old Remington electric shaver for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Like the razor/trimmer itself, but seriousl dislike the charger - IT MUST PLUG DIRECTLY TO A WALL.  </li>
            <li> I was terrified for my 11 year old to use a razor, so I bought her this</li>
            <li> When my old razor broke, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my 11 year old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer blades aren&#x27;t as scratchy as my old razor.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> had this issue with my old shaver when I used it under the arms, but this one cuts close</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beside, it makes my legs look even smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work really well for her, especially since she can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> And it will help me get a closer shave but not remove my completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this April 2013, so it is just 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is so sensitive, that no matter what brand of razor or product used, she breaks out in a rash.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old one died.</li>
            <li> Much easier and faster than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter to shave with so that she does not have to deal with a razor that might cut her.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it, just realize that you&#x27;re getting an electric razor and they can only do so much.</li>
            <li> like with my old razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Small enough to store, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require frequent charging and doesn&#x27;t snag your skin or pull as it is shaving.</li>
            <li> Not as loud as my old shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried it on my dog, a Lhasa Apso, but it didn&#x27;t work - need a tougher clipper for that.&lt;br /&gt;For about $20 I can buy one a year if necessary and still not pay as much as it would cost for a presumably high-end shaver.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Got this as a starter shaver for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave, but works well enough for a quickie shave in between shaving with a real brazor.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and no problems thus far</li>
            <li> But wow.  </li>
            <li> No issues thus far.</li>
            <li> I can only say that I really like it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those women in their 40s who have those wild hormones.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver since I was 16 or 17 years old.</li>
            <li> The charger plugs directly into an outlet.  </li>
            <li> , I might never go back to my straight razor.</li>
            <li> a must have for busy young women { mothers</li>
            <li> Overall it works to my needs and it very convenient.</li>
            <li> and no complains so far.</li>
            <li> The close shave does come very close to an actual razor but at the pain of plucking or waxing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like</li>
            <li> Plus, I really like getting to shave outside of the shower.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife to replace a 20 year old corded one.</li>
            <li> After about 9 months I frequently need to shake this one to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> and it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> So much easier than trying to balance in the shower and shave at the same time.</li>
            <li> I will be surprised if I even use my razor on my legs in the shower again for the rest of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anywhere near to a close shave.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as close a shave as a razor, even from the very beginning.</li>
            <li> I have never had overly sensitive skin and this hurt.</li>
            <li> nowhere near a razor-close shave, though it&#x27;s never cut myself with this one.  </li>
            <li> shaves so far before charging.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had a problem with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old fashioned lady shavers from the 1970&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> wish i had not wasted my money</li>
            <li> Does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; or nick and gives a closer shave, unlike my old electric one.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver gives a close shave, so far, non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.  </li>
            <li> This works very well and is quiet.  </li>
            <li> As far as problems plugging it into a wall socket, just use an extension cord.  </li>
            <li> When it came to shaving it seems like it does not get the hair completely.</li>
            <li> I have to wake up early for work</li>
            <li> Replaced an old electric shaver that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Definitely pleasantly surprised by this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> She has commented on how much she loves it several times.</li>
            <li> time, I let the shaver go completely out before I charged it.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic because I thought that the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> It is SO much easier and quicker than traditional shaving and just all around BETTER.&lt;br</li>
            <li> **completely</li>
            <li> I normally do not care for this kind of shaver but needed something due to having back surgery.</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin i give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin and want something inexpensive this is the one.</li>
            <li> thought that if it worked on a women&#x27;s legs and sensitive &#x27;bikini&#x27; area, that it would work on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for the money I paid.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than my old shaver did, and that one probably cost over $50.</li>
            <li> Since this was a recent purchase I&#x27;ve not had a chance to use it much (the reason for only 4 stars), but so far I am very</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter because I did not want her using a reg razor.</li>
            <li> no messy looking tangled cord).</li>
            <li> My old electric shaver cut my skin this ones does not.</li>
            <li> I completely understand why.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money... bought two as gifts</li>
            <li> and this razor would not  even rid me of my nearly transparent arm hairs, let alone my 3 underarm hairs, or anything below that.</li>
            <li> just pinches and pulls on longer soft hair..</li>
            <li> it has never given me a problem so far.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t completely close,like getting a wax but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I used to use my husbands old Norelco</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to buy this than get replacement blades for my old shaver.</li>
            <li> like I had to with my old one.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking this razor...</li>
            <li> (I feel so old saying that).  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Some people complained that you had to go over an area more than once.  </li>
            <li> charger doesn&#x27;t have a cord and plugs directly into the outlet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old razor that broke )-:  </li>
            <li> Charger is convenient and the razor holds a charge for a complete leg shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend for a young lady beginning to shave</li>
            <li> and my skin is incredibly sensitive</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I leave it on the charger 24/7 except when I&#x27;m using it, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the battery holding a charge.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 10 year old and I ended up using it also.</li>
            <li> And wow.....</li>
            <li> The price was very affordable and I would recommend it for women who don&#x27;t require a daily shave.</li>
            <li> I am very tempted to buy another to have for the future since companies are always changing models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far they have held up well as far as recharging goes</li>
            <li> Pulls hair too much, even with initial use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it so far.  </li>
            <li> My old one cracked to which is why I purchased this.</li>
            <li> So far used this twice</li>
            <li> But it was definitely worth the $$ spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be charging it up anyway just to be safe for my next shave in a few</li>
            <li> its kind of weird having my razor standing straight up from my outlet</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last more than a few years.</li>
            <li> But I really like the shaver works well, worth the trouble of a reorder.</li>
            <li> Well, if this is the best, I&#x27;d hate to see what all the others are like.</li>
            <li> , if you have sensitive skin, make sure you shave slowly with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I should be glad the Remington quit holding a charge and forced me to buy something to replace it.  </li>
            <li> and I was tired of waiting for it to warm up before I could even start trimming hairs.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver,but not perfect for arms.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating which model to get but then decided to give the least expensive one a try since it had gotten so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I must have tried at least 10 different electric razors, including some that were designed for the guys...and this one is the best HANDS DOWN!!!</li>
            <li> Only minor down thing has been catching or pulling on stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase for such a small amount of money!</li>
            <li> I had been hesitant to get a new electric razor - even though my old one (also panasonic) was on the fritz after about 8yrs of semi-regular use - because my first one never really got that close a shave</li>
            <li> No need for lotions or shaving creams or having to clean up the mess</li>
            <li> I did have some slight discomfort after the first use or so, but I think I was applying too much pressure, because with my old razor I had to, in order to get results.</li>
            <li> But sometimes it leaves a red mark on my right arm at the same spot.  </li>
            <li> This razor works so that no hair is visible, but it does not give as close a shave as an actual razor (that should be obvious right).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life: Even though it said that it needs to be charged for 12 hours before the first use and between every use, I used it right out of the box to test it out on a small patch.</li>
            <li> I come right back and wonder why I left.</li>
            <li> with this razor that was the easiest hair removal ever, I only use it dry before I&#x27;m about to shower, and it worked perfectly on my full legs, fore arms, armpit and bikini area.</li>
            <li> also suffer from eczema and very sensitive skin; four days after my first shave with this device, my legs didn&#x27;t feel nearly as itchy or dry as they normally do after shaving with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> The Close shave and no little bumps.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of this wet/dry razor for a lazy girl like me!</li>
            <li> I decided to wait 24 hours just to make sure I&#x27;m not getting any reaction, and charged it in the mean time.</li>
            <li> if you PRIME what i Mean :)</li>
            <li> OK, I have one small problem, my box arrived with hair already on the inside of the box!</li>
            <li> I was willing to put up with that, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> My thighs will get painful shaving burn with a normal razor, and this is the perfect solution, and I can do it dry without problems!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to charge using the small plug/dock.</li>
            <li> This might sound weird, but because of this shaver, I am now excited when it is time to shave.</li>
            <li> You may have to go over the same spot many times, and I found that getting a clean shave with this product often meant tolerating razor burn and a tedious process.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I was VERY pregnant and not able to see my toes.</li>
            <li> I used it dry for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver because I&#x27;ve spent years with my leg in the bathroom sink trying to balance on the other leg and shave.</li>
            <li> The changer unit is small and easy to use with the razor attached.  </li>
            <li> As an extremely hairy lady also gifted with pale and sensitive skin I have spent a significant amount of my life worrying about hair removal.</li>
            <li> but this left me pretty smooth and no real lasting itching, just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little brush that is included to clean the blades with.</li>
            <li> She uses it with a little body soap, can manage it herself and can clean it herself as well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and maneuver when shaver is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> so uh.. stick to your legs and other flat surfaces and you should be fine....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This got the job done, though it did start to drag toward the last part of the session even though I stopped frequently to clean &#x27;er out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think you will like it, especially if you are an older adult.</li>
            <li> Bought this particular product because my old shaver was the same brand.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought it was dead, so I attempted to charge it by plugging it into the wall</li>
            <li> It caused me extreme anxiety, so I would rarely ever shave, and could not wear shorts or dresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking high and low to find a shaver that combines 1)a close shave 2) ease of use 3) safety in highly sensitive areas -</li>
            <li> I guess the only con now is that since it&#x27;s a shaver, I&#x27;ll have to shave every 2-3 days, because the hair grows back very fast.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old one was - getting a new one makes my legs as smooth as shaving it with a razor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and actually didn&#x27;t shave my legs for several years because the red bumps, stinging, and itching weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to wet shave when I&#x27;m getting very good results shaving it dry</li>
            <li> For years she always uses a razor but after convincing her to try this shaver that can be used wet or dry, she hasn&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li> -- I can get a VERY close shave on my legs - almost as if i shaved for real (maybe 1 day of growth?) - in about half the time it took me with my old razor.</li>
            <li> , I am not an especially &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; person to begin with, but, I think this makes it even more difficult to shave those fine hairs rather than coarse</li>
            <li> It definitely works better dry than wet though it does specify that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I went back to regular razors they worked better and less often.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this dry, but assume the wet use will be even better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave- waste of money</li>
            <li> I like it better than my previous more expensive brand of rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done if you&#x27;re willing to go over your shaving areas a few times and thoroughly clean the blades and take it apart to do that especially, while you&#x27;re in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs with a regular razor has become detrimental and never fails to leave several nicks and bleeding.</li>
            <li> so I prefer to shave dry, but the shaver seemed to do fine on wet skin the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li> Overall: Decent product.</li>
            <li> No complaints, except that my hair grows back - I hate shaving, and this razor makes it a pleasurable and quick experience, with great results.</li>
            <li> I have tried the more expensive dual head shavers and I don&#x27;t feel that they get any closer of a shave than this one; and this one is much quieter!</li>
            <li> and you can get several shaves of decent length before having to recharge it.</li>
            <li> razor battery lasted me less than a year before it would just drain quickly after being charged.</li>
            <li> Decent razor, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing is as close as a razor, but this does a decent enough job in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I always used a typical razor I decided to get this because I needed something I could use quickly while on vacation</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and the battery is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first lasting about 3 years before it died.</li>
            <li> I only use it for my underarms, but I like it better than my shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s never going to provide the exact same shave as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> bought as a replacement for my daughter who stole my first one (was a replacement for another brand 6-8 years ago) when she went to college three years ago which then husband bought my second one, so this is the third one,</li>
            <li> As with previous comments and reviews I have read I would recommend not moving the razor to quickly to avoid your skin catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had and the first was about 20 years ago..</li>
            <li> I replaced a different brand with this shaver because the older electric shaver fell apart.  </li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair and fair skin</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap wet/dry from a big box store which helped cut down on my buying of disposables.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a higher standard for shaving her legs than with other shavers</li>
            <li> This one is very good and much less expensive than the mens model.</li>
            <li> I received a new shaver not long after.  </li>
            <li> Buy this shaver for my wife, because with normal razors was much irritated skin, after reading several reviews and see that most reviews spoke highly of this model, I decided to buy it and try it, I can say that the finish is almost Similar to manual razors, without the annoying irritation, lasts about 20 minutes running, which has reached me to shave all my wife&#x27;s body: legs, underarms, vagina, and also is easy to wash</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and for only $20 plus shipping!!!</li>
            <li> and I can only shave using the high level</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my old Remington for around ten years and is tried many times to replace it with a few recent model, but everything is tried has been returned or thrown away after one shave.</li>
            <li> reviews, Good Housekeeping, and product claims seemed to tout it as a best-in-class razor for a gentle shave, close as possible with as near zero chance of cutting oneself as presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth and silky after each shave either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> comfortably and can be used dry and wet</li>
            <li> I figured I would try a cheap wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so easy to do everyday that it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to me</li>
            <li> Following other reviews on Amazon, I always do a dry shave and make sure that it&#x27;s fully charged to prevent tugging at hairs.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: a pretty decent little shaver.</li>
            <li> Again, a huge waste of time!</li>
            <li> If it really lasts as long as the manufacture says.</li>
            <li> have had now for nearly a month.slight crack in one side, barely noticeable, but not affect how it works.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a gift from my hubby mid winter, after letting my natural beauty grow far too wild.  </li>
            <li> Not good for bikini area at all, does okay for legs.</li>
            <li> Very reliable and keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not a good as I hoped but better than the alternative.</li>
            <li> I can get a smooth shave in a few minutes!</li>
            <li> charges quickly,keeps a charge,and is comfortable in my small hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shaver holds charge for a long time and it shaves really well.  </li>
            <li> The case that comes with it is too small to fit both the shaver and the charger.</li>
            <li> The case that comes with it is too small to fit both the shaver and the charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I didn&#x27;t find any other suitable options for a starter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dream around the bikini line--so much easier and cheaper than waxing, and (as long as you exfoliate afterward)</li>
            <li> I actually have gone back to the old shaving cream and razor because this did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to fit shaver and battery</li>
            <li> Works really well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> and she has fine soft blond hair with hardly any ingrowns.</li>
            <li> , this really does the trick to get all that long hair off the legs.</li>
            <li> It is light years ahead of razor blade shaving, but I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> But really, how long does it take to shave your underarms..</li>
            <li> I normally use handheld eyebrow trimmers from beauty supply stores to trim facial, underarm and bikini hair.  </li>
            <li> I would rate it higher except that I haven&#x27;t tried it wet.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product like this and got exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I generally used it on my bikini area and if you&#x27;re careful, it can actually be used for a full brazillian</li>
            <li> This is not a fault of the product of course, rather this is pretty much to be expected.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected from a foil razor.</li>
            <li> Now there is no dark spots anymore.</li>
            <li> The shave is good enough, not great, takes multiple passes but does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Now it dies within about 5 minutes after a full charge ( it takes me about a minute to do under my arms, and a few minutes for each leg).</li>
            <li> I can feel and see more stubble than my old (OLD) Remington wet/dry shaver used to leave behind.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve said ouch a few times, but it&#x27;s not really painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving the country is a few months and will need a shaver that works on 220v, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a new one right now.</li>
            <li> It shaves okay in certain places, such as my legs, but I have to go over an area a few times to shave it all the way down.</li>
            <li> About ten years ago I finally upgraded to a Venus which was mediocre, then a Schick several years later [which I still love], but then after stealing my brother&#x27;s beard trimmer I realized that electric razors are WAY better.</li>
            <li> While this may not shave as close as a regular razor, in my opinion, it&#x27;s certainly close enough!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was remarkably easy to use, and the pop-up attachment for longer hair makes getting hard to reach areas a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dark hair and found that the shaver works much better on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t go with an electric shaver because I have such thick, course hair and all other ones I&#x27;ve tried did not do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers have weak motors, don&#x27;t shave closely, require far too many pass overs of one area, or are simply so frustrating that I throw them away and return to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Works very well - too new to evaluate the charging complaints found in other comments.  </li>
            <li> There is a pop up feature that allows you to shave longer hair and then just push it back down to get a clean shave to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge really well, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and has a trimmer feature for that hair you haven&#x27;t kept up with and got a bit too long!</li>
            <li> But instead of throwing it out right away, I let it sit for a while (not in the charging stand) and both times, 24-48 hours later, when I tried the power switch it magically turned back on like it was never ever mad at me in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and as well the new product which I recently order</li>
            <li> I have only used the new one a couple of times, and this week after charging it overnight, I turned it on and again, nothing.  </li>
            <li> So sometimes, I simply get a new razor.</li>
            <li> purchased for my teen new to shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After owning it for 6 months the battery only let me shave one leg before needing a new charge.</li>
            <li> A new foil is only $9.95.</li>
            <li> Although it has a 2 year warranty, I would have to ship it to California or New York for service, since those are the only two places that have service centers for this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Had another brand that was constantly needing new screens and foils.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time and it shaves really well.</li>
            <li> Been busy with other things in life, but felt I needed to post a positive about this shaver.</li>
            <li> For the unforseeable future, I cannot use disposable razors (too great a risk of cutting self and bleeding).</li>
            <li> However, during dry shaving, if I go to fast my skin catches in the razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work very well when you use it dry.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave for an electric and so far the battery lasts longer than expected between charges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the dry option doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second one - used the first until battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore (quite a long time).</li>
            <li> So worth trying for less than $20.</li>
            <li> The shave lasts much longer than regular razor shaving, and without the hazard of potential nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> The only drawback with this shaver is that it has no cord - you plug the recharger directly into the socket and the shaver directly into the recharger.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because after several years of use, my last razor (another brand) broke and this seemed reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> If your hair is long enough to be cut by the clippers, you need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor shaving made my skin really sore and irritating but using this shaver leavers my skin smooth and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> This allows me to at least get rid of visible hair until I can get back to do a better job with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product worked very well when it actually did, I just can&#x27;t get over the battery/outer frame issues enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does cut things pretty close -- closer than I would have chosen, but it keeps the hair long enough that ingrowns aren&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s razors for as long as I remember because I like getting a close shave but didn&#x27;t realize that it was possible to get a pretty close shave with an electric razor with none of the razor burn and pain and ingrowns.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic as I lost my first one after long use.  </li>
            <li> I think that if you need something that will leave your legs really smoothe you might need to get a more expensive product.  </li>
            <li> These reviews have helped me so many times that I am really finding it difficult to buy things in the store without someone telling me about it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that prevents me from using a regular razor on the bikini and underarm areas.  </li>
            <li> No issues, made by a major manufacturer, and seems to be well made.  </li>
            <li> My longest lasting razor thus far!</li>
            <li> Major letdown and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my face, which may make me a little pickier than if I were using this on my legs, but still, all the other razors I&#x27;ve owned were better than this.</li>
            <li> shaving my legs was a major annoyance.  </li>
            <li> Dont know how it would have worked if I had not used that other shaver first though.  </li>
            <li> Barely works!</li>
            <li> Charges well and can get plenty of time to shave all major areas without battery dying out.  </li>
            <li> not extremely close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 joyous weeks-no scratchy stubble if I take an extra minute or two, zero ouches or burns, and it gets my bumpy underarms completely!</li>
            <li> Finally something that works to shave legs arms etc for my 12 year old!  </li>
            <li> I was able to quickly shave both my legs while sitting down, using the dry setting -- it cut my shaving time at least in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, so if you&#x27;re looking for a super quiet trimmer, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Usually not painful unless I was being quick and careless</li>
            <li> first dry exfoliate then shower with aveeno shower oil,dry off then dust over with baby powder that seems to give me an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product dry, and it gives a VERY close shave!</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t run out of power half way through a shave (presently it is only powered by wall charge and a full re-charge</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that the basic Schick double blades were more powerful than this shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t leave stubble behind - very smooth results.</li>
            <li> But enough to do some little clean</li>
            <li> I use the adjustable extending single blade only and it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> 4 FL OZ, Super Size.]], which puts back the moisture and calms down the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would agree with those that said this isn&#x27;t ideal for the bikini area, it is a bit large to get into tight areas and it does tend to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hair when on the trim setting, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, the shave left my legs less smooth than they are 3 days after a shave with a traditional razor blade in the shower.  </li>
            <li> sure, wet and dry, but does almost nothing when wet.</li>
            <li> shaved with it, yes it left me partially smooth but left yucky black dots all over my legs like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Even if it only lasts 6 months like the other reviewers said, I still think it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this shaver, I&#x27;m one of those individuals who cannot handle nickel and other metals, and the Close Curves shaver is one of the few I can use without getting a reaction.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one as the whole shaver cost less then replacing just the blades</li>
            <li> the other day.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was my first and only so far.</li>
            <li> When I use the shaver, every few minutes I have to stop and clean it, personally I don&#x27;t mind,</li>
            <li> and I had to make several passes over the same area in order to get a decent result.</li>
            <li> It is a quick shave on my legs and can be used either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> When I would get out of the shower, I would experience mild itching, especially on my arms and legs for about a half hour.</li>
            <li> After a year of light use the blades have become too dull to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to fit the shaver &amp; charger togather in it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave smooth like it advertised, I had &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my legs and the blade seems dull.</li>
            <li> The charger is nice and small and takes up little space.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for an electric razor that actually works.  </li>
            <li> Blade got dull pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something I could use on the front of my shins and down by my Achilles tendon where I&#x27;m starting to have problems with nicks since my skin is getting thinner as I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is a little difficult but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I agree that you need to be sure that your skin is either wet or extremely dry when using it.</li>
            <li> Hair should be about 1/4&amp;#34; or it&#x27;s difficult to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it hasn&#x27;t been an absolutely amazing experience..</li>
            <li> old one went bad and replaced it with the same model and happy with it.</li>
            <li> The least comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> There is also a clipper feature, which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but I don&#x27;t generally use the clippers anyway.  </li>
            <li> Generally this shaver works well.  </li>
            <li> This shaver generally did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Have an indicator that tells you when it is charged, or at least just have the light go</li>
            <li> This razor does have the pop up feature, but it did seem like it has a tendency to pull the hairs, so I generally don&#x27;t use the pop-up feature.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I avoid the general nicks that I would get with a razor.</li>
            <li> Mind you, this one may not last as long, but unless it dies in a year I am very impressed!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to be hairy in the final stages, and at first I was using cheapo $10 electrics because honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between them and the note expensive ones I used in the past, plus at $10 a pop</li>
            <li> The charging time of 12 hours is a bit much, but it seems to last a long time between charging times.</li>
            <li> I tried this electric shaver on my legs and take about 10 times longer than it would take with a regular old shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to work near as well as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> it caught and removed all the old lady poker hairs with only a couple trips across my chin/neck area.</li>
            <li> Please buy this product if you have sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle a regular shave.</li>
            <li> Over the years, she has developed a lot of facial hair on her cheeks, neck, and under her chin.</li>
            <li> The only possible negative is the charger-it&#x27;s just not the most convenient type for me.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m very cautious not to get it wet</li>
            <li> She has such sensitive skin that the dermatologist recommended getting an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Christmas shopping on the net kept me busy</li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it plugs directly into the charger that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> Know going in that it will not replace a bare razor and it will work for you.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave as close as I had expected, but I used it again after a shower and got a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and it gets rid of the light blonde peach fuzz-like hair, which the Remington had trouble with.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I get severe razor burn from shaving my legs when wet, and I always thought it would be so much easier to find a way to &amp;#34;dry shave.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> that you can barely tell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works very well and absolutely no knicks whatsoever.</li>
            <li> works well, only issue is the light on the charger is always red and never turns green.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver when my old purple Remington shaver went kaput.  </li>
            <li> I am still practicing and hope to get to where I won&#x27;t mind shaving, but I will admit I fall back to the old plastic shaver as I know what to expect.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old shaver because its battery gave up the ghost after several years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because her old Remington model finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> my needs are simple and this Panasonic ES2207P fills those needs completely.  </li>
            <li> Has a tendency to pull hairs at times even though it&#x27;s only a two weeks old.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive skin on the legs.</li>
            <li> This replaces one that was about ten years old.  </li>
            <li> Only design flaw thus far.  </li>
            <li> The battery, so far, holds its charge for several sessions.</li>
            <li> I sent it in to Panasonic for repairs nearly 2 months ago, but still haven&#x27;t heard anything back from them.</li>
            <li> waxed professionally once a month, back when I was in India.</li>
            <li> I had the same model and owned it for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very flexible,  nor am I very stable...</li>
            <li> I can barely get both legs below the knee done before it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li> Also, as expected, it doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave</li>
            <li> so far I have used it several times and it does not pull or cut my skin...</li>
            <li> but I had alot of irritation and a rash, so the next time I lathered up with sensitive shaving cream and had no rash or \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I hoped this would work for facial hair near chin</li>
            <li> Wish I could find my old Remington ladies personal trimmer again -</li>
            <li> no problems, does a decent job for dry shaving when you don&#x27;t have time to use a razer in the shower.</li>
            <li> My grandmother had given me an old one back in the 1990s that never did a thing, but I was hoping that maybe ladies electric razors had improved a bit since then.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once or twice so far</li>
            <li> Today, the razor barely cuts my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Although only used once so far, it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> If you have like 2-3 day old stubble on your legs and try to use this shaver, I don&#x27;t even think it works on hair that short.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I don&#x27;t like having to pass the same area twice.  </li>
            <li> Had to finally replace my old rechargeable shaver and got this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my old Remington with this Panasonic version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything--shaving with razors that cost a fortune, waxing, hair removal creams for sensitive areas--and everything has left my bikini line stinging, bumpy, even pimply no matter</li>
            <li> My buttons near the shaver head got stuck the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> And for 1/3 of the price of this Phillips Ladyshave Sensitive HP6366 that I bought from Walmart, that&#x27;s going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It stays charged much longer than I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it three times to far, and the battery seems to be holding power well.</li>
            <li> Back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Left me feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I frequently forget to throw it on the charger, but it doesn&#x27;t hesitate to work just as well the next day.  </li>
            <li> NATURALLY IT DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A REGULAR RAZOR...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the close shave this gave, for such an inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> the only reason that i even bought this was because her remington had just completely worn out.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy this model for myself in the near future.</li>
            <li> The airlines don&#x27;t like razor blades, apparently.  </li>
            <li> This razor cuts much closer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for a few years now and this one is pretty close to the old Remmington</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to watch with this shaver is that it does cut pretty close, so you have to be careful not to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> As long as you trim long hairs first, there is no pulling when you try to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to constantly shave like I did with my disappointed shavers, this Panasonic worked good the first time like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not a great shave, but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> (but it did a good job even on his chicken</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but not great.</li>
            <li> : I would recommend this razor for ladies with light to medium thick body hair.</li>
            <li> : I would recommend this razor for ladies with light to medium thick body hair.</li>
            <li> I am one of those rare women who have to shave everyday just like a man.</li>
            <li> There are other areas that we are expected now to keep clean shaven, and I have yet to find a razor that does that job, on such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but at first i was just moving it up and down like i shaved my legs.</li>
            <li> no little red</li>
            <li> Product is adequate for shaving however it has failed in less than a year of very light</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold a charge, and even with brand new blades it grabbed the skin under my arms leaving red marks and left stubble on my legs.</li>
            <li> if you live outside USA or will be travel in future in europe dont plug it in electric source, it will be burnt immediately.</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon  shipped it right out, it was a day early.</li>
            <li> but it did not work very well nor last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry but get a very close shave....</li>
            <li> I mean it glides smoothly on my skin while leaving my legs hairless.</li>
            <li> The ddirections do say to secure the shaver to the stand after use; but what they mean, but</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, so regular razors or male shavers are not in the cards.  </li>
            <li> ( You only have to clean it out every few minutes on first uses, or you have to do that after you have&#x27;t shaved in a few days.)</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t gotten a new razor in a long time and was nervous about ordering one on-line.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt matter if the hair is just 1 inch long or just newly growed haired</li>
            <li> I live in UK and didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that you plug the razor right directly into the charging plug so it has no long ugly cord laying around on my counter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why this one, with less blades and less movement, does such a better job...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for those with normal skin, or even just dry skin, but my skin does not like this shaver at all.</li>
            <li> I use it without the water (dry), hence my reason for wanting to use an electric razor instead of a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> After lots of research, this was one that could be used wet or dry, had a quick charger and that I could actually afford.</li>
            <li> Battery charge is not long enough to complete shaving needs as needed by customer.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for dry shaving mainly of my neck/hairline so don&#x27;t have a review for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super lazy when it comes to shaving</li>
            <li> I wanted to get an electric to shave my legs only now that I am older (62) and showering and shaving my legs is more difficult.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Braun it has a light that blinks red when battery is red and solid green when charged.</li>
            <li> Shaver is the right size and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a personal shaver for a long time and settled on a cheapy one that hardly worked (costing me about $8)</li>
            <li> I could not clean it the way I did when I used it wet, but when cleaning it with water, as recommended, I saw no hair again, nor were my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every ladies trimmer at my local walmart they all sucked compared to this i had to hunt it back down after old one i had i believe was destroyed by an old roomate, forget to shave your legs no problem this will get you out the door and save you an extra day or two, underarms no problem i wouldnt go for that too frequently tho as you will get irritation if you use it one your underarms too often, i only use the pop up trimmer for shaping my bikini area so i dont know to much about that</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said it wont be as close as a real shaver</li>
            <li> Works extremely well, and fast.  </li>
            <li> Mine stays charged much longer than other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re really set on an electric razor, buy one that either has a removable batteries, or a razor with a company other than Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> which I still use in case of needing to wear a bathing suit or other events, but, this keeps me from having to take the shower shave nearly as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li> I end up having to shave ever other day since my hair grows rather fast.</li>
            <li> I first used it dry and then cleaned it -- only to see no hair at all on the white paper towel as I brushed off the blade and tapped the foil on the paper.  </li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews on this razor I had high hopes, but was extremely disappointed after using it, both dry and in the shower with shave gel.  </li>
            <li> : Not a single issue.</li>
            <li> : Not a single issue.</li>
            <li> But since I liked it so much before it stopped working, I decided I&#x27;d try another to see if I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I have heard these are amazing but would love to know why mine didn&#x27;t work :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the charger light never indicates that it is charged, even when it&#x27;s been charging for hours.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is ridiculous, I actually had to use an old tooth brush to get it clean.</li>
            <li> To dry off, I sort of shake both the parts vigorously so that the water falls out, put the top back on to protect the blade, and leave it to air dry for a few hours.</li>
            <li> To dry off, I sort of shake both the parts vigorously so that the water falls out, put the top back on to protect the blade, and leave it to air dry for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Future buyers beware, they clearly send back items people used &amp; returned (gross)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery lasts long, really shaves and softly, not like others pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> (only really got it wet when rinsing it)</li>
            <li> I happen to have extra sensitive skin and coarse hair that tends to become ingrown.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can only shave about once a week with traditional shavers.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on dry skin but barely works at all on wet skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and since I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure or go over the same spot several times to get a close shave</li>
            <li> big disadvantage is that the razor casing developed a crack shortly after I began using it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work very well on wet skin, as described in the description of the product.</li>
            <li> At that time I was trying to decide on a more expensive razor for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lady who is over 60 years old and when women start to age their tissue in the face some times start to produce testosterone (or so my doctor tells me) and when this happens you grow hair on your face--especially around the chin area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as you follow the instructions carefully, this device here should make shaving so much easier!</li>
            <li> think the idea of a stranger spreading things, putting warm wax there then ripping it off is horrifying, so I was seeking an alternative to get the area smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job, but by no means as close as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Despite this, I found this product to be quit disappointing, especially after reading many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Also, go slowly, especially if your hair is longer, to avoid getting pulled on and to consistently trim the hairs down.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled as to getting a razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot, but it does tend to pull just a little when I first start using it.</li>
            <li> After running it across my legs multiple times to barely remove any hair, I got fed up and threw it in the trash this morning!</li>
            <li> First a little background.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to charge it this first time on the little charger that came with it.....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman who shaves everyday, or every other day this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to women who have sensitive skin, dark and coarse hair, or who simply want to try an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The pop-out cutter pulls slightly so is not used much; if there is a need to cut hair shorter (in less sensitive areas) a light partial blade shave &amp;#34;with&amp;#34; the grain usually gets it short enough; but can&#x27;t get longer growth.  </li>
            <li> I decided on this shaver after reading a few reviews, and I definitely made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, course, and dark leg hair and this just wipes that right out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first (and only) electric razor I had before this was this little purple Remmington that used batteries that I purchased from Dollar General.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d found this long ago, it works very well as a dry shaver -</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a wet / dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> a loyal Amazon customer for many years, I am thoroughly disappointed about the negligence on the seller &amp; marketplace&#x27;s part on this transaction.</li>
            <li> It hurts my skin and is not very user friendly, both with wet and dry functions.</li>
            <li> that of a porcupine.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very loud and embarrassing considering how long it takes going over the same area</li>
            <li> I really doubt there would be that much difference in performance, at least for me, between this one and the next step up</li>
            <li> This razor generally gets the job done in one pass, and when a second pass is needed, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY well designed - fits your hand like a glove, and the head glides over even the most delicate parts of you.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> it gives a close enough shave where you can barely feel stubble.</li>
            <li> I bought the only one I could find, a Remington, &amp; it barely shaved at all &amp; tore up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had the shaver long, but so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time a few hours ago and am still in pain-</li>
            <li> but could have been designed a bit better for using on curves of delicate areas and better at cutting longer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty thorough about shaving and go over areas a few times to get the closeness that I like.</li>
            <li> The wet option does a much better job for me, but only when I use a thick shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll invest in a higher quality razor so that I don&#x27;t have to replace it every few months.</li>
            <li> Although it was not expensive, still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This razor gives an OK shave (not great but not horrible), but it is uncomfortable on my skin -- pulls and scrapes.  </li>
            <li> (dry only) back in high school.</li>
            <li> On my bikini area I cant really say if it worked well or not, as I did use another product down there before but needed to bring in some reinforcement as I didnt get the close shave i wanted with that product.  </li>
            <li> but I put that down to moving the razor to fast over the area.</li>
            <li> The head is small enough to quickly wipe out unwanted facial hair as well.</li>
            <li> had an older version of this model, which I had to replace due to the battery</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far!  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t slow you down too much though, since you can just do some quick swipes and then switch to the foil.</li>
            <li> This razor work very well, shaves close but will never be equal to that of a conventional bladed razor.</li>
            <li> I would have thrown out my old shaver a long time ago!</li>
            <li> This razor works very well, however it is the 3rd razor I have purchased because the other brands only lasted 2 or 3 months and quit shaving.  </li>
            <li> the only plus over a hand shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t give you as much razor rash as a hand razor does, that is the only reason I still use it VERY CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> I could not find this Panasonic in stores or any other brand that was highly rated.</li>
            <li> It worked slightly better if the skin was wet, but oil did no good.</li>
            <li> Or for periods of time when I just have been working too much and have less time to manage the legs.</li>
            <li> And the shave is much closer than the previous one too.</li>
            <li> I have used it dry so far</li>
            <li> Just ordered this wet/dry one to replace the old dry one I dropped in water and broke.  </li>
            <li> It took less than 7 days from ordering to arrival, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li> I got this for my young daughter who is too young to shave with a razor but was worried about teasing at school for her dark hairy legs.</li>
            <li> And so far the charge is long lasting!</li>
            <li> &gt; If you are curious, my armpits are actually quite normal.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic ES2207P - the first one lasted a few years until the battery stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is thick and dark, and I LOVE his thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Small things like not being able to take care of basic hygiene issues are a little demoralizing.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product and thus far it has held up to every single one.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high hopes due to how coarse everything tends to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry, sensitive skin, and I can finally shave my legs without pain.  </li>
            <li> I have used this razor on wet and dry legs and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it dry so far.  </li>
            <li> Works very well both wet n dry</li>
            <li> So far i have only used it dry</li>
            <li> I really like wet dry shavers, but this one died and the one before that in just one year.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please with the close curves wet and dry shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it wet, but dry is just so much easier</li>
            <li> Have only used as dry shaver so far</li>
            <li> far I have only tried it dry</li>
            <li> If your legs are DRY when you dry shave, he quickly and efficiently mows down all the stubble in one pass.  </li>
            <li> If I pressed REALLY hard--hard enough to leave bruises--and went over every spot three or four times, I could finally get down to a day-old stubble.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly cuts down on my shaving with a razor time!</li>
            <li> So, I accessed support online, and spent 20-30 minutes talking to three different people, only to be told I would have to purchase a new charger.  </li>
            <li> It attaches right the the plugin to charge so you have no bulky base taking up space on the counter or long cords to get tangled which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as a wet shaver, only as a dry one - but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Look I mainly got this because I wanted to use it for my naughty bits.  </li>
            <li> and there are certain areas that work with a blade, others that work with an electric shaver, and some that are not comfortable regardless of what you are using.  </li>
            <li> Nifty little shaver, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Finding this razor really lifted my spirits as I can now shave my legs, and with a little help, my armpits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and realized that maybe my other one may just need new parts.</li>
            <li> I am new to using an electric shaver, so I cannot compare this with any other shavers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go back to shaving because it takes so much time, wastes so much water in the shower, and inevitably I cut myself almost every time (typically around my ankles).</li>
            <li> It would be great if it also came with a base type charger and a better case for travel (comes with a very thin drawstring bag and small cleaning brush), but for 16 bucks, it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of shaving my legs because my skin is very dry and sensitive</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a spring action, so that you can, very gently, press it down on your skin, giving a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little skeptical, but so far this has been doing the job nicely.  </li>
            <li> she has a hard time using straight edge blades and her old electric shaver wore out.</li>
            <li> Though next time I will spend a little more and upgrade to the next one up because I have such thick course hair.</li>
            <li> Due to very sensitive skin I can&#x27;t use a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is hard to maintain a good grip on it when my hands are wet.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad one either, but after many years with this razor, I&#x27;m ready to upgrade.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I had a different Panasonic razor that I loved and never pulled my hairs.  </li>
            <li> only bad thing is it is kind of loud, but it is an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin when it comes to regular razors and get really bad razor burn, but honestly, I&#x27;d rather have razor burn than use this electric one.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really not that bad but who cares, I have a fully suitable wet and dry shaver and that is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It worked well both wet and dry as advertised, gave a very close and non-irritating shave, and the charge lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> other reviewers mentioned, it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get a smooth shave with this device (and likely, with any electric shaver).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I wasn&#x27;t shaving right, it&#x27;s just that my skin was so sensitive that I&#x27;d always get cut, and the worse part was that it would burn and itch afterwards.</li>
            <li> I think if you go slow and keep the head tilted at the right angle</li>
            <li> I generally use this dry in the morning before running out the door, but it works well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on the other shavers.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a wet/dry shaver due to recently being put on blood thinners and this has worked well for me so far</li>
            <li> It takes less time using a normal razor if you ask me.</li>
            <li> have dark thick hair and this seriously did an amazing job!</li>
            <li> I have had lady shavers in the past and they either left big scratch marks on my legs or way too much stubble after multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> This was my second one in less than two years, and I already need a new one.</li>
            <li> I sport a decent number of little scars around my knees and ankles from contending with the awkwardness of shaving in THE SMALLEST SHOWER.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, using it for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a particularly sanguineous round of shaving this last weekend</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor, the first day I got it and used it on my arms, which were pretty fuzzy and have never shaved because I hated the commitment of doing it every other day, but OMG!</li>
            <li> I really prefer battery operated shavers because as long as you keep fresh batteries you&#x27;ll never be unable to shave, but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore.</li>
            <li> advice to any women considering this product due to sensitive skin: try safety razors instead.  </li>
            <li> for the ladies with really sensitive skin, to the point that it cracks to extreme heat.</li>
            <li> I do think as with any razor, you have to be careful in the bikini area, but when the razor is flat against the skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem and gets a much closer shave than I ever did with my other razor.  </li>
            <li> I found out if you lay it flat against your skin as much as possible then you can avoid this though.</li>
            <li> It shaves close enough, and the charge lasts long enough for several shavings of my legs.  </li>
            <li> if it dies in 6 months I will just buy a new one (still cheaper and less hassle than razers)</li>
            <li> Panasonic quality at a very reasonable price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted at least ten years.</li>
            <li> The shave is much closer when used dry (not as close as a razor, but close enough to wear shorts for a few days).  </li>
            <li> My wife utilizes this unit using only ordinary bar soap in lieu of shaving cream and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t tried this razor on dry skin, and I am not sure I will because the results in the shower with shaving cream is almost exactly like that of using a hand-held razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t tried this razor on dry skin, and I am not sure I will because the results in the shower with shaving cream is almost exactly like that of using a hand-held razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I have tried on damp skin a while after a shower, the shaver does NOT glide across the skin and is pretty much rendered useless.</li>
            <li> It cuts well, is quiet, and I really like its small charger.  </li>
            <li> This only happened twice, a very brief stumble, didn&#x27;t hurt, when the razor was just out of the box.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will last as long as my last one did</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a regular razor and it doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> Only problem is the battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I left it on the charger for three days thinking I had just not charged it long enough....</li>
            <li> Problem is, there&#x27;s no good alternative shaver at this price range - the others at this price have poor reviews or seem to be just for bikini lines, whereas I want a good one for shaving my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Panasonic for making this little gem!</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for sensitive areas like under the chin and the bikini areas, but tough enough to tackle legs that haven&#x27;t been shaved in a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and find that I am much less itchy after using this in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> ..I Highly Recommend This Product For Everyday Use</li>
            <li> And previously I had spent hundreds of dollars on wax, no no ( which was absolute garbage</li>
            <li> I personally will use mine dry and shave my legs every couple of days - it only takes a minute.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the device that I used before this, even though it is old and slightly rusty.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry as I use a regular razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and also a close shave even when using it dry on short of longer leg hair.  </li>
            <li> It sounded like a terrific shaver--and maybe it is, so far the shave seems less close than a razor</li>
            <li> I have been using disposable razors for several years now only because my previous electric razor died and at the time I was unable to find a suitable replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also holds a charge long enough for me to completely shave without it starting to die toward the end, like my previous razors did.  </li>
            <li> You do need to be a little careful on certain areas of your bikini line because you can cut yourself with the pop up</li>
            <li> Charges up fast &amp; holds a charge longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these when they first came out in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> how much$ I speny over the past 20yrs trying to resove this issuebut</li>
            <li> have dark hair and olive skin and my hair on my legs grows like wild fire!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so if you get lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a week or two, you really need to use the trimmer blades to shorten the hair before using the foil portion.  </li>
            <li> I have a newborn, so I usually have to take really fast showers...</li>
            <li> Recently I realized that it seemed to be functioning properly but wasn&#x27;t cutting hair any more.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the charge doesn&#x27;t seem to hold that long and takes quite a while to recharge.</li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a long time also.  </li>
            <li> The reviews say the shaver doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a socket in a convenient location, you have to jury-rig an extension cord so that the charger can stand on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> It last long the power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why women&#x27;s shavers can&#x27;t be made to last as long as men&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts long enough to do legs, and face.</li>
            <li> Charges last a long time, by the way</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long so it takes you forever to shave, and you have to make multiple passes over every inch.</li>
            <li> Charge last long but will not finish all ladyscaping in one sitting.</li>
            <li> It is not a quiet device, but it&#x27;s not atrociously loud and obnoxious either.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, no razor burn, long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> Works well on flat skin.  </li>
            <li> The extended shaver pulls the hair every now and then especially if hair is too long.</li>
            <li> Battery last a long time between charge.</li>
            <li> long blonde hairs on my legs, arms...</li>
            <li> I have to dig it into and drag across my skin, and even then it barely cuts hair at all.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a LONG time; I used it about 15 times without having to recharge, and the recharge time was only a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> She has been a long time user of razor and has not looked back since owning this.  </li>
            <li> I think the &amp;#34;20-minute&amp;#34; battery-life after a 12-hour-charge is unreasonable, but it lasted long enough for me to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> so long it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a razor blade&#x27;s shave does.</li>
            <li> About long enough for me to finish one leg.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last long.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to others, just so long as I don&#x27;t have problems with the battery in 6 months.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, trim it with scissors first.</li>
            <li> I has been using an old version (different brand but same features etc) and even new, the last one had to be used very slow</li>
            <li> the inside - the product turns on by pushing up a large button on the outside, but that actually just flips a very small, flimsy plastic switch on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Put down that old disposable and buy this baby.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the shaver doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few minutes, and the battery runs very slowly.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient to be able to use the little wall charger/base (no long cord, no remote base, no batteries to purchase) and see him sitting on the wall next to the hotel sink in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> It needs to glide smoothly over your skin, and if your skin is only damp, like from the bath or from sweating in a humid bathroom, it&#x27;s going to be tacky and the shaver will skip rather than glide, and you will be forced to press down harder to keep contact</li>
            <li> But for the bikini region, it&#x27;s pretty essential, as little short spiky hairs with a sharply-cut edge in that region are pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> While this does save space, it makes the 2nd outlet useless (whether you plug it into the top or bottom outlet, it partly blocks the other one).</li>
            <li> I only hope it lasts a long time before I have to purchase another one!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving with a razor usually results in pain and a rash unless I use the super expensive razors and high end shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry.  </li>
            <li> then my previous 15 year old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it in the shower, have tried it dry only.</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a pretty long time, but I charge it for a couple of hours at least once every week.</li>
            <li> I have only used this dry</li>
            <li> has used it several times dry, and says it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She also uses it as a dry shaver only while doing her legs away from the bathroom</li>
            <li> I have only used this as a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> My mom wanted a dry electric razor that she could use to shave her legs outside of the shower.</li>
            <li> but ive only used it once and used it dry..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used it dry and have had no problems with nicks.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like dry shaving my legs</li>
            <li> and I only dry shave with it.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it dry</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this shaver might make shaving my legs painless and easy, but unfortunately, it did the opposite&lt;</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry.</li>
            <li> I only dry shave</li>
            <li> , only dry.</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair, apply some talcum powder/baby powder and run a dry towel across the area in the direction opposite to the hair growth to lift the hair up.</li>
            <li> Also, this is a wet/dry razor, but I definitely prefer to use it dry.</li>
            <li> With soap, it left me as smooth as a razor, but without the expensive blades and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using this in the shower, I&#x27;ve only dry shaved with it.</li>
            <li> or dry same</li>
            <li> Only use it dry.</li>
            <li> I do mine after the shower and use a hair-dryer on low to totally dry off my skin before I use</li>
            <li> I started thinking about the fact that I shave less as I get older, and the utterly ridiculous prices on razors for women, razor kits--and wondered--how much has changed in electric razors from my rock clacking days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used in the dry mode,</li>
            <li> I only use it dry and have never used it in the water.</li>
            <li> use it dry though as this seems to make the  life of the shaver last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the pain if it means shaving less frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry.</li>
            <li> have only used it dry, as I was wanting one I did NOT have to use in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had this same shaver for many years and when it \\&quot;died\\&quot;, I was afraid it was not still being made.  </li>
            <li> I only use it as a dry shaver and use it just before going out.</li>
            <li> Although this is a wet/dry shaver, I have only used it dry so that it is what I am reviewing.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed out the removeable head and left it off to dry before reattaching it.</li>
            <li> I only use it as a dry razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less loud than my Wahl hair</li>
            <li> So basically it is not only a dry shaver</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have a few liver spots and tiny moles on my legs.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous.its tiny enough to carry in ur purse and big enough to shave legs in less than five min.</li>
            <li> My only choice is to ship it back to the Panasonic service center for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li> I sit on the toilet and shave my legs and then get in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Tired of nicks and having to suds up for a quick shave?</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and now that i live up north in the winter my skin was so thin that I could not shave regularly.</li>
            <li> have very soft hair on my face and this works well.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing and threading are too harsh and make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> It does it in a single pass without having to go back over areas.</li>
            <li> My last shaver had to be charged after every single shave.</li>
            <li> It must be placed into an outlet so if you have a limited amount of these in your house it may present a problem.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I would say it has is that it obviously does not cut the hair as close to the body as a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> its not a razor shave, but its great when you are lazy, or sleepy, or when i had a cast on for six weeks and taking a bath to shave was impossible.</li>
            <li> The charge is plenty long enough to do both legs on a single charge.</li>
            <li> and I hated spending money on a new one when my old one still &#x27;seemed&#x27; to work ok.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and shaving with a razor in the shower gives me crazy itchy skin once the hair starts growing back in.</li>
            <li> The manual says that 12 hours of charging gives about 20 minutes of shave, which sounds ridiculous at first.</li>
            <li> The presumptuous \\&quot;this works fine if you know how to use it\\&quot; is absolutely absurd.</li>
            <li> and I paid $ 300.00) for it., and other more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> have only used it DRY, as in my book water and electricity simply do NOT belong together, so I cannot comment on how well it handles a wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should mention that I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, not particularly hairy and</li>
            <li> This shaver did get SOME of the hairs - but I had to go over the same area about 7 or 8 times for it to work decently (not</li>
            <li> It works equally well wet in the shower or dry outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li> So when plugged in, it is NOT in my bathroom due to lack of open and properly situated outlets.</li>
            <li> Other shavers won&#x27;t work on longer hair and must be used only on short stubble.</li>
            <li> I have small hands so holding this particular shaver wasn&#x27;t comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not exactly what a nice girl needs to hv going on down there w/ very delicate skin!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE IF SKIN IS EVEN A LITTLE SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small bag to keep it in, a small brush to clean all of the hairs out of the inside.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to clean out the trimmer heads (one on front, one on back)</li>
            <li> I would give this shaver 5 stars if it had the kind of battery like my husband&#x27;s shaver - but for some reason women&#x27;s shavers only have the batteries that you&#x27;re supposed to let run down before re-charging, which I mind next to impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wet/dry shaver, but since I&#x27;m older 54, I never use it wet due to being brought up on extreme taboo of putting anything electric in the shower/bath.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use this razor and prefer a real razor to the electric because it gives a closer shave</li>
            <li> fits the hand very well and gets hard to cut area well</li>
            <li> Granted, I usually would use this shaver every day or every other day, but the fact that it can be used dry makes it so much easier to use daily.  </li>
            <li> I have dark, thick hair and was able to get close shave in very little time.</li>
            <li> I was anxious using this for the first time, since so many reviewers have had a bad experience regarding this shaver</li>
            <li> I had a mastectomy and some of the literature you get afterwards recommends a lady&#x27;s electric shaver instead of using a razor since your skin is numb and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to feel a razor cut.</li>
            <li> They looked smooth, but they always felt like there was still some stubble there, even with an expensive razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a closer shave, free from razor burn, and since it&#x27;s all-mechanical, the chances of the razor randomly breaking one day are about zero</li>
            <li> Ordered this one after she was unhappy with one she bought at target for $10 more than this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really be too picky about the close shave of an electric razor, so I can&#x27;t say anything negative about that.</li>
            <li> so I can avoid nicks in questionable water and shower facilities while staying smooth.</li>
            <li> It works well and is better than my cutting myself with a razor.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that the charger is a small cube that plugs directly into a socket.  </li>
            <li> You might want to use some small scissors before you trim if your&#x27;re starting off au natural</li>
            <li> The battery keeps its charge for several shaves and the charger is small and plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li> I would always get irritated skin and red bumps after using disposable razors, thinking it was normal, but then found out that I had a nickel allergy, which is commonly found in disposable razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing, but not worth taking stars away, is that the plug  in my case, only fits to the side, not up like the display.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as it claims.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, no burning, dragging or pinching of the facial skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in for long.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get something like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just used this shaver on my entire body and have absolutely no complaints at all.  </li>
            <li> It held a charge a long time, shaved close and never grabbed my skin.</li>
            <li> To get something even remotely akin to that, you have to go over the areas several times, and even then you can still feel the stubble.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife who loves the shaver and asked me why we didn&#x27;t buy this thing a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> also holds a charge for a long time, so I go without charging for long periods.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> stuff gets long...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry,never wet use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no longer an excuse to not shave your legs, ladies.  </li>
            <li> next time i will try wet shave..</li>
            <li> After a 2 years the batteries did not hold a charge long.</li>
            <li> No longer holds a charge no matter how long you recharge it.</li>
            <li> And the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought I was being extra careful to not over-charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a really long time which I need for my long legs.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> 3 days later the re-growth is minimal.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving the shaver, I charged it (didn&#x27;t take long), read the instructions, and used</li>
            <li> it holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> so stubble won&#x27;t become too long, but this shaver didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair.  </li>
            <li> The next day I used it in the shower -- as it was wet after use</li>
            <li> the best!&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time and the shave is close.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and keeps charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> One has to shave really a long time to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel stubby for a long time.</li>
            <li> Holds the charge long enuf to get legs shaved.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and does everything that it said it would.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge, a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts so long you almost forget you need to plug it in to charge every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it when my leg hair has been fairly long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the razor that long, but when it worked it worked well.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> so a close shave never lasts long for me anyway.</li>
            <li> All that to say that despite how long the hair gets, it has not pulled hair, and it does not hurt to shave.</li>
            <li> charge stays for a really long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Long battery life</li>
            <li> Keeps charge a long time.</li>
            <li> I just hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It actually shaves closer than I expected.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> I find that the battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> However, it will be a long time--hopefully--to see if it lasts as long as the Remington.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an electric razor, but I wanted to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Long life for a battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apologize for the long review beforehand, but I promise you, the details will help you make</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it wet with shaving cream...</li>
            <li> but it was a few years old and started to cut me.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s not nearly as close a shave as a blade.</li>
            <li> Plugs into wall charger and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Bottom third pops out partially, blow on it.  </li>
            <li> It has been so long since I used it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> Overall, no real complaints.</li>
            <li> my purpose of this purchase was to not have to take the long showers to shave.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> Safety razors clog when the hair is a bit long and then do not cut until the hair is rinsed off.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a LONG time of shaving, and I&#x27;ve had it running for over 30 minutes in one</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, and I did for as long as it worked.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> All electric shavers will pull hair if you allow it to grow too long.</li>
            <li> And I gave it multiple tries.</li>
            <li> I recommend this razor and it stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> long: didn&#x27;t read summary</li>
            <li> long: didn&#x27;t read summary</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave and had a long battery life.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THE LONG HANDLE</li>
            <li> I only use it when I didn&#x27;t shave in the shower, so I cant tell you how it works wet.  </li>
            <li> I have PCOS and exhibit minor hirsutism.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For legs: If my hair has grown a bit long I start out with the pop-up trimmer and glide that along my legs</li>
            <li> Works well for an elelectric and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to put it on the charger every day.</li>
            <li> According to her, if the hair is long, it would pull it out rather than cut it.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to buy one.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had used one of these or had been told to use one of these a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time, and cuts about as close as you can get from electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems, no nicks or cuts, battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery life is really long.</li>
            <li> and it hold a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange routine</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> next time, I think I will try it wet.</li>
            <li> I get about 7 from a long long charge.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Will try it wet next time.</li>
            <li> So long as it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one I had used for a long time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like chargers with long cords that have to sit on something while being charge.  </li>
            <li> It has a blade that can be raised to get at long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to leave something sitting on my vanity with a long cord.</li>
            <li> , I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for years to come, as long as Panasonic keeps making the replacement foils and blades...</li>
            <li> hope it lasts for years to come, as long as Panasonic keeps making the replacement foils and blades...</li>
            <li> I first bought the item in January then took it back to the store because I though the item was broken.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used Nair hair removal but didn&#x27;t want to chance placing extra chemicals on/in my body after reading about the negative side effects it had on some other pregnant reviewers with all the hormone</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy this product I would say to use it only on your private part to trim down the hair then finish the rest with it a razor.  </li>
            <li> my legs have been far, far less itchy than usual during the winter.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost of new shaver blades.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this electric razor as a dry shaver as opposed to a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I have only used it in a dry setting, because I&#x27;m scared to use it in a wet setting.</li>
            <li> Only enough battery power to shave half a leg</li>
            <li> Wet or dry this shaver pulled hair and left my skin and me, irritated.</li>
            <li> Shaves the same wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Even though I go over the same areas several times with this process, it takes less than two minutes to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> have been looking for a wet dry shaver and found this one and to actually be rechargeable?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it on both wet and dry skin, and it works equally well on both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with both wet and dry skin... works the same!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but honestly, since I purchased this for nearly half off of Amazon&#x27;s listed price I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> Have only used it dry, but has a wet capability also.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry, like the low profile recharging system also.  </li>
            <li> When I moved to the US, I realized how super expensive it is to get it done here, especially on a student budget!</li>
            <li> Keeps its charge for a long, long time (months!).</li>
            <li> A total waste of my money, which is so sad because when it worked the first two times , it was a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I also live that it runs quieter than some electrics I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you find that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well, I&#x27;d return it right away rather than put up with poor functioning.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little weird at first but doesn&#x27;t weigh much so it doesn&#x27;t fall out of the outlet.  </li>
            <li> One minor downside, the twin trimmers on each side of the foil make shaving beneath my nose and ears a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> I tried it briefly on my underarms but my skin didn&#x27;t agree with it--not tight enough maybe?</li>
            <li> I decided recently to give electric shavers another try, figuring if I had the same result as before, at least it would get my hair short enough that I could shave it with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a fella, I tried three different brands of electric shavers for men, all of which were horribly disappointing and extremely expensive, before giving this one a try, which turned out to be far superior than the others.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful on the angle, sometimes this will pull the hair - but overall much less than other razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Plus a single charge lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver multiple times now, both wet and dry, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had dropped it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor for other senior women.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaved my private area extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have troubles shaving my legs due to my back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long in life without one!</li>
            <li> If your hairs are too long it will hurt!</li>
            <li> So when I was told to stop using a regular razor due to blood clots I was worried.  </li>
            <li> so I have tried other smaller ones meant for travel</li>
            <li> I can finally get rid of my other shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is not working due to the above.</li>
            <li> I have had several other electric razors, (conair, braun..</li>
            <li> It just seems like the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough or something.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers wrote, also use it for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I only used it to trim my bikini area once every other week.</li>
            <li> So that was a fail, and I&#x27;d recommend shaving with a regular razor first if possible or trimming with scissors before using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> That was the other that I kept waffling over when finally settled on this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, friction is responsible for most of your nicks and also for those extremely painful incidents where a small bit of skin gets caught by the shaver.</li>
            <li> That way you can learn the ropes before switching to the speedy, extra sharp razors.</li>
            <li> The other armpit I noticed that some of my skin was getting caught/immediate red bumps rash.</li>
            <li> The other armpit I noticed that some of my skin was getting caught/immediate red bumps rash.</li>
            <li> This is pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t come in other colors..</li>
            <li> i agree with several other reviewers .</li>
            <li> WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a really long time a well!</li>
            <li> The blades last longer than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> The shaver pulls long hair and it hurts!</li>
            <li> Due to health issues it was suggested I use only electric shavers.</li>
            <li> The next time I cleaned it, the other piece broke off the foil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other&#x27;s and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> In the bathroom, I only have one bathroom outlet and other things to plug in, so it&#x27;s a bit of an outlet hog.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and she especially like the cube charger since there&#x27;s no cord.  </li>
            <li> you can just trim it till your next wax session is due..</li>
            <li> Purchased this after my other brand died - but had owned for several years.</li>
            <li> So hard to find decent electric razors for women.</li>
            <li> I can only dry shave my legs due to chronic dizziness.</li>
            <li> It gets the thick hairs down on my shins, calves, and on my inner thighs very well and those are the ones that always end up with razor burn.</li>
            <li> I tried a different brand and it was very rough and scratchy feeling, I did keep it</li>
            <li> Battery lasts very long between charges.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t very long but can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It holds its battery charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time</li>
            <li> It hold a charge for a very long time and can be used both dry and in the shower.</li>
            <li> I used the razor dry and was amazed at how well it works on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I used it dry..</li>
            <li> Also, you can dry shave with it</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Everytime i&#x27;d dry shave with a razor</li>

            <li> I used it dry on my legs that hadn&#x27;t been shaved for a month (</li>
            <li> I use it dry after showering.  </li>
            <li> If it makes a difference, I used this razor dry.</li>
            <li> I use for dry shaving, never tried the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this in the shower once but prefer to use it in dry mode..  </li>
            <li> I used it dry.</li>
            <li> When used &#x27;dry&#x27; it pulls some.</li>
            <li> and I use it dry tho</li>
            <li> I use the shaver dry.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer than anything I&#x27;ve tried to date (dry shave).</li>
            <li> I do not use dry because my skin get dry with any dry shave and even moisturizer shows it for two days (but</li>
            <li> That may have been because I prefer to shave dry with electric razors...</li>
            <li> I shave them dry before my shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well in dry mode.</li>
            <li> So I got this wet/dry shaver to see if I could dry shave before getting in the shower . . .</li>
            <li> not when you get out of shower dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it dry.</li>
            <li> I almost always use it dry while I catch the news in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I always use it dry to shave my legs either before I take a shower or when I change into shorts but didn&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shave is close to manual razor quality, and it glides like butter even when I use it on my armpits, dry.</li>
            <li> I use it dry for a close cut.</li>
            <li> no nicks or cuts and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> As a dry shaver?  </li>
            <li> I used it dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on dry skin because without the water running, I can wear my glasses/contacts</li>
            <li> I can dry shave,  which is convenient.</li>
            <li> After several e-mails informing me that they were on back order, I am now told they are not available.  </li>
            <li> This stopped working - totally dead - exactly 1 day past the return window.</li>
            <li> Different bodies, different skin, it stands to reason every lady will have different types of hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark blonde hair, but my leg and armpit hair comes in between thick/thin, and dark black.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it sits on the charger which plugs directly into the wall versus having a cord.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin and not a smooth finish like using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> But alas it must not be shaving as close as my old shaver (14 years old)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair skin, and disposable razors have always given me horrible razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Only had it about 3 weeks and would highly recommend it, the only thing that could use some improvement which is why I only gave it 4 stars is the connection to the charger which is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> The side of the the blade is big enough for quick shaves, and small enough to get around difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The side of the the blade is big enough for quick shaves, and small enough to get around difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how I shaved - wet or dry - I went over the same section 10 times, and there was little to no difference visible from that section to the next.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and began to look at electric razors again since I was cutting my legs up terribly no matter how careful I was trying to be</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> As a single mom of an infant, I don&#x27;t have time to shave my legs in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> rechargeable battery&#x27;s life might be limited to 2-3 years, but at this price I think that is forgivable.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> so this year I decided no more razor shaving my legs in the winter, though after using my old Ladies Remington (the one with the purple trim)</li>
            <li> This is for the white model with pink sides, #ES2207P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other brands for ladies shavers, but this one is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dark coarse hair- do not buy this electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is just not powerful enough to do the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take a charge, and is not worth sending back.  </li>
            <li> The charger is small and plugs directly into an outlet, with no cord to have to worry with.  </li>
            <li> This shaver, which has one cutter, (dissappointed,) shaves slightly above average.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate it may get slippery in the shower due to lack of rubberized grip and mostly flat switches, but I don&#x27;t use these in the shower anyway.</li>
            <li> The shaver sits atop a small plug charger that plugs directly into the wall outlet.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on longevity since I haven&#x27;t had it real long.</li>
            <li> Apparently the rechargeable battery inside is dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently part Wookie, so having let my leg hair grow out for a few months, it was this or a weed-wacker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but every time I shaved the more sensitive areas, I had terrible bumps.</li>
            <li> was really disappointed, because I truly liked the razor.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it, but after three months, the cutting heads are dull, and it takes three complete shavings, pressing hard, to bother to start feeling for missed spots.</li>
            <li> After a month it started not working then found out it was a loose connection in the prongs where it attaches to the charger.  </li>
            <li> It came in a box loose.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that the switch had come loose on</li>
            <li> I purchased a new one because the extendable &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; blade became dull and it is not replaceable.</li>
            <li> thing that is somewhat of a pain is that it is difficult to clean and using wet was virtually a nonevent for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t get the trimmer back down</li>
            <li> Eventually though, this also wore me down, so I decided to research different ways to shave my legs, which brought me to this electric shaver here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I ran the battery down and now the razor won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> However, I believe it is because I&#x27;m following the directions and not lifting the razor as I go up and down my legs or forearms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ((a side note if you shave down there- follow with unscented regular deodorant to prevent bumps/irritation, too))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It had somehow fallen into the hamper and then made its way to an unintentional deep cleaning, and been switched on as it bounced up and down and around.  </li>
            <li> when your shaving down there your only supposed to damp it then shave smh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me only about 5 minutes to shave both legs from the knee down.  </li>
            <li> but you can feel just a little tiny bit of stubble but for me as long as you can&#x27;t see the hair thats all i care about .</li>
            <li> I bought this razor, but since it was 1/3 the price, my hopes were not high.</li>
            <li> The cut may not be as close as from a standard razor, but by the same token, there is no razor burn left behind as sometimes is the case with a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for a special needs child who we were afraid would cut herself with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> She recently had to go on blood thinners for a few months due to a medical reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides THAT discomfort, I never felt like I was getting a close shave without really pressing down hard on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many bad ones in those long months.</li>
            <li> But, this shaver beats them all, even with a dry shave!  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry either!  </li>
            <li> The compact charger eliminates the awkward cord, is easy for travel and a space saver to store.  </li>
            <li> Your skin either has to be completely wet or completely dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes shaving easier because it takes less time than shaving with a regular razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li> tried both wet and dry functions</li>
            <li> U can shave wet or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This will give you the close shave that you want with the versatility of using wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer and feels gentler than the earlier ones, and it costs less.</li>
            <li> Use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> it definitely gives me less bumps then</li>

            <li> Works well wet and dry.</li>

            <li> I can use it wet dry,  every where I want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several months and hope it last longer than the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I use it wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Wet Or Dry.</li>

            <li> The wet and dry work well.</li>
            <li> Works as promised: on wet or dry skin.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2207P ladies shaver gave a close shave while dry and also while wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> It works on dry and wet skin.  </li>
            <li> Put it in the charger last night and after 9 hours it ran for less than a</li>

            <li> It took me half the time to shave than with a regular razor!</li>
            <li> Product works well in wet and dry conditions.</li>
            <li> it does not get as close as with a razor but definitely close enough for me with out the usual bumps and razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry.  </li>

            <li> Wet and Dry--</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it wet but works wonderfully dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it does not work wet dry</li>

            <li> It can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that is can be used either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> i prefer to use this product dry, i tried wet and it pinched me.</li>
            <li> I like the ability to use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> no matted what length, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for wet and dry shaving of my legs.  </li>
            <li> I like that it can be used wet or dry and that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> However when she used it dry it gave her razor burn and when used wet still requires shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Although it is not a super close shave by feel, it is close enough to wear shorts without seeing any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Always use when 100% charged, and use when skin is completely wet &amp; completely dry.</li>
            <li> Can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It does work wet or dry, as it should.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive razors in the past that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact I can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> (when shaving the battery sometimes dies so I wanted to have a back up to avoid a half shaven pair of legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a black man with moderately course hair.</li>
            <li> used it dry and wet - works</li>
            <li> I like that you can use it dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> Not a super close shave, but enough to get by.</li>
            <li> Basically what you expect out of a electric shaver, no more no less.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it gave up on me too quick.</li>
            <li> They have been just OK, and the two I purchased recently in local stores to replace an older one were downright awful.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry, on my underarms and have gotten a little bit of razer burn, so</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t want to bring a razor with me to the public shower I&#x27;ve switched to dry shaving with this little guy.</li>
            <li> She spends half the summer in long pants because she can only shave once every other week.</li>
            <li> As someone who used to sell on the Amazon marketplace -- until Amazon started playing fast and loose with their ever-evolving and less than forthright *cough* (lies) policies -- I know that a seller would be penalized for fulfilling an order so slowly.  </li>
            <li> only.&lt;br /&gt;The new razor is less expensive than the blade and foil set that would be necessary to get her old razor up and running again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a part of the head that pops up to cut long hairs and crazy strays, which is very useful.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and would get itchy after shaving my legs with a regular razor (from pressing down too hard).</li>
            <li> It shaves closely, is quiet and collects hair inside the shaver rather than leaving a film of hair on the floor or toilet seat where I usually prop my legs for dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> When it was working, it was great, but now I am thouroghly displeased and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as price for this new shaver was cheaper than replacement parts for my old Remington 5000.</li>
            <li> (By the way, I never use mine wet, I use them dry before the shower, not during, so I cannot attest to how well it works wet.)</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t tried it as a &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver yet, but I like that it is versatile and can be a wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry - just don&#x27;t use it if the razor is wet</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver outside of the shower a few times, but I find myself using lotion afterwards, because my legs would get too dry.</li>
            <li> I can use it to shave my legs, and not feel a SINGLE hair!  </li>
            <li> I own a No-No and have been very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Also, even though it&#x27;s a wet dry trimmer....don&#x27;t leave it in the shower!</li>
            <li> There are trimming blades on each side to take care of longer hairs and the flat razor part in the center to take everything down to the skin.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush for cleaning the blades, but the entire razor head can be detached for a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Using it on my mustache and chin, the hair takes a little longer to come back without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I had thought shaving with an electric razor would be faster than with a regular shaver, but it seems to take a little longer with the electric.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking an hour or so to shave only half of my legs, now it only takes 20 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> I got little red bumps that burned and itched.</li>
            <li> My underarms are a little sore and red after I use it!</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it sits on a little charging dock, so you neither have to be tethered to the wall by a cord nor have to constantly replace batteries.</li>
            <li> If you want something that will last I&#x27;d spring for something a little pricier with a longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> Even after going over the legs several times, I can still feel little nubs.  </li>
            <li> When trying to remove the outer foil (screen), one of the little white side pieces broke off as soon as I touched it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my self hundreds of times not to mention running out of the blades i&#x27;ve used for years in my little personal shaver.</li>
            <li> It was compact enough to take on vacation with the little charger.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well on legs, I have a tendency for ingrown hairs, but this shaver did not cause any problems, and shaving my very delicate underarms was a dream--no scratches, no</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, you get a closer shave using it in the shower with shaving cream than using it dry.</li>
            <li> I used it wet under my arms and it caused the little red bump thing.  </li>
            <li> Works well dry or wet!  </li>
            <li> This electric razor does have one other advantage: It seems to irritate my underarms less than a safety razor does, especially when you want to do a touch up but just shaved them the day before.</li>
            <li> The warranty on this buddy is 2 years long, which is how long it takes the blade to dull with constant use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to any bad reviews on this product because it works perfection.</li>
            <li> B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]], despite its bad reviews... I&#x27;ve had it for about double the time of the Panasonic one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also blind as a bat without my glasses, so while in the shower I am often missing huge portions of hair because I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing (and my glasses fog up in the shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived this morning, nestled cozily with my protein powder and several air-pacs.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic (just like this one) finally gave out after at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is trimmed, then you won&#x27;t have any issues (at least I haven&#x27;t found any so far).</li>
            <li> It works as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> Performs as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic was absolutely no help, either.</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;ll try it wet and see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I used it once a week, washed it according to directions, and placed it back on the charger once it dried.  </li>
            <li> ) Works well wet and dry&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not give as close of a shave as a razor, but I expected that when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer jammed and would no longer deploy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on the wet function with lather, as she has not used it that way yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not use it wet, so I cannot comment on that.  </li>
            <li> only lasted a few months, quit working</li>
            <li> this product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not very discrete, with the razor attached to the wall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying this on the world wide web).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet</li>
            <li> all straight razors made the bumps worse but since using this i the bumps have gone away.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before that I bought locally that lasted quite a few years but couldn&#x27;t find one to replace it.</li>
            <li> It also can be used in the bath or shower as a wet razor with no shaving cream needed.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be just</li>
            <li> not a very close shave for those who want no stubble..</li>
            <li> After some careful research and comparison, I decided to buy the Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used wet...</li>
            <li> I only have it for a few month.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic Shaver was nicer than I expected to be....</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I won&#x27;t use the wet feature, as that seems to shorten the life.  </li>
            <li> Even if an electric razor&#x27;s too rough, I get razor burn.</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs was such a pain and so much trouble but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet</li>
            <li> which I sorta expected.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it as a wet shaver yet.</li>
            <li> she no longer tries to illicitly use my wife&#x27;s and she no longer steals my razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last me a few years</li>
            <li> It’s not what I expected</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> this only worked for a few months before it conked out.</li>
            <li> It does as expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no stubble</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I use it with either a creme shaving lotion or hair conditioner and shave wet.</li>
            <li> Shave carefully and take your time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it wet.  </li>
            <li> When I use it on my legs it removes the hair partially, but I have still have stubble immediately afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This device has a pop up head and won&#x27;t drag on your skin.</li>
            <li> AS expected.  </li>
            <li> and I had to keep taking the cap off to empty out the shavings.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t felt the need to try it wet.</li>
            <li> It sounds like I&#x27;m using my husbands electric razor, as to be expected since it is an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve every had and doesn&#x27;t nick my skin or cause rough spots.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it works too well when wet.</li>
            <li> This product only worked for a few weeks before breaking.</li>
            <li> The cut was not smooth and left stubble.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times  and finally threw it in the trash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth shave, obviously, but if I need to wear a skirt and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs, I use this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet</li>
            <li> the Wet is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> With the exception of a few shaves with a razor I have used this religiously a couple times a week for almost 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can take it into the shower and that it is meant to get wet.  </li>
            <li> This razor stopped working after about a month of wet shaving, could not recommend.</li>
            <li> I never used the shaver in the wet</li>
            <li> although , I;ve never tried to use it wet.</li>
            <li> The manual says I can use this with some shaving cream, and I lot of reviews say that your skin needs to be soaking wet to shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the surface will become slippery if you&#x27;re shaving wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the surface will become slippery if you&#x27;re shaving wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Have only had this producta  few weeks, but it has been working well.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 years or when it dulls, I just buy another....much cheaper than razors.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also never used it wet, maybe that&#x27;s the difference?</li>
            <li> Customer service says absolutely no exception.</li>
            <li> so I expected that.</li>
            <li> I owned this razor a few years ago and it finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> no real complaints about that.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it would take forever to shave wet</li>
            <li> Not a real close shave for your underarms, but it you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expected that at all.</li>
            <li> I do have to shave everyday unlike with regular razors.  </li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no problem in the month</li>
            <li> I have to recharge it less than half as often as previous, more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> Which was my fault not being to careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I was tired of spending so much money on razor blades.</li>
            <li> This product is a convenient alternative to shaving with a razor in the shower, but with a few big caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> working as expected</li>
            <li> so maybe wet</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It will pull on longer hairs so do be careful...</li>
            <li> and I have spent over two hour strugging with it.  </li>
            <li> I am 70 so have a few facial whiskers I choose to remove each day with my razor.</li>
            <li> If you want a close shave like with a wet razor this is not the one for you.  </li>
            <li> I threw it in the junk drawer after 3 tries.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a dead four blade one and it actually shaves closer than the four blade.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not available in any of our local stores.  </li>
            <li> I did purchase a competitors shaver and it was too rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I read and followed the manual carefully.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of spending so much money on disposable shavers.</li>
            <li> Quality of this shaver is as expected.</li>
            <li> This does &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; on legs, but not very well for under arms.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried as a wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> The blade is rough</li>
            <li> For the price, I would definitely buy it again even if it stops working in a few months, and will keep buying it.  </li>
            <li> Shaves closer than expected,, and  smoother.  </li>
            <li> i have to go over that area multiple times until a few hairs are taken away.</li>
            <li> all the wet promises.</li>
            <li> It was only used a handful of times and after a few months, it no longer turns on.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called Keratosis Pillaris, and I can&#x27;t use a wet razor</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a wet shaver it can&#x27;t be charged with batteries.</li>
            <li> I fractured my femur and had to have a partial hip replacement.  </li>
            <li> How can a wet/dry shaver be used if your hands cannot be wet?  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet shaving capabilities,</li>
            <li> I like that this can be used wet or</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different electric razors.</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get the hair close enough and was not smooth.</li>
            <li> sucks!&lt;br /&gt;i can only imagine how much people with real hair hate it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;wet&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Closer shave than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> I have to run over an area two or three times, but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for the bikini area as the hair on the bikini area are thicker than on the legs and armpits and dulls the blade faster.</li>
            <li> never used wet</li>
            <li> I have not tried to use it wet and don&#x27;t know that I will, as it works so well dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it wet, though, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind spending the money on a razor, but could not really find what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Whether that made a difference, I don&#x27;t know, but the results were as expected and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the wet yet.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that you select your partners carefully -- they are a reflection on the Amazon brand.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it wet</li>
            <li> After only a few months of occasional/light use, it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> When it was working, it worked about as well as I expected a product of this type to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried using an electric shaver many years ago, and quickly tired of it, because of how poorly it worked.</li>
            <li> This thing will rip your hair out if you&#x27;re not shaving slow enough, and that&#x27;s with me trying with longer hairs and short hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice for an &#x27;oh crap</li>
            <li> The blades were not very powerful and I had to repeatedly use the shaver over the same spots with little difference each time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had had the same Panasonic product previously and it lasted for-ever!</li>
            <li> I can go right over the red blister and not worry about cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I have dark jet black coarse hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m alsways interested in anything that might make shaving easier and less irritating.</li>
            <li> Certainly not going to repurchase this - since others have - and continue to have it die.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried my legs, but I don&#x27;t think it would work since the hairs aren&#x27;t stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I was right</li>
            <li> But, bottom line: I wanted a reasonable substitute for the ridiculous prices I was paying for the insufferable cartridge razor nonsense!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting like any other electric shaver does, but it isn&#x27;t quite narrow enough for the precision I need.  </li>
            <li> Also much less noisy than my previous shaver which was a different brand.</li>
            <li> Previously pucrhased a Remington WDF-4820 wet dry shaver for a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of using regular steel disposable razors or various Venus razors, I was put on some serious blood thinners for a health issue.</li>
            <li> last long, in less than a month it  stopped working, the little vibrating unit slowed down and faded away every time I turned it on</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit after careful review of all the other AMAZON reviews</li>
            <li> Also this product is not good for your under arms and female private part.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way better to have tiny hairs you can&#x27;t really see, than atrocious, painful, red bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> I finally got past the weirdness and tried it wet.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would hold up to people with fast growing thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and I only itch a little bit, NOTHING like what a razor does to me!</li>
            <li> this makes it faster and less likely to end p with little pieces of tissue all over the legs.</li>
            <li> To avoid getting a bad case of battery memory, (look it up,) run the shaver down, and then charge it for 18 or more hrs.  </li>
            <li> any skin area that can be stretched a little bit.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a little on the long side on my legs and bikini area (was going to wax before I made my decision to get this razor</li>
            <li> A little practice goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is a block that plugs right into the outlet, there is NO CORD!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I have long hair</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times, since I have had it less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times as a dry shaver, so I&#x27;m not sure how it performs when wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually given up on electric razors for about the past year or two which is really annoying for somebody who has SUPER sensitive skin and gets razor</li>
            <li> A small issue is that it does spit some of the hair it has shaved back onto your skin, so it makes you think &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Adjustable heads help get into body curves but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Now i bought this so that i could stop having to buy the disposable razors every other week .</li>
            <li> sharp.</li>
            <li> I suppose that shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise, but considering I just sort of randomly picked the first one I saw on amazon that was</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other shavers before this one and ended up getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> delivered way before due date.</li>
            <li> Regular razors are not recommended for me because small nicks and cuts can be an issue.</li>
            <li> : Went to use this the other week</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit weird at first because I&#x27;m used to cords and corded charging stands.</li>
            <li> It could just be the shape of the other plugs.</li>
            <li> and I received it with no damage due to shipping.</li>
            <li> this one is really, really sharp and shaves close and the shave lasts a day or 2 longer as a result.  </li>
            <li> so I read other reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I have cut myself more with this than with any hand shaver :(</li>
            <li> but it stopped working not even a month after due to rust in the motor preventing vibration which causes the blades to move.</li>
            <li> but I was reluctant due to the safety risk of razors.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering another one soon for my other daughter, can&#x27;t beat the cost and the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;warranty&#x27; is pretty useless, since it appears you have to pay for shipping both ways (and they might decide the damage is an &#x27;act of god&#x27; and not fix it at all, not kidding, it&#x27;s written word for word in the warranty).</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and made my decision to stay with this brand</li>
            <li> I would reccommend a small remmington facial shaver for stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading all the other reviews</li>
            <li> I think its due to the razor, or to the lack of razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> I got this razor due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these (3) in the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have bought razors in the past that did not last, and did not work well, but this razor has met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the shipping will cost, but I am sending it back on principal if nothing</li>
            <li> Moreover, the price is lower than other shopping site like drugstore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because my skin gets extremely irritated when I shave any other way.</li>
            <li> I converted to trimmers years ago due to the irritation brought on by trying to shave.</li>
            <li> It cuts as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to charge it every other day.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately the other product (shaver) which I ordered I don’t like it at all (shaver).&lt;br /&gt;Two of the orders just arrived on September 1, 2013 (shaver and perfume) when I ordered on the first week of July which I understand because I work in a cruise line</li>
            <li> and I tossed the other razors</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> Due to medications I can no longer shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Closer than my other shaver</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with any other one.  </li>
            <li> One note to other though</li>
            <li> But after reading other reviews, I decided to take a risk and go for it.</li>
            <li> When I do use it, I have to make sure to put lotion on or it looks like I rubbed by legs with sandpaper.  :(</li>
            <li> I taught her how to shave her legs last year, but noticed this year, she was getting lazy.</li>
            <li> It had extremely sharp edges, yet skipped over hair on up to three passes.  </li>
            <li> Mfg. recommends against replacing this yourself due to risk of fire/shock.  </li>
            <li> , I thought you guys were a better act than this :(</li>
            <li> It usually lasts for several years before the battery wears out.</li>
            <li> The problem is, I have to use electric shavers due to skin sensitivity, but there are WAY fewer options for women than for men.</li>
            <li> Blades are not as sharp and leave stubble in their wake.</li>
            <li> during that time Id also be in extreme discomfort &amp; have to address ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a blade to shave due to health reasons and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> But other than that.</li>
            <li> other thing to consider is that the charger uses 120V, so if you travel to Europe, you need a converter.</li>
            <li> I tried some other shavers which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It held a charge, after the intial charge, for 1 week using it about every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but I cannot use it on any other area becasue it pulls and cuts my skin.</li>
            <li> to plug anything else in the outlet other than this.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had tried other electric razors and did not get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> no electric shaver will -- but closer than the other two electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never given me a rash, pulled hair, or any of the other horror stories that some of the reviews are saying.  </li>
            <li> Read some other reviews that it dies after six months, but if I can get six months out of a $17 electric razor I will still save money over disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I had to run out the other day, so while showering I took care of all body hair that was bothering me in record time.</li>
            <li> I will usually try to wear pants as much as possible to avoid shaving my legs</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading the other reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say this shaver died after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using this every other day since then</li>
            <li> The other razors do not work unless I shave every day.  </li>
            <li> I have had various razors in the past.</li>
            <li> But it seems pointless to only have a razor for your pits and pubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t compare it to other electric razors, not having used any others.  </li>
            <li> I tried this after buying, but I am too lazy to be constantly cleaning it, so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;close cut&amp;#34; blades are on both sides.of the foil and appear sharp (as any sort of double-pass razor teeth are)</li>
            <li> So you might want to read through some of the other reviews if that is why you are looking at purchasing this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Read all the review in this site and other sites before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day, and have for 2 yr.</li>
            <li> This is one out of (5) shavers from other companies I ordered in the past that is actually still working.</li>
            <li> It cuts closer that other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I was never really interested in trying out</li>
            <li> THEN, if I want an extremely close shave, I go over the skin yet AGAIN</li>
            <li> but no matter how long I charge it, its dead.</li>
            <li> It pulls on my hair at random, so I stopped using it after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I like that the charger is small enough not to block other outlet slots.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with these shavers in the past, I expect that it wll last about 6 months, then die.  </li>
            <li> i feel like the charge lasts longer than other razors.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any difficulties with it staying charged or the foils remaining sharp.</li>
            <li> Bought so many electric shavers and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This little razor holds a charge for a long time and it gets a suprisingly close shave!</li>
            <li> read other reviews that mentioned tugging and ripping hair out, so I was nervous, but I have had NONE of that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I went to the effort to return it that I would actually get money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will hesitate to buy products other than books and music from you going forward.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other posters, I thought it just needed to be charged.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a close shave without irritation and this razor is quieter than other electric razors I have had.  </li>
            <li> Use it as advised and the results will be extremely favorable.</li>
            <li> This is money Well Spent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But other than the shaver charger</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job like any other electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It surprises me it worked extremely well .</li>
            <li> as we speak it has made it&#x27;s way to the landfill with all the other garbadge.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; feature yet, but usually shave with a regular razor when in the shower.  </li>
            <li> They last a few months (less than 24 on average)</li>
            <li> So the 2-year limited warranty for product failure is essentially null and void from the start.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark, coarse hair, very sensitive skin, and some weird skin issue that resulted from shaving with razors to the point my Dr. had told me to give up shaving altogether.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with it though</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to move the switch to the side</li>
            <li> so you gotta be very careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much money on other razors before buying this.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s hard to believe she&#x27;s reached that age already!  </li>
            <li> I only use it dry, but the battery lasts a very long time and the shave is close without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> I expected less than a razor shave, it is electric after all.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick shave but don&#x27;t want to worry about cutting yourself while doing it, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;The item itself has thus far generated no complaints, although I&#x27;m not impressed with the overall build quality and the lack of a cord to plug it in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than expected and takes less time than shaving in the shower used to.</li>
            <li> So you can see a TINY bit of stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> just tiny specks of hair left behind.</li>
            <li> The charger is awkward though; sits on top of a thick plug, can&#x27;t use it in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I thought, instead of buying those pink disposable razors every month or so, why not invest in a razor that will last me at least a year?</li>
            <li> Also, the battery life is shorter than my previous shaver and not as expected.  </li>
            <li> I also have slow growing very thin fine hair on my legs so it cuts through my leg hair like nothing.  </li>
            <li> It shaves hair but not long or thick and it still leaves stubble.</li>
            <li> Until then it did a good job as a shaver, but I&#x27;m very disappointed that it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I waited so long to get the new model.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> They also were less nicked than usual, which definitely helped to lessen some of my skin</li>
            <li> However, the on-off button is very stiff and requires multiple attempts to turn it on.</li>
            <li> No pulling hairs, no bumps, and talk about holding a single charge for ever!!!</li>
            <li> Very dull.. seems old and rusted</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t last a crazy long time but plenty long for the low price.</li>
            <li> Most of the shavers meant for women were very disappointing.</li>
            <li> You can plug it the cordless charger into an outlet, plug the shaver in to charge, and no cords are hanging down and the shaver isn&#x27;t falling over as in some other models.  </li>
            <li> ; for &amp;#34;longer hairs,&amp;#34; by longer hairs, they must mean a few millimeters, because when I ran it over hair 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch long, it constantly got tangled and yanked the hair out from the root.  </li>
            <li> A few things to note, use it in shower with water pouring down or when you are completely dry.</li>
            <li> Not as close as conventional razors</li>
            <li> It pulled a little on the longer hair even after I trimmed it, but that was to be expected from something like this.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest using it for underarms because it can feel a little rough.</li>
            <li> Does a close clean cut even on those annoying facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> would be too hard to get smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly have to do any \\&quot;passes\\&quot; over my skin with this shaver compared with a regular razor, so it saves alot of time.</li>
            <li> Second time was after dropping it on hard ground off a 3 foot counter.</li>
            <li> You know how hard it is to find these things locally when it&#x27;s not Christmas?</li>
            <li> However, after 10 months of moderate use the blades have become incredibly dull.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned an electric shaver since I was in high school....and quit shaving my legs regularly because I kept cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> , the second time was pretty bad and it bled a lot.</li>
            <li> I knew this wasn&#x27;t an expensive and that the electric ones are never as close as a real shave.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer is useless, but I don&#x27;t really care about that feature anyway.</li>
            <li> It is  shaped well for the hand, not heavy and quiet compared to my last Remmington which sounded like very angry hornets and was fairly heavy in the hand.</li>
            <li> Figured even if it was mediocre, I wasn&#x27;t out all that much money.</li>
            <li> When I finally remembered to try and return it, I discovered I was too late.</li>
            <li> They are not perfect, but compared to others I&#x27;ve tried they work very well.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the battery.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and for those lazy days when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving with a blade I use this</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> what I do have isn&#x27;t dark.  </li>
            <li> This product don&#x27;t work well, very noisy unable to use it again.</li>
            <li> (She has dark hair, so her leg hair is dark and noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I don&#x27;t like the wall mount charger</li>
            <li> Seems to be a common issue with such shavers, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the charger.  </li>
            <li> This is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Pop up razor for longer hair is not useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this seems too big, too heavy, and the double-pass &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; blades really spooked me as someone on blood thinners who can assume zero risk of cutting self.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to get it wet at first</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s not worth the suffering.</li>
            <li> THIS IS YOUR AVERAGE SHAVER.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there&#x27;s no guard for a trim vs. a close shave for bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have dark course</li>
            <li> Just an average shaver.  </li>
            <li> Recovering from an injury like this is difficult and very humbling.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is pulls some when shaving underarms</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is recommend to charge for 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> For the average person who has a medicine cabinet over the wall outlet, this just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but after a few times I decided I wanted something that didn&#x27;t hurt and wasn&#x27;t rough.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> aspect of the razor because I&#x27;m just not comfortable with using an electrical appliance on wet skin.</li>
            <li> Then the razor sits on top of the base and charges.  </li>
            <li> and I hate spending more time in the shower than I need to.</li>
            <li> I hate electric razors as they all seem to leave razor burn for whatever reason, but this razor is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It would be better if it sat on a base with a 2prong plug cable to the outlet.</li>
            <li> This will not damage the e-razor, but it will need to be rinsed out a few times; just don&#x27;t get the plug in area wet.</li>
            <li> Often when I get extremely busy and behind with the upkeep, I would just wear pants until I had a chance to do it.  </li>
            <li> also find the power charger annoying, as I do not always have access to a plug that has space for the razor to sit on top in the vertical orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that there is no cord; the charger plugs directly into the base of the shaver and this unit must be upright when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> And sensitive skin, which just makes it worse).</li>
            <li> but I can see, if a couple years down the road it gets a low battery quickly, at least it won&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; a leg to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have used disposable razors in the past, but I feel like I am constantly throwing them out and buying new ones (and they are so expensive nowadays).</li>
            <li> It makes me long for the old fashion safety razors that opened with a screw that lasted forever, except for the very thin blade, which at least would eventually rot back to component metals in the ground.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gave a close shave and even with my naturally dark hair (dark brown to black)</li>
            <li> This way I can go up and down my leg instead of just pulling up like a blade.</li>
            <li> I bought another Remmington before this one and it broke down on me within two months.</li>
            <li> but while it was popped up, somehow the button got pushed down</li>
            <li> I am in California so needed to cut down drastically on shower time</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs from knee down while driving to work.  </li>
            <li> I shave my legs and after I am down using it</li>
            <li> This shaver beats my Remington&#x27;s hands down.  </li>
            <li> but you look down afterwards and there is blood</li>
            <li> So, when it runs down, she sets it in the cradle overnight and moves on.</li>
            <li> I wont cut the hair down to the skin.</li>
            <li> But DOES help with some grooming down below.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer gets taller hair down and then the foil blades mow it under the skin.</li>
            <li> It saves lots of time and keeps the water bill down if you&#x27;re like me and need 30 minutes to shave in the shower every week.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in after it slowed down and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, unless you are just doing a touch-up shave, you must cut your hair down with the clipper setting before you use the foil.</li>
            <li> Remember to go up down and sideways for cleanest look.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver on my armpits or my bathing suit area, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness there, but I&#x27;m going to have to give it a thumbs down for legs.</li>
            <li> , I dropped it face down in a cast iron tub.</li>
            <li> use the buzzer to break down the stubble / hair, then use the &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; (part with holes)</li>
            <li> I pop up the trimmer to do under my arms, then get close there with the trimmer down[ diagonally ].</li>
            <li> ,now I have scars on my leg due to the nicks n itching!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but be careful - it snags (ouch!!)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I tend to get ingrown hairs on my legs when I shave with a razor - not pretty!  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a close shave around my knees and ankles which, any woman knows, is VERY difficult to shave without nicking your skin!  </li>
            <li> After showing her how to use it, she used it on her other leg and her underarms with no problems, no cuts, no discomfort!</li>
            <li> By this I mean that I have to go over the same spot about three times in order to get an even shave.  </li>
            <li> I can wear skirts and shorts without concern when i used other electric razors!  </li>
            <li> Above I mean</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know how long it will hold a charge as I charge it at least every other time I use it.</li>
            <li> I usually shave dry and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my legs before taking my shower and go over them again when I&#x27;m dry.  </li>
            <li> I can not believe it broke down on me in less than six months</li>
            <li> My last razor was so bad that it left bumps on my face and barely would shave.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s not too bulky and heavy to travel</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s not too bulky and heavy to travel</li>
            <li> it can still give a few sharp pulls tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with the other model.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver, there are a few tips and tricks to know (that some of the other reviewers have mentioned).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a breeze to use, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it pinching skin, as some other reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> Either hard to position or have to move razor to open cabinet -- not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> , I decided I must try something less...</li>
            <li> so this does the trick in half the time.</li>
            <li> You will start liking football even LESS if you use a lady&#x27;s shaver:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had noticed years ago that I did get one that was duller than the previous one I was replacing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the area of the razor shaving area is a bit narrow compared to my previous razors.</li>
            <li> It takes less than five minutes to get rid of the stubble.</li>
            <li> I had this razor for LESS than 7 months and as of today it no longer works at all.</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and in 5 minutes or less, you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Wet hurts a lot less but doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the super-expensive models in the past, hoping for better performance and longevity, and have always been disappointed in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it less than 2 months</li>
            <li> I;ve had this shaver for about a half a year now.</li>
            <li> The previous one stopped recharging after four years of use.</li>
            <li> Although it is not like a typical razor non-electric shaver, it is probably the closest thing to it.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 3 different electric razors when I decided to replace it and that was a mistake as well a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Plus typically I am allergic to metals and this one does not give me a problem at all.</li>
            <li> am Sicilian with black hair...</li>
            <li> Previously I had been told I could not shave my legs</li>
            <li> Previously I had a ladies Remington</li>
            <li> I have researched this shaver for less than a hour.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
            <li> Closer shave than her previous shaver.</li>
            <li> My previous Shaver cost me over $100.00.  </li>
            <li> I previously bought Remington shavers costing approx.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the Braun razor &amp; had to return it.</li>
            <li> It just amazes me, unlike the conair that I previously owned, which I had to charge every time I wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li> am a black man</li>
            <li> Had to replace it after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> A lot of my previous shavers have been Panasonic, and each time I try something else</li>
            <li> Am keeping it hidden</li>
            <li> No more nicking my legs and no more red razor bumps!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that the shave is as close as my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said their&#x27;s stopped working, but I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and a half</li>
            <li> My old razor that was a different brand has been cutting me under my arms</li>
            <li> Attempted to use it on 4 different occasions, each time it left scratches on my legs and in my armpits but failed to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> shaver is nothing like my previous one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, but you have to go over the hair several times or go over it really slow.</li>
            <li> It is a typical ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with this model, my hair comes back growing into my skin, so definitely a star off.</li>
            <li> Only real complaint is it doesn&#x27;t keep charge quite as long as I want it to.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say there are less ouchies than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So, from 1 to 10?  Less than 1.</li>
            <li> UPDATED: just stopped working after less than 20 uses</li>
            <li> My previous electric shaver worked well for 20 years but did not shave my underarms.  </li>
            <li> My previous electrical used to pull my skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for the previous model from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver was priced so much less than the others</li>
            <li> When I realized the blades were failing I was only going to replace the blades rather than the entire unit, but I decided against that because 1: the replacement head is nearly as expensive as the shaver itself and 2:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will have to buy lubricating oil for it since it didn&#x27;t come with any, which I find odd.</li>
            <li> And For Less Than $20 ( You Can&#x27;t Beat That )</li>
            <li> I used it about half a dozen times without any issues and then it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well on legs, but using it dry on underarms, it is not very good.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without the mess (one notch below using a razor).  </li>
            <li> so there is no cord to mess with.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this I was desperately trying to find something to shave with for my twin brother&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> I used the razor for the first time yesterday and it seems to work well without cutting the skin on my knees and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried it it pulled my hairs like crazy</li>
            <li> With this I save time and mess.</li>
            <li> that is not good enough for an Amazon review...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what makes it a ladies shaver, except for the pink color.  </li>
            <li> I checked the price on replacement batteries and found it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> and then you have to deal with the mess.  </li>
            <li> These injuries have made it difficult to do lots of things I normally do including shaving my legs with a razor.</li>
            <li> Not true with this one.  </li>
            <li> but was useless for anything other than my arms and the soft hair on my thighs.</li>
            <li> If you have really long thick hair (or if you are a guy shaving his legs), use the pop up trimmer to trim first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just go slow and do not use the foil on long hair or it will hurt.</li>
            <li> also have eczema on my legs that shows up only when something irritates them, and this panasonic can go right over these little annoying bumps and not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li> Also you have to be careful about pressing to hard, what I mean by that is, if you are shaving short hair ( hair on your legs,)</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it&#x27;s almost impossible to get cut with it, and it works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought the battery had just run down, but it is dead as a door nail.</li>
            <li> But when shaving you need to pull your skin tight when shaving.</li>
            <li> It needs to be pressed tightly into the charger to charge.  </li>
            <li> To get and even closer shave pull on the skin a bit to make it tight.</li>
            <li> no cord plugs tightly into the recharger in the outlet.  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin and fast-growing dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no irritation and very very few (if any</li>
            <li> It also cut my shave time down in half!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a super close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t do bad.</li>
            <li> I switched to electric razors a few years ago, but was disappointed with the two I used because they never got my legs as smooth as disposables.  </li>
            <li> Just sorry that I&#x27;ve lived so long without one-(got it for medical reasons)</li>
            <li> Bought this less than a month ago, used it a few times...</li>
            <li> I have slight stubble after a few days, but nothing that would keep me from wearing shorts.</li>
            <li> It gives a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; shave tho not a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I decided to wait a few days after using the product before posting a review, because with previous items I have brought, for the purpose of shaving, have caused irritation a while after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nearly as clean of a shave.  </li>
            <li> Have had it for about five months and don&#x27;t have a single complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a single complaint about it.  </li>
            <li> It also shaves the difficult knee area really well with very few passes.  </li>
            <li> Only thing negative I have to say is that the charger is very heavy and unless it&#x27;s held up by something it will fall out of the socket.</li>
            <li> I did a little reading in Consumer Reports</li>
            <li> It gets the little hairs, too.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s this little baby</li>
            <li> I even use the little pop up thing to do my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am blown away by this little machine.  </li>
            <li> I like the little clipper, too - the Remingtons didn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is a little too streamlined.</li>
            <li> A little bulky on outlet, but works well.</li>
            <li> I figured out that I can still plug it in that way with the razor charging, but I think it probably puts stress on the little prongs that go into the razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for either about or a little over six months.</li>
            <li> I almost cut a little too close at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers&#x27; issues have been, but I have none.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I could mention is that it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t care if I have a little stubble in some spots.</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair it pinches a little, but there&#x27;s no ingrown hairs or redness afterwords.  </li>
            <li> This shaver lasted me a little over the year before it died.</li>
            <li> This should not happen, though even a little moisture with allow for corrosion.]</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t get awful bumps any more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to see your legs in the shower when you can&#x27;t wear glasses, but the ability to use this shaver dry makes that problem non-existent!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other brands.</li>
            <li> I am extremely hairy and usually wax</li>
            <li> I use this shaver in the shower and have little issues.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; as other shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Just wish it gave a little closer shave.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a little bag to store it.</li>
            <li> I was a little comprehensive about the charger, but I have charged it twice</li>
            <li> You will still feel a little stubble, like you might a day or so after shaving.</li>
            <li> The little elevated guard works well too.  </li>
            <li> No matter what, you are going to have a little bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> Leaves little bits of stubble.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this little razor .</li>
            <li> Sometimes feels like it catches a little</li>
            <li> This little thing saved me a lot of money already and works just the way it should.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a shaver I can use without having to whip out the shaving cream and razor whenever I wanted to wear something that may show a little leg.</li>
            <li> and I was a little nervous about it</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not worth the hassle!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little cleaning brush too.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and charged a little.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a close, smooth shave without the bloody mess.  </li>
            <li> This time, I got so disgusted with that brand not even making a dent in my hair that I pitched it, brand new, right into the bathroom trash can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rinsed it a few times and there&#x27;s still little bits of hair in the device.</li>
            <li> Has a little trouble around curves of ankles.  </li>
            <li> I may give up waxing down THERE....!</li>
            <li> and she sat down on the floor &amp; used it like a pro on her legs!</li>
            <li> But I wanted an electric razor to cut my shower time down because it takes forever shaving my legs in the shower!</li>
            <li> And, if you hit it wrong against certain delicate areas, it will gouge a quarter inch chunk of skin off of you.</li>
            <li> cube that plugs into the wall (which means no twisty tangly cord that can get wet on the bathroom counter and no counterspace needed) Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> I found this hard to use with wet skin.</li>
            <li> Careful with the side trimmers though, it can knick you if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> For real its useless it is making sensitivity and cleaning is hard</li>
            <li> but when it comes to shaving my legs, I am the type that doesn&#x27;t care all that much to be on the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about her using a real razor and cutting her legs.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the whole time it feel like you are either cutting yourself or pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll see how it holds up in a few months.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to any woman I know and have recommended to a few.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 11/2013 - Battery totally dead.  </li>
            <li> so no water wasted during use.</li>
            <li> The shave is not completely smooth.</li>
            <li> When I dried off, I could still feel hairs</li>
            <li> and it was dead.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and can no longer stand up in the shower to shave.  </li>
            <li> I have had it a few months now and use it quite a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there, from those at-home waxing kits to the epilators and hair removing creams and hated just about every one of them, with razor shaving at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> had it for a few months, it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> I did not like how it made my legs feel, not smooth at all.  </li>
            <li> but I did have some trouble when shaving under my arms.  </li>
            <li> Died a few months after I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two months now and use it almost everyday .</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have owned a few electric razors.</li>
            <li> but the unit is dead.</li>
            <li> but i still have a few.</li>
            <li> It is as if it is completely dead and done with.</li>
            <li> I had breast cancer surgery a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> came on Amazon to look for another electric razor since this one is almost dead.</li>
            <li> a few tips-</li>
            <li> If I let it sit in on position for a few minutes, it comes on.  </li>
            <li> Plus I dropped it in the shower a few times and cracked the foil.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> after 6 months, the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> Why waste the water and time?  </li>
            <li> I used this a few times now...</li>
            <li> Possibly it was returned to them broken and then sent to us.  </li>
            <li> I need this for just a few places I want to shave about once a week.  </li>
            <li> They are so expensive and my skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, it will broke after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I tried the lotion and spray hair removers for a while, but they&#x27;re messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with any others.</li>
            <li> I waste money on this one</li>
            <li> And it hurt even worse when the hair starts growing back, I would go for months with out shaving</li>
            <li> The weight of the shaving unit is too heavy for a wall plug charge.</li>
            <li> waste of my money, id say...</li>
            <li> complain about it having a narrow head.</li>
            <li> I got a close shave in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still not really smooth.  </li>
            <li> It was dead.  </li>
            <li> I have been waxing the last couple of years, but was really tired of the cost, in spite of the longevity of the service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor everyday on my legs for about 20 years now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this razor for a few months now and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> and I can get a few shaves out of one charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I wanted an electric razor because disposable razors are too harsh to use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it today, and the battery is dead and will not charge.  </li>
            <li> but I still was bristly in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> and it goes over uneven surfaces around my ankles and knees</li>
            <li> I use the shaver after I shower and have thoroughly dried myself off-</li>
            <li> I hated that it had to be done more often.</li>
            <li> -- It sucks wet.</li>
            <li> ...must go over a few times...and then chafes.</li>
            <li> But it actually is a waste of money because it hurts so baldy</li>
            <li> It broke a few weeks after using it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in a hurry!!&amp;#34; Moments, but definitely not smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> My old one needed to be bathed like in an alcohol product that was getting expensive.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it for a few days and when I went to use it the battery was completely dead</li>
            <li> so I recommend charging it a few hours before yo plan to use it.</li>
            <li> It did take care of some of the hair left behind by that product but not all, so i guess its not 100% there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used my husband clippers on my bikini area &amp; end up with a few cuts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Worked for six months now its dead in the water</li>
            <li> Lasts for a few shaves and if you don&#x27;t shave often, does not seem to drain between shaves.</li>
            <li> always felt I left hair behind.</li>
            <li> but my sisiter tried to use it a year or two ago and the battery was so dead it no longer charged anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> It was a waste purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried charging it and it seems to be completely dead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this rechargeable shaver to reduce the waste of disposables.</li>
            <li> Not to waste, I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of using it for the last 10 years</li>
            <li> But after about 3 months it won&#x27;t charge and is dead as a doornail.  </li>
            <li> but I would not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I dropped it in the tub once a few months after that</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who is tired of using regular razors.</li>
            <li> With my epilators, I still have to use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfectly smooth shave</li>
            <li> Every couple uses after that it would play dead and I would have to hit it against a wall or literally throw it on the floor and it would begin working again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> You have to go over things a few times before it will fully do its job.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver to replace a Remington Shaver that I purchased a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> like I have seen in some posted pictures unless you were abusing yourself with it, but it is abrasive feeling, not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled and</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> The shaver does miss a few leg hairs,  but it is a &amp;#34;keeper.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The foil doesn&#x27;t catch 90% of your hair, and the trimmer makes for an incredibly uneven trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very short, thin person, and after [attempting] to shave both my legs, the battery was about done for.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, will never by this brand again.  </li>
            <li> I would not say this is an everyday razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a few months now</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and so I was not comfortable using a razor on her yet</li>
            <li> And I missed the return/replacement option by just a few days.</li>
            <li> My old one broke and was skeptical about buying one online</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again because it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> worked for a few weeks and died.</li>
            <li> There were a few moments of skin nicking (no bleeding occurred and a mark could not be seen)</li>
            <li> BUT THE BATTERY WENT DEAD,</li>
            <li> Completely dead.</li>
            <li> We used it once a week and after one month it is completely dead.</li>
            <li> Just charge it for a few hours before using.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few times a month for almost a year</li>
            <li> Conveniently my trimmer has been dead so this Panasonic is what replaced it.</li>
            <li> Worse, I have actual CHUNKS of skin missing now-</li>
            <li> (Let me mention that you need to pull the skin taunt to keep from pinching soft, thin, or delicate skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in several months because I hate the whole production of using a manual razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not huge.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t let me down yet, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve required it to go past three or four</li>
            <li> If you are wet shaving (I like using a bit of hair conditioner for an inexpensive shave base), he glides along and gets even the little invisible hairs that normally get missed with a disposable, wet cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently I broke my right femur and it was very difficult to move the leg, but this little shaver floated into each difficult to reach area like a charm.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably, this shaver works worse than the old, dull one.  </li>
            <li> I still need to shave at least every other day.</li>
            <li> Battery life is passable, but needs a charge at least every other day.</li>
            <li> because now I find I am having to shave at least every other day.</li>
            <li> It even cuts hairs that were too thick for other razors/trimmers/etc.</li>
            <li> I think this is why some people plain that the shave isn&#x27;t as close.  </li>
            <li> Older now and can&#x27;t seem to shave without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I am a very optimistic person&amp;#62; This piece is 100% WORTHLESS and takes three times as long to shave with results leaving nothing desirable.</li>
            <li> You do have to let it grow a little longer than usual to shave well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> during the winter we ladies get a little lazy with leg de-forresting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use blades because of the high risk of cutting myself (and then getting blood all over the place).</li>
            <li> I had to buy one for my son, who is fairly new to shaving, he kept borrowing mine because he didn&#x27;t like shaving with a razor and the men&#x27;s shaver I bought for him (which was not cheap at all) kept cutting him.</li>
            <li> have since returned the $40 Remington, and willthink twice before overlooking less expensive shavers next time.  </li>
            <li> I have a back problem and trying to shave my legs with a regular razor has become just about impossible.</li>
            <li> I was going to get this as a gift for my sister as a first shaver, but I would feel bad if I gave it to her</li>
            <li> and I suspect it may have been a returned product, but the unpleasant literature in the box about returns really turned me off, as did the restocking fee.  </li>
            <li> This is really not good at all if you have any hair that is even remotely lengthy..</li>
            <li> i needed a razor that was sensitive enough to shave without causing the horrible red bumps i got after giving birth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of its max charge since I tend to recharge it after a few uses, but I&#x27;ve never had the annoyance of having the charge run out mid-shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually use it a few times before I need to charge it again.</li>
            <li> I want to shave a few times a week if that just to keep it small.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every day or at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the in-grown hairs and razor burn from safety razors, tired of the time and money investment of waxing, and too sensitive for the chemical heavy hair removers.</li>
            <li> I must add that I have thick and dark hair on my legs and armpits</li>
            <li> the plastic edges do not scrap your leg when pressing down like some people complained about with the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve .</li>
            <li> The trimmer is even worse - it pulls hard enough around areas that would be veiled should I be in a bathing suit that I refuse to use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> You get the right angle, and you will never be disappointed.</li>
            <li> While this was disappointing to me, even more disappointing was the response I got from Panasonic: they would not help me, fix the product, or replace it.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving with a disposable razor in the shower and luckily I found this product.</li>
            <li> It costs too much to crap out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I now call it my little miracle worker!</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this little shaver!  </li>
            <li> This little razor rocks!  </li>
            <li> I like how little space the charger takes!</li>
            <li> She has crazy long thick blonde hair on her legs..</li>
            <li> The shaver I received was dirty and covered in little black hairs... gross!</li>
            <li> but it started acting weird and would slow down and speed up as I shaved and then died on me.</li>
            <li> and I mean like half an inch or so.</li>
            <li> The pop up blade is a little hard to use on the bikini area but</li>
            <li> Panasonic razor sits firmly on the charger, which I like, as I have knocked other brands out of their charging bases and ended up with broken pieces.</li>
            <li> Pulls a little and you have to go really slow</li>
            <li> after a few uses, it&#x27;s dull and takes a LOT of effort to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> So I thought I would try and electric razor since I am very limited on my mobility as my broken ankle is nonweight bearing.</li>
            <li> It was used very little in the past maybe 6 mos</li>
            <li> I would itch so bad that my whole body would be shaking as I tried to resist scratching until I bled.</li>
            <li> Comes with a charger and a small bag that fits all gear and the razor, too.</li>
            <li> I really only bought this because a few times over the last couple weeks I&#x27;ve thought to myself \\&quot;Crap, I didn&#x27;t shave my legs this morning</li>
            <li> I am not sure what has caused this decline in performance, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t miss my usual razor.</li>
            <li> There is a small plug, maybe 2in x 2in, that you plug in and then there is a small piece that sticks up that the razor sits on to charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually get two shaves before I need to recharge it.</li>
            <li> As a man, I have had electric shavers for my face in the past, so I knew that an electric shaver is no replacement for a blade.  </li>
            <li> I usually used electric razors to shave my legs between tub and water shavings.</li>
            <li> You may have to go over a few spots but go slow while using</li>
            <li> I used the pop up bikini attachment and it got to the trouble areas without nics or cuts!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a lazy person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times on my random patches of skin, but my boyfriend seems to have claimed it for regular use.  </li>
            <li> No more cuts and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Not sure I wanted to use an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like small charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a small inconvenience, though, and doesn&#x27;t affect my rating.</li>
            <li> And since it looks like this isthe &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; one you can get, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy another one or not.</li>
            <li> I take an anticoagulant and I was continually plagued with small nicks turning into never-clotting bleeds.  </li>
            <li> I have bought them in the past and</li>
            <li> Gets 5 stars for this purpose - no more unsightly bumps (</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not sure if any battery operated shaver will have the result that i wanted.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a small battery operated shaver, but boy does it get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It shaves not quite as close as an ordinary blade on my face but keeps the skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the blade becomes useless after 8 months of use and have to replace it again.</li>
            <li> Have had this model in the past and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> this really is pointless</li>
            <li> No more nicks from shaving.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I had been bed bound for 4 months and was unable to use my regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I get tired of wet shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that girl did to cut up her legs</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small traveling bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more missed hairs, scrapes, scratches.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I delayed returning it, because I was hopeful it would revive itself and come back to life</li>
            <li> I sit on the edge of the tub and use this, some slick (greasier) soap, and the spicket to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> and i dont have to worry about him doing something dumb with a sharp razor</li>
            <li> it is the oddest thing :/</li>
            <li> I have had electric razors in the past that shaved a lot closer than this one.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the charger is small and there is no chord to get in the way.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave once or twice a week in about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Like the use of electric, but they usually won&#x27;t butter.  </li>
            <li> and I usually do it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> so no more razor cuts.  </li>
            <li> No cuts or razor burn like others she has had in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for just a few months and it just died!</li>
            <li> Since it is past the 30 days I can&#x27;t get a refund or exchange it.</li>
            <li> It was wasted my money !</li>
            <li> but there were always difficult patches which would turn sore and red because I couldn&#x27;t hold the skin taut.</li>
            <li> However, it took me, the amateur shaving person, 10 to 12 minutes to shave both legs, both arms and underarms.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my small hands and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li> If anything goes wrong or I face any issues, I will come back and update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits well in my small hands and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li> If anything goes wrong or I face any issues, I will come back and update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead!  </li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to use on my underarms and my skin became red, rashy and sore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, out of the 8 items I purchased on Amazon</li>
            <li> No more nicks and scrapes.  </li>
            <li> I had so many cuts from awful disposable razors.</li>
            <li> No more cuts every time I shave.  </li>
            <li> Amazon delivered me so many things but in between all of them this is the worst.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I started using this, no more hives, no nicks.</li>
            <li> No more bumps</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make it past two drops in the shower.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with a tweezer plucking ingrown hairs out, and then waiting for those spots to heal up, and then shaving and having the all-clear for legs and skirts for about a week before the ingrown hairs show up again...</li>
            <li> Being lazy, I don&#x27;t shave every day and the hair grows out.  </li>
            <li> With a few passes, I get the quickest shave with the least pain.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the women&#x27;s models are cheaper/less hardy.</li>
            <li> No more razors, no more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I am not smooth for weeks!  </li>
            <li> Not many outlets in my home where this works.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why i didn&#x27;t think about getting one of these before, because i don&#x27;t like using razors, never did.  </li>
            <li> Why did I not have one of these for the past 30 years?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get razor bumps or burn, but this shaver pulled my hair and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> razors in the past and was never satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clumsy a few times and have dropped it, but have not had any problems with performance after that happened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy shaver.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually too rushed for time to spend all that time in the shower.</li>
            <li> Fits spaces that are small.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I may end up buying this same model.  </li>
            <li> I have had to use men&#x27;s shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> The small wall charger is also convenient.</li>
            <li> the charging unit is extremely small.</li>
            <li> Comes with instructions and a small fabric drawstring pouch.</li>
            <li> I have a small shower and it&#x27;s a pain to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is all coming from the lazy girl who despises shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m too lazy to shave with blades and shaving cream all the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I use it for my underarms, my legs, and my bikini area when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just feeling lazy.</li>
            <li> No more Panasonic products for me.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t shave with electric razors because they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was not sure which shaver to buy.  </li>
            <li> Also, I used to have the skin darkened after shaving in the bikini area and armpits, but no more.</li>
            <li> But by then, I&#x27;d been so spoiled by having my legs waxed and never having to tend to hair removal myself, that I got too lazy to use a razor once I couldn&#x27;t afford the waxing.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, cuts, scratches.</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to looking at those expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> The price point is unbelievable and I am grateful I found</li>
            <li> Like if you&#x27;re not sure which shave thing to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too small</li>
            <li> I replaced it but that one didn&#x27;t shave at all; not sure</li>
            <li> helpful for a disabled senior!</li>
            <li> I still feel like there are small portions of hair where you get the scratchy.</li>
            <li> No more throwaway razors, no more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> The battery in the razor I had for the past 10 years just died &amp; I had to buy another razor &#x27;cause the battery isn&#x27;t suggested for replacement .</li>
            <li> I like the small charger that holds the product against the wall where you plug it</li>
            <li> A waste of money I&#x27;ll stick to razors at least it removes the hair.</li>
            <li> I usually blow off the hairs stuck between the razors with an air can duster after use.</li>
            <li> Now, since using it, I&#x27;m not sure what all the raves were about.</li>
            <li> The foil is for cutting very short hair down to skin level, but it is going to catch and pull any hair that is longer.</li>
            <li> After a few bad results with this one, I decided to buy a new Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the wet mode but the dry mode is disappointing.</li>
            <li> For some reason there are very few women&#x27;s electric razors to be had in my town.</li>
            <li> having it sideways makes me think it will fall off the charger, it&#x27;s very firm on the charger</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful because if you angle it the wrong way you may pinch your skin and bleed a little.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and I have not experienced any pinching or pulling when shaving.</li>
            <li> I tried both the regular and trimmer setting, and both times, the thing yanked out individual hairs mercilessly while leaving other random areas untouched.</li>
            <li> We are so tired of the new machines which are a piece of crap and never work or never last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an Amazon, but for whatever reason, trying to get my legs shaved in our rented house&#x27;s shower is torturous, at best, and  downright bloody, at worst.</li>
            <li> but it is not so bad for everyday or frequent shaver.</li>
            <li> Not very good for shaving your legs</li>
            <li> I always shaved in the shower but it was small and hard to do.  </li>
            <li> I have COPD and sit on a bench in the shower to shave my legs, which is not easy!  </li>
            <li> This renders it pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> so I always hate using these things for the first time thinking it will burn me or something...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t bought it for a month long trip</li>
            <li> so I was not able to return it when I got home since it was too late.</li>
            <li> My beard hairs are particularly thick and tend to get passed over by shaver heads with small foil holes.</li>
            <li> However I hate the pain of returning stuff, and it was pretty cheep</li>
            <li> A company that does not stand behind their product is not worth doing business with.</li>
            <li> Too bad the replacement heads cost as much as a new razor...</li>
            <li> This is not great to look at, much less feel.</li>
            <li> It is pretty painful, much worse then a shaving nick.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair on my legs so shaving would often be irritating, not to mention the annoyance of razor burn and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Little disappointed in how much razor stubble it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something to make shaving less tedious and even a little easier.</li>
            <li> It hurts so bad and it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> you have to keep the skin very tight or it snags your skin (OUCH!)</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to every girl out there to get this product it gets hard using a Razor blade and getting those razor bumps ...</li>
            <li> I have RA and it makes it hard to stand in shower and shave.</li>
            <li> would if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> the front razor pops up for a closer shave for those hard areas like ur knees.</li>
            <li> So I adjusted how hard I push this one while shaving, and I still get a close shave, but no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t have to press hard at all, just let it glide over your skin.</li>
            <li> However I may need to replace the blade, because it&#x27;s somewhat dull.</li>
            <li> You also do not have to press the head to your leg hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> The safety cap/cover is hard to remove and replace, but I don&#x27;t need it anyways.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting close for some areas like my underarms, but for legs, its a miracle.</li>
            <li> wife says it hurts when she uses it.&lt;br /&gt;extremely hard to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not feel I need to push it hard into my skin to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hardly have to charge it.  </li>
            <li> It shares a wall socket with our spinbrush, so it&#x27;s hardly ever plugged in, however it STILL holds a charge</li>
            <li> the blades were so dull I couldn&#x27;t use it without it pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> After a month, it would have a hard time turning on.</li>
            <li> No going over and over and pressing hard.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with razor burns with razor blades, not a problem with this electric razor.</li>
            <li> (it is hard to get out of the charger</li>
            <li> : Razor is dull.</li>
            <li> So dull it feels like the hairs are being pulled out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull on my longer hair, and even has a popup trimmer for hard to shave areas.</li>
            <li> and I have had a hard time finding a way to shave my underarms without irritation.  </li>
            <li> The blades become so dull that you feel like nothing is happening after about 10 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have been shaving with razors then they say it&#x27;s hard to go electric</li>
            <li> However, after a little over a month it has randomly broken.</li>
            <li> You do have to go slow or it will pull the hair which I had to learn the hard way.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the old one thinking maybe it was just a bad apple in the group or something.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a cord to contend with than that stupid square</li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> and I was wondering what the heck I&#x27;ve been doing cutting myself up with my dollar shave club subscription razors the last couple of years when I could just be using something like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razor since the late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so never using those regular razors again where I always end up cutting myself</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Mom who is in her late 70&#x27;s as a gift</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to return it, unfortunately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> remember co-opting my late grandfather&#x27;s electric razor</li>
            <li> It starts itching in October and continues through March at least.  </li>
            <li> Bending over sucks, getting in and out of the tub sucks.</li>
            <li> with the closest shave and least irritation.  </li>
            <li> It will not work when there is the least bit of moisture.  </li>
            <li> Bought this despite the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It was least expensive, so I expected I would have to return it, But no&lt;</li>
            <li> it is not kind of cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES2207P is at least comparable to my Remington...</li>
            <li> Shaving with this is at least a 15-minute procedure</li>
            <li> I have never liked electric shavers, used the throw away ones.</li>
            <li> Then one day in late May, after charging it overnight, I turned it on and nothing.  </li>
            <li> and I can use it without charging for at least 4 times.</li>
            <li> I have not charged this shaver for at least 2 months plus.</li>
            <li> lasts at least 10 minutes, which is the longest I have used it at one</li>
            <li> and I always have at LEAST 5 nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take my chances since at least it gives me results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked electric shavers because I feel like they don&#x27;t get a close shave</li>
            <li> they charge setup for this razor really really really sucks</li>
            <li> Had to toss it as it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant given the negative reviews, but decided to get it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it gives a close enough shave without almost cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> It had a negative run in with my armpit at one point, so I keep it below the belt and all is well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point, it doesn&#x27;t even turn on when I click it, unless I slide it on at least 10-12 times.</li>
            <li> I used it at least four times a week.  </li>
            <li> Got this bad boy for myself a few months back</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t use a wet shaver and have tried products like no-no [expensive and uneffective], please do yourself a favor and try this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Its just Common Sense</li>
            <li> It is common sense.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this shaver I use to have to shave my chin area at least once a week to prevent having a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> the razor attachment sucks</li>
            <li> First,I read the negative reviews, then read the helpful reviews.</li>
            <li> They are the only ones I can use without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and it shaves my medium thick beard closely with no irritation.</li>
            <li> and I tend to shave fairly slowly out of fear of slicing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair on my legs and it shaves them like there is nothing there.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, you might have problems shaving with it.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs, and this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick for the head to grab the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-Plain</li>
            <li> It does pull a bit, but I just go really slowly to avoid the pull.</li>
            <li> It does the job if you go really slowly over your legs.</li>
            <li> Also the charging base plugs directly into an outlet and its difficult to get the razor to sit properly on it.  </li>
            <li> The charge over the years has slowly been decaying.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few months and then threw it in the garbage because I hated it so much.  </li>
            <li> the night I was forced to purchase one.</li>
            <li> the hair was rather thick on her legs, but this shaver had no problems tackling the hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this, don&#x27;t crap out like others I have had and don&#x27;t yank your skin.</li>
            <li> Just go slow</li>
            <li> how slowly I go, how charged the shaver is, or from what angle I approach my legs.</li>
            <li> Honestly...I ordered this and was ready to hate it.</li>
            <li> Just keep it charged and move the razor slowly.</li>
            <li> I HATE to shave my legs-takes up too much time</li>
            <li> I  DO NOT recommend this, and it is a total waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> That said, this is like any other razor, you have to do it every other day, but since you can skip the shaving cream and water and do it while you watch tv (which is what I do and since the razor is covered is almost impossible to get a nick or a slice cut).</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s not an expensive razor, but I&#x27;d at least expected a year!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after 2 other brands were a miserable failure, she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Plus no more razor burn!</li>
            <li> once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a ridiculously lazy shaver!</li>
            <li> No more disposables or batteries for me!</li>
            <li> So, I called the 1-800 number on the shaver for customer support, and was sent in an endless loop of useless automated support messages.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burn!</li>
            <li> There is no difference between this product and usual raiser!</li>
            <li> I mean for the money.....</li>
            <li> No more razors for me!</li>
            <li> and I mean years probably since the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I mean you can</li>
            <li> one of the other reviewers stated that the item chopped up her pubic skin into pieces &amp; she returned the item, I unfortunately got something that someone else used like that, contaminated by who knows what!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more band-aids!</li>
            <li> Too bad the product doesn&#x27;t last past warranty.</li>
            <li> it did a shoddy job of shaving and not a good job of trimming either.</li>
            <li> The drawbacks are very small compared to the quality you get from it.</li>
            <li> but when I put it into action I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and don&#x27;t know how to get this fixed.</li>
            <li> I am very lazy and do not like to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> It just did not shave my legs as close as I expected...that it would very disappointed back to the regular shaver augh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad to say that these just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> No big deal, but a little annoying</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m going through a series of spine surgeries and regular shaving will be impossible for me to do.  </li>
            <li> this takes some serious abuse.</li>
            <li> I am also a ridiculously furry lady (yeah,</li>
            <li> Using even the nicest ladies&#x27; razors on my upper legs or bikini area gives me nightmare red bumps, itching, and awful ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> (sorry if that sounded odd</li>
            <li> Ridiculous to have to mail away for service to remedy the problem.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the product to any woman who is tired of cutting herself with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks...</li>
            <li> Ridiculous product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was less expensive than just the replacement blades for my Remington.</li>
            <li> Hair gets caught in the shaver and is impossible to rinse without taking apart the entire thing.</li>
            <li> I found this very frustrating - not really because of the money I lost, but because of the poor business practices exhibited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver, if you are tired of buying expensive shaver heads!!</li>
            <li> After previous failed attempts to use rechargeable razors, I decided I&#x27;d have to try a rechargeable again because my allergies (Aloe Vera and Nickel) have made it too painful to shave with any brand of regular razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this razor!  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after seeing the picture where the ladies legs are all scratched up after shaving using this product</li>
            <li> not sure if i&#x27;m using it wrong, but it has a hard time shaving bikini area and legs.</li>
            <li> It will hurt bad the next day because you will tons of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I also get really bad itchy bumps on my shins and calfs when I shave with a regular razor</li>
            <li> I get razor burn really bad especially on my upper legs and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I was using another trimmer that constantly cut me and gave me bad burns.  </li>
            <li> I find this one to be somewhat awkward to hold which makes just barely glidinig over your skin difficult.</li>
            <li> I have a bad problem with facial hair..decided to try electrical razor.</li>
            <li> I charged this bad boy for the initial 12 hours and after a month I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it.</li>
            <li> My personal experience is that it pulls hair so badly that I&#x27;d prefer to not use it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for wife she wishes she had her remington back so bad she said.</li>
            <li> &quot; Needless to say I was staggered by the asking price, I think that this an obscene cost to rid you of a few hairs, hi tech are not.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the power behind it to do the shaving and the battery loses its charge within the hour after having it on the charger for 12+ hours.</li>
            <li> Can get a big painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different shaving creams, nice razors, not shaving against the grain, nair (which by the way was one of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve ever made it burnt me terribly</li>
            <li> Not good for the environment.</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as Remington wet/dry shavers I have</li>
            <li> I have always hated electric razors, but this one really works well</li>
            <li> it still has the same effect, its bordeline painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s easier and faster than using a hand razor, but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good razor for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> and it is both incredibly painful and ineffective at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never used a wet/dry electric razor; It&#x27;s not a good idea to try to shave growth that is longer.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve become quite frustrated with the very short charge life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, its not good quality</li>
            <li> I hated this thing so much I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I am not a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> To charge, plug the charger directly into the socket and place base of razor onto the charger.</li>
            <li> The base plugs directly in the outlet saving room.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to cut time shaving on the go &amp; was appalled that i spent so much time in the shower with results as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all :(</li>
            <li> The trimmers on either side of the foil grab my skin and cuts me - not pleasant at all.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the charging base has no cord so you must charge it on the plug, as I store mine out of the bath</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not very powerful on tough hairs and a bloody mess as a result.</li>
            <li> I imagine so since my major complaint was that it was painful!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the previous one was a bit faulty or what.. the battery went bad after around 15 months of use.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible nickle allergy and have had a hard time shaving for the past few years due to irritation.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and stays charged for a long time, I have no clue why some people are giving a bad review.</li>
            <li> (honestly I&#x27;ve never tried it in my pits...)!  </li>
            <li> I bought an extra cutter assembly too :-(</li>
            <li> the only problem is i can&#x27;t find any replacement blades. :(</li>
            <li> and I was running late!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty awful razor.</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to maneuver in small hands.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would at least serve as a leg razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> and it was uncomfortable to use there due to the angle as I was unable to see where I was going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very hard to nick your skin with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I had an electric razor and tried very hard to find another one</li>
            <li> You just have to keep in mind that all you have to do to keep the shaver tightly on the base is to put the shaver on the base first, and then you plug it into the wall.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ve very thick hair on legs almost curled up hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick leg hair</li>
            <li> No more cuts on my legs!!</li>
            <li> no more razor blades!!  </li>
            <li> Charger is a little awkward for horizontal outlets.</li>
            <li> The shaver and replacement cutting heads purchased at the same time were cheaper than replacement cutting heads for the Remington.  </li>
            <li> but it is time consuming, painful and expensive and regular shaving when you are not the skinniest chick is a nightmare and can take FOREVER!  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> Finally, tired of dealing with this problem every couple of days, I switched over to this rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> but it does a poor job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> But I got tired of nicking myself</li>
            <li> You plug the base unit into an outlet, but it is so big that you cannot plug anything else in.  </li>
            <li> After growing tired of shaving in the shower and somehow running out of razors, I researched electric ones and after reading the reviews, bought this after it went on sale.  </li>
            <li> and they both have broken (although she said hers did shave her legs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thin hairs in my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without scratching and irritating the skin&lt;</li>
            <li> The blade part was detached and the plastic piece holding the blade was broken off.  </li>
            <li> Extremely frustrating experience.  </li>
            <li> , I was tired of razor burn, which seems to get worse with age.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand that was worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at approximately 8 shaves (5 mins each) with no drop in power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only annoying thing has to do with the nature of the foil shaver itself...</li>
            <li> But their online warranty website appears to be inoperable - you can&#x27;t do anything without an account, but account creation appears to be irrevocably broken.  </li>
            <li> and it has decreased the amount of razor rash I get under my arms.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind spending about $20 and using it for approximately a year to 1.5 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it seems like ladies electric shavers have been getting worse and worse as the years go by.  </li>
            <li> However, the quality is poor and I do not recommend this model.</li>
            <li> After seeing the poor design, however, I decided not to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> This is not a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of using razor blades to do my legs.  </li>
            <li> but I got tired of the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I am now fully against the Panasonic company for the absolutely poor customer service and product guarantee.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the least expensive razor I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> This one is worse.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and tired of using razors, so I looked around for a shaver.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using a blade.</li>
            <li> Now its just collecting dust, not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works poorly both in the shower and out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I also doy husband beard, mustache and thin his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it was fully and it not turn iand is completely broken.</li>
            <li> I guess the razors were irritating my skin</li>
            <li> THAT WAS TIRED OF USING MY VENUS SHAVER</li>
            <li> Some I have not read or no longer have got a worse review.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculously poor battery life, and it requires 12 hours to recharge....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ahead of the game if it lasts 6 months, but it shows no signs of slowing.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving, so finally decided to buy an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I left the charge base behind at a hotel before -</li>
            <li> I have tried other electronic shavers and the metal that covers the blades have broken and cut me badly.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> and it is lasting a mere 2 MINUTES before dying :(</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who had nicked herself badly using conventional razors (even 4-blade razors).</li>
            <li> After about two months of using it a few times a week it just started being very difficult to turn on.</li>
            <li> Typical razors cause ingrown hairs or painful skin.</li>
            <li> I would almost immediately develope wealts &amp; the next day have a horrible rash that would take a week to go away at the least.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my underarms and bikini area and have looking for a way to shave without getting terrible razor burn for years now.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product!</li>
            <li> Pulls my hair a little but noting bad</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d itch like crazy, but this little shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to have that problem!!</li>
            <li> I walked around like a gorilla for a few days afterwards because the skin under my arms hurt so bad</li>
            <li> but alas, I got lousy results.</li>
            <li> I hated spending extra time in the shower.</li>
            <li> Using a regular razor gives me very bad razor burn.  </li>
            <li> that are so expensive and it is a lot less painful than the razors.</li>
            <li> It got every little hair and the ingrowns!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for my previous Panasonic and I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed but the shave is not as close as a razor, but taking blood thinner means I need to avoid razors, so this will do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About three months ago, I started getting very sad, since my little razor just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore</li>
            <li> (Unless like my house, some idiot put all of the outlets in upside down, which renders this useless.)  </li>
            <li> She was going through chemotherapy and being very weak</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would leave a small stubble, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> plugging it in to charge is a little annoying because pressing the shaver in the charger makes the charger loosen a bit from the outlet.</li>
            <li> PAINFUL and definitely not worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> I guess ill just stick with the disposable razors</li>
            <li> The shaver failed to perform to the level of the Remington Wet/Dry I have had for almost 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I find shaving in the shower uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?  </li>
            <li> Keeping her balance on one leg has become too difficult at her age.</li>
            <li> It missed random hairs too.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razors are getting so expensive these days.  </li>
            <li> Ill stick to a razor</li>
            <li> sorry for all the inconvenience and all the troubles that I made cause.</li>
            <li> I just got time to write sorry because I couldn’t reply before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was unable to find that model anywhere to repurchase.)  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, looks is where the similarity ends.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with a shaver that is useless.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but a pain to have to replace so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more cutting yourself from a hand held razor!  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Conair wet/dry shaver terrible choice, it was noisy and didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I had always sufferedvfrom horrible razor burn especially around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I cannot count on it working when I want</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The Remington was absolutely useless (made me itch and shaving took for ever), so I bought this Panasonic again.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not help the problem.  </li>
            <li> A bit difficult getting it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> My wife was skeptical when I bought this for her, but after using it a couple times she loves it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try because the razor blade cartridges are just so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Buying disposable razors or even razors with disposable blades gets tiresome and expensive.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too expensive, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> If mine ever breaks (and that will be a sad day indeed)</li>
            <li> I researched the Panasonic website, users manual, and can&#x27;t see that we&#x27;re using it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have a spinal injury and shaving is terribly difficult.</li>
            <li> However, after using it 2 or 3 times a week for about 3 months, it randomly stopped turning on.</li>
            <li> It stopped holding a charge almost immediately and within four months was unable to be recharged at all.</li>
            <li> Even when fully charged, it was difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Three blades that does nothing but glides over the skin, useless for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not use it till it was time to travel and by then the receipt was no where to be found.  </li>
            <li> Still plan on sending it back and writing them a nasty letter.</li>
            <li> but its still useless</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult for me to reach everywhere on my leg to shave.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have RA, and shaving with a razor can be cumbersome and difficult, after charging the required overnight</li>
            <li> I was hoping there would be a setting option so you could choose the length, but unfortunately it&#x27;s all or nothing with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> and they can pull at the hair and skin making it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in my case this shaver is not what I need it to be.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called lymphedema and found it difficult to shave my legs without getting cut.</li>
            <li> I was sort of skeptical ordering this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this by accident, I was looking for an epilator, I guess I clicked the wrong image.  </li>
            <li> I tried one, once, an itty bitty thing on my legs and all it did was pull hair, scrape my skin and leave an awful red road-like rash.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> They are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been highly disappointed in the past by both men and women&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve splurged on expensive electric razors meant for men.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as any expensive model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> that just seems weird to me.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I am still hoping that I am doing something wrong and that with time I will work out how to use this shaver without it hurting as it pulls out hairs and snags on them.  </li>
            <li> but for now I&#x27;m definitely not impressed!</li>
            <li> Not impressed that I have to purchase something else already.</li>
            <li> The charger is weird.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this shaver , for the price, expect years of service</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 2 that I bought broke in under a year.</li>
            <li> and some people write angry about the manufacturer because they can&#x27;t find the power button.</li>
            <li> even when I use shaving creams, expensive razors, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a star because it doesnt work well for underarms...</li>
            <li> So no shave November started Oct 1st for me, and somehow turned into WTF</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> You Won&#x27;t Go Wrong With This Purchase.</li>
            <li> so I hate shaving because I have to wait so long to get out of the painful bump stage.</li>
            <li> One of my hips is very inflexible</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because to get the shaver to cut, you have to press so hard, it scratches my skin.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for weeks, and the charge base is so small it takes up no room at all to store.  </li>
            <li> No more bloody cuts from razors.</li>
            <li> - at least I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on it.. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> but the base had a small clip piece that broke and now it does not stay on the charger.</li>
            <li> And the wet shave was terrible.</li>
            <li> I hate being negative</li>
            <li> Not good:-(.  </li>
            <li> I have a very badly scarred ankle from and auto accident and also some small patches of psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cut the hair about half way leaving horrible stubble and the hair it did remove did so by PULLING it</li>
            <li> This little razor can get the worst of the hair off, but if you have fast-growing hair (like me), you&#x27;ll be stubbly again by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I would often end up with bloody wounds all over my very delicate</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll get nicks from goosebumps being raised when I&#x27;m chilly.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s cutting the hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She was afraid of cutting herself with a razor, so I did some research and bought this for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he was afraid I would cut myself using disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not longer afraid to knick myself</li>
            <li> My daughter is crazy over her shaver, It was a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Like the hypoallergenic cutting head.</li>
            <li> I was hospitalized and put on blood thinners, so using a razor to shave my legs was dangerous.</li>
            <li> After 3 disappointing shavers (2 Remingtons and Philips), I took another chance and change of a shaver with this Panasonic, so I ordered it.</li>
            <li> but then you risk cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> sometimes instead of cutting, the hair gets stuck and it pulls the hair</li>
            <li> Virgin Cold Pressed, Grade A, Odorless.</li>
            <li> This was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Stopped cutting after six months or so.</li>
            <li> I like that you can adjust the cutting length so that if you have longer leg hair to cut you can.  </li>
            <li> I researched like crazy and landed on this ES2207P...</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> The recharge system is awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> (since they were/are afraid of cutting themselves).  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter since she kept cutting herself while trying to shave her legs.</li>
            <li> They both started shaving and kept cutting their legs.</li>
            <li> Dirty item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tweens when they started getting to where they wanted to shave -as opposed to letting them use razors alone and cutting themselves.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my skin is pinched and instead of cutting my hair it pulls it.</li>
            <li> and my legs don&#x27;t itch like mad after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> No more expensive VENUS razors!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> Sad. :(</li>
            <li> However, I have owned at least 5 of these, and they die without fail every two years!!!  </li>
            <li> Something was very, very wrong with mine.</li>
            <li> and I was sick of using a razor and cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> so shaving standing is impossible,  and shaving in the tub..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even wince when rotating to get to awkward nooks and crannies like with a dangerous razor!</li>
            <li> Thought it may have just had a bad seal</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> it was that bad.</li>
            <li> I did some reading and it appears this model is notorious for bad switches.  </li>
            <li> Too bad Panasonic</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction to disposable razors and have used electric since.  </li>
            <li> OMG, this thing hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> but still it hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> The shaver wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I break out realllly bad.</li>
            <li> Pulls hairs so bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after a bad case of razor burn.</li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> Charger works well and battery life isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work too bad, but I was always worried about the batteries.</li>
            <li> Bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> If worst comes to worse</li>
            <li> I was completely shocked.</li>
            <li> This does not bother me at all because I no longer have to put up with painful razor burn.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll get shocked.</li>
            <li> Four days after using it, I still have painful scratches and poked holes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be painful to her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to use</li>
            <li> It pinches and plucks the hairs out, rather painfully.</li>
            <li> Shaving shouldn&#x27;t be painful.</li>
            <li> Others often pull at the hair (painful and ugly) or just don&#x27;t even try...  </li>
            <li> and I no longer get painful razor bumps and ingrown hairs in my arm pits like i did when using a disposable razor (venus).</li>
            <li> which definitely is painful.</li>
            <li> Because Of How Painful It Was..</li>
            <li> I got sick of buying desposable razors.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because she was sick if disposables and this one said it gives a close shave...</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this shaver.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> Get one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> If you expect a close shave on your legs with just one swipe you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed when I seen it was a shaver.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you would be disappointed if you purchased this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :-(&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed and desatisfied</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this razor at my daughter&#x27;s request, and so far she says it&#x27;s exactly what she had been looking for. Fairly easy to use and seems to hold a charge well. She&#x27;ll see how it holds up in a few months.</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively now! Love it, so easy</li>
            <li> Having only one useable hand makes shaving a problem;  this shaver does the job - clean underarms!</li>
            <li> Works great so far and very easy to clean.  Found I do prefer to use it with pre shave oil for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish I had bought it much earlier... while it will not give a shave on the legs as close as a razor... its pretty darn close. And for those of us with skin issues and have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors without a skin reaction, this alternative is great. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> never worked as good s my regular razor, but I&#x27;m on blood thinners and it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor.  Would recommend to any woman I know and have recommended to a few.  This is my second one - used the first until battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore (quite a long time).</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had. Easy to clean &amp; recharge too.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for a nice price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy handling.  Clean shave.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> Have used this product more than once thru the years, this is the first one that blades only stayed sharp about 2 months and it won&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  Probably won&#x27;t buy this item again</li>
            <li> Works great. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric razor. I have had mine for over a year now and it still works wonderfully! I have extremely sensitive legs so shaving often left me with itchy and burning legs for days. I have had no issues with discomfort while using this razor. It won&#x27;t get you super smooth legs like you will get with a regular blade-razor, but it will take all the hair off. I love the button that pushes up the blade for longer hairs too. A small issue is that it does spit some of the hair it has shaved back onto your skin, so it makes you think &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t I already shave this spot?&amp;#34; Lol. And don&#x27;t use it with damp skin, as it will pull your hair. Your skin either has to be completely wet or completely dry. Also, if it starts to pull your hair, make sure to charge it first. I always charge it after each use so it doesn&#x27;t pull next time. Definitely glad I bought this razor. The drawbacks are very small compared to the quality you get from it.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this as an electric razor, not a an equivalent of a manual razor.  As an electric razor, it gives a very respectable close shave (not as close as a regular razor) and is easy to use.  I forget what all the complaints about it are, but I have had it a couple months and I have not had a problem with it not charging properly (you HAVE to make sure it is properly seated in the charger, charger light ON); the charge lasts for at least 2 shaves (I haven&#x27;t tried to do it longer, I just recharge); it does not damage my skin at all; it is easily cleaned; it is not too loud.  I got this because of a temporary skin problem that did not allow for a blade on my skin.  The problem is gone and I am still using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut myself, or run out of battery time and it shaves close enough that my legs and under arms are smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> I had an cordless shaver, but could not use it on my underarms, this does a great job, no burns.  I also like the compact charger, rather then on a cord.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, make sure yo charge it before every use. :)</li>
            <li> Works fine. Not as good as shaving with a razor, but adequate for what it is.</li>
            <li> For an electric razor, this does a great job.  Nothing beats a razor and shaving cream, but this is handy!</li>
            <li> I tried this electric shaver on my legs and take about 10 times longer than it would take with a regular old shaver. Also this product is not good for your under arms and female private part. It will hurt bad the next day because you will tons of razor bumps. If you are going to buy this product I would say to use it only on your private part to trim down the hair then finish the rest with it a razor.  (Basically, this product will not cut of the hair.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too happy with this electric razor. I bought it for the price and the reviews, but I can&#x27;t quite figure out what blades to use where seeing as all three of them are attached at once and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well. I liked my old one better where you could switch them out, less complicated. The only good thing I can say is, it is waterproof and it works for shower use.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver, but on a day I needed it the most, it did not work.  It just stopped working, tried everything, but nothing helped. only had it for about a year. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the type of shaver I was looking for so I am pleased with it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got it on time just as it said it was going to be. I would recommend it to every girl out there to get this product it gets hard using a Razor blade and getting those razor bumps ... But with this shaver you don&#x27;t get is that&#x27;s y i like it</li>
            <li> The least comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Feels like it&#x27;s scratching as I shave.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price. Not as close as a regular manual razor but you can&#x27;t really expect it to be. It still does a great job.</li>
            <li> This razor actually does a great job when it works. I am not a hairy person therefore shaving occurs probably once every 4-5 weeks.  It was used very little in the past maybe 6 mos it was used however after being fully charged it just stopped working. I believe I should be refunded for this foolishness. If it would have lasted longer this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I knew this wasn&#x27;t an expensive and that the electric ones are never as close as a real shave.  It works as I expected it to.  I think it is a good product for the cost.</li>
            <li> Performs as I expected.  Love it.</li>
            <li> After a year of light use the blades have become too dull to use.</li>
            <li> My razor is wonderful and I don&#x27;t need to charge it that often.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of shaving in the shower. I have RA and it makes it hard to stand in shower and shave. Couldn&#x27;t believe my luck on finding this and the price was right. Guess you get what you pay for though, as this shaver cuts nothing except for the bikini cutter but can&#x27;t use that on the legs. Luckily I purchased at the store nearby and not online. Taking it back today. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever got myself. The shave is so close and I don&#x27;t get razor burn. Also replacment parts are pretty cheap. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Adjustable heads help get into body curves but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as other products I&#x27;ve used. Easy to store on wall plug.</li>
            <li> Excelente, 100% recomendado.</li>
            <li> I wasnt all that impressed. Now i bought this so that i could stop having to buy the disposable razors every other week . Maybe i have steel like leg hair? But this thing didnt do ANYTHING at all! i tried it numerous ways with and without water, with and without shaving cream... but it doesnt do almost anything. I guess ill just stick with the disposable razors</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use. I think is really worth to use this money to buy this product. I like it.</li>
            <li> There are no great lady&#x27;s&#x27; razors, but this one is pretty good.  I don&#x27;t know why a lady&#x27;s razor can&#x27;t be as good as a man&#x27;s razor, but they aren&#x27;t.  This one is as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This works really well....doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I&#x27;d like, but still works well. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> just wonderful must better that I expected at the price paid. It works really well and easy to use and charge</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this...until, like so many of the others, it up and quit on me after a few months. Panasonic was absolutely no help, either. Spend the few extra bucks for the slightly better version, I asked for it for Christmas and also like all the others have been much happier with it - and most importantly, it&#x27;s KEPT WORKING! Don&#x27;t take the high risk on this product that you&#x27;ll be like so many of us and get one that works great until just outside the return period.</li>
            <li> Suggested by my doctors after surgery. It seems to work very well.  It is easy to charge, hold, use and clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t begin to do the job.  In fact, it really irritates my skin while leaving a stubble.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it!</li>
            <li> At first this razor was pretty good, I was even able to shave my armpits with it without getting shredded. After 6 months, though, it began having problems holding a charge. Now it&#x27;s to the point when I can&#x27;t finish ONE LEG without it completely dying. This renders it pretty much worthless. I&#x27;m very disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> Finally! Found a reasonably priced, good working razor.  It gives a close shave without pulling or causing red irritation marks.</li>
            <li> No lies, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been able to as quickly and efficiently as I am able to with this product. I used the razor dry and was amazed at how well it works on my bikini area. I also have used this razor wet on my arm pits with great success as well. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and cause pain and I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable too! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> best electric razor I have ever had and great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I think I love this shaver. It&#x27;s only been in my possession for an hour, but it has made me have faith in the virtues of smooth legs again. I sport a decent number of little scars around my knees and ankles from contending with the awkwardness of shaving in THE SMALLEST SHOWER. EVER. I&#x27;m not an Amazon, but for whatever reason, trying to get my legs shaved in our rented house&#x27;s shower is torturous, at best, and  downright bloody, at worst. I can deal with the bruises on my elbows from shampooing my hair, but my very being protests when I decide the fur level has gotten out-of-control and I must shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a particularly sanguineous round of shaving this last weekend, I decided I must try something less... sharp. I jumped on line and read reviews. Of course, I&#x27;d love to purchase the $100 lady shaver whatever, but my budget has been depleted by Band-aid purchases and styptics. This little shaver came up at the top of the list with a decent number of stars and several fairly good reviews. I threw caution to the wind and committed my $16+change to the possibility of a bloodless shave for the first time in nine months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived this morning, nestled cozily with my protein powder and several air-pacs. I unpacked it, read the instructions and then got to work. Although it said it should be charged for 12 hours, it purred to life, so I decided to take it for a test run. I shaved my knees, calves and lower thighs. I tried the little trimmer feature on the more heartily furred part of my thigh that I&#x27;d been avoiding while the wounds healed, and it removed the hair readily. While it is not the closest shave in the world, after putting lotion on, I&#x27;m pretty darned pleased! It seems to get pretty close and didn&#x27;t rip or snag the skin. The best thing was the lack of blood trailing down my leg or ankle. I&#x27;ll revisit this review after a month, but I&#x27;m hopeful I&#x27;ll be even more in love!</li>
            <li> I  love how it it gives  a  smooth and  silky feel on my  face  and  it does not  pull on the hair on my face and  legs.  I love it  and  it  does  such  agood job  shving the hir on my  face  and legs .</li>
            <li> I am about to turn 40 years old and I have been dealing with ingrown issues on my armpits all my life. Now that I have found this product I enjoy not suffering from ingrowns as much anymore. You will not get the closest shave with this product but that is okay with me. If I attempt to shave over and over to try and get a smoother shave I will still get ingrowns with this shaver. Note that I have not used this product on my legs. I still recommend this product for those that have any ingrown issues.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and timer works great dry and in shower. No bumps after either</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was looking at a \\&quot;NO-NO\\&quot; Needless to say I was staggered by the asking price, I think that this an obscene cost to rid you of a few hairs, hi tech are not. After searching around, I settled on the Panasonic wet/dry Shaver. Liked the wet/dry feature. Special longer hair razor head should be handy but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. The ease of cleaning, comes with two cleaning brushes, is a strong plus. Unless you do a super heavy shaving session, just remove the top and rinse under running water. Comes with a charger and a small bag that fits all gear and the razor, too. Only minor down thing has been catching or pulling on stubborn hairs. This only happened twice, a very brief stumble, didn&#x27;t hurt, when the razor was just out of the box. No trouble since then.</li>
            <li> Initial quality is great, not too loud of a motor. Bought for my girlfriend and she hasn&#x27;t complained. That being said it must be effective and user friendly.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have found for under $100. Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed. I&#x27;m in my 30s and I remember having cordless razors when I was a teenager and when I was in my early 20s. I remember them pulling and snagging quite a bit... I also remember them not giving the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light years ahead of the cordless razors I had 10-15 years ago. I suppose that shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise, but considering I just sort of randomly picked the first one I saw on amazon that was ~$20, I feel like I got a great deal where I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I got this to use in those quick situations where I may need o shave my legs or arm pits at the last minute when I want to throw on a dress or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a good, quick job on my legs and arm pits... So I figured I may as well give it a shot on my bikini area. It did a GREAT job there, even though the area was *ahem* a bit unkempt... There are trimming blades on each side to take care of longer hairs and the flat razor part in the center to take everything down to the skin. Everything felt SO smooth and I was wondering what the heck I&#x27;ve been doing cutting myself up with my dollar shave club subscription razors the last couple of years when I could just be using something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use, it came charged right out of the box. It&#x27;s easy to clean, a small brush is included. It&#x27;s easy to charge using the small plug/dock. It&#x27;s easy to store in the little fabric pouch that comes with it. It&#x27;s affordable and feels like a quality product from a brand I trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is good product. It does a relatively close shave, especially as far as electric shavers go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes shaving easier because it takes less time than shaving with a regular razor and shaving cream and you can do this in front of the television or before you walk out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a brush that quickly unclogs the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good shaver. Good price. I have had more expensive one , but this one work better. Used it for a year and no problem</li>
            <li> Mom likes the shaver. For years she always uses a razor but after convincing her to try this shaver that can be used wet or dry, she hasn&#x27;t gone back. Great price too and holds a charge very long too.</li>
            <li> Works well for legs, but watch out armpits and elsewhere. Razor burn, pulling, and pinching on any surface that isn&#x27;t basically flat and any hair that isn&#x27;t fine. Ouch.</li>
            <li> Gave as gifts. Complaints of &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Charged it over 24hrs for the first time and the red light never went off or turned green. Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> After my first shave with it, I still had hair. It does not seem to work near as well as a regular razor. Not too happy so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li> Pulls a little and you have to go really slow</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a real shave w/a razor, and know i know why.. depating on sending this back, but at $19.95 i may just keep it for &#x27;emergency&#x27; purposes on the run. It does not give you that smooth silky shave you get from a razor. I used it dry.. maybe i&#x27;ll try it wet and see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife.  The first one died, but the second one has been going strong for a few months now.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my face some.</li>
            <li> I shave pretty much head to toe and this thing works great. I like it more as a dry shaver, for me it works better. I love that I can shave real fast, rise it off, and leave it to dry. It says it has about a 30 min battery life when in use but I have yet to kill the battery. This has saved me so much money on razors.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not the best shave you&#x27;ll ever get but it&#x27;s pretty good.  After a month it started not working then found out it was a loose connection in the prongs where it attaches to the charger.  Just wiggle it and it comes back on.</li>
            <li> Very happy with razor for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product myself since I bought it as a gift, however, I do own a similar one and it cuts down my time shaving significantly and saves me on having to buy razors and shave gels.  What women wouldn&#x27;t want a quick option to remove unwanted hair?  We don&#x27;t always have time for that long hot shower.</li>
            <li> Suckz..didn&#x27;t cut ..rolls over but doesn&#x27;t really cut at all.</li>
            <li> This shaver makes the everyday upkeep SO much easier. The only downfall to me was the sharpness of the blades. It seemed like in the bikini area I had to do a lot of touch up. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower with a creamy shave lotion and it works great.  I get a nice close shave.  The top snaps on and off for easy cleaning.  This shaver does the job and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I used to use Remington electric shavers, but their battery chargers wear out before a year is up. I did my research and decided to try this shaver. So far I love it. I get a lot of shaves before having to recharge and it does a great job on my legs. If the charger doesn&#x27;t wear out before a year is up I will be very happy with this Panasonic shaver. Right now I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had pretty low expectations based on my experiences with electric razors in the past. I really only bought this because a few times over the last couple weeks I&#x27;ve thought to myself \\&quot;Crap, I didn&#x27;t shave my legs this morning and now I want to wear a skirt.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not the silky smooth shave you get with a real razor, but it&#x27;s totally serviceable in a pinch. No razor burn. No nicks on my knees or ankles. And for the price, definitely worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than this on an electric razor (unless maybe the \\&quot;lift &amp; cut\\&quot; ones really work and I was a guy?) and I probably won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on my underarms. But happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as it claims. Knicks your skin and pulls hair as well</li>
            <li> It works just fine on my legs and underarms.  I wish that the charger did not take up so much space on my wall outlet. I have not tried it in the shower.  I am not trying to shave a beard so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it would accomplish something like that.</li>
            <li> We give gifts that are &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;.  This product is listed as origin USA on the web site, but the packaging of the product received says Made in China</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself, and my sister liked it so much, I ordered this one for her -- it&#x27;s a great product.  It won&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but you won&#x27;t nick yourself, either!</li>
            <li> The shipment date was accurate.  There was no problem with the packaging.  I finally had a chance to try it out and I loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t feel any stubble at all.  It was a nice, smooth shave for my legs.  I would absolutely highly recommend this shaver!!</li>
            <li> Bought one of these years ago and I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close as it once did, so I thought it was time for another one. I tried a different brand and it was very rough and scratchy feeling, I did keep it but after a few times I decided I wanted something that didn&#x27;t hurt and wasn&#x27;t rough. I was happy to see this Panasonic shaver, so I bought it. I read the instructions and realized that maybe my other one may just need new parts. Well, I charged this one and used it and have decided to keep it. It works so well and there isn&#x27;t any scraping on my skin very smooth shave. I can only dry shave my legs due to chronic dizziness. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrendous thing that has ever gotten near my..ahem..bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time a few hours ago and am still in pain- and I used to get waxed once a month, so I know what bikini-line-maintenance pain is all about. I tried both the regular and trimmer setting, and both times, the thing yanked out individual hairs mercilessly while leaving other random areas untouched. Worse, I have actual CHUNKS of skin missing now- the razor actually sucked in bits of skin and chopped them up!!&lt;br /&gt;Back to the store with this one..immediately.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but now it is doing just a decent job. I am not sure what has caused this decline in performance, but I still like it. I like that I can use it in the shower and with shaving cream every once in a while but not have to worry about having to shave in the shower. Doing quick touch ups or being able to shave right before going somewhere, dry, is really a bonus to me. I also enjoy not having to worry about nicking myself. I have saved so much in shaving cream and razors though, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> So for years I have been using either disposable razor blades or Venus ones where you replace them every month or so. Every time I shaved, whether it be with shaving cream, conditioner, etc. I would get nicks and cuts all over my legs. It&#x27;s not that I wasn&#x27;t shaving right, it&#x27;s just that my skin was so sensitive that I&#x27;d always get cut, and the worse part was that it would burn and itch afterwards. Finally, tired of dealing with this problem every couple of days, I switched over to this rechargeable shaver. BEST decision ever. It&#x27;s not only quick and convenient, but it gets the job done without any pain, cuts, or burning/itching sensation! Although it may be a hassle to clean every couple of weeks, it&#x27;s way better than any plain razor i&#x27;ve used. Also, you can dry shave with it and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all. Everytime i&#x27;d dry shave with a razor i&#x27;d itch like crazy, but this little shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to have that problem!! For only 20 bucks, it&#x27;s a GREAT investment. Although it may not give you AS close of a shave as a razor does, it def. gets the job done. I now call it my little miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I did a little reading in Consumer Reports and they gave the 2206 a good rating.  That model is replaced with the ES2207 and it is fantastic.  I&#x27;m a man and it shaves my medium thick beard closely with no irritation. (I shave dry.) Highly recommend it and for only $20 plus shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I have Parkinson&#x27;s disease with the shaking of my hand and I needed some help with my grooming. SOOOOO, I selected this Shaver and it has been the answer!  I use the dry mode and it works just great and takes only minutes with easy cleaning!</li>
            <li> This shaver is great.  Don&#x27;t always have time for a razor shave so this does the trick in half the time.</li>
            <li> The charging adaptor is suck.It did not work after 2 months.I brought two of these already, and both of the adaptor did not work after awhile.</li>
            <li> Shave is fairly close, probably as good as you can get with an electric. Comfortable under arms and for bikini area. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the charge doesn&#x27;t seem to hold that long and takes quite a while to recharge. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I love this sucker - it&#x27;s great for legs &amp; bikini (honestly I&#x27;ve never tried it in my pits...)!  They aren&#x27;t kidding about the wet/dry thing - it works great in both situations, and has never malfunctioned due to water.  And for the price?!  Just go ahead and buy it already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/2013 - Battery totally dead.  Cannot use it at all anymore.  I suppose I could have it replaced, but I&#x27;ve really fallen out of the habit of using it/trying to use it, so I haven&#x27;t done any research on that.  It was good while it lasted!</li>
            <li> One star enough said.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift and I love it! This doesn&#x27;t give as close as a shave as a razor obviously, but it gets pretty darn close. I am a very busy person and this is really nice for a person on the go.</li>
            <li> Like it, is worth the $</li>
            <li> My wife has used this several times since Christmas and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;It works for the most part, but she said a regular razor blade still gives a much closer shave for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;But in a hurry, she said you&#x27;d never know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so only 4 stars, but it&#x27;s definetely something to have when you&#x27;re in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shaver for a Christmas gift for my wife.She told me it works great and that she would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift and she likes it just fine.</li>
            <li> great product delivered before time</li>
            <li> It appeared, based on the reviews and the product description, that this shaver would do a better job than the Remington Wet/Dry I already had.  The Remington has always done a decent job but was looking for a closer shave quicker. This shaver just didnt cut it at all.  Within the first week the pop up blade would no longer retract without alot of effort and then it stopped retracting at all.  The shaver failed to perform to the level of the Remington Wet/Dry I have had for almost 2 years.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> She likes it and was a good gift</li>
            <li> After searching a long time for a rechargeable razor that actually works on women with real curves and real hair, this is great! I was using a men&#x27;s electric razor and this puts it to shame. Well done!</li>
            <li> I really like the shaver! It&#x27;s very convenient, works fine, comfortable to hold, looks pretty, and works well! What I really like about it is that it gives me NO bumps!</li>
            <li> I was using another, much more expensive ladies electric razor and it was not doing the job. I bought this razor, but since it was 1/3 the price, my hopes were not high. I was pleasantly surprised! This razor left my legs as smooth as could be. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric razor, so I really have nothing to compare this to. I&#x27;ve only tried it wet so far and I am pretty happy with the results. You do need to go over the same spot several times, but as someone who has very sensitive skin I can honestly say I have NO irritation and my legs are not as dry since I&#x27;ve started using this razor. It takes me longer than the 3 minutes in the product description, but still seems more convenient to me and I get no knicks or cuts anymore. The pop up trimmer is useless, but I don&#x27;t really care about that feature anyway. Overall a good purchase for such a small amount of money!</li>
            <li> A great shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I am in total shock at how well this shaver works.  It is excellent for shaving legs at any length and it does an awesome job.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll do a comparison on 5 blade venus razor disposable &amp; this electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I basically get 1 weeks use out of 1 venus 5 blade cartridge. Which means 1 set of 16 blades at $40 lasts me about 3-4months, meaning I spend $80-120 a year on blades.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: If it really lasts as long as the manufacture says. I&#x27;ll replace the foil cover at $7.00 once a year. So $7.00 to maintain this razor. If worst comes to worse I may just buy a whole new shaver ($18.00 here) every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I have to use this with water running in shower to keep my skin warm or I&#x27;ll get nicks from goosebumps being raised when I&#x27;m chilly. So I&#x27;m wasting water.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: I like how this shaves better dry than wet so no water wasted during use. I also can takes this on the go with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I get a really close shave from these! Like no hair left@&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: I get a pretty close shave (comparable to a 3 blade venus razor) Still feels smooth but not as smooth as a 5 blade disposable shave! (this is why I only give it 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venus Disposable 5 Blade: I nicks and cut myself on occasion and I tend to shave fairly slowly out of fear of slicing into my skin. I have an awful scar from shaving a layer of skin off my ankle area a year ago, YIKES :/&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic Electric: I can go as fast as I like, no nicks, cuts, nothing just safe fast shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So really if you like being eco friendly and wanna save some money and don&#x27;t mind if you don&#x27;t get the closest shave ever just smooth enough to feel nice gliding your legs together. Just get one of these. So worth trying for less than $20. If it doesn&#x27;t work you aren&#x27;t out too much!</li>
            <li> I LOVED using this razor &amp; bought it in February because of the low cost &amp; good reviews.  I needed a safety razor now that I have bifocals &amp; couldn&#x27;t see my underarms clearly!!  I always used it dry &amp; it gave a decent, quick shave.  I was very happy for 4 months.  This week I took it off the charger &amp; it did not start; thinking I hadn&#x27;t placed it in the charger correctly, I repositioned &amp; waited 12 hrs. to try again.  Nothing.  Now I&#x27;m wondering if I should have let it run completely out of juice before re-charging?  I used it once a week, washed it according to directions, and placed it back on the charger once it dried.  I will have to contact the company to see if they will replace it for me &amp; I will give an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please COMMENT if you have a similar experience or knowledge of battery chargers.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent razor.  it caught and removed all the old lady poker hairs with only a couple trips across my chin/neck area.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for ladies. No issues, made by a major manufacturer, and seems to be well made.  Thanks Panasonic, for another great product!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! It gets just about as close a shave as a razor. Absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. Exactly what I was looking for. Panasonic makes shavers for women that truly do not pinch or scratch, but leave area smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few months, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the weight, the feel of it in the hand and the appearance. It remains charged and is very easy to manipulate, shave and clean. Pleased with the results as well! Just sorry that I&#x27;ve lived so long without one-(got it for medical reasons) and I expect it will be easy to pack and use on trips.</li>
            <li> I actually use this for saving my head! If it&#x27;s good enough for ladies&#x27; legs, it&#x27;s good enough to keep my head shaved too.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother, who needed a replacement for her old one (which was bought in 1965!!). As far as I know, she likes it. Her old one was a corded one, so she really liked the fact that this was cordless and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE MY PUSSY BUMPY</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this shaver.  I have only used it dry.  An electric razor is an electric razor and this is the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> very nice item! thanks so much</li>
            <li> Works perfect, good delivery, great price,</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. I have tried 2 other shavers before this one and ended up getting rid of them. So thought I would try this brand and it is amazing ! I have thick hair on my legs and it shaves them like there is nothing there. Wonderful product. Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver has worked pretty well for me so far. I love that I do not have to buy razor refills constantly that are so expensive and it is a lot less painful than the razors. It attaches right the the plugin to charge so you have no bulky base taking up space on the counter or long cords to get tangled which is really nice. The battery also lasts for several shaves before having to charge again. Overall, the Panasonic shaver is a great buy, definitely worth what I paid for it. Though next time I will spend a little more and upgrade to the next one up because I have such thick course hair. If you have fine hair, this one should work good for you with no problem.</li>
            <li> I only use this for shaving my legs but it does a poor job. Even immediately after shaving razor stubble is present. So obviously the blades will not provide a close shave. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the wet mode but the dry mode is disappointing. If as others report it has a short lifespan I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and stays charged for a long time, I have no clue why some people are giving a bad review. I love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought one sooner, VERY convenient!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!! I buy one very six months:)</li>
            <li> I expected less than a razor shave, it is electric after all. But I find that when I let leg hair grow a week, it actually gives a slightly better shave than just after 1-2 days of stubble. It is very good at 1-2 days also, so if you need to shave often this is definitely good. And best of all, it&#x27;s about 95% of razor smooth and no razor burn at all! I was completely shocked. I use it dry. It&#x27;s fantastic. I may never shave with a razor again! :)</li>
            <li> It works fine. I bought one for myself and bought the second one as a gift. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old daughter. She has crazy long thick blonde hair on her legs.. I thought it was fine but she has been teased over hairy legs at school and wanted to shave.. this is a safe alternative to a razor. It does not leave your legs smooth like from a razor but she is not concerned about baby smooth legs at this age.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and very handy. Just plug it in, charge it up, and it&#x27;s ready to go. I love it!</li>
            <li> This was to be my daughter&#x27;s first shaver and she cannot use it.  It provides a close shave and proved to be too much for her sensitive skin (she said it felt too prickily; she also broke out into a rash each time).  I am now using the shaver and like it very much - I find it much more effective then my previous 15 year old shaver.  My daughter now uses my old shaver which is much duller!  I have not used it in the shower, have tried it dry only.</li>
            <li> So far I have realy enjoyed using this razor. It really is easy to handle amd shaves perfectly. The price is good too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor for the price, does exactly what I bought it for, easy underarm hair removal.</li>
            <li> 100 x better than my old shaver, this one shaves really close, keeps its charge and it a lot easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Please buy this product if you have sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle a regular shave. My thighs will get painful shaving burn with a normal razor, and this is the perfect solution, and I can do it dry without problems! Really saved me so much embarrassment during swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen! She loves it!</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, Light and easy to use, Keeps good charge.&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered way before due date.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver.  I have sensitive skin and cannot use a blade on my legs, so I have always used an electric.  This one is the best one I have had, cuts close and keeps it&#x27;s charge for a long time. It even works on underarms if you pop up the front blade. Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> I have tried several shavers before and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far.. I use it to shave underarms, legs, and bikini area.. It gives a clean and a close shave, without pulling. Though it does not come with bikini trimmer attachment, i use the pop up trimmer to do the job. I cut my skin the first time i used on the bikini area, then i realized , i need to use lesser pressure and hold it light and let it glide ,for a better shave. It has been smooth since then.  It works great for legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> My longest lasting razor thus far! Holds a great charge and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> I recently found out that I am allergic to nickel in disposable razors.  They were giving me hives.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I could do until I found this razor.  After using it I didn&#x27;t break out in hives.  It has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well without pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li> It is very good.It shaves clean and it was done dry and my wife is very satisfied.It is totally painless and does not knick your skin.But when shaving you need to pull your skin tight when shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a replacement for one that has been dropped in the shower many times.  The shaver fits in the hand very well and does hug the shape of the legs and underarms.  Would recommend this shaver based on how well it holds a charge, shaves closely to the skin without irritation and price.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised by this razor!  It was so inexpensive, compared to others offered...yet, it shaves closely and doesn&#x27;t irritate, it&#x27;s very lightweight, so, it will be great for travel in the cloth pouch that comes with it.  I took it apart to see how to clean it, and that&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Wow, I can recommend this without reservation.</li>
            <li> My husband told me electric shavers were evil. I tried this one anyway and I&#x27;m very happy I did. Regular razors are not recommended for me because small nicks and cuts can be an issue. The Panasonic ES2207P wet/dry works great and I don&#x27;t miss my usual razor. A few relevant facts: I have extremely sensitive skin and very fine hair&lt;br /&gt;The run down:&lt;br /&gt;(1) gives a close shave quickly and painlessly. The shave is not completely smooth. For me, its the way my legs would feel 12-24 hours after shaving with a razor&lt;br /&gt;(2) No razor burn, bumps, or irritated skin. No ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;(3) Works well wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;(4) bikini bit works well, though it requires more care than using the shaver normally. I shaved a bit of skin off a finger, but not enough to bleed or anything.&lt;br /&gt;(5) shaved well and easily even when the hair was quite long, ~2 weeks of no shaving. Felt great to shave after so long!&lt;br /&gt;(6) plugging it in to charge is a little annoying because pressing the shaver in the charger makes the charger loosen a bit from the outlet. No big deal, but a little annoying&lt;br /&gt;(7) easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;(8) pretty quiet, if you care about noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this shaver. It allows me a nice fine shave despite sensitive skin and a health concern.</li>
            <li> Gift for my mom.  She loved it - it was just what she wanted and she says it works great!</li>
            <li> Works well and charges easily. Has a nice design, easy to hold. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am new to using an electric shaver, so I cannot compare this with any other shavers. I do really like this electric shaver, it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed by how quickly the shaver worked, as well as how close the shave was.  I don&#x27;t expect razor-close shaves, but the Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves Shaver was darn near razor-close.  There is no pulling when using this shaver - it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s cutting the hairs.  My last Panasonic Shaver (don&#x27;t recall the model) was alright, but it took several passes to take care of an area.  This shaver gets most areas in one pass.  This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Of all the Ladies Shavers I had, this is the best one, gives a close smooth shave. A great product, I highly recomented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H. H.&lt;br /&gt;Knoxville, TN</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother at Christmas.She is very happy with it</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried. I get a close shave (not quite as close as with a wet razor, but good) with no skin irritation. I have very sensitive skin and actually didn&#x27;t shave my legs for several years because the red bumps, stinging, and itching weren&#x27;t worth it. This shaver has completely resolved that dilemma. I also really like the convenience of being able to shave when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  Much better than a razor. No cuts at all. Fast and simple.</li>
            <li> This works great! Disposables give me razor burn, but I like the close shave. I tried an epilator and that didn&#x27;t work too well, it just broke off the hairs. I figured I would just give up and use an electric shaver and get a close enough shave, but this one exceeded my expectations. I also like that there&#x27;s a nice compact place for it on my electrical outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both wet and dry functions and I think it works better dry. When I dried off, I could still feel hairs so I went over it again and the area became smooth. However, during dry shaving, if I go to fast my skin catches in the razor. There was no bleeding, but it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there&#x27;s no cord attachment. That&#x27;s probably for safety reasons, but I would like that option when the battery starts to lose it charge.</li>
            <li> What is the electricity that operates 110V or 220V</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing!!  I have horribly dry, sensitive skin, and I can finally shave my legs without pain.  It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but close enough for me to be happy.</li>
            <li> Love the close shave it provides. Wonderfu buy.</li>
            <li> After having two Remington Shavers that did not last the Panasonic is a welcome relief.  Is a much better shaver.  The shaver and replacement cutting heads purchased at the same time were cheaper than replacement cutting heads for the Remington.  Would deffinately purchase again.  Superior product and fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver to replace about a 5 year old Conair Electric shaver.  This one is much, much better.  Razor is relatively quiet, no knicks or cuts, smooth shave, good for using on the bikini area.  The charging stand is also pretty neat.  There is no cord or real docking station.  There is a small plug, maybe 2in x 2in, that you plug in and then there is a small piece that sticks up that the razor sits on to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/19/13: Went to use this the other week and it was dead.  It still lights up when plugged in but does not charge.  It was good while it lasted!</li>
            <li> Great for facial hair. Absolutely, no burning, dragging or pinching of the facial skin. I got this for my Mom.  Over the years, she has developed a lot of facial hair on her cheeks, neck, and under her chin. This shaver removed that hair, quickly and cleanly, without shaving cream.  After her painless \\&quot;shave\\&quot;, Mom&#x27;s face looked and felt very smooth.  No redness. She&#x27;s happy. For any woman that has gone or is going through menopause; this shaver cleans those unwanted hairs quickly and efficiently....and pain free.  It does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be used with shaving cream and in the shower, too. It needs to be charged for 12 hours before using the first time. It comes with a little brush for cleaning the blades, but the entire razor head can be detached for a thorough cleaning.  A satin pouch is included for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; Very effective shaver. It gets the little hairs, too.  We use it about twice a week. It has kept it&#x27;s charge for months. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it, yet.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  I could not believe how smooth the shave was.  And previously I had spent hundreds of dollars on wax, no no ( which was absolute garbage and I paid $ 300.00) for it., and other more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> there were lots of positive reviews for this razor so I thought it would be great, but I don&#x27;t think it is. I was really excited but when I put it into action I was disappointed. I did dry shaving cuz that is what a lot of people recommended but maybe I will have better luck with using it to shave wet.. I imagine so since my major complaint was that it was painful! it did a shoddy job of shaving and not a good job of trimming either. I think it kept catching my hair and not cutting/shaving it off.. was really annoying and I had to inspect to make sure there was no blood because it did hurt more than once. whether or not I am the best shaver, this should not happen with a razor and of course I&#x27;ve never had trouble like that with a regular razor.  &#x3D;/ it did an ok job but it was a feat</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Shaving with a razor and shaving cream really dries my skin out. This is great to do a quick shave without drying skin. Does not give as close of a shave as a razor, but I expected that when I bought it. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I have had lady shavers in the past and they either left big scratch marks on my legs or way too much stubble after multiple passes.  But, this shaver beats them all, even with a dry shave!  First of all, it&#x27;s Panasonic, so that makes it one of the best.  Then, it shaves so close, almost nearly like a razor.  It comes with a plug-in charger that the shaver just sits on to charge.  There is also a clipper feature, which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but I don&#x27;t generally use the clippers anyway.  It fits right in my hand, is easy to clean, and was even fully charged when I got it! It did my underarms even better than I expected!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone, first time user or otherwise.</li>
            <li> --edit March 2014--&lt;br /&gt;Not even a year old and the motor and battery gave out on it. It doesn&#x27;t have the power behind it to do the shaving and the battery loses its charge within the hour after having it on the charger for 12+ hours. Major letdown and annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--July 2013--&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now and I am very happy with it. Because I&#x27;m on a blood thinner I don&#x27;t want to use blades because of the high risk of cutting myself (and then getting blood all over the place). I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for a few years now and this one is pretty close to the old Remmington I first owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the nippers on the front AND back. This way I can go up and down my leg instead of just pulling up like a blade. Going backwards is more to catch the strays in my observance. I also love how the front nippers can be raised to shave longer hair first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and really easy to clean. There&#x27;s a little brush that is included to clean the blades with. And when it needs it, stick the top under running water and then let it sit on a towel for 12 hours to dry. It fits nicely in hand and is easy to maneuver. I use the razor on it&#x27;s own without any sort of cream or soap. I find that these razors last much longer this way. Best time to shave is right out of the shower and toweling off. The hair is softer and easier to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the charging &#x27;station&#x27;. I thought it was a bit weird at first because I&#x27;m used to cords and corded charging stands. This though..... it&#x27;s neat that it gets rid of the annoying and risky cords but, it blocks the outlet. It could just be the shape of the other plugs. I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in for long. Overnight does a real good job of recharging. I can usually get two shaves before I need to recharge it. Sometimes three. It all depends on how quick I can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this as a replacement for the Remmingtons. I bought another Remmington before this one and it broke down on me within two months. A waste of money. Oh I was ticked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another version of this one that has an attachment for bikini lines.</li>
            <li> GREAT!!! My 19 year-old daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> I love this. It provides a very close shave. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Not the best  ...But will do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razor since the late 40&#x27;s. Started out with a Sunbeam, then tried a Norelco. After that Brauns, Switched to Remmingtons. Now that I have this Panasonic I think that it is the best yet. It shaves smooth and quickly too. An electric razor will never give you a shave as close as a regular razor but so much easier. It is  shaped well for the hand, not heavy and quiet compared to my last Remmington which sounded like very angry hornets and was fairly heavy in the hand. The feature of cleaning under running water is very convenient. All in all a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Works ok but doesn&#x27;t do a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Oh man! What a beautiful razor! This is exactly what I was looking for as a present for my wife. And she loves it. It was shipped right on time and I received it with no damage due to shipping. Therefore I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  If you have thick hair, you might have problems shaving with it.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me as a gift (I am using his account to post this review) and I love it.  It never pulls my hair as I am shaving and it is very easy to use and to charge.</li>
            <li> 1. Charger died in a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Trimmer jammed and would no longer deploy.&lt;br /&gt;3. Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is after light use.  What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my daughter (12) who wanted to start shaving her legs....</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well.  Shaves close.  No complaints.  Nothing special about it.  Just a good product so far.</li>
            <li> The razor in general does a great job. But the attachement you can raise to detial \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; areas pinches, a lot. I like the razor enough to just not use that feature though. And becareful if you have any moles or raise beauty marks, this razor is so good, is shaves them like a straight razor would if you press too hard. Otherwise, once you get the hang of it, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Wife writing this. I bought this item to replace my Remington 5000, which was good, but the replacement heads and blades have become too expensive to be worth purchasing to rebuild it. I was skeptical as price for this new shaver was cheaper than replacement parts for my old Remington 5000. However, as my husband was extremely happy with his Panasonic ES8066 that he has had for years, I decided to give this item a try.  Excellent shaver. Better than the Remington 5000 was when it was new.  Smooth close shave. Fast with no burns or bumps or stubble left. Easy to handle and maneuver when shaver is wet or dry. Economical as replacement blades and foils are reasonably priced. Delivery by Amazon was fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to shaving in the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is suitable for those times when a quick shave is needed without a shower.  This shaver did not irritate my sensative skin.  For the price, it provides a good shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but it won&#x27;t replace my razor.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get something like this for a long time.  As I have gotten older, my skin has become more sensitive. Shaving my legs with a regular razor has become detrimental and never fails to leave several nicks and bleeding. This is not great to look at, much less feel. It does exactly what I want it to do.  I think that if you need something that will leave your legs really smoothe you might need to get a more expensive product.  The PANASONIC ES2207P CLOSE CURVES rechargeable shaver is perfect for what I need it for. I have not had one cut nor has it &#x27;pulled&#x27; any hair while in use.  It is comfortable to use and since no one is touching my legs who cares if you can still feel a really minimal roughness?  The other reason I love this is because I cut my own hair. This means shaving the back of my neck of the fine hair that grows there. I have used it for this and it is awesome and so much easier than using a regular razor.  Thank you to all who do theses reviews as this is the reason I am doing one.  These reviews have helped me so many times that I am really finding it difficult to buy things in the store without someone telling me about it.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a shave this close with an electric razor.  I can use it to shave my legs, and not feel a SINGLE hair!  It&#x27;s my new favorite product, I love it so much!  I had the older version of this too, the blue/green one, which I liked but bought this one when I lost the charger (I&#x27;d had that for years, and it still works!  I just can&#x27;t charge it, haha!)  And this one gets an even closer shave!  I&#x27;m so never using those regular razors again where I always end up cutting myself, it&#x27;s this little baby every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic, you have truly revolutionized electric razors for women - we can FINALLY get a close shave like the men get with their razors!  My legs have never looked more fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product as far as electric razors go.  I had recently purchased a Remington razor for $40.  I returned it a few weeks later, as it didn&#x27;t work very well.  I had to go over the same spot several times just to get all the hair.  This razor, for about half the price, works much better and works with just one pass.  Electric shavers don&#x27;t necessarily get a razor-close shave, but this electric shaver gives a nice close shave.  The same day I shave with it, my boyfriend thinks my legs are as smooth as a razor-shave.  There is stubble by the next day, but just a few minutes with this shaver makes my legs as good as smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people complain about how you have to charge this shaver.  I like it much better than the corded razor, it takes up less space and is out of the way when charging.  You just have to keep in mind that all you have to do to keep the shaver tightly on the base is to put the shaver on the base first, and then you plug it into the wall.  If you do that, the shaver will have no problem staying secure on the charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, I am very impresses with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this during my first year of college--apparently, hairy legs, arms, armpits, and sideburns aren&#x27;t popular on campus? Lol. Anyway, it works perfectly. I used to use disposable shavers, but after I got scar tracks on my legs, I decided to purchase this. I don&#x27;t even have to use any shaving cream or anything with it. Everything can be totally dry, and it removes the hair perfectly. I even use the little pop up thing to do my bikini area. It stays charged for a pretty long time, but I charge it for a couple of hours at least once every week. I would definitely recommend this to any college girl! :)</li>
            <li> So far, this shaver is PERFECT.  Firstly, I should mention that I am a GUY, yet I firmly believe the only place hair belongs is on top of our heads.  Why it grows everywhere else, only God knows for sure.  I&#x27;ve been looking high and low to find a shaver that combines 1)a close shave 2) ease of use 3) safety in highly sensitive areas - IE no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaver to shave EVERYTHING except my face and head - have a separate shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;This baby is the BOMB!  Did my entire body on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it DRY, as in my book water and electricity simply do NOT belong together, so I cannot comment on how well it handles a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery lasts a long time - at least 30 minutes - on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is extremely ATTRACTIVE in design - gorgeous mauve color.&lt;br /&gt;3) EXTREMELY well designed - fits your hand like a glove, and the head glides over even the most delicate parts of you.&lt;br /&gt;4) Delivers a nice close shave without irritation&lt;br /&gt;5) Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;6) You will start liking football even LESS if you use a lady&#x27;s shaver:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t cook dinner for me.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s so pretty you hate getting it hairy.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have to say I am super pleased! I bought this at a Target store for only $20. I was looking for something that was sensitive to my skin and won&#x27;t give me nicks and that itchy feeling after a clean shave. This does it all!!! It&#x27;s sensitive, no nick,itch-free and my legs were ultra smooth! It gets a close shave compared to a manual razor. I just wish I found this a lot sooner,now I have scars on my leg due to the nicks n itching!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Panasonic ladies shavers now for over 10 years.  I had noticed years ago that I did get one that was duller than the previous one I was replacing had been when new during that time.  But, the price is great for this brand, and so, when my old ones were becoming dull, it is either replace the blades or get a new one.  I paid $27 at Amazon for this replacement and am now very happy that I did....this one is really, really sharp and shaves close and the shave lasts a day or 2 longer as a result.  I would recommend this model.  (By the way, I never use mine wet, I use them dry before the shower, not during, so I cannot attest to how well it works wet.)</li>
            <li> I have only used this dry but it does a very nice job if your goal is to get rid of visible hair. It will not get rid of palpable stubble. It does it in a single pass without having to go back over areas. It holds a charge for a long time. I took it on a weekend trip and never even had to recharge it. The trimmer is very precise. I have been using the $9.99 trimmers which dont last long, this is much better. Overall I am very happy. I had a Conair infinity which stopped holding a charge after 2 weeks. (wish I read the reviews before that purchase!) This one so far is way ahead.</li>
            <li> Nice electric shaver for women. Gives a close shave (relative to electric razer). Re-charges nicely. No cord. Can be used in the shower. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother that lives in the same county as I do. She recently had to go on blood thinners for a few months due to a medical reason.&lt;br /&gt;She was afraid of cutting herself with a razor, so I did some research and bought this for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used it several times dry, and says it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the wet function with lather, as she has not used it that way yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought this may help other folks in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;As usual with Amazon, a great price and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;d recommend everyone to buy it....although I believe you can get it same price in walmart etc. I had a gift card I needed to use that&#x27;s why I bought it on amazon so price wise - you don&#x27;t really save much but everything was brand new in the box &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> FINALLY.. a shaver that works...I have tried many ladies electric shavers...and they were lousey...I just bought this one and it really works..1 pass and my legs are smooth as I like them..i am so grateful that I decicied to give this shaver a try...</li>
            <li> My first one lasted at least ten years. Second one is same great quality.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!!!  The blades are so sharp,,,,,my face began to peel!!!!  Of course, I am used to a manual shaver for the hair on my&amp;#34;chinny chin-chin&amp;#34;  so that might have contributed to my loss of skin (smiles).</li>
            <li> Works well. However, the on-off button is very stiff and requires multiple attempts to turn it on. OK for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a couple of weeks now, and like it quite well. It gives a decently close shave (not as close as a blade, but good for an electric), and I don&#x27;t have to go over my legs several times for it to catch the hairs. The plug in charger does take over an outlet, but I don&#x27;t mind - I like that it&#x27;s compact. The price was great, also. I used to use a Remington, but it wore out. I am pleased I tried this one this time.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this. It was not expensive and seems to shave well. Of course, if you want a really close shave you need to use a razor but this is really close for an electric razor. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I always do research before trying a new product, so I ordered this one based upon reviews as well as price.  As a man, I have had electric shavers for my face in the past, so I knew that an electric shaver is no replacement for a blade.  You basically trade a super close shave for a acceptable shave in exchange for the convenience and cost of razor blades.  I have to say that I am blown away by this little machine.  I shave head to toe...everything except my eyebrows...and there are certain areas that work with a blade, others that work with an electric shaver, and some that are not comfortable regardless of what you are using.  I just used this shaver on my entire body and have absolutely no complaints at all.  No pulling, no pinching, no cuts, no rash...even on areas that I had never planned on using this shaver for.  It&#x27;s so cheap that even if it breaks in a month, I would order another.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife &amp; she says it does the best of any razor she has had.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter in April of 2014.  Just as other reviewers noted, it stopped working after 9 months of light use.  It was great when it worked but an item should work for more than 9 months!</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Easy to use, easy settings, easy charge.  Fits well in the hand and takes care of my hair removal needs quickly and painlessly, no redness and no bumps afterwards.  I bought a second one for my daughter because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife, and he likes it.  It is smooth and comfortable, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> i loveeeeeee this product!! it is perfect for my legs and i love that i can shave on the go :) it doesn&#x27;t give off that dry leg feeling where you need aloe vera asap so that&#x27;s a bonus</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this purchase since I owned the older version and it wasn&#x27;t a good product but this updated version is very good, it holds a charge for weeks and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I got this razor a couple of months ago and it works fantastic...I obviously don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;soft as a baby&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; shave like I do a regular razor but this works great for the money....both in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I surprised my grand-daughter with this shaver for Christmas.She immediately tried it and loves it...I really didn&#x27;t know what to shop for in a ladies shaver so I read other reviews on this one.Plenty of positive reviews for the price..</li>
            <li> Not a close shave, but works as well as Nair without the smell. Its satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shaver. Shaves really great and holds a charge for a very long time. Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before buying this and agree with the reviewer that said you have to use it correctly.  I want to add that you also need to have realistic expectations.  And electric razor is NOT going to give you the same type shave as blade.  But if you use it correctly and keep it charged, it can be a pretty good substitute.  I am disabled and can no longer stand up in the shower to shave.  It was suggested that I try an electric razor.  I have one that I&#x27;ve had for years (rarely used it) and I like it, but you can no longer get replacement blades or foils for it.  This Panasonic is fitting the need very well.  Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Just don&#x27;t use it on your face, it hurts! It&#x27;s pretty powerful. So everywhere else on the body it works great.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this shaver. I tried it with clean dry legs and it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair. So then I tried it in the shower. It didn&#x27;t do a very good job there, either. So I put on some shaving cream in the shower and it worked a little better, but it still didn&#x27;t do very well. So I pulled out my trusty razor and threw out the Panasonic Wet/Dry Electric Razor.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Ok so if the puppy wouldn&#x27;t have chewed the blades on my old electric razor... Well if ain&#x27;t broke why replace it right? I usually used electric razors to shave my legs between tub and water shavings. Or for periods of time when I just have been working too much and have less time to manage the legs. So I bought this one thinking it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;ll not do well. But it was definitely worth the $$ spent. I love the easier wall plug. U can shave wet or dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the razor bumps. I like the front razor pops up for a closer shave for those hard areas like ur knees. So far it has been way better than my old one so thanks to the dog lol I have something even better lol</li>
            <li> I was given the Panasonic ES2207P for a Christmas gift and I am very pleased.  The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it correctly or not as it felt like it was burning and wasn&#x27;t removing the hair.  I decided to play with it before making a decision and I realized I wasn&#x27;t holding it correctly.  Cockpit error that&#x27;s all.  Once I realized I wasn&#x27;t holding it at a 90 degree angle, it was awesome and I am very very happy with it!  I found it does do a better job using shaving cream vs dry.  You may have to go over a few spots but go slow while using and it&#x27;ll be a good shave.  As long as you hold it correctly (and it even tells you in the instructions) and take your time, you will have a great shave and will enjoy using your new razor!  I&#x27;m thankful my husband thought to buy this for me as I begun using blood thinners and he was afraid I would cut myself using disposable razors.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all with this one!  He chose this particular one because of all the other good reviews it got and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY IMPRESSED! This is my very first lady shaver. I normally use handheld eyebrow trimmers from beauty supply stores to trim facial, underarm and bikini hair.  The trimmer will nic and leave cuts in the areas I use.  I started on my face and the shaver was very smooth, trouble free and easy to use! I used the pop up bikini attachment and it got to the trouble areas without nics or cuts! I highly recommend this product; it&#x27;s a time saver and it delivered on what it said it does!! I will write an update soon!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a lazy person but when it comes to shaving my legs, I am the type that doesn&#x27;t care all that much to be on the cutting edge. In the winter if no one is going to see my legs, I don&#x27;t care to whip out the wax per say. Basically I like to keep things simple. I just needed a razor to do the job until summer comes around when I start to care. So this is perfect for those times, when you don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;Wax\\&quot; kind of closeness but don&#x27;t want to go around looking all beastly either. Perfect for times like winter or other times when you are in a big hurry and just need a little touch up or if you don&#x27;t care much. Sometimes I use it if I am going out on errands and know no one is going to be looking at my legs up close.  It doesn&#x27;t get the closest shave ever, but does what I need it to. Great for travel too (like vacation, where you will never see those people again) kind of thing. Not travel like to see a new boss that you really need to impress. Basically what you expect out of a electric shaver, no more no less.  I have had it a few months now and use it quite a bit and it has worked fine, still going strong battery and all!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m glad my old one finally gave out because this one is much better. It does everything it claims and gives a comfortable shave. I&#x27;m leaving the country is a few months and will need a shaver that works on 220v, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a new one right now. When the time comes I hope I can find a 220v that&#x27;s this good and at this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple of times and its fine. Easy to clean, has pop-up for sideburns, etc. To charge, plug the charger directly into the socket and place base of razor onto the charger. No counter space is needed so its a good choice if you have limited space.</li>
            <li> The Ladies shaver came wrapped very well.  It works very well. Came with extra parts.  Is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Shaver is the right size and can be used wet or dry. Does a good job and does not sound like a lawn mower. For the money, its seems to be a good value. Can recommend.</li>
            <li> This razor was great in the beginning.  After about 6 months, it dies.  Charging it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I&#x27;ve now bought 2 thinking that maybe the first one was a quality issue and it&#x27;s now happened to both of them.  I don&#x27;t want to keep buying a new electric razor every 6 months.</li>
            <li> The first two times I used it I loved it, but when I was taking off the removable outer foil to clean it I dropped it and the blade part snapped off, and it doesn&#x27;t look like a replacement blade will fix it. I&#x27;m really disappointed and don&#x27;t know how to get this fixed.</li>
            <li> works great for my purpose of shaving over psorasis</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a Remington and I loved it. It held a charge a long time, shaved close and never grabbed my skin. So when the battery finally gave out after several years I bought another Remington, the closest model I could find to the one I liked which was discontinued. Big mistake - the second Remington was a disaster! Didn&#x27;t hold a charge, and even with brand new blades it grabbed the skin under my arms leaving red marks and left stubble on my legs. So, back to the drawing board. I read the Amazon reviews on a number of electric shavers and settled on this one. It&#x27;s great! It is lighter weight than the Remington, shaves closer (amazingly close for an electric shaver) and holds a charge really well. It glides smoothly and never grabs my skin. I like the little clipper, too - the Remingtons didn&#x27;t have that. The blades and foils are much easier to change than they were on the Remingtons also. This Panasonic is just an all-around great little electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First-timers should keep in mind that no electric shaver will ever give as close a shave as a razor. Those triple and quadruple razor blades made today shave really, really close. But I got tired of nicking myself and I really don&#x27;t care about a super close shave so I switched to electric and never looked back. If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before, there is a short period of adjustment while your skin gets used to the feel of it. Do a final shave with the razor and then use the electric shaver gently for a few days in a row before you tackle any major stubble; it should feel a lot better. If using it dry, make sure the skin is really, really dry - not damp. I find shaving in the shower uncomfortable so I prefer to shave dry, but the shaver seemed to do fine on wet skin the one time I tried it. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year now and replaced the blades/foil once so far. I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Yahhhhhh! I have been searching for an electric razor that actually worked and this one does! The hair doesn&#x27;t start to grow back for a week or more! Thank you soooo much! If you are thinking of purchasing this...do it!</li>
            <li> the first day the switch to pop up the edger blade broke. I had this shaver before for over 10 years. I bought a new one as the whole shaver cost less then replacing just the blades and it broke.</li>
            <li> Get a really close shave for an electric razor. I love it!</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as using a razor, but great for everyday shaving while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there, from those at-home waxing kits to the epilators and hair removing creams and hated just about every one of them, with razor shaving at the top of the list. I was so excited when I got this in the mail to try it out, and even though the directions recommend charging it for a full 12 hours it came out of the package fully charged and ready to go. I tried it in both wet and dry conditions, and with shaving creams as well as conditioner and it held up great under all conditions. I will say that it gets a much closer shave when in the shower and using conditioner and I have been super pleased with the results. The shave lasts much longer than regular razor shaving, and without the hazard of potential nicks and cuts. For longer hair, I recommend using the built-in trimmer first and then finishing up with the shaver for the best results. It works great on all areas, from legs and arms to the more sensitive areas like underarms and bikini areas. I didn&#x27;t even wince when rotating to get to awkward nooks and crannies like with a dangerous razor! I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s super durable (I&#x27;m a complete klutz and have dropped it once or twice with no issues) and I did a lot of homework on comparable products before purchasing this one and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Passing on what my wife reports on the shaver. She mainly uses it while bathing and has fallen in love with the product. As a wet / dry shaver she reports that it working perfectly in the water. She also uses it as a dry shaver only while doing her legs away from the bathroom and it also works wonderfully. She is so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> the razor works well. i have had good results w/it. i have not tried it wet but works great dry.</li>
            <li> Love the charger.  Never had a problem with this and it gives a pretty close shave.  This is my second one so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it. Cheaper than  $25 plastic razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been safe with sharp objects.  So, when I was put on anticoagulants, my clumsiness became something more than an inconvenience.  This razor provides a close, safe shave.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors.  One of them gave me road rash, another just didn&#x27;t really work.  This one is great.  It glides over the skin with no discomfort, and I&#x27;ve never cut myself with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted!! I can not believe it broke down on me in less than six months :(( it was a really good product but unfortunately it gave up on me too quick. I wish there was a way to return it!!! I literally bought it in Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver wet or dry. Great deal, fast delivery as always with Prime.</li>
            <li> On water rationing here in California, this saves me lots of water. Easy to clean, such a good deal for this price.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life used anything but a blade razor on my legs and underarms, so this was a totally new experience.  So far I&#x27;m liking it, although you do not get a shave nearly as close as with a blade. To get something even remotely akin to that, you have to go over the areas several times, and even then you can still feel the stubble.  It does not matter that much to me, but if really smooth legs are important to you, stick with a blade, or waxing or something like that.  As far as performance and ease of use and cleaning, it&#x27;s super great.  I keep it plugged in while I&#x27;m at work and it&#x27;s always ready to use.  I use it dry before I get in the shower.  Then I can just tap the head to get the dry hair out and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  I do recommend it, but not for very smooth skin.  It really can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Works excellent! Glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I love it. Going through chemo so my hair is drifting seat. I bought this because I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I use blood thinner and this is a great answer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers over the years, and have to say that this is by FAR the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric. No razor bumps either. Just smooth skin. Highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good shaver.  It works just like you want it to, it provides a close shave without the fear of cuts and the precision tool works very well.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times on my random patches of skin, but my boyfriend seems to have claimed it for regular use.  He uses it as an everyday easy shaver.  I&#x27;m going to have to get my own it seems.  :P</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife who loves the shaver and asked me why we didn&#x27;t buy this thing a long time ago.  I told her that I didn&#x27;t know she wanted one until I found that she was using my razor.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For a long time I was using a men&#x27;s electric shaver, and it worked okay for my underarms, but for legs it was just not efficient and didn&#x27;t even give a very close shave. Then I dropped and broke it, and had to get something new. Wish I had dropped it a long time ago! I chose this razor based on the good reviews AND the low price. Figured even if it was mediocre, I wasn&#x27;t out all that much money. Anyway, I am pleased to report that I agree with the positive reviews! It gives a nice, close shave and works really well for underarms. I did have some slight discomfort after the first use or so, but I think I was applying too much pressure, because with my old razor I had to, in order to get results. So I adjusted how hard I push this one while shaving, and I still get a close shave, but no razor burn. The only possible negative is the charger-it&#x27;s just not the most convenient type for me. I&#x27;d rather have just a cord to charge with. And I guess it would be nice if the surface area of the shaver was larger in order to do legs more quickly, but I guess it&#x27;s comparable to a regular razor, so I&#x27;m probably getting a little greedy here!</li>
            <li> I would give this shaver 5 stars if it had the kind of battery like my husband&#x27;s shaver - but for some reason women&#x27;s shavers only have the batteries that you&#x27;re supposed to let run down before re-charging, which I mind next to impossible to do.  Other than that this shaver gives a close shave, is easy to use, and cheap enough to throw away in a year or so when the battery stops working, which it will.</li>
            <li> I titled this as a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; razor because it will not give you a close shave.  I find this razor great to keep up short enough shaving when I&#x27;m wearing pants a majority of the time.  I even feel comfortable enough to use this razor to go to the gym, but then again, I really don&#x27;t care if a little stubble is on my legs.  Men shouldn&#x27;t be looking that closely...!  Works good on legs and armpits.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Does not cut like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I hate shaving my legs, and this makes my life so much easier. I love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it is doing its job. I was surprised to see how well it removes leg hair.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  It does a wonderful job.  SO MUCH BETTER than the razor I had before!  I love it.</li>
            <li> have had now for nearly a month.slight crack in one side, barely noticeable, but not affect how it works. I think anyone would be happy to have this  Panasonic Razor.. I am very pleased.  update:: here we are 10 months later. I love love love it.  I am so glad I got it. It was worth everything I paid for it which was not a lot.  Its been an amazing little shaver.  also holds a charge for a long time, so I go without charging for long periods. wonderful is all I can say.</li>
            <li> It hurts my skin and is not very user friendly, both with wet and dry functions. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It gives a close shave without irritation.  Very reasonable price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Really Good Rechargeable Razor. This is easy &amp; comfortable to hold &amp; actually DOES work as well as it does wet &amp; lathered. Charges up fast &amp; holds a charge longer than usual. Best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> The razor was a good price and it does the job without any problems. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Im currently going through laser hair removal for my face and I&#x27;m not allowed to tweeze or wax, so I thought this would suffice. I use it in the shower with shaving cream and it is the closets shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. My skin looks visibly different.. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this shaver for trimming my husband&#x27;s neck hair and shaving my legs.  Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> LOVE it ,, nice and quiet</li>
            <li> So much better than giving my daughter a razor. No more cuts and razor burn. The perfect first-time shaving tool!</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and not able to shave my legs with razor any more.  This is perfect. I can&#x27;t tell the difference is blade razor and this. Smooth, easy to use and much quicker on the go. Great razor.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a fairly smooth shave and has held its charge well. It is easy to clean. Unlike the disposible razors it doesn&#x27;t give cuts. My only complaint is that it is hard to maintain a good grip on it when my hands are wet. Maybe it is a little too streamlined.</li>
            <li> was purchased as a gift</li>
            <li> My wife loves this razor!  She has been using it for about a month now and still comments on the close shave and how well the trimmer works.  If I had to make a suggestion for improvement, the trimmer does a nice job but sometimes requires multiple passes to cut longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Im surprised how powerful it is! The pop up blade is a little hard to use on the bikini area but the shaver part is great!</li>
            <li> This electric razor is pretty much amazing. Close shave, no irritation, no razor bumps. This shaver has been life changing for me! Just make sure to go slow for the closest shave possible, and make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before used.</li>
            <li> This my second one.  I was pleased with my first one so after some years it stopped charging.  I set out to find the same one for a guaranteed good item.  Would recommend it to all ladies young and older.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m going through a series of spine surgeries and regular shaving will be impossible for me to do.  Also, this is my first electric shaver so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to but I can tell you that I have super DUPER sensitive skin and there are areas that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain or I&#x27;d NEVER be able to wear a swim suit which sucks because you can&#x27;t really get a good shave.  With this... YOU CAN!  It&#x27;s AWESOME and doesn&#x27;t leave me with blemishes or any type of redness.  I do have to shave more frequently but it really doesn&#x27;t take much time.  I also get really bad itchy bumps on my shins and calfs when I shave with a regular razor and I don&#x27;t with this bad boy!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver.  My Wife has used it several times and is very satisfied with it.  She had been using a similar type shaver and claims this one is better.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  It is good value for the money. I do not use it wet, so I cannot comment on that.  Also, it is easy to clean.  Electric shavers won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but the Panasonic is so easy and fast that you don&#x27;t mind grabbing it often.</li>
            <li> only lasted a few months, quit working but it worked okay ..not the best closest shave but it was easy to use</li>
            <li> I had been hesitant to get a new electric razor - even though my old one (also panasonic) was on the fritz after about 8yrs of semi-regular use - because my first one never really got that close a shave and I hated spending money on a new one when my old one still &#x27;seemed&#x27; to work ok. I am SO glad i got this though. They&#x27;ve done a lot with this razor since my old one -- I can get a VERY close shave on my legs - almost as if i shaved for real (maybe 1 day of growth?) - in about half the time it took me with my old razor. I have super sensitive skin and shaving with a razor in the shower gives me crazy itchy skin once the hair starts growing back in. With this, i&#x27;m able to quickly shave my legs (i do it on dry skin), get a close enough shave that even if you&#x27;re up close/ touching me you wouldn&#x27;t know i didn&#x27;t just shave with a regular razor, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would not hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone else in my situation. Note that I only use this for my legs.</li>
            <li> My search for the best personal electric shaver ended when I purchased this Panasonic series. I love it!!!  No pulling hairs, no bumps, and talk about holding a single charge for ever!!! Seriously! After a full charge and body shave, it still last for 2 weeks without charging. This might sound weird, but because of this shaver, I am now excited when it is time to shave.</li>
            <li> This is horrible!!! It hurts so bad and it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using it dry or wet. I have sensitive skin when it comes to regular razors and get really bad razor burn, but honestly, I&#x27;d rather have razor burn than use this electric one. I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but be careful - it snags (ouch!!)</li>
            <li> I have cut myself more with this than with any hand shaver :( you have to keep the skin very tight or it snags your skin (OUCH!) the only plus over a hand shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t give you as much razor rash as a hand razor does, that is the only reason I still use it VERY CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> I bought a handheld Clio shaver from CVS when I saw it on sale and I really liked the convenience of having it around for a quick dry shave when I needed it. When that died, I thought there must be a better brand out there, so I looked at Amazon reviews and decided on this one. Right away it ripped my hairs out. I figured it might just take me time to learn to use it but no matter how lightly I pressed it would always end up ripping hairs out. It also often will catch on my skin and tear it open. It is pretty painful, much worse then a shaving nick. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product ,well made ,holds a charge a long time!</li>
            <li> Powerful clean shave. It&#x27;s simply easy to use, quick to charge, easy on the cleaning and reasonably priced. Will recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this electric razor!  My husband gave it to me last year, and at first I was hesitant.  Not sure I wanted to use an electric razor.  But now I love it, and it makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted for a close shave without the scratch and irritation.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this product is a total waste of money. worked fine for 4 months, i barely used it, may be once a month or so. i got may be 6 shaves and the battery stopped charing.  19 dollars of this? Panasonic, you should be ashamed of yourselves, or many be have your stuff MANUFACTURED BACK IN USA NOT CHINA, MAY BE THEN I WILL AGAIN BUY YOUR PRODUCTS!! WHAT A PATHETIC DISGRACE THESE GOOD AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE BECOME.</li>
            <li> the best one i&#x27;ve ever owned. i&#x27;ve had several, i&#x27;m just not a razor gal. this takes some serious abuse. i use it on my whole body. goes easily from my face to my legs, and i&#x27;m italian. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND RINSING WITH SOAP AND WATER AFTER EVERY USE. i&#x27;ve never met a razor that can stand up to it, this one can. had it for a few months, it works like a champ. can&#x27;t say enough good about it. i&#x27;d pay any price for this.</li>
            <li> Got one for Christmas but it stopped working not even a month after due to rust in the motor preventing vibration which causes the blades to move. Thought it may have just had a bad seal (only really got it wet when rinsing it) But since I liked it so much before it stopped working, I decided I&#x27;d try another to see if I just got a bad one. Had the new one for about a month now and so far so good however I&#x27;m very cautious not to get it wet even though I know it&#x27;s supposed to be wet/dry. If this one lasts, I&#x27;ll be very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> Very convenient. I HATE shaving so it&#x27;s nice to have something where I can just do a quick touch up and go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old girl.  She wanted to shave her legs but I was reluctant due to the safety risk of razors.  This is the perfect solution.  She uses it with a little body soap, can manage it herself and can clean it herself as well.  No worries for mom about cuts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Still hairs. I have to use this and then a regular razor</li>
            <li> I have Lipedema, which means any nick or cut, can cause chaos within my legs.  this shaver has been a godsend, very easy to use &amp; no risk of damage.</li>
            <li> This works way better than the one I was using.  Shaves close, holds charge for a while, good price.  Although, the mauve and lavender ones are a $10 price difference for the same razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver has worked pretty well in the short time I have had it.  It has retained a full charge very well, I have yet to recharge it since the first time (over 3 weeks ago) and I use it pretty often.  Its is pretty simple to clean as well.  My only complaint is that the area of the razor shaving area is a bit narrow compared to my previous razors.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and no nicks on my legs!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading everybody talk about the smooth shave.  I did not like how it made my legs feel, not smooth at all.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?  I do like the trimmer but while it was popped up, somehow the button got pushed down and now I can&#x27;t get the trimmer back down which I guess is okay since I&#x27;m not using it to shave anywhere else but it&#x27;d be nice to have that option.  Thinking I&#x27;ll have to return it.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves this shaver. She had this brand before but this model is perfect for her. Easy to clean. Nice smooth shave that I get to enjoy too.</li>
            <li> THE SHAVER WORKS GREAT! I PURCHASED FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER FOR MORE REASONS THEN ONE AND IT SHAVES CLOSELY AND IT IS MUCH SAFER THEN A REGULAR SHAVER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a razor anymore. But I doesn&#x27;t shave close to the skin. So it leaves bumps. And I would get bumps the next day just like a regular razor. I didn&#x27;t get cuts like on a razor though on the bright side. And it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Works great. Shaves close and cleans up very well. Holds a charge for a decent amount of time and options are nice to use.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Arrived quick  and works great for the price. I get horrible ingrowns from waxing and shaving. Not the closest shave like razor but no ingrowns!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at all. I was really disappointed by it. So hard to find decent electric razors for women.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2207 exceeded my expectations. As a single mom of an infant, I don&#x27;t have time to shave my legs in the shower every day. I wanted something I could use outside of the shower so I could keep an eye on him, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how close of a shave I would get with a dry shaver. I decided on this shaver after reading a few reviews, and I definitely made the right choice. It doesn&#x27;t provide a silky smooth result like a traditional razor, but it IS the next best thing! I can walk out the door without being embarrassed of my prickly legs. It takes less than five minutes to get rid of the stubble. I would absolutely recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, great price!  Very happy with purchase!  The customer reviews on this shaver are good!</li>
            <li> does not shave at all. I should have listened to the reviews that said not to buy it. thank you</li>
            <li> I just bought this razor, and it seems to work fine. But, there is one thing that isn&#x27;t clear in the description that might be helpful to know: the charger plugs into the socket, rather than sitting on the countertop (and plugging in with a cord). So, it&#x27;s not very discrete, with the razor attached to the wall. And, if your bathroom sockets are sideways, you&#x27;re not going to be able to use it. But, the instructions say it holds a charge for seven 3-minute shaves, so I suppose you wouldn&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> wife hasn&#x27;t tried it out yet like almost everything she gets got item super fast and was on time lol</li>
            <li> This works better than other shavers I tried.  Gives a clean shave.  My only complaint is the cost of new shaver blades.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this, it does a great job. My friend recommended it, I use it on my face and neck, no problem!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little shaver ever, does what I need it to do, I bought two one for my daughter and she also thinks its great. I will be ordering another one soon for my other daughter, can&#x27;t beat the cost and the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> Works very well - too new to evaluate the charging complaints found in other comments.  But I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter who wanted to shave but we didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with her using a true razor.  This does a great job for her needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  Good value and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works as described.  This will give you the close shave that you want with the versatility of using wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this electric shaver. I&#x27;ve owned several over the years, and this is the best.  I love that there is no power cord on the recharger.  You can plug it the cordless charger into an outlet, plug the shaver in to charge, and no cords are hanging down and the shaver isn&#x27;t falling over as in some other models.  Excellent close shaving for legs and underarms.  Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my old one I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to any bad reviews on this product because it works perfection.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and works well!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results this shaver provides. No, it&#x27;s not as close as a blade but I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself either (I take anticoagulants). I also appreciate the ability to use it outside the shower.</li>
            <li> Very handy when pressed for time, does the job</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Mom who is in her late 70&#x27;s as a gift and she loves this Womans Razor. Works very well and is exited to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these types of shavers will never get as close as a good razor, but when you&#x27;re in a hurry, it&#x27;s a life saver. You can use this one in the shower too. It works great on arms and legs. Holds a charge for a LONG time. For under $20, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this as a dry shaver.  It works pretty well on my legs but I did have some trouble when shaving under my arms.  Overall, I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This suited my needs perfectly. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a touchable shave, just something to maintain my legs in-between close shaves. The two trimmers on either side are great, and it gave me a great shave even dry.</li>
            <li> Very worthless product.  All this product does is trim the hair.  It does not give you a smooth feeling at all! I have used this razor once since i have bought it and havent used it again.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!! you still have to shave with a razor in the shower anyway!!!</li>
            <li> Used to use a cheapo less than $10 drugstore Clio razor which was okay but was useless for anything other than my arms and the soft hair on my thighs. Definitely wasn&#x27;t something that was a good replacement for razors. I have thick, coarse hair so it can be a pain to find products that work for me but don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin. I was tired of the in-grown hairs and razor burn from safety razors, tired of the time and money investment of waxing, and too sensitive for the chemical heavy hair removers. Saw the price for this one and decided to take the jump  and it definitely paid off. This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s compact, powerful, and has a charger that saves space. The battery lasts a very long time - right out of the box I was able to save my entire legs, bikini, underarms, and arms and still have charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that it takes a bit of maneuvering to shave the nethers with since this model comes with no bikini attachment, but it still did it&#x27;s job fine. A cord would be nice but take up space so if I ever decide to use it on the charger I can just go get one of the many extension cords in the house - it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic Ladies Razor and it is the best by far. Shaves closer and feels gentler than the earlier ones, and it costs less.</li>
            <li> It broke after the third time I used it.</li>
            <li> This shaver just stopped being able to charge, and died within a year.  The &#x27;warranty&#x27; is pretty useless, since it appears you have to pay for shipping both ways (and they might decide the damage is an &#x27;act of god&#x27; and not fix it at all, not kidding, it&#x27;s written word for word in the warranty).</li>
            <li> Worked well ... until it stopped working at all. Died a few months after I got it.</li>
            <li> Love this wet/dry shaver.  You can use it in the shower no problem.  It is really reasonable and a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I had higher expectations. It felt like it was burning my skin and it took two chunks out of my bikini line.</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor. Very gentle. Easy to use and clean. Seems to get most hairs the first time over.</li>
            <li> Works great. Don&#x27;t like small charger.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied! Works excellent both dry and wet. Close shave no nics or cuts. Cleans super easy and great too!! Holds a super long change as well.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice. No cord for charging, it has a plug for the razor that plugs directly into socket. I had to. Buy an adapter to plug it in so it would stand horizontal for charging.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic shaver before and lost charger, so I chose this as my replacement. I am so happy I bought another Panasonic shaver. I read other reviews and made my decision to stay with this brand and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old electric razor this one is heaven.  I mostly just use it on my legs and it glides easily across my skin and cuts the hairs quite closely.  I probably will never use the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; aspect of the razor because I&#x27;m just not comfortable with using an electrical appliance on wet skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for maybe one month before it broke. It didn&#x27;t work very well and took up a lot of space. Glad to be rid of it now.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, has not pulled any hairs, and is water safe. I did have to move it over some hairs several times to have them removed, but overall this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Yes, Yes, Yes this razor really is solid. I even use this myself (for facial shaves) it gives me a clean shave. My wife enjoys the bikini line and arm pits for this razor. She says it doesn&#x27;t do well in the calf area. This maybe because she goose bumps easily.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I ever used</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wife, sinch to setup and use. Plus no more razor burn!</li>
            <li> Great Shaver I love it</li>
            <li> Awesome. I&#x27;ve had this for about two months now and use it almost everyday . Great price and value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this shaver!  It&#x27;s too late to return it, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave close, my legs fell like 1-2 days stubble right after a very thorough shave, and it cuts my legs - now I have an infected gash.&lt;br /&gt;I would not get hurt any more than this with a blade razor, and at least I would get a close shave!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I bought an extra cutter assembly too :-(</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a dry electric razor that she could use to shave her legs outside of the shower. Keeping her balance on one leg has become too difficult at her age. She wanted to be able to sit safely in a chair and take her time shaving. So far, this has worked well. I did not realize it had different style trimmers for full shaving and more detailed grooming. The design is nice. Not too heavy. Batteries seem to last a long time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor for other senior women.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it&#x27;s doing pretty well so far. It handles the curves of my body quite well. The shave is close, but not always perfect (especially when I don&#x27;t take my time). As someone who gets ingrown hairs pretty easily, this is much better than using disposable razors. The fact that this device is water proof is also nice.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve found. Use wet or dry. Charges quickly</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my private area!</li>
            <li> I have really dark, coarse hair, very sensitive skin, and some weird skin issue that resulted from shaving with razors to the point my Dr. had told me to give up shaving altogether. (Uhm, hello... NOT going to happen!) This little gem gets almost as close to a razor shave as I have ever been able to manage, and I don&#x27;t get any of the resulting skin irritations that I once had.</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price!  It gives a close shave, and I haven&#x27;t gotten razor burn.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This has been a great investment. I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently had to start taking blood thinners after a medical event, and this was the product that I saw recommended most often for folks who have to avoid regular razors. It doesn&#x27;t always shave as closely as I would like, but it&#x27;s super-easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and is very simple to clean.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who is just starting to shave her legs. She has such sensitive skin that the dermatologist recommended getting an electric shaver. It serves it&#x27;s purpose for her 11 year old legs, but I don&#x27;t see it being effective for an adult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  not the closest shave ever,  sometimes pulls and is weird,  but using water helped.  Is helpful when i am having issues s with razor burn.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this for Christmas. At first I was a little puzzled as to getting a razor for Christmas. Was he trying to send me a message? But with all kidding aside I gave it a shot. After two months of almost daily use I have to say I am seriously impressed with this amazing little razor. First off I have to add I have PCOS and with that comes hair in places women shouldn&#x27;t have hair...the face. This has been a life saver in that area. I haven&#x27;t used it in water. I just use it as a dry razor for my face, legs, arms. Some times it can pull hairs a little but for the most part I am in LOVE with this little thing. I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it before.</li>
            <li> I have owned a few electric razors. This one is the first one I have ever had that didn&#x27;t give me razor burn! I have fair, sensitive skin, and I thought after buying the others that razor burn was to be expected...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price scare you off- I was concerned it would be cheaply made, but it is of better quality than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic of this model I have purchased. My first one was four years ago. I purchased a new one because the extendable &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; blade became dull and it is not replaceable. I replaced the inner blades once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a ridiculously lazy shaver! I hate shaving. I am also a ridiculously furry lady (yeah, I&#x27;m saying this on the world wide web). When the blades are at peak performance they give a remarkably close shave! The trimmer is great for the *bushier* areas and when you are a lazy shaver like I am and sometimes wait a couple weeks between shaves...months...stuff gets long...you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! The one fix I&#x27;d like to see is to be able to replace the trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> I loved the close shave. It was better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve bought over the years but it just stopped charging after only 4 months!  Now I&#x27;m in the middle of vacation and I can&#x27;t find a good shaver in the stores and have to buy on line.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t gotten a new razor in a long time and was nervous about ordering one on-line.  After reading the reviews, I did it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was  pleasantly surprised with the results from this shaver.  Most electric shavers for women do not work well at all.  Most leave a stubble.  This one works well on legs, not so good for underarms as it will bite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many shavers and so far this one is working out.  It keeps it&#x27;s charge and has so far lived up to its name because I have been able to successfully maneuver it closely over all my curves... (LOL)</li>
            <li> Works just like it says it does.  I&#x27;m just trying to figure out if I can just leave it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> This really cuts well and is very light in the hand. Surprised by how well it has performed. If you would like to have one of these electric razors for those quick trims, I would recommend this as you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Charge included. A little bulky on outlet, but works well.</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is the best razor ever. Purchased #2 just in case they stop making this style.</li>
            <li> I had looked and looked for a razor and after reading all the reviews on this one, I decided to purchase it.  I have diabetes and vascular issues in both of my legs.  My doctor had told me not to shave my legs, but I couldn&#x27;t stand having hairy legs.  I have used this razor on wet and dry legs and it works really well.  I know it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as a regular razor, but this one comes close.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the shaver does a good job dry !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed but the shave is not as close as a razor, but taking blood thinner means I need to avoid razors, so this will do.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter just began shaving her legs.  She tried my electric razor which is a Panasonic but an older version.  She felt secure with mine so I decided to get her one for Christmas.  Now that the box has been opened and the razor used by her, I can tell you it&#x27;s a nice razor.  It is exactly as described.  She is enjoying this razor and very glad to have it.  Delivery was fast, the razor is a nice pink (great for a girl), light weight and can be used wet or dry.  I highly recommend this razor.  It&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li> This shaver did a great job.  I liked the way it worked but it only lasted about two weeks before the charger stopped charging.  For some reason, I didn&#x27;t realize there was a time limit on returns with Panasonic. Christmas shopping on the net kept me busy and I forgot about the shaver.  When I finally remembered to try and return it, I discovered I was too late.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had very many, but this wonder of modern convenience blows the shavers of old out of the water.  First of all it detaches from the space-saving charger base/cord, seems to hold a charge for long periods, &amp; works fabulously in the shower or out.  Wet/dry &#x3D; easy carefree maintenance and cleaning.  I received this razor as a gift from my hubby mid winter, after letting my natural beauty grow far too wild.  This razor hummed through the toughest terrain I have ever had the misfortune of claiming.  Easy to use and effective.  Not as close/smooth of a shave as a straight razor, but easier &amp; more convenient to use, resulting in an attractive and comfortable shave anywhere &amp; anytime its needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife, the price was very good , it arrived on time. To say the least, she is very Happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for 2 years but used it only a handful of times for quick jobs. It worked ok as I guess dry shavers do... I&#x27;ve only used it dry,never wet use. 2 Years would have been a better review if I had used it more but it suddenly stopped charging. The red light is on so I know the charger works but the unit is dead.</li>
            <li> Burns. Not close shave</li>
            <li> Works great and made well!</li>
            <li> i got this razor to reduce razor bumps under my arms. it definitely gives me less bumps then a razor but i still have a few. but i would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> .Use daily, this is my 2nd one. Best for price!</li>
            <li> I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this product.  It does the job for me.  Now I will always use a rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  It does a very good job and fits in the hand quite well.  It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this great little electric shaver!  Works really well! So easy to use, and no cuts or nicks on my legs.</li>
            <li> Snags like a mother ######! When your damp from a shower! Beware! Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The shave could be a LITTLE better, but it is, after all, an electric.... nothing compares to an old-fashioned razor shave... But overall it&#x27;s a great razor! Holds a good charge and easy to travel with.... I love Panasonic shavers, and I try to stay loyal to the brand since it&#x27;s a great value for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great shaver.....definitely recommended. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these over the years.  They are not perfect, but compared to others I&#x27;ve tried they work very well.  I hope they are not discontinued because I expect to buy more in the future.  They do fail after a few years, as most things do, after all.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW (July 2, 2011): I was tired of getting razor burn from my cheap, disposable razors so I decided to ditch razors all together and get this instead after I saw it had good reviews. I have used it both wet and dry and in all honesty they both give just as good of a shave. It&#x27;s a nice close shave (surprisingly as close as a razor) without leaving me red bumps the next day. You do have to be careful because if you angle it the wrong way you may pinch your skin and bleed a little. I found out if you lay it flat against your skin as much as possible then you can avoid this though. It just takes getting used to, but it is well worth it. It really is a good razor and for only $22 (that&#x27;s how much I paid for it) it is not a bad deal at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that you don&#x27;t have to purchase batteries for this one. It recharges every time you plug it into your wall. The charge lasts for awhile as well. After I first charged it I shaved for maybe a total of 30 minutes so far and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ll probably be charging it up anyway just to be safe for my next shave in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW (January 17, 2012): Ok, this product went from 5 stars down to 1 star. I had this razor for LESS than 7 months and as of today it no longer works at all. I originally thought it was dead, so I attempted to charge it by plugging it into the wall like I always have. The red light lit up to signal that it was charging, so I left it there for 12 hours. After 12 hours of charging I took it out, only to discover that it did absolutely NOTHING when I put the power switch on. It is as if it is completely dead and done with. All I have to say now is that this razor was amazing while it lasted. My original 5 star review would have remained had it not died on me after only 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and not as limber as I used to be.  I always shaved in the shower but it was small and hard to do.  I now shave with this electric shaver before I shower and it works great!</li>
            <li> Wow! How easy!  There&#x27;s no longer an excuse to not shave your legs, ladies.  This shaver is great.  Easy! and FAST!  Just follow the directions and in 5 minutes or less, you&#x27;re done.  I haven&#x27;t owned an electric shaver since I was in high school....and quit shaving my legs regularly because I kept cutting myself.  Now, there&#x27;s no excuse, and I love this shaver.  It&#x27;s easy to clean too. Rechargable is a plus! No cord to deal with.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Mother in law needed something reliable, and easy to handle, it shipped quickly and she likes the way it works. Recommended was a good purchase</li>
            <li> I waited to do my review after having it for a while. I have been using it for over a year now and it is fantastic. It holds a charge for a long time and recharges just as good as it did when I first charged it up. I am glad I read reviews on several razors before making my decision. It was very affordable and lived up to my expectations and hopes.</li>
            <li> This razor is u believable and the best razor I have ever had!Husband got for me in August of 2014. Gave it a full charge and have used it at least twice a month on legs and arms and is STILL RUNNING on the original charge!It is so smooth you cannot even tell is shaving yet does an excellent job!Still cant believe it!!Will never buy another kind of razor!!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. I don&#x27;t know what everyone else expects to get out of an electric razor but it obviously isn&#x27;t going to get you waxing smooth. I have very sensitive skin and legs so I always hate using these things for the first time thinking it will burn me or something... and this one never does. I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry. I used it while pregnant because shaving is too much of a chore at 9 months pregnant but not with this! In just a few minutes I&#x27;ve got smooth legs and don&#x27;t feel like chewbacca when I go to my OB appointments. My Mom used it when she was at my house and enjoyed it so much she wanted her own. At $16.99 you cant beat this price.</li>
            <li> I ordered Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve&lt;br /&gt;by Panasonic from Amazon. I like it but the Remington WDF 7000 is better, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. The Panasponic shaver works well but is not as gentle around my ankles as the Remington shaver. This Panasonic shaver is much better (and price is lower) than the Panasonic shavers with heads (razor part) that move.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and cheaper than disposable and other manual razors</li>
            <li> A good strong razor that holds a charge, does the job nicely, and is easy to clean. Glad I found it; my last razor had to be kept plugged in all the time and quit working after a year. This one looks to do the job for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using the model for several years now.  I would recommend using it while fully charged to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is an very good shaver.  I am glad I purchased it.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet but it does a great job dry.</li>
            <li> after reading a ton of reviews i opted to get this one. i&#x27;m happy with my choice, i&#x27;m even buying another for a gift. i use mine to dry shave my legs. it gives a close enough shave where you can barely feel stubble. the plastic edges do not scrap your leg when pressing down like some people complained about with the Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve . i needed a razor that was sensitive enough to shave without causing the horrible red bumps i got after giving birth. all straight razors made the bumps worse but since using this i the bumps have gone away. the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it plugs directly into the charger that plugs into the wall. its kind of weird having my razor standing straight up from my outlet but i&#x27;ll get used to it. you have to position the razor just right on the charger to make sure its getting charged. the light will let you know when its in the right position.</li>
            <li> Great product for trimming</li>
            <li> For some reason there are very few women&#x27;s electric razors to be had in my town. I bought the only one I could find, a Remington, &amp; it barely shaved at all &amp; tore up my skin. This Panasonic is great, especially for the price. I had one of these before that I bought locally that lasted quite a few years but couldn&#x27;t find one to replace it. Glad I found this one on line.</li>
            <li> battery has short duration</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is a very good little shaver, for a very small price.  It shaves close enough, and the charge lasts long enough for several shavings of my legs.  The only drawback with this shaver is that it has no cord - you plug the recharger directly into the socket and the shaver directly into the recharger.  This is a drawback for me because all but one of the outlets in my home are horizontal, not vertical.  I can only  charge it in that one outlet.  I tried using an extension cord, but that was unsatisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small inconvenience, though, and doesn&#x27;t affect my rating.</li>
            <li> I had breast cancer surgery a few weeks ago. Because of the lympnode dissection I can no longer use real shaver on my right arm or underarm. I shaved one underarm in the shower with my real shaver. Then I used the electric shaver for the arm I had surgery on. Honestly they look almost the same. Then I used them on my legs. Very good shave. Like other reviewers said it wont be as close as a real shaver but nobody can tell. I plan to use this every day. As some one with cancer the convience of this product is awesome. My beauty routine has changed &amp; I am so glad I made this purchase. I would reccommend a small remmington facial shaver for stray hairs. It can be easier then going over the same area over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews of electric razors, I found that this one was considered the best. Well, if this is the best, I&#x27;d hate to see what all the others are like. I bought this razor to save money and plastic instead of buying disposables. Now I regret that I did. It shaves okay in certain places, such as my legs, but I have to go over an area a few times to shave it all the way down. On top of that, no matter where I shave it tugs on the hairs and hurts. On my armpits, it shaved off skin! The trimmer does absolutely nothing, you&#x27;re better off using the actual razor no matter what you&#x27;re shaving. I&#x27;ll be getting rid of this as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> The razor, while it worked, was great - shave is not as close as a razor, but it sufficed, no nicks or cuts, and it worked great dry. My only complaint is the battery. Seven months and two weeks after I bought it, it died completely. Won&#x27;t make a noise, won&#x27;t take a charge. Granted, it&#x27;s not an expensive razor, but I&#x27;d at least expected a year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but it works extremely well, gets a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It was well shipped and arrived incredibly fast.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Your feelings about this product will depend on your expectations. Know going in that it will not replace a bare razor and it will work for you. If you need a quick shave but don&#x27;t want to worry about cutting yourself while doing it, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics:&lt;br /&gt;-Dry hurts. It pulls and pinches on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Wet hurts a lot less but doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave. I&#x27;m guessing water causes it to just slide over a lot hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-Cream/gel/foam just blocks the blades. It&#x27;s too thick for the head to grab the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-Plain soap seems to offer the best shave. No pain and the head can grab the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember co-opting my late grandfather&#x27;s electric razor (dry only) back in high school. It too pinched and gave a good but not great shave. I&#x27;ve deducted one point because electric razors haven&#x27;t improved in 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> I am on blood thinners and was told to switch from blades to an electric shaver.  I purchased this after reading other reviews. It is okay for what it is. Except for using creams, I doubt that anything is as good as a blade for getting a smooth shave. This does work well enough that I will continue to use it as long as needed and is good for a quick shave if you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting much.  It was cheap and I was sick of using a razor and cutting myself.  I love it!  The shave is much closer when used dry (not as close as a razor, but close enough to wear shorts for a few days).  It was close enough of a shave to feel smooth and soft the first day.  I hope it lasts a while, but at this price I would still save if i had to buy it three or four times a year.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for some time and it lasts and does the job.  I just feel like it makes my hair grow back faster than it does with a disposable and that may not make sense but its just my opinion.</li>
            <li> She had a razor but would complain about it catching and not getting as close.  I got this after reading all the other reviews and she said she likes this much better than her other one.  This is her favorite so far, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Great product. Very pleased with this product. No pain no raches after used. Can recommend it to others</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade razor, but it is fine with me for what I need now.</li>
            <li> For the record, I&#x27;ve only used it once so if anything changes in the near future, I&#x27;ll be sure to change my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it came already charged so that was a surprise to me. It looked clean so I don&#x27;t think it had been used and repackaged or anything, and I examined it really closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaved my legs very well. Not ultra-smooth like you&#x27;d expect from a regular razor or from waxing, but good enough to last a day or two depending on how picky you are about prickly legs. I think it did as well as I&#x27;d expect from an electric shaver. I tried it briefly on my underarms but my skin didn&#x27;t agree with it--not tight enough maybe? I had no chance at getting it smooth that way so I just used a regular razor in the shower for my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaved my private area extremely well. No nicks or cuts. It pulled a little on the longer hair even after I trimmed it, but that was to be expected from something like this. It helps to go with the grain rather than against it at first. Overall, it did a very smooth job down there--the best I can get without waxing and without risking the Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the charger had a cord rather than plugging right into the wall. My electrical outlets in the bathroom are horizontal rather than vertical. I figured out that I can still plug it in that way with the razor charging, but I think it probably puts stress on the little prongs that go into the razor so I probably won&#x27;t do that again, but find another outlet somewhere else in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small white plastic-ish bag to put it in (the charger doesn&#x27;t fit with it in there), so that was better than nothing which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 8/16/2016**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came on Amazon to look for another electric razor since this one is almost dead. It barely keeps enough charge to do one full leg anymore. I was hoping it would last more than a few years. And since it looks like this isthe &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; one you can get, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy another one or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried using an electric shaver many years ago, and quickly tired of it, because of how poorly it worked. Since then, I&#x27;d gone back to a regular razor and shaving cream. Eventually though, this also wore me down, so I decided to research different ways to shave my legs, which brought me to this electric shaver here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was remarkably easy to use, and the pop-up attachment for longer hair makes getting hard to reach areas a breeze. I was able to quickly shave both my legs while sitting down, using the dry setting -- it cut my shaving time at least in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from eczema and very sensitive skin; four days after my first shave with this device, my legs didn&#x27;t feel nearly as itchy or dry as they normally do after shaving with a regular razor. They also were less nicked than usual, which definitely helped to lessen some of my skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the instructions carefully, this device here should make shaving so much easier! The fact that the price is so reasonable is also a definite bonus, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest qualm with the shaver is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to clean. I&#x27;ve rinsed it a few times and there&#x27;s still little bits of hair in the device. I&#x27;m going to try giving it a proper cleaning later and see it it helps any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely satisfied with the many types of Panasonic products that I have purchased over the years and that is why is decided to order this particular shaver for my wife.  Once again, I was not disappointed!  According to my wife, it is \\&quot;terrific\\&quot; and \\&quot;works like a charm\\&quot;.  There you have it! Thank goodness there are still some quality companies still out there that shoppers can rely upon time and time again!</li>
            <li> I have winter dry skin- It starts itching in October and continues through March at least.  The worst thing for the itch was razor shaving- so this year I decided no more razor shaving my legs in the winter, though after using my old Ladies Remington (the one with the purple trim) I wasn&#x27;t sure I could stick with it.  I kept going over and over my legs with the Remington and couldn&#x27;t get a close shave.  It missed random hairs too.  Ugh.  I bought this shaver, and I LOVE it- I quickly get a shave nearly as close a razor can and my legs don&#x27;t itch like mad after I&#x27;m done.  I have NOT tried it wet, but its so good dry I can&#x27;t imagine needing to use it in the shower.  Holds a charge well and the shaver stands on top of charger that plugs into the wall so you don&#x27;t lose valuable vanity space.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update during the coldest week of the year- my legs have been far, far less itchy than usual during the winter.  I think its due to the razor, or to the lack of razor shaving.  Best $20 I have spent in a while- yay!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and for those lazy days when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving with a blade I use this and it&#x27;s just as good.  It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I use this more then a razor.</li>
            <li> I had another Panasonic​ and it did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> This razor is great does everything I wanted it for.  The charge seems to last a long time also.  I am in California so needed to cut down drastically on shower time so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.  It gives me a very close shave without the irritation of razor burn.  I love the cordless wall charger design.  The shaver sits on the charger saving much need counter top space.  It works great for a quick leg shave at the last minute and gets close enough to give a day after shaving feel. It also works great for bikini line (has a pop up trimmer that works well for this) and underarm hair.  It also can be used in the bath or shower as a wet razor with no shaving cream needed.  I would recommend that it be used on relatively short hair otherwise it can tend to pull.  But as of today I have had no cuts or razor burn with this product and have used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming private areas, without razor burn or cuts.  Keeps its charge for a long, long time (months!). Haven&#x27;t tried using it in the shower yet, but I prefer to use it dry. No need for lotions or shaving creams or having to clean up the mess after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for men&#x27;s parts as well, I&#x27;m told by the males in my household who requested their own, and well enough that they didn&#x27;t care that it only came in pink.</li>
            <li> excellant for shaving legs very easy to handle</li>
            <li> My wife loves this inexpensive shaver and uses it mainly for her legs! She really likes that it is rechargeable and so far so good!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is awesome for the price. I expected it to be just so-so because it is so inexpensive but It is a great little shaver.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet but as a dry shaver ti does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect! We r very happy ! Thank u very much!  We like it a lot. And yes, we recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i waited for years to find the right one and i think i finally found it.. does all i ask of a razor and is easy to use and clean.  not a very close shave for those who want no stubble.. but ive only used it once and used it dry.. next time i will try wet shave.. but for an old women it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;i like the fact that they give parts ordering info leaflet also.. so i can replace parts if need be.  and for the price, i think it does the job well..&lt;br /&gt;also i like the angle tilt of the razor itself.. easy fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet. It doesn&#x27;t shave smooth to the skin but it&#x27;s enough in between shaving. It takes a long time to charge though (12 hours) and only last 10 good minutes until it weakens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.  Have only used it dry so far.  It works smoothly and is very gentle on the skin.  Great product, great value!</li>
            <li> I take an anticoagulant and I was continually plagued with small nicks turning into never-clotting bleeds.  So, I thought I would give the electric razor another shot.  I have bought them in the past and they simply didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES2207P was a tremendous surprise.  It works great. Like others have noted it doesn&#x27;t give you quite the smoothness that a regular blade razor would provide, but it&#x27;s close enough.  And...I&#x27;m no longer have legs laced with bandaids.  Bravo, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the value. It didn&#x27;t shave as close as I had expected, but I used it again after a shower and got a much closer shave. This razor can be used in the shower, but I haven&#x27;t tried that. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and it keeps a good charge that allowed me to shave both my legs entirely on the same charge. If you suffer from razor bumps, this may not be the electric razor for you. I was hoping to have better results with that based on the reviews I had read before deciding to purchase this product. It believe most women with normal skin/hair would be very happy with this razor. I happen to have extra sensitive skin and coarse hair that tends to become ingrown. If you suffer from the same shaving/skin problems, I would not recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Great price too.  I like being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and lasts quiet awhile.  This is my third.  After a 2 years the batteries did not hold a charge long.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick shave when you don&#x27;t want to break out another razor.  Not as close has a non-electric, but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the wife she loves it.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks and feels good. My wife did not complain about its performance while it worked... Bought it 5 months ago, does not work anymore. Yes, it is under warranty but I have to pay to pack and ship it back for repair or replacement. My experience with Panasonic has been that they make quality stuff so either my shaver is an unusual circumstance or this is the result of purchasing one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; lady shavers...</li>
            <li> Pregnancy is a bummer. Bending over sucks, getting in and out of the tub sucks. And then it was spring and I really needed to shave my legs. I used my husbands electric razor a couple of times and decided to get my own. So I ordered this shaver. Being able to sit in a chair with my feet up and shave makes life so much easier. I&#x27;ve only ever used it dry and have had no problems with nicks. It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it does a good enough job to get rid of the appearance of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to recommend it to all my pregnant friends. And once the baby is here it means I can do a quick shave without showering if I need to. I like that so many of the parts are replaceable. The reviews say the shaver doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ve only had it over a month now, but I think the convenience for this time in my life has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> Did the job after hip replacement when I couldn&#x27;t use a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I tend to get ingrown hairs on my legs when I shave with a razor - not pretty!  Gets 5 stars for this purpose - no more unsightly bumps (though not as close a shave, but that&#x27;s why it works).  Works well for underarms too.  However, though I have tried various methods of using this shaver on my bikini line (with and without cream/gel/soap, pulling my skin taught, various angles, etc.), it still nicks me every time.  The trimmers on either side of the foil grab my skin and cuts me - not pleasant at all.  I have given up trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: lasted about a year, then died on me.</li>
            <li> My skin never gets irritated when I use this! It&#x27;s great in a pinch when I don&#x27;t feel like getting in the shower to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I found this hard to use with wet skin. It works way better with damp skin, at first I was not happy with it until I used it after my shower and it works great</li>
            <li> My teen step daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> best women&#x27;s electric razor I have tried!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; yet, but it does a far better job than my previous elec razor.</li>
            <li> I loved my Remington until I bought this.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a wet shaver, only as a dry one - but it works very well.  The two things I love about it the most are that it&#x27;s (relatively) quiet, and it really does a great job.  I&#x27;m blonde and it gets rid of the light blonde peach fuzz-like hair, which the Remington had trouble with.  For that alone, the Remington bids me adieu.</li>
            <li> It works very well on me. No problem at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ES2207P since early 2013, and let me tell you, after having used this WONDERFUL product dozens of times, it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using a disposable razor and shaving cream. It&#x27;s very gentle when I use it on my arms, armpits and even on my face (when I have to remove that unwanted &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;). The shaver&#x27;s square-shaped recharger is also great; whenever necessary, I can just plug it into any outlet with the shaver installed on top of it. I&#x27;ve often traveled with this excellent shaver-in fact, a good friend of mine gave me the PERFECT silver-colored cosmetic pouch into which this product fits EXTREMELY WELL (much better than the thin white carrying bag that originally came with the packaged product!!). Anyway, if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for an excellent shaver, look no further than the Panasonic ES2207P. You&#x27;ll be VERY GLAD you did!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this just over two years a go. Worked great until a week a go. No longer holds a charge no matter how long you recharge it. Sadness</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good, it&#x27;s easy to handle, i&#x27;ve use it in wet areas and it had works excelent,it&#x27;s bring you a shave complete with just a once, you must to take care of surfering a cut because it&#x27;s powerfull, in my case it happened. But is just to take care cause i think is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this product, I ordered it.  I find it as others have; that it is good for removing facial hair, and easy on the skin.  It holds a charge for weeks, and the charge base is so small it takes up no room at all to store.  It comes with a brush for cleaning.  This shaver is very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic razor which will shave your legs just fine.  It doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as a disposable but it also doesn&#x27;t cut your skin.  My problem with it is that you almost need a dedicated outlet for it.  You plug the base unit into an outlet, but it is so big that you cannot plug anything else in.  Then the razor sits on top of the base and charges.  (Unless like my house, some idiot put all of the outlets in upside down, which renders this useless.)  I found a way to charge mine and I like it very well.  It is handy to have around for quick shave and just to look pretty.  I love mine.</li>
            <li> I get razor burn really bad especially on my upper legs and bikini line.  I have tried many razors and none help with this problem.  I absolutely love this razor.  I have no razor burn at all.  The only negative I would say it has is that it obviously does not cut the hair as close to the body as a normal razor.  This does not bother me at all because I no longer have to put up with painful razor burn.  Buy this product you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> It shaves close and fits in your hand.  I tried some men&#x27;s shavers at the discount stores and they wouldn&#x27;t even shave my legs.  This one shaves perfectly, fits well in the hand while your using it and you don&#x27;t have to keep plugging it in all the time.  I keep it in the drawer and forget about it but it still works when I need it.  Of course if you use it everyday, I would plug it in more often. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several months ago and LOVE IT!  I have never found an electric shaver that would cut leg hair until now!  Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as traditional razors, but is very convenient for a quick job. My skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry either!  I liked mine so much that I ordered a spare plus 3 more for gifts!</li>
            <li> Love mine...got one for my DIL and daughter!</li>
            <li> Might be the perfect bush mower.</li>
            <li> Just got this razor last night, and for the price I am Very impressed! Other reviewers complained about it catching and pulling the hair quite a bit which I noticed as well! However, it wasn&#x27;t fully charged either... so I stopped using it and let it charge overnight before using it again which made a Huge difference! So if you want to avoid the pulling, make sure it&#x27;s fully charged! (it also helps to use shaving cream! Especially when shaving your bikini line!) It gives a great close shave, both wet and dry. I did have to go over some spots on my legs a couple times, but I had to do that with a regular razor anyways. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it seems to die pretty quickly... it doesn&#x27;t come to a full stop but the power is noticeably lower within 10 minutes of using it. I would absolutely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> This shaver is so much better than the old Lady Remington I had. I had a mastectomy and some of the literature you get afterwards recommends a lady&#x27;s electric shaver instead of using a razor since your skin is numb and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to feel a razor cut. It&#x27;s perfect all around!</li>
            <li> Works great so far, only used it a few times, but way better than a razor.</li>
            <li> this is the only women&#x27;s shaver that actually cuts well. I love it. And the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t scratch or scrape my skin!  I like it better than any I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s economical.  Love this one.  My last one needed to be replaced, and I tried another band.  I used it once, then went online to find this one again.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I ordered this! I tried an electric razor years ago &amp; it didn&#x27;t work well, but this one is amazing &amp; a good price. If your leg hairs are long then be sure to clip them first before using the main foil &amp; you will get a smooth shave. It&#x27;s not as smooth as a regular razor but it&#x27;s still close. It&#x27;s like the day after shaving with a regular razor, if that makes any sense. Also, you don&#x27;t have to press hard at all, just let it glide over your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Closest shave I have ever had without using an actual razor. Love the wall charger that comes with it too. I would recommend this razor to any women.</li>
            <li> Very impressed, smooth shave considering it&#x27;s an electric razor. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> As an extremely hairy lady also gifted with pale and sensitive skin I have spent a significant amount of my life worrying about hair removal. Using even the nicest ladies&#x27; razors on my upper legs or bikini area gives me nightmare red bumps, itching, and awful ingrown hairs. I finally purchased this 15 years into my battle with the hairs and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I very rarely use my regular razor or wax anymore. This gets pretty close, definitely not as close as a razor, but good enough for me. I can use it on my thighs and bikini area and I only itch a little bit, NOTHING like what a razor does to me! I can finally wear shorts again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few tips- I have coarse dark hair and found that the shaver works much better on dry skin. Also, go slowly, especially if your hair is longer, to avoid getting pulled on and to consistently trim the hairs down.</li>
            <li> I got this on Saturday, plugged it in to charge sometime that day, for benefit of doubt, Saturday evening.  here it is Monday evening TWO DAYS later, and the charger light is still showing red!  what gives?  if it is still red when I wake up Tuesday morning, I will try using it anyway, but am not too confident that the problem is only the charger light and that it will actually work.</li>
            <li> I like this protect a lot. I do have one question??? I don&#x27;t have a dock to charge both the razor and the charger. Can I charge the charger first then charge the razor???</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly, would buy agian</li>
            <li> Not even a month yet and this product had already died and is not working.</li>
            <li> Great product that is easy to charge and holds the charge for several uses.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great value for this shaver.  Works well wet and dry.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well and gives a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the charger is a small cube that plugs directly into a socket.  If you don&#x27;t have a socket in a convenient location, you have to jury-rig an extension cord so that the charger can stand on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> Disposable razors are getting so expensive these days.  I had a \\&quot;Lady Remington\\&quot; back in the 1980&#x27;s that got lost in one of my many moves.  After growing tired of shaving in the shower and somehow running out of razors, I researched electric ones and after reading the reviews, bought this after it went on sale.  So glad I did.  For the price I just paid for an 8 pack of Venus at Costo, I have this.  The Close shave and no little bumps.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair skin, and disposable razors have always given me horrible razor burn.  I switched to electric razors a few years ago, but was disappointed with the two I used because they never got my legs as smooth as disposables.  They looked smooth, but they always felt like there was still some stubble there, even with an expensive razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this one today and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gets my legs just as smooth as disposable razors with NO razor burn!  When I started using it I could actually FEEL that I was getting a closer shave, and now my legs feel so smooth I can&#x27;t stop rubbing them!  I&#x27;m very impressed that I could get such a smooth shave with such a low cost razor.  My previous razor cost more than twice as much and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also holds a charge long enough for me to completely shave without it starting to die toward the end, like my previous razors did.  So I get a smooth shave from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I saw someone else mention, if you have sensitive skin, make sure you shave slowly with this razor.  It does tend to catch your skin if you go too fast, but it doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or razor burn on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive, fair skin like me, and you want a smooth shave without razor burn, BUY THIS RAZOR.  I guarantee you will love it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, easy recharge &amp; does a good job. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have troubles shaving my legs due to my back. I got this razor due to the reviews. I used it the day I got it. I was very happy with how close it shaved and how it preformed in the shower. I would tell anyone that needs an electric razor to get the Panasonic ES2207P Curves. The shave is great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This gives me a good shave and it&#x27;s always charged because I put it right back on the charger after I use it. Get it.</li>
            <li> I have used electric women&#x27;s razors for probably 25-30 years -- and they sure have come a long way over the decades.  These newer ones have much more comfortable shaves, and are contoured to fit your hand and your crevices!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Panasonic ES2207P a couple weeks ago, and am truly pleased with its performance.  I immediately had to go on a five-day trip, so my new razor hit the trail with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the compact charger:  It was very convenient to be able to use the little wall charger/base (no long cord, no remote base, no batteries to purchase) and see him sitting on the wall next to the hotel sink in the mornings.  I actually remembered to take him with me when I left the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:  It performs well.  If your legs are DRY when you dry shave, he quickly and efficiently mows down all the stubble in one pass.  If you are wet shaving (I like using a bit of hair conditioner for an inexpensive shave base), he glides along and gets even the little invisible hairs that normally get missed with a disposable, wet cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nooks &amp; crannies:  He very gently maneuvers into the most delicate of locations and without pinching can tidy up satisfactorily.  I will leave it \\&quot;at that.\\&quot;  (Let me mention that you need to pull the skin taunt to keep from pinching soft, thin, or delicate skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to electric razors -- this is a wonderful, inexpensive model to try out! At the worst, you are out $20 and can give it to your sister...&lt;br /&gt;If you are an experienced electric razor user -- then this is one of the best models I&#x27;ve used at a surprisingly low price.  I&#x27;ve purchased the super-expensive models in the past, hoping for better performance and longevity, and have always been disappointed in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade \\&quot;Close Curves\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased razors like this before and have never been impressed by how close they can shave, so I used it as an emergency, \\&quot;yikes! I need to shave fast\\&quot; razor. This razor is so good, and shaves so closely, it&#x27;s now my first choice every time. It&#x27;s just as good as hand shaving with a store bought razor; and a whole lot faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for either about or a little over six months. So far -- the aforementioned is fine. However I may need to replace the blade, because it&#x27;s somewhat dull. Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this electric razor as a dry shaver as opposed to a wet shaver. Concerning the seller: The electric razor was new and in sealed packaging. Also, the shipping time was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these (3) in the past 5 years.  They last a few months (less than 24 on average) and I have to replace.  They all have the same issue so it is a DESIGN DEFECT.  The on off switch stops working.  I turn it on and it never comes on.  If I let it sit in on position for a few minutes, it comes on.  Then it stops working altogether.  I will NOT buy another.  When it works, its great but they should last more than a year or so....</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to hold and does a good job.  The razor sits upright on the recharger, which must plug into a vertical outlet.  All my bathroom outlets are horizontal so I have to find an outlet in another room to charge it.  That&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance to me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit after careful review of all the other AMAZON reviews but alas, I got lousy results. Lots of stubble. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> ok.... It has a clean cut, it is wonderful if you don&#x27;t have time to take a shower. It does not give you razor burn too.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is it is kind of loud, but it is an electric razor. It is awesome to be out of water. I am kind of scared to bring it in the shower though. You know how the electric in water thing is. But it works just fine out of water.</li>
            <li> I would have chosen it 5 stars but I&#x27;ve had it less than 2 months and it won&#x27;t charge anymore. I got a pretty close shave with zero nicks or cuts. I used it about once per week. I charge it for 12 hours before the day I need to use it and then take it off. When I saw all of the reviews regarding it not charging. I thought I was being extra careful to not over-charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a similar model by Panasonic and was able to continue using that one almost 2 years before it died. I was going to get this as a gift for my sister as a first shaver, but I would feel bad if I gave it to her and it stopped working a month later.</li>
            <li> Such a great everyday electric razor! The price can&#x27;t be beat. Way cheaper than having to buy regular razors all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews. I came back to review myself. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for the first time this week. I haven&#x27;t shaved since summer and realized it was time to tackle the forest emerging from my armpits. This had some great settings, allowing for me to first trim the longer hair, then give myself a nice close shave for the remainder. The results were smooth with no problems with ingrown hair. I used it in the shower and it worked great. The charger is small and much more convenient than the old rechargeable shaver I had before. And the shave is much closer than the previous one too. The only thing you have to watch with this shaver is that it does cut pretty close, so you have to be careful not to nick yourself. I almost cut a little too close at times. Besides that though I love it. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> light and nice. I will love it</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s hard to believe she&#x27;s reached that age already!  My granddaughter LOVES this shaver.  It comes with a wall charger unit that it clicks right into with ease, which is perfect for her.  This is the perfect gift for the budding young lady!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this electric shaver eleventy billion stars. It is so great I ran back to my amazon and purchased one for each of mys sisters. I have tried other shavers etc and none have worked as great this. When you actually factor in the cost of buying disposable razors and blades this shaver is dirt cheap. Get one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect electric razor!</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it saves me time and makes shaving quick and simple!  I have bought razors in the past that did not last, and did not work well, but this razor has met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Remington electric razor fan but this Panasonic puts them to shame!  The charge lasts a really long time which I need for my long legs.  I love the compact recharging station as well that plugs right into the outlet.  No cords.  Some razors I have tried in the past do not do well with more than a day&#x27;s worth of hair growth but this one cuts the long and short hairs with ease and no pulling.  It also shaves the difficult knee area really well with very few passes.  You also do not have to press the head to your leg hardly at all.  It&#x27;s like it floats over the surface.  For any woman who shaves with an electric razor exclusively like me this is a great product.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Using it on my mustache and chin, the hair takes a little longer to come back without any irritation. Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews, I choose to purchase this ladies shaver.  My main purpose&lt;br /&gt;of purchasing  the shaver was that we RV camp and don&#x27;t always have water or sewer hook up available so I needed a shaver like this.  I found it to work very well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but its super gentle on sensitive skin and has consistent results and cleans easy</li>
            <li> Great product.  The battery charge lasts a long time.  I got this because I get severe razor burn from shaving my legs when wet, and I always thought it would be so much easier to find a way to &amp;#34;dry shave.&amp;#34;  I use this dry (not in the shower), and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gets a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have used it everywhere (every part of my body) and it&#x27;s easy to clean as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I;ve had this shaver for about a half a year now. In the beginning it seemed really good. Great alternative to razors. But after a couple months, the blades started to pull hairs and it didnt cut as close as before. Plus I dropped it in the shower a few times and cracked the foil. I do understand the need of replacements but i dont even know if it&#x27;s worth it considering such low price. Might as well just get another one. Might try the Swivel headed one next. Overall: Decent product.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before now, as I never thought it could do what I wanted it to. After some careful research and comparison, I decided to buy the Panasonic ES2207P. I&#x27;m amazed! I had no idea that an electric razor can do what it does! This is something I think every lady should have in her boudoir. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long in life without one!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Can I just say how amazing this product is!!!! I have thick dark hair on my legs and this shaver does as good of a job as my husbands $150 shaver!!!! You must have some patience and go over the areas a couple of times, but if you do it right it leaves you with legs as smooth as a razor shave. I have read a ton of reviews stating it does not leave a close shave, but if you do it RIGHT it will leave a close shave! No more cuts on my legs!! So excited!!!!! No more expensive VENUS razors!!!!! WEEEEEEEE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my daughter a year ago, and was pleased by the design. It is a rare find -cheap but smooth enough to shave underarms. While it worked, it worked very well. Her shaver stopped charging about 9 months after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own shaver stopped working-and I was kind of glad because even though I paid almost $40 for it, it would scratch me so I could not shave my underarms with it- and the foils would tear and had to be replaced often (it was a [[ASIN:B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I would take a chance and buy the same one my daughter had, because maybe that was a fluke and the next one would last longer. It is cheap, so if we get a year out of it, that would be worth it. It worked very well on legs, I have a tendency for ingrown hairs, but this shaver did not cause any problems, and shaving my very delicate underarms was a dream--no scratches, no ouches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, 45 days later it just stopped working. Would not turn on at all, could not charge it. I tried the charger in a different outlet, but no go. I dug out my daughters old charger, but that did nothing either. It was completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Amazon has a very good return policy, electronics being returned after 30 days only get 80% reimbursement, and I have to pay for the shipping. The item has to be in its complete original packaging- which, fortunately I had kept. I am not sure what the shipping will cost, but I am sending it back on principal if nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy this, good luck. If you can recommend a different shaver that works well on underarms, please let me know. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The last electric razor I bought was 10 years + ago in Germany in duty free.... another panasonic I thought was very good.  However, my underarms do not get a close shave with the electric and a non electric irritates them too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Panasonic ES2207P rechargeable gets my underarms shaved very close and smooth, as well as the bikini line, and no irritation. I used it on dry, powdered underarms.  I may give up waxing down THERE....! well, at least my underarms are smooth and happy.  I am very happy with this product and am ordering another one for my vacation home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also ordered the Conair LW D375WCSV Satiny Smooth Ladies Wet/Dry rechargeable, charged it and tried it another day.  If I had not ordered and tried the Panasonic I would be happy with the Conair.  I think, however, that the Panasonic is the best of the two.... with the closest shave and least irritation.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Finally a great functioning razor FOR WOMEN....im very satisfied,will buy again!</li>
            <li> Should have bought one of these handy shavers years ago.  Does just what I need and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  Haven&#x27;t used wet...no need so far</li>
            <li> Not as close shaving as I hoped. Workes well though.</li>
            <li> This does what I bought it for: gives me a quick and easy way to touch up legs when I haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully shave. I didn&#x27;t expect it to give as close a shave as my regular razor so I&#x27;m no disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received this and have only used it once, but I love it!!  I have dark, thick hair and was able to get close shave in very little time.</li>
            <li> This is really not good at all if you have any hair that is even remotely lengthy.. and I mean like half an inch or so. I had a wet/dry a while back and it was great, I was hoping this one would perform as well but it falls very short.</li>
            <li> Pulls the hair and hurts</li>
            <li> A+ product. works well and this is easy to clean. I use on my legs, under arms, I have not used on the bikini line as yet, I am sure this will work perfect. compare to a straight razor this is so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with or without shaving creams or water. It&#x27;s easy to detach the head for cleaning. It&#x27;s all around a good item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I hate it - I just can&#x27;t use it. It didn&#x27;t say anywhere in the item description that it was 120V. I needed it for outside the US, where voltage is 240V. It would have been helpful, if there were an indication of voltage in the product info.</li>
            <li> You  have to go over the same spot over and over.  Not as great as it seems .  Ill stick to a razor</li>
            <li> It is the close to getting a close shave and works so easy and was as described and had fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wow!  Works great.  I never thought I would use an electric razor again but this one is perfect.  Close shave.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this changed my life.  I&#x27;ve always done wax, epilating, shaved with disposables, and depilatories, but shaver just changed my life.  I&#x27;m not longer afraid to knick myself and I don&#x27;t need shaving cream.  I use it for my underarms, bikini, and legs and does the job each time!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a five-star produce. It easy to remove hairs off and convenient to recharge. Moreover, the price is lower than other shopping site like drugstore.</li>
            <li> Generally this shaver works well.  But sometimes it leaves a red mark on my right arm at the same spot.  Perhaps it is because how I use it.  I only have it for a few month.  Battery life is pretty good so far. For the price I paid, I&#x27;d say it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver!  I&#x27;ve gone years without using an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; razor! :)  This shaver is fabulous.  It works well, is easy to clean, and maintains charge well.  I haven&#x27;t used it wet yet but love using it dry!  :)</li>
            <li> This is my **second Panasonic ES2207P Shaver as *first one disappeared.(????) I&#x27;m a fair skinned Redhead with sensitive skin so I need to be extremely careful as far as picking any kind of product. Not to mention, GREAT PRICE/FREE SHIPPING. I order a lot online especialy around Christmas and AMAZON.com can&#x27;t be beat. Customer service is *EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Shaver was nicer than I expected to be....it was so nice I got one to give for a gift.</li>
            <li> The shave is good enough, not great, takes multiple passes but does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;What I hate is the charger must plug right into the wall - the plug prongs are right on the charger. Also you can try an extension cord with the charger on the edge of my dresser - SO impractical. I loved my previous Remington which had an actual cord on the charger but it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> I like that this razor is rechargeable and all - save the environment. However it does not give a very close shave and I have completely given up on using it under my arms because it shaves NOTHING. My sister has had two of these and they both have broken (although she said hers did shave her legs well - maybe I am just used to a regular razor).</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she sat down on the floor &amp; used it like a pro on her legs! She had no trouble at all using it, I didn&#x27;t have to give her much instruction. The only thing is the next day I helped her use it under her arms and she ended up getting a rash. We just won&#x27;t use it on that area anymore, that wasn&#x27;t the intended purpose for it anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for five months with no problems. It cuts close.  After reading reviews, I won&#x27;t use the wet feature, as that seems to shorten the life.  I personally prefer a corded model - will go to use it and the battery will start waning before I&#x27;m done, and will have to stop to charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this Shaver. It has been worth my money! Its easy to use, no niks or cuts..</li>
            <li> This shaver worked for about 6 months and then refused to recharge. Until then it did a good job as a shaver, but I&#x27;m very disappointed that it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Panasonic I&#x27;ve owned. The previous one stopped recharging after four years of use.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I has been using an old version (different brand but same features etc) and even new, the last one had to be used very slow and I never felt it was a super close shave. I&#x27;m happily surprised that this cuts fast and is as close as I think you&#x27;ll ever get from an electric razor - and I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far!  The charging mechanism is really unique and handy - no cords!!!</li>
            <li> I have used several shavers.  This one is easy to use and also easy to clean .  Does not leave any marks or burns.  Simply the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many electric shavers and they all let me down. This shaver is amazing though!!!! I actually screamed when I noticed it actually worked. For this price it is TOTALLY worth it!! My new favorite and I don&#x27;t even care if it dies in 6 months I will just buy a new one (still cheaper and less hassle than razers) I highly recommend people try this</li>
            <li> First, a note abut Amazon.  This order took five days to ship.  Not five days to arrive, just five days to get out the door.  As someone who used to sell on the Amazon marketplace -- until Amazon started playing fast and loose with their ever-evolving and less than forthright *cough* (lies) policies -- I know that a seller would be penalized for fulfilling an order so slowly.  Amazon, do as I say, not as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item itself has thus far generated no complaints, although I&#x27;m not impressed with the overall build quality and the lack of a cord to plug it in.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to disposable razors. You get a close shave without worrying about your skin being irritated. The process is painless. Following other reviews on Amazon, I always do a dry shave and make sure that it&#x27;s fully charged to prevent tugging at hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers&#x27; issues have been, but I have none.  I should mention that I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, not particularly hairy and what I do have isn&#x27;t dark.  It shaves closely and has all the features more expensive shavers have--cordless, wet/dry, pop-up trimmer, floating heads.  I&#x27;ve just used it dry where I have better lighting than in the shower.  When I&#x27;d shaved with a blade in the shower, the lighting wasn&#x27;t that good, I went mostly by feel, and would later see hairs, particularly on my knees, that I&#x27;d missed.  This shaver gets them all and solves that problem.  Wish I&#x27;d tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I like it very much it gets the work done!!! Easy to charge. It last long the power. I like the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this shaver. I never tried any shaver before so I was hesitant to use this one when it arrived. I don&#x27;t have thin hairs in my arms and legs that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not sure if any battery operated shaver will have the result that i wanted. But it worked really really well. For the price it&#x27;s so worth it. It has smooth result and is very easy to operate.  I highly highly recommend this to everyone.. BUY THIS SHAVER! :) You&#x27;ll not regret it.</li>
            <li> This the first electric razor that my wife has had. We read many reviews before selecting this one. She says that it works better than she expected.</li>
            <li> Got this with Christmas Amazon gift card last year. Still works fine and keeps a charge. I have coarse hair, so it&#x27;s not the best closest shave. Worth it for the price as I have sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs, do not experience that anymore using this product now!</li>
            <li> It works very well. Although it is not like a typical razor non-electric shaver, it is probably the closest thing to it. It is also very cheap and portable for when I travel.</li>
            <li> After previous failed attempts to use rechargeable razors, I decided I&#x27;d have to try a rechargeable again because my allergies (Aloe Vera and Nickel) have made it too painful to shave with any brand of regular razors. I had pretty low expectations, but after reading tons of reviews I decided to try the Panasonic Curves...I was actually more than surprised at the excellent job it did!  I used it on full legs, and underarms with NO issues.  I felt clean shaven and 3 days later the re-growth is minimal.  I would agree with those that said this isn&#x27;t ideal for the bikini area, it is a bit large to get into tight areas and it does tend to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hair when on the trim setting, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was looking for something for legs and underarms I still gave it 5 stars because for those things it works great...plus I saw it in a local store yesterday for $40 MORE than I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because my skin gets extremely irritated when I shave any other way. Even if an electric razor&#x27;s too rough, I get razor burn. Upon receiving the shaver, I charged it (didn&#x27;t take long), read the instructions, and used it.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s easy to handle&amp;operate, and gentle on my skin-no razor burn! I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with this item. Replacement blades are relatively inexpensive, but each razor head lasts quite some time. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and have recommended this product to friends&amp;family.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  You can use it in the shower or not.  Shaving my legs was such a pain and so much trouble but not anymore.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a good rechargable shaver and she is quite pleased with this one.  It is working well for her.</li>
            <li> My daughter is crazy over her shaver, It was a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 other electric trimmers and this one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s cordless, rechargeable (nice low profile recharger--no cord) and gives me a nice close trim in my intimate areas with no injuries. For those ladies or gents that are cursed with an unmanageable jungle like me, this trimmer is up to the task!  Just don&#x27;t expect a smoothness associated with a close shave. I converted to trimmers years ago due to the irritation brought on by trying to shave. Just remember to use the trimmer first before you use the close trimming foil. You might want to use some small scissors before you trim if your&#x27;re starting off au natural so you don&#x27;t jam up the trimmer. Also, even though it&#x27;s a wet dry trimmer....don&#x27;t leave it in the shower! Take it apart, rinse it and let it air dry to prevent rust or damage.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet but the dry is smooth, glides over what ever you want to shave &amp; it fits well in the hand. I do recommend this product &amp; seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both used it several times and got really discouraged: this thing doesn&#x27;t work. We are back to the cheap plastic ones.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do I guess... But snags on hair and hurts here and there when trimming your bikini area.</li>
            <li> Works great and charges really fast.  No complaints!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product at a great price.  Works extremely well, and fast.  I would recommend it to all women great on legs.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Like several of the other reviewers here...I love this shaver. It works great on the first or second pass, and never leaves any razor burn.  It cuts as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  HOWEVER, before I purchased it, I read several reviews that talked about the short battery life, and, yup...after 6 months, the battery is dead.  I just checked, and the battery is under warranty, but what a pain to mail in a $20 piece of equipment and prepay for shipping to have it fixed.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews so I had to try it out. I really like it! It does a pretty good job and it certainly cuts down on my shaving with a razor time! The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s not a close shave which I sorta expected. But it&#x27;s not major Because it does get get pretty close (closer than shick manual razors! Which I hate) and I what I do is just do a once over in tub with my gillette Venus with gel bars. And I don&#x27;t have to do it Eveeyday either. Mostly in between shaves with this razor. It close enough shave you don&#x27;t see any hair a THATS good. But on special nights with hubby I definitely use the gillette...so close and smooth smooth.</li>
            <li> Handles very well. I especially like that I can use it in the shower</li>
            <li> Does not get close at all when shaving. The blades that trim just rip the hair out OUCH OUCH OUCH OUCH OUCH! I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works well-charges well</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver about a year and so far I have no complaints.  It is easy to use and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Daughter love the way this works</li>
            <li> Product as described, works great and I would recommend</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my old one. The old one lasted about 10 years or so. This one is shaving just great!</li>
            <li> I had one of these razors for years and it finally stopped holding a charge, so I had to replace it. I tried at least 3 different electric razors when I decided to replace it and that was a mistake as well a waste of my money. I finally bought another one of these and I love it. It works great does exactly what it is supposed to do. Even brand new it holds a charge for a long time and I don&#x27;t have to have it plugged in all the time like some others.  Hopefully this one will last as long as my last one did and I will get another one when it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> great for travel, haven&#x27;t used it with water yet, but seems to hold a charge, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good for me with fine motor issues, but doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> This is my second of these razors. The first one lasted 3 years and 2 months.  The charge was going and I&#x27;d have to charge it every other day.  I use this primarily for my underarms.  Using a regular razor gives me very bad razor burn.  I use this and I get a smooth underarm without the burn.  Considering it cost $13, 3 years is not bad.</li>
            <li> I owned this same shaver for five years before it gave up the ghost so getting another one was a no-brainer.  It&#x27;s a good shaver especially at this price!</li>
            <li> Love the close shave and how smooth it is on the skin.  Also the flip up shaver, how easy it is to clean and charge.  Great product!!!!!  Highly recommend.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Item as described and arrived on time. Very satisfied with my purchase.  Good razor (like any other razor) at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works OK, not as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to help me shave &amp;#34;down below&amp;#34; while preggo. Previously, I used Nair hair removal but didn&#x27;t want to chance placing extra chemicals on/in my body after reading about the negative side effects it had on some other pregnant reviewers with all the hormone changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now don&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;smooth, shiny nickel&amp;#34; look but it will get the hair down to a nice clean shaved look. And be sure to use a good serum to rub all over after you shave. I got mine from a local European Wax location and never had issues with bumps, etc. Or you can always go old school and use some rubbing alcohol. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Gift for granddaughter. She loves it</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.  Gives a close shave, almost like a traditional razor.  I don&#x27;t have to shave as often as I did with another brand of shaver.</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews on this razor I had high hopes, but was extremely disappointed after using it, both dry and in the shower with shave gel.  I shave every day so stubble won&#x27;t become too long, but this shaver didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair.  I first used it dry and then cleaned it -- only to see no hair at all on the white paper towel as I brushed off the blade and tapped the foil on the paper.  The next day I used it in the shower -- as it was wet after use I could not clean it the way I did when I used it wet, but when cleaning it with water, as recommended, I saw no hair again, nor were my legs smooth.  The shaver has been returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been replaced with the Braun M-60 mobile shaver, which I&#x27;d give 6 stars if I could.  Yes, it&#x27;s a small battery operated shaver, but boy does it get the job done.  It can be used wet with gel or dry -- I&#x27;ve now used it both ways and got the best shave possible next to using the Venus Embrace manual razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for ten years and this one is the best!&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time and the shave is close.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d found this long ago, it works very well as a dry shaver - haven&#x27;t tried it as a wet shaver yet. It really does make shaving easier, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaver runs very smooth against the skin - no tugging or pain whatsoever.  So far, the charge is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic ES2207p Close&lt;br /&gt;Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry ladies shaver beginning of June 2011 and enjoy it very much. The color Mauve is very nice and feminine. It shaves not quite as close as an ordinary blade on my face but keeps the skin from breaking out. It works very well on my legs and I do not have to shave as often as with a blade. All in all it is a very well working shaver for the price. I feel it was really the best from the multitude offered by Amazon. I will recommend it if anyone ask about Ladies Shavers. [[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve]]</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for; the razor doesn&#x27;t catch or injure. Love the wet/dry feature. The safety cap/cover is hard to remove and replace, but I don&#x27;t need it anyways.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. My old one (emphasis on old) would often pull or snag on the hair and I had to make several passes over the same area in order to get a decent result. This shaver doesn&#x27;t pull, shaves well the first time over, and offers a closer shave to boot. It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, obviously, but for an electric razor it does a pretty darn good job. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> For my daughter just learning how to shave this is a hit - she doesn&#x27;t need a super close shave and it is very hard to nick your skin with this shaver.  I would never use it, does not shave close at all.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this as a gift, and I havent heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I have an older model and was thinking how much better could this possibly be.  WOW is all I can say! Definitely worth the money to upgrade.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product and worth the money.  This is my  second one and loving it.  I need to replace the charger but then decided to get the whole unit since it it cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> Tired of nicks and having to suds up for a quick shave? This is perfect. My legs are hard to get a clean smooth shave thus the nicks. Also do not like shaving in the shower. I grab this and seconds later clean, smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Not good for bikini area at all, does okay for legs.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li> Works great on my legs and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of these and this one works as well as any of them, and better than most.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gives a close shave without scratching and irritating the skin&lt;br /&gt;2. Can use in the shower with water&lt;br /&gt;3. Battery lasts very long between charges.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to take apart the top and clean the blades and rinse out the inside.&lt;br /&gt;5. Light-weight&lt;br /&gt;6. Charger doesn&#x27;t have an annoying cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1. The extra flip-up blade at the front works okay, but could have been designed a bit better for using on curves of delicate areas and better at cutting longer hair. Maybe if it popped up a bit higher or was more adjustable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of this exact kind through the years and they last a good while and work really well.  It is my favorite and I love that amazon still carries this version.  It&#x27;s the best.  Holds a good charge and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had several rechargeable Ladies Shavers.  This is the first one that really leaves my skin smooth without having to repeatedly go back over the areas.  Very reasonable price, also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife but she is used to disposable razors. I hate them. I have yet to find an electric razor that shaves as good as a blade, I like the MACH III TURBO. So I use this in the shower with no soap or shaving cream. As long as your in the direct stream of  water it is the best shave I have ever had from an electric. As usual Amazon  shipped it right out, it was a day early. You cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is the second shaver of this model that has been purchased for my household. This shaver came with an amazing bonus; it has brought peace and joy to my home again!  Now that my daughter has one of her own she no longer tries to illicitly use my wife&#x27;s and she no longer steals my razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take care with charging habits these work great!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  Make sure your skin is fully wet and it is fully charged.  Nothing works as good as a blade but this works good enough.</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty awesome simply because I can use it whilst dry. The only problem is that it kind of pulls on my hair every now and then, causing quite some pain.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and happy to receive these items before Christmas after the promised date was after. I have had this item for years and really love it.  They were gifts to my daughters and they simply love them too.</li>
            <li> It lives up to its claims, providing easy and comfortable hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t yet tried in the shower but it&#x27;s supposed to do the job dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Great razor. They last me a few years then I just replace the entire razor as the refill blades seem to run about the same cost.</li>
            <li> Good item and don&#x27;t regret buying it. It comes handy when you are in hurry and want to shave fast and go after going to work or school. The only problem is that the blade becomes useless after 8 months of use and have to replace it again.</li>
            <li> Love it and in my opinion for an electric razor - it shaves close.  Plus typically I am allergic to metals and this one does not give me a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Works well. Like the hypoallergenic cutting head.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a four star now because after 2.5 months the inner blade is rusting. I don&#x27;t even use the razor in the shower.  I have contacted the company and I am waiting on their response.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  Gives a nice, close shave for legs.  I even use it on my face.  So quick &amp; easy.  My last Panasonic (just like this one) finally gave out after at least 10 years.  Very reliable and keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> I can use it wet dry,  every where I want</li>
            <li> I purchased this back in September 20, 2010.  I only use it on days where I don&#x27;t feel like hopping into the shower to shave because I know I am going to workout and sweat a bunch anyway.  Why waste the water and time?  I don&#x27;t use it on my legs because I prefer a closer shave.  It does a good job with the armpit hair.  The battery is still good but it doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  I may have to buy a new cutter.  At this price, I rather buy another one.</li>
            <li> Alright, ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;The new age is here!&lt;br /&gt;I am IN LOVE with this product. It gets so close to the skin and has never caused irritation. I use it mostly around my bikini line when I am on vacation and holy smokes I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I&#x27;ve saved instead of shaving in the shower! It&#x27;s so quick and easy and is almost as close as shaving. Granted, you are not baby smooth after using this, but the shave is so close that you can barely tell.&lt;br /&gt;I am Sicilian with black hair...so my hair is thick and dark, and I LOVE his thing.&lt;br /&gt;I also have eczema on my legs that shows up only when something irritates them, and this panasonic can go right over these little annoying bumps and not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li> Hello, my name is Diana I work for a cruise line and I started buying products online. Well I ordered 3 different things online like perfume, jacket and a shaver. Two of the products which I really like so much and I have nothing to say. But unfortunately the other product (shaver) which I ordered I don’t like it at all (shaver).&lt;br /&gt;Two of the orders just arrived on September 1, 2013 (shaver and perfume) when I ordered on the first week of July which I understand because I work in a cruise line and I know that the packages take time to be delivered to the respective destination which is not a problem for me.  Well, now I’m writing this message because I would like to change it for another thing if it’s possible because  It’s not what I expected or  I was wondering if I can return them.&lt;br /&gt;Well if I’m able to return them, could you please tell me how to do it or give me the address where I can send the package? If it’s not possible I will understand. In case I can do it, I can say that next month October, I going to be in the United States because the ship that I’m working for, it’ll be there so I think it will be easy.&lt;br /&gt;Here I put the order number of the products I ordered, in case you want to check first and as well the new product which I recently order because that’s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I’m sorry for all the inconvenience and all the troubles that I made cause. I really apologized with all of you. I just got time to write sorry because I couldn’t reply before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order #110-1483509-0343421&lt;br /&gt;Placed on Thursday, July 4, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, this is the new product that I just ordered online and what I really want.  “Order #108-9257340-3161053</li>
            <li> I recently suffered my third bout of blood clots in my leg and was put on blood thinner. Previously I had been told I could not shave my legs and when I did I bled. This time the instructions I was given were use an electric shaver. This does not shave as close as a razor but no blood. I still need to shave at least every other day. It is not a good as I hoped but better than the alternative.</li>
            <li> It really works well and I tossed the other razors, haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet though. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and produces a smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;Has a unique charging system. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good design, pretty color.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had an  rechargable shaver that works this well, ever.  I get a nice close shave quickly.  I really like this shaver, its great!</li>
            <li> I like that my legs don&#x27;t get nicks any more.  I had thought shaving with an electric razor would be faster than with a regular shaver, but it seems to take a little longer with the electric. I have to go over the same area more than once.  Still use standard shaver on underarms.  Started out shaving legs dry sitting on side of inside of bathtub but have moved to shaving with shaving cream in shower.  I like that better.  I think this is a better shaver than one I had a few years ago.  I could not find this Panasonic in stores or any other brand that was highly rated.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. I have never owned an electric razor. The cost was definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> This razor is great! Shaves close and keeps charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I did not purchase it on amazon, however.  I bought it at Target.  Works fabulously on the legs.  Works almost perfectly under the arms.  Doesn&#x27;t sting like any other electric shaver does, but it isn&#x27;t quite narrow enough for the precision I need.  Can anyone suggest a better option for under the arms?</li>
            <li> Have had this model in the past and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the cost and so far the shaver itself. I bought one of these when they first came out in the late 80&#x27;s. The price is better than then and it appears to be solid looking - works great</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for a couple months now and it still works fine. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth with the shaving and zero bumps after.I love the shaver I just wish it was much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> As I said, it&#x27;s very light and quite nice. Love the fact it&#x27;s cord free except when charging. The color is really pretty.</li>
            <li> It says wet/dry.  It will not work when there is the least bit of moisture.  In fact it will pinch.  Otherwise, it has lasted longer than the Remington equivalent.</li>
            <li> Item was as described, would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super lazy when it comes to shaving and I hate spending more time in the shower than I need to. So I got this because I just wanted something I could quickly run over my legs and walk out the door without having to turn the water on, soap up, etc. LOVE it! Works very well and absolutely no knicks whatsoever. Gets a close cut too!</li>
            <li> no more razor blades!!  I love it and would recommend it to anyone no more razor blade cuts from shavers&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Bought this despite the negative reviews. I have had it for over 6 months now and found that it shaves well and close. It does pull a bit, but I just go really slowly to avoid the pull. would recommend.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Ladies 3-Blade Wet/Dry Shaver is alright.  One has to shave really a long time to get a close shave.  Previously I had a ladies Remington and it did a much better job in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor, the first day I got it and used it on my arms, which were pretty fuzzy and have never shaved because I hated the commitment of doing it every other day, but OMG! with this razor that was the easiest hair removal ever, I only use it dry before I&#x27;m about to shower, and it worked perfectly on my full legs, fore arms, armpit and bikini area. That said, this is like any other razor, you have to do it every other day, but since you can skip the shaving cream and water and do it while you watch tv (which is what I do and since the razor is covered is almost impossible to get a nick or a slice cut). The battery lasts for like and hour depending on how many areas you are going to shave, but the battery holds charge pretty good. I love the convenience of this wet/dry razor for a lazy girl like me!</li>
            <li> Just received my electric shaver in the mail and used it right away...love it. It works really well and I am going to get my mom one as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. It comes with a charger and a bag for storage. Nice little unit!! TMB Roselle, IL</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my 11 year old daughter.  This is her first one and she loves it! It came packaged nicely and was perfect for her Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers most of my life and most of them have been Remington.  The last three Remingtons had  only lasted about a year each and Remington replaced them free of charge until the last one.  I don&#x27;t understand why women&#x27;s shavers can&#x27;t be made to last as long as men&#x27;s shavers.  This Panasonic is far superior to the last three shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  It is comfortable to hold and gives a close shave.  The battery keeps its charge for several shaves and the charger is small and plugs directly into the wall.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months and hope it last longer than the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times now...it came packaged well, with detailed instructions and intact. I charged it like the instructions said it keeps its charge as I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. It shaves well with a little stubble its pain free and does the job well. It cleans easily with the enclosed brush and has a cover for the blades. it also comes with a cotton draw string bag for travel. I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update...I shaved my bikini area and was easy and pain free. The razor cleaned easily and the charge is so long! I have told my friend who just ordered one also...</li>
            <li> I have bought many electric shavers for my wife over our 40 year+ marriage ranging. None have meet her expectations in confort and closeness but this very inexpensive Ladies razor.That says it all for me and that is why I have rated this device with 5 stars. It is light comfortable in the hands to grasp and cleans easy.</li>
            <li> So easy to just break this out and shave really quickly.  I&#x27;m so happy my friend introduced me to this product because now I can&#x27;t see how I would ever live without it.  Can get a big painful but that&#x27;s because I let my hair grow to look like the dang rainforest sometimes LOL</li>
            <li> I am happy with this shaver.  I use it once a week, and for me it works fine.  I have never cut myself.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is set up for charging.  My old one was very bulky and this one is so easy to use.  Does a wonderful job, nice and smooth.  Have not used it in the shower and don&#x27;t plan to. Very happy with my selection.</li>
            <li> I guess I agree with most of the other reviews here. It seems to be good quality and it works better than I expected for an electric razor. It doesn&#x27;t shave my legs as close as I&#x27;d like, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to a regular razor. The trimmer gets pretty close. Overall, I like it and have been using it a lot. It seems to hold its charge very well.</li>
            <li> Nifty little shaver, reasonably priced. Works very well. Product well engineered, easy accessibility for cleaning. Perfect size, works well while traveling .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this as someone who&#x27;s used regular razors for 40 years. This is my first experience with an electric shaver. It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use (legs, underarms, and bikini), and holds its charge for many weeks. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as razors, but I understand that I cannot expect that.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver; it is fast, feminine, easy to use, easy to clean, charges well, and I like that you can use it in the shower.  It is not going to get as close/touchable smooth as a real razor, but it keeps things pretty close.  This shaver is nice when you are in a rush but are wanting to wear some cute shorts.  But use a real razor if it is date night!</li>
            <li> Kid got this for a gift recently. She says it works very well. Seems to hold a decent charge also.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife a couple of weeks ago and so far so good. She loves the fact that it can be used in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact and good quality. Holds charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is cordless and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I could mention is that it&#x27;s a little noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good price, good quality</li>
            <li> This shaver is lightweight, has an ergonomic fit for your hand, is easy to charge, and gives a smooth shave. It is gentle when shaving the underarm area, which is nice. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never had a shaver that shaved as close to the skin as this one. I am very satisfied with this purchase. My only complaint is that the charger light never indicates that it is charged, even when it&#x27;s been charging for hours.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use product and shipping was good too.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Rather quiet and runs awhile between charges.  Price is right.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it every other day and it&#x27;s great! the only problem is i can&#x27;t find any replacement blades. :(</li>
            <li> This shaver met all expectations.  Great shaver for my special needs daughter.  It must not have pulled any hairs because I heard no complaints out of her what so ever...</li>
            <li> Works very well both wet n dry</li>
            <li> works well, only issue is the light on the charger is always red and never turns green.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend likes it。</li>
            <li> Received this on time and it is everything ad described.</li>
            <li> Works as described...rechargeable which is great. I have one and bought another for daughter. She likes it.Enough said.</li>
            <li> this only worked for a few months before it conked out. save your money and buy something that works.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, maintain it correctly and this should last quite awhile for you. The battery lasts long enough to do legs, and face. Shaves close and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. (I use it dry).</li>
            <li> Works great. Mine stays charged much longer than other reviews stated. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love This!!  Due to medications I can no longer shave with a razor.  One tiny nick and it looks like someone was murdered. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors and they were as effective as running a paper towel over my legs.  I decided to try one last time and hit the jackpot with this Panasonic razor.  It shaves close, the battery holds a good charge, easy to clean and has a nice travel pouch.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace my old shaver - this one was only one I could find with most of the features I was looking for. Satisfied with price, shipping, etc.</li>
            <li> The razor was good in the beginning. After about 6 time usage (not even 5 min in each usage), it dies. Charging it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Great solution to arthritic hands and hairy body.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wet/Dry Shaver for my neice as a gift.  She was going through chemotherapy and being very weak I thought it would be useful after recovery.  It was her first electric razor and she thouoght it worked great.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves my skin silky smooth! And there is no cord for the charger! You just attach the razor to the plug!</li>
            <li> Works great for the price.</li>
            <li> Joining the festivities of no shave November I wanted to buy something to help with the after math. Before I even tried it I new it wouldnt work. Now almost a year later unless you want your leg hair trimmed this really is pointless it doesnt cut the hair close enough to make them girl legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little shaver. I have sensitive skin and every time i shaved with a razor blade, for a week or more i had a rash all over my legs. My husband got me this lil shaver. It works great, I hardly have any rash after shaving. Now i can use it every day. I use it wet and dry. I don&#x27;t like the trimmer that is why I gave it four stars. It was pulling on my hair. So i don&#x27;t use it at all. Don&#x27;t expect the same close shave as you get from a razor. I have been using it for over a month now and am very satisfied. I bought a second one for my stepdaughter. The battery life isn&#x27;t very long but can&#x27;t complain for the price. I am very happy not having any bumps on my legs, especially the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Works well for all my needs. I would have given it 5 stars, however; sometimes I need to go over a spot several times to totally remove the hair.</li>
            <li> My first rechargeable shaver &amp; it works fine.  I don&#x27;t use it on my bikini line but legs and underarms it works.  Much better than adding disposables to the landfills.</li>
            <li> I choose to rate this Panasonic Ladies Shaver at 1 because the shave was not close at all.  In fact, the shave left my legs less smooth than they are 3 days after a shave with a traditional razor blade in the shower.  I realize that the shave with an electric is never as close as a standard blade.  Despite this, I found this product to be quit disappointing, especially after reading many positive reviews.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does as expected. Wet Or Dry. It charges well. What else could I expect?  It was least expensive, so I expected I would have to return it, But no&lt;br /&gt;It is going well . I do not expect any problems at all</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver when my old purple Remington shaver went kaput.  (I have no idea what model the Remington was - but I was unable to find that model anywhere to repurchase.)  This Panasonic was actually the 3rd shaver that I bought to replace my old Remington - which was the best rechargeable shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first replacement shaver I purchased was a Remington - model WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky.  I assumed that because it had the Remington name, it would work as well as my old shaver.  I purchased it for $19.99 at a big box store.  I followed the directions and charged it the recommended amount of time prior to trying it out.  It would NOT shave my legs at all.  No matter how I shaved - wet or dry - I went over the same section 10 times, and there was little to no difference visible from that section to the next.  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second replacement I purchased was another Remington - model WDF4830 Smooth &amp; Silky.  I paid $39.99 for it at another big box store.  Again, I followed the directions and charged it the recommended amount of time, and then tried to shave.  This shaver did get SOME of the hairs - but I had to go over the same area about 7 or 8 times for it to work decently (not well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held onto it on the off chance that I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that worked better, and went back to the store and purchased THIS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves shaver.  THIS ONE WORKS LIKE MY OLD SHAVER.  It takes AT MOST 2 passes over the same section to have a very smooth/close shave. It is so very close to the same shave I get with my manual razor that I don&#x27;t mind using it instead some days.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I tried the $40 Remington side by side to the Panasonic - and the Panasonic is 150% better at getting a close shave.  AND it is much quieter - which to me was not a big deal, but it is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer is a nice feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since returned the $40 Remington, and willthink twice before overlooking less expensive shavers next time.  This Panasonic is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a philips bikini trimmer and shaver, and wished I never had. The trimmer is not very powerful on tough hairs and a bloody mess as a result. Looks like a very nice ladyshave for legs and arms, but definitely not recommended for the delicate bikini area.</li>
            <li> It has been years using a disposable shaver and thought I should upgrade to a electric shaver. After lots of research, this was one that could be used wet or dry, had a quick charger and that I could actually afford. It works okay, you do need to be careful and watch the direction so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair. I am still practicing and hope to get to where I won&#x27;t mind shaving, but I will admit I fall back to the old plastic shaver as I know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The price is right and for those emergency shaves it works great and fast. You don&#x27;t have to worry about razor cuts but you still get a nice shave. I still resort to my razor blade occasionally but mostly I use the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> When I was a teen I had invested on a electric shaver.  Thereafter, disposable razors. Than I got hospitalized 3 years ago, was put on blood thinners, in that short time, I thought why not a portable shaver and it is chargeable, no wires, very Eco -pack n go. Does a fantastic shave. No nicks or burns. Your use with this lasts longer, than a disposable razor that can you can  get cut.&lt;br /&gt;Could not take a chance under arm pits or legs bleeding- when you are on thinners. This is great for starters. Packs well. You don&#x27;t feel stubby for a long time. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Closer than my other shaver</li>
            <li> Okay, not sure whose fault it was but this product came broke.  The blade part was detached and the plastic piece holding the blade was broken off.  For some reason this product did not come in its original packaging.  It came in a box loose.  We will not buy from this vendor anymore.  Possibly it was returned to them broken and then sent to us.  Who knows it may have been used.  Stay away from this vendor.</li>
            <li> works very well for me!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so cannot use a manual razor.  Every one I ever tried has given me razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this razor absolutely gives a shave that feels exactly like I used a manual razor.  Absolutely no stubble whatsoever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Panasonic with the pivoting head, which I assumed would be better.  It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.  I can&#x27;t imagine why this one, with less blades and less movement, does such a better job...but believe me when I say, you cannot tell you have used an electric razor, the shave is so close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HAPPILY give this 10 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, don&#x27;t hesitate on this one.  I must have tried at least 10 different electric razors, including some that were designed for the guys...and this one is the best HANDS DOWN!!!</li>
            <li> Love that is rechargeable, plugs into outlet and you could leave it there. Smooth shave if you don&#x27;t want razor.</li>
            <li> I used a Remington for YEARS very similar to this one in appearance. Eventually it just wore out and I needed a replacement. This Panasonic seemed comparable, so I ordered it. Unfortunately, looks is where the similarity ends. Right out of the box it barely dry-shaved as well as the Remington when it was old. And the wet shave was terrible. The pop-up trimmer cuts if you move it VERY, VERY slowly, but still pulls the hair more than it should and it takes multiple passes to get an okay cut. I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $20 dollars but it isn&#x27;t even worth that. They sure don&#x27;t make things like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;If I were you... I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a good wet/dry shaver... this isn&#x27;t the one!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor, because my Mom had one and seemed to work well for her.  It does a better job than any rechargeable razor I have ever used!  It cuts the hair pretty darn close to the skin.  After using it, my legs look like I just shaved them with a regular blade razor.  I am extremely happy with it, and I would recommend this razor to anyone shopping for an alternative way of shaving. :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for. It does the job quickly, competently, and it charges quickly. The price was also very competitive. I recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have researched this shaver for less than a hour.  I could not be happier with any other one.  Great price and function smooth. Easy to clean and look great.</li>
            <li> good quality and powerful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for me. for younger women though, I don&#x27;t think they would be satisfted. it really doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. leaves some stubble.</li>
            <li> I recently had a total knee replacement and was advised not to shave with a blade that might nick my leg possibly causing an infection.  I like this razor although it does not cut as closely as a razor blade. It is satisfactory and I can use it daily if needed.  The price was very reasonable..</li>
            <li> I had to have surgery which restricted mobility of my arm. So I tried Panasonic razor. Not only did it work fantastic, I didnt have to be concerned about cuts and razor burns from which was a concern after surgery. After using razor for few weeks I ordered two more for family members. Which they use often.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise.  It was very inexpensive and works just as well as the one that I paid twice as much for....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredible how good this shaver is and at the price it&#x27;s unbeatable. Have had it for about five months and don&#x27;t have a single complaint.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Shaves close (Daddy Likes) no expensive blades and gels required. Charges quick.</li>
            <li> Works great! No more nicks from shaving.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter that was begging us to let her shave her legs.  It didn&#x27;t do a very good job, only making the hair slightly shorter.  Never gave a smooth shave.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to charge for me, the light stayed red. I don&#x27;t want to keep messing with it, so I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s great when I need a quick shave before wearing a skirt. Love that I don&#x27;t have to get in the shower to shave</li>
            <li> Never had an electric razor before. Didn&#x27;t know they could be so easy to use &amp; work so well. No more bloody cuts from razors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and it worked pretty good for about 2 months.  Not quite as good a shave as a regular razor but okay.  Then one day it just refused to hold a charge.  It would charge like normal but then when I would turn it on it would just sound worn out and die.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Do not recommend purchasing this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver.......best one i have had in years. Highly recommend this one to anybody who wants a close shave without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right and works wonderfully!!!</li>
            <li> Like the product so far. Meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting close for some areas like my underarms, but for legs, its a miracle. I forget to shave and sometimes i have to rush it and it takes all but a minute..best part is i haven&#x27;t seen a razor burn since!</li>
            <li> This razor worked great for about 2 weeks then it started losing power while trying to use it. After 3 weeks it completely stopped working! My mom ordered the same razor and it is still working so I guess it&#x27;s a gamble whether you will get one that works or not. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t bought it for a month long trip I went on so I was not able to return it when I got home since it was too late.</li>
            <li> This product don&#x27;t work well, very noisy unable to use it again.</li>
            <li> It shaved like an electric razor.  It was quicker than a manual razor, but not as close.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet.  The shape was good for handling it. It looks nice.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it works for the price.  I use it on my legs from knee down while driving to work.  I&#x27;d much rather sleep than get up earlier to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I love it I have had this razor for many years and it has not given me one bit of trouble.</li>
            <li> Love this product !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for those times I want to shave but avoid razor burn, particularly in summer when I &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to shave more often. I had read a bunch of reviews before purchasing this, so I make sure to have my razor fully charged before use, to limit the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;es that can occur (just like with a &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; razor). I also use it as a wet shaver. I personally don&#x27;t like dry shaving my legs, I feel like it&#x27;s more work to get a good shave that way. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Tried it with shave cream and it worked well. Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> Great price, offers convenience with charger and it works well with unsightly and thicker hair! It&#x27;s my second one I&#x27;ve bought and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I need this for just a few places I want to shave about once a week.  It&#x27;s a perfect size.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my daughter (who often forgets to shave in the shower) and it does a great job.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on getting a higher-end electric shaver, this is a good solution!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a different brand model that I had. LOVE this one. Charging plug is so convenient - keeps it off the counter and out of the way. Razor works perfectly and has a long battery life once fully charged. No complaints, except that my hair grows back - I hate shaving, and this razor makes it a pleasurable and quick experience, with great results. A close shave, smooth legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once and only the trimmer option.  I was using another trimmer that constantly cut me and gave me bad burns.  This one did NEITHER.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, get this trimmer/shaver.  Even if it only lasts 6 months like the other reviewers said, I still think it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice love it my wife is in love with it I just hope that it makes me want to buy it again live the color</li>
            <li> My wife utilizes this unit using only ordinary bar soap in lieu of shaving cream and it works very well.  Make sure the unit is FULLY CHARGED before using and it will work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since my wife got this and she loves it. No problems what-so-ever!! Would recommend. She gets a nice clean shave every time!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I received the shaver 2 days after ordering it. I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant so I can&#x27;t see my private parts in order to remove any hair but this shaver does the trick. I gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell how close of a shave it provided but it was quick, and certainly removed hair in areas I didn&#x27;t even know it could! (sorry if that sounded odd but my hormones are out of wack) I would definitely recommend this shaver if your looking for a quick hair removal mechanism.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this brand  Does  a great job clean and close ! The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the recharging stand  it is not kind of cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I had been bed bound for 4 months and was unable to use my regular razor.  It is nice.  I really like the longer shape.  As with most electric razors, the shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I would have liked, but it certainly was better than not being able to shave at all.  If you don&#x27;t mind some little nubs, this is a really good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> High quality and provides close shave.Easy to charge in wall unit and easy to use. Holds the charge long enuf to get legs shaved. LIghtweight and easy to grip. This is a no-brainer every gal should get, esp when you need a quick touch up and can&#x27;t take the time out to get in the shower. You can use this on the run!</li>
            <li> I love it. All I wanted was an electric razor to use during the summer. I get tired of wet shaving all the time. This little guy is great for touch ups. Because it is an electric you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave, but all I care about is not spending 40 minutes to shave to throw on some shorts. Takes 5 minutes and I love it! Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was happy with it for about 2 weeks.  Then I dropped it in the shower and a piece of plastic broke off of the inner blades.  I contacted Panasonic and ordered replacements.  After several e-mails informing me that they were on back order, I am now told they are not available.  Can&#x27;t find them anywhere. I am stuck with a shaver that is useless.</li>
            <li> The best wet dry rechargable razor I have owned. It cuts smooth and has a great design, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is just learning to shave.  Its light and she&#x27;s doing well with it.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> My mom has one of these, I used hers and it worked great. So, I ordered one and it great!!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  I have not tried it wet, but it has worked otherwise just great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much!  I am very careful with it though and I only dry shave with it.  I also have slow growing very thin fine hair on my legs so it cuts through my leg hair like nothing.  I only shave every 2 weeks.  Not sure how it would hold up to people with fast growing thick hair.  Have not used under arms as I have thicker hair there and have to use a razor blade every couple of days.  The pop up trimmer works well for bikini area.  Holds a charge well and is easy to charge.  I have had it about a year now and still love it.</li>
            <li> After having a bilateral mastectomy where some lymph nodes were removed, I needed an electric razor to avoid any nicks.  This works great!  It even does a terrific job on my legs.  One note to other though, I am not an especially &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; person to begin with, but, I think this makes it even more difficult to shave those fine hairs rather than coarse hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to clean, easy to re-charge, the charger comes with the shaver. Anyway, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is never going to give you smooth legs like a normal razor would but it works well for what it is. If your hairs are too long it will hurt! Seems to be holding up well and does the job it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a shaver, it works well.  The charge lasts a long time and does everything that it said it would.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ES2216PC that gets a closer shave, but it does the job and it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Doesn&#x27;t work and quite frankly don&#x27;t understand some of the high reviews????</li>
            <li> easy to use and works great</li>
            <li> I loved it. Shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that girl did to cut up her legs but this razor is not harmful at all! Works great, gets very close shave, but not as close as shaving in the shower with my intuition razor.</li>
            <li> Been using this since high school. even bought a second one. thinking about buying my 3rd</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t go with an electric shaver because I have such thick, course hair and all other ones I&#x27;ve tried did not do a good enough job. But after reading other reviews, I decided to take a risk and go for it. I am so glad I did. This one truly is the best, even with thick, course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s super convenient! I love how it charges on the wall... You plug in the plug thing into the outlet and then the shaver goes on top of it, saving very much needed counter space! It also comes with a small traveling bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus... It has a built in trimmer... Just push the bottom button up and the trimmer pops up! I highly recommend using the trimmer first if any hair is longer than 1/4 inch or so before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and for an even better shave and to keep it from pulling/tugging any hairs, make sure it&#x27;s fully charged. The faster the blades move, the better and closer the shave. Charges last a long time, by the way and it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this is a wet/dry shaver. Just make sure you&#x27;re either completely dry or completely wet when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I loved the results I got from this, but the battery stopped holding a charge after fewer than six months.</li>
            <li> Works great on the first stroke.</li>
            <li> Most razors are so expensive that you would think this won&#x27;t be good for the price. Surprise! This razor won&#x27;t disappoint. I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much money on other razors before buying this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaver. My healthcare workers use it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Battery lasts a very long time. Shaves great.</li>
            <li> Having just had surgery and cannot use a blade razor for 3 months, I was bummed because it is unusual to find an electric that works wee. Use it per directions and it works. I use it with either a creme shaving lotion or hair conditioner and shave wet. Using with a foaming shave gel does not give a close shave. It is a great product and stays charged for a long time!</li>
            <li> This stopped working - totally dead - exactly 1 day past the return window. So now I have to see if Panasonic has a warranty. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but a pain to have to replace so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, however, when it did work.</li>
            <li> keeps me from having to shave my legs with a razor. I am very lazy and do not like to shave my legs. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I like it very much thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Closest wife has ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my upper lip and my chin whiskers. Works great. I get clear, wiry whiskers on my chin that are like 100 pound test fishing line. You could land a prize winning bass with those whiskers. I have to go over them 2 or 3 times with this shaver, but it takes care of them. I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> As I expected, its not like using a hand razor,but definately does a nice job if youre in a hurry</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this razor. I got sick of buying desposable razors. They are so expensive and my skin is so sensitive, I was just paying for razor burn. I tried a cheap wet/dry from a big box store which helped cut down on my buying of disposables. But it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one. No more disposables or batteries for me! I will never go back! This razor gives a very close shave and is powerful! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> After my first Panasonic ladies, which lasted 10 years, I tried a cheaper (bought in store) Remington. It did not perform at all like the smooth, effective new Panasonic I then immediately purchased online!  Good Housekeeping Seal and MY seal of APPROVAL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this razor!  The first time I used it I had a good 3 days growth going on... which isn&#x27;t much...and every once in awhile it would catch on a hair!  ouch!!  Besides THAT discomfort, I never felt like I was getting a close shave without really pressing down hard on it.  Boo...  So - I don&#x27;t use it much.  When I do use it, I have to make sure to put lotion on or it looks like I rubbed by legs with sandpaper.  :(</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, it will broke after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver! I was anxious using this for the first time, since so many reviewers have had a bad experience regarding this shaver but it works great!! Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a hand razor, but gets pretty darn close. I think the most important things to remember when using this is:&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before you use it, don&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s on low battery.&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure you are either completely wet or completely dry. I think a lot of people use this when they are still damp from coming out of their shower, so it could cause issues.&lt;br /&gt;3. Shave carefully and take your time. Even hand razors will cut you if you&#x27;re not careful, right?</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble finding a good place to plug it in to recharge but other than that it is as good as any electric shaver I have used. Nice to live in an ever growing cordless world. Great product, great price. I&#x27;d recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I am yet to use this product but I am giving it 3 stars since the appearance meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought two, one for wife and daughter. I guess if I was the one using it I&#x27;d be able to give a better review. But they both use them and never hear them complain.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a non-electric razor, so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised on that count. It works pretty well for what it is, but it seems like it could work better.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old shaver because its battery gave up the ghost after several years. I liked it so well, I bought the same thing again.</li>
            <li> You have to use it to believe how great it is to shave  any  part  and see how smooth it is . No  nicks, no pinch, and it&#x27;s very quiet. Keeps a charge, a long time. .I like the way it&#x27;s shaped ,fits good in your hand. I hope they don&#x27;t change it .</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine. The charger plugs directly into the outlet (no cord) and then the shaver plugs into the top of it. Not as easy as setting it into a corded charger.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by so many favorable reviews of this unit so I chose it and wish to add my raves. Very good product and a very nice price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because her old Remington model finally bit the dust.  She loves this. Eveidently it doesn&#x27;t pull and scratch like the Remington did and the charger is a lot more compact. All in all, it&#x27;a a great product at the right price.</li>
            <li> Works great on legs.  Totally painless, close shave.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it wet.  I didn&#x27;t like using this for my underarms and I even tried my bikini area.  For my bikini area, it felt like it was pulling my hairs out and after the fact, it was almost like it cut a top layer of skin off as the area was reddened and sore as if the skin was open.  I will continue to use this product for my legs since it is much easier than shaving with a razor blade and will probably continue using it for my underarms but I will stick to the tried and true method of razor blades for my bikini area or waxing.  Still, I am very happy with my first purchase of an electric razor.  Comes with a convenient charging station that is compact so that it doesn&#x27;t take up two  electrical outlets. :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light weight and easy to use.  It goes over your skin smoothly.  The charging unit is nice, there&#x27;s no cord, it just sits in the electrical socket.</li>
            <li> This razor didn&#x27;t even last a year. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and shaved very smooth, the carry on bag was very nice too,my girlfriend loved it, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, because it was  priced so reasonabily, I was both surprised and pleased when it arrived.  Really enjoy the Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would use an electric shaver...but it is great in a pinch when you are running out of time!  Works like a charm; I didn&#x27;t have to wear pants today and I was running late! Woohoo!</li>
            <li> Works well dry or wet. Quick fast shave and the trimmer works well do. Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> I chose this because I had the same shaver but lost it.&lt;br /&gt;Received the shaver quickly and it does a really nice job.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had an older version of this. I bought it in order to shave the bikini area and to avoid razor bumps. it was worked perfectly. I have used it to shave my legs also when I am in a hurry and have no time to hop in the shower. It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Well they last about a year, this is like the fourth one i&#x27;ve bought for the wife.  but she keeps going back to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Really love the product! It works really well! I like it and I don&#x27;t really have much more to say !</li>
            <li> Had problems with teenage girls shaving with razors so we went to this and it&#x27;s been great will be buying more when my other two girls gets old enough to shave !</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a ladies razor that has been made as sturdy as a mans. so far it works great.</li>
            <li> Product does not make my legs smooth. I have to go over an area about 5 times to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> A woman&#x27;s needs vacillate as much as the wind does and I am, with pleasure, no different.  When it comes to shaving those parts that need attention my needs are simple and this Panasonic ES2207P fills those needs completely.  Either wet or dry I end up with no short, stubbly unwanted growth.  I get no burn, nor redness.  I get a clean shave and that is fantastic for me.  Now if I can keep the other household member from trying to sneak a quick shave I&#x27;ll be even happier.  He&#x27;s really not that bad but who cares, I have a fully suitable wet and dry shaver and that is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok.  I was really hoping for a closer shave then it gives.  When I use it on my legs it removes the hair partially, but I have still have stubble immediately afterwards.  If you are looking for a clean close shave skip this razor.</li>
            <li> wife says it hurts when she uses it.&lt;br /&gt;extremely hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;stays clogged and hence cant do a good job at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;returning it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time. It does a pretty good job of getting her lady bits smooth. She never complains about it, so I&#x27;m giving it Great Star Action.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been working great very easy and practical to use, loved the color, cheap for all what&#x27;s out ther in the market. Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> This razor works great.  I like the charger that just plugs into the wall and the razor sits on it.  No cords to fool with andg  rest for traveling.  I have used the razor 3-4 times and was very pleased.  I can&#x27;t speak on longevity since I haven&#x27;t had it real long.</li>
            <li> This electric wet/dry shaver is very nice.  The charge lasts so long you almost forget you need to plug it in to charge every once in a while.  The shaving blades are extremely smooth and the results are great.  No more cutting yourself from a hand held razor!  The shaver fits nicely in your hands and the on/off switch is easily reached without needed your other hand.  The we/dry feature is especially nice since many of us use our shavers when we are bathing or getting ready to go out.  The carrying case is extra sturdy and very handy.  This works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Love the shaver however the metal tore and I can only shave using the high level or I&#x27;ll get shocked. So I just felt like .... Ok I just purchased the shaver and already I need to replace the shaver.</li>
            <li> Just OK..not very powful I think. But enough to do some little clean</li>
            <li> This has revolutionized my shaving life!!! I use this dry a couple of times a week. It doesn&#x27;t offer the same closeness as a traditional shave, HOWEVER, it looks like it does. I have extremely long, course, and dark leg hair and this just wipes that right out. I was willing to take a chance because of the low price but it has been worth more than its weight in gold. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Works great for this 63 year old.</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about 1 month won&#x27;t recharge. Piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I need help. My shaver stopped charging. My mom has the same thing and hers works and charges fine. My shaver will not charge on her charging dock or my own. I don&#x27;t know why it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good price.</li>
            <li> Incredibly close shave. I hate electric razors as they all seem to leave razor burn for whatever reason, but this razor is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Does what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it. I have 2 in my household now, my brother stole my first one :)</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I have had no issues with it since I bought it.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works very well however I wish it didn&#x27;t require replacement of the foil in the future.  I miss the old shavers that you just plug in and they continue to work for years and years.</li>
            <li> Sooo impressed! This Panasonic Close Curves wet/dry shaver shaves just as close as the Gillette Fusion 5 blade razor I was using before I purchased this one. I&#x27;m very happy that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries and that the charger is a cordless 1.5&amp;#34; cube that plugs into the wall (which means no twisty tangly cord that can get wet on the bathroom counter and no counterspace needed) Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> I have been through several razors of the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; in my lifetime, thinking that they were the obvious brand to try. This time, I got so disgusted with that brand not even making a dent in my hair that I pitched it, brand new, right into the bathroom trash can. I tried the lotion and spray hair removers for a while, but they&#x27;re messy and time consuming. Then I took a look at this Panasonic on Amazon. The price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give an electric razor one more try.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic is AWESOME!!! It shaves very closely, it does so rapidly, and I hope you will be as happy with it as I am! It charges quickly and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> works wonderful for once no irritation</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve used this now numerous times and have never had a nick or even felt a tug and I&#x27;ve used it when my leg hair has been fairly long (hadn&#x27;t shaved for weeks during the winter) and with the leg hair short and also when I&#x27;ve been in a hurry and not being &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34;. I have never used it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so can&#x27;t comment on that. I also don&#x27;t know how long it will hold a charge as I charge it at least every other time I use it. I really prefer battery operated shavers because as long as you keep fresh batteries you&#x27;ll never be unable to shave, but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore. But I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver so far.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the money! I have pale skin and fast-growing dark hair. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric shavers, but this is the best. I can get a smooth shave in a few minutes!</li>
            <li> Worked great while it lasted. I had it for about 4 months when it gave out. While it was still working it worked great though! Seemed to shave pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li> not as close a shave as desired, but better than a blade shaver for my touchy skin</li>
            <li> It has everything that I needed. Cheap, easy to use, light and portable, efficient. You can use it for hands, legs and facial hair..</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever bought for the under arms on dry it is the best and also good cut on the legs.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving my legs or my lady parts when I&amp;#34;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to lather everything up and do it in the shower.  This razor works so that no hair is visible, but it does not give as close a shave as an actual razor (that should be obvious right).  I like that it is rechargeable by placing it on the wall attachment.  Don&#x27;t have to buy batteries, or be S.O.L. when you are out of batteries and the thing dies, just charge for a bit an you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Works great, good for the first timer and for the lady shaving for years.</li>
            <li> Works well for an electric razor. I don&#x27;t think anything can come as close as a good old razor and shaving gel.... but this does the job when your legs need a quick shave!  Great quality for the price. It&#x27;s light, not bulky and love the fact that it holds a charge for a long time.  Have only used it dry so cannot comment on how it functions &amp;#34;wet.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for! I&#x27;ve had my old Remington for around ten years and is tried many times to replace it with a few recent model, but everything is tried has been returned or thrown away after one shave. Most electric shavers have weak motors, don&#x27;t shave closely, require far too many pass overs of one area, or are simply so frustrating that I throw them away and return to my old Remington. This Panasonic ES2207P is at least comparable to my Remington...maybe even better! It&#x27;s light weight, requires one pass over of most areas (and I have very dark, coarse hair), and feels great in hand. I would absolutely recommend this product to women who have sensitive skin, dark and coarse hair, or who simply want to try an electric shaver. Don&#x27;t waste your time with any others. They&#x27;re garbage. This Panasonic ES2207P is the shaver you want!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now and I think it gives a nice close shave wet or dry. It&#x27;s very reliable and a good deal so I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> As a lot of new moms can probably understand I have been struggling to find 5 minutes for a shower let alone time to shave my legs while I&#x27;m in there. This is great because I can shave while my baby is playing in the same room! I really like that the charger is compact. I charge once a week and use it about three times between charges without any sign of the battery waning. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Well-satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this less than a month ago, used it a few times... Went to charge it and for some reason the charger doesn&#x27;t work at all. Of course there is no way to contact seller and organise a charger replacement. It&#x27;s a shame because the product came so quickly in the mail and works beautifully in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic razor we have purchased and find it to be a good , quality , item for the price.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I found. I had a &amp;#34;shick&amp;#34; that was tearing my skin up. This device has a pop up head and won&#x27;t drag on your skin. Great shaver!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She loves it very much and says it is so much better than a blade and far more convenient and shaves so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I waste money on this one</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Had one just like it that I wore out after years of use. Bought another brand by mistake (that looks similar) and it didn&#x27;t cut the hair!!! So, returned it, and got another one of these.  Yay, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it works really well until it dies.</li>
            <li> What you pay is what you get. It shaves, it shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;On my legs and armpits it worked great, but the trimmer I used for the &#x27;bikini line&#x27; is a bit rough, it pulled out hairs. I like it a lot that it is cordless and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving you legs so much easier and the charger is pretty cool too. I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> gave to my mother she likes it says it works well</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it for in between shavings bc I do not every day. Great. Love it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> better than shavers that cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Remington for several years, had the head changed out and still ended up getting knicked all the time.  THIS one is so awesome - love it.  Give a close shave for an electric razor.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works good but it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as smooth as a razor does. I used it then I went back over with a razor to get a smoother effect. It works good for trimming hair and keeping it neat. The blades are safe and don&#x27;t cut the skin unless you are using it wrong. It holds charge for a good amount of time. Not like other cheap ones that run out of charge in 15 mins. Overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use a razor. Love having an option not to be &#x27;gorilla girl&#x27; forever. Had this for about a year and still have not had to replace it. The price is quite reasonable and I think I&#x27;ve already made up for the razors I would have bought.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for 30+ years.  Due to very sensitive skin I can&#x27;t use a traditional razor.  This razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in all those years and it takes longer for the hair to grow back!</li>
            <li> This razor is great. I really appreciate its charging station. It is a small 1 1/2 inch cube that plugs into the wall, and you can put the razor right on top of it. This is perfect for charging it in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a part of the head that pops up to cut long hairs and crazy strays, which is very useful. However! It does get overwhelmed if too much hair is lingering on the head. I have to brush it off at some points so it works at full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total head in general is great at moving with the contours of your legs and body. I have only used it in a dry setting, because I&#x27;m scared to use it in a wet setting.</li>
            <li> very good product. Easy to use, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great! Works best when fully charged. doesn&#x27;t work as good as shaving, but it&#x27;s the next best thing (:</li>
            <li> This razor work very well, shaves close but will never be equal to that of a conventional bladed razor. Has a tendency to pull hairs at times even though it&#x27;s only a two weeks old. It holds a charge well and can be used many times prior to a follow on charge.</li>
            <li> I was hospitalized and put on blood thinners, so using a razor to shave my legs was dangerous. This little razor does a nice job and is easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet.</li>
            <li> this item was everything it was advertised to be - just as it was described on Amazon.  Good shave, not too hard to clean and easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Durable, clean smooth cut per my wife&#x27;s statement. Water proof is a huge plus for her.</li>
            <li> does not work that well. Could not shave that clean</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! I have always had problems with my legs because they are way to sensitive and they hurt to shave,wax,pluck.And it hurt even worse when the hair starts growing back, I would go for months with out shaving it was that bad.My last option was laser hair removal. Then I got this, and it&#x27;s so amazing. Sure some places it does not get as close like a razor. But I don&#x27;t care if I have a little stubble in some spots. Not having the pain of shaving is worth it. So anyone who&#x27;s got legs like mine. Get this right now! Besides my husband,this is the second best thing that has ever happened to me.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working the third time I tried to use it. I charged it and charged it and it will not turn on. A total waste of my money, which is so sad because when it worked the first two times , it was a decent shave. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the razor that long, but when it worked it worked well. The only problem is that I ran the battery down and now the razor won&#x27;t charge. I&#x27;ve had it charging for days and nothing.</li>
            <li> Great razor, very sharp, makes quick work of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly. Have only used once so far but shaved smoothly, not as close as a razor, but quick and easy for touch ups. I used it dry and hope to save time this summer by having this available.</li>
            <li> I owned several Panasonic and they all performed great.  I have tried others but always returned to Panasonic. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! No more missed hairs, scrapes, scratches. Bought an extra one to use on our vacation. Enough said!!</li>
            <li> fast shipment of product. so far it has been working pretty good,charge fast and easy to clean,came with a little bag where you can store it.</li>
            <li> I have used it over a year now and I love everything about it. I would reccomend it very highly.</li>
            <li> From the shining reviews I guess I just expected more from this razor. It does a fine job of trimming longer hairs (when I haven&#x27;t shaved downstairs in a while and don&#x27;t want to break out the scissors), but it will not provide a close shave. The foil option actually scratched up my legs when I tried it there, and got me to the prickly stage of hair length. It pulled the hell out of my underarm skin too. So, I guess if you want to keep things trimmed but not totally shaved, this works okay on the extended clipper setting. It&#x27;s usable wet or dry, which is nice, but I got much better results when lathered up in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it! I just use it on my bikini area as razors irritate my skin there. It does not shave close enough though for my legs, but I prefer a razor for my legs anyways. The battery lasts long. I charge mine about once every 2 weeks and it has not rained at all.</li>
            <li> (Wife here) i ordered this for myself and so far it is ok. i get about 2-3 shaves without charging, it does not provide a nice close shave like a regular razor but it is not so bad for everyday or frequent shaver. I have very sensitive skin and using disposable razor blades sucked for me because no matter what i use my skin gets cut easily and very irritated and since this does not produce a super close shave i can shave more often without getting irritated skin and cuts.</li>
            <li> My wife needed to replace her electric shaver and after some searching she decided on this and she has been pleasantly surprised. Closer shave than her previous shaver.</li>
            <li> Buy this shaver for my wife, because with normal razors was much irritated skin, after reading several reviews and see that most reviews spoke highly of this model, I decided to buy it and try it, I can say that the finish is almost Similar to manual razors, without the annoying irritation, lasts about 20 minutes running, which has reached me to shave all my wife&#x27;s body: legs, underarms, vagina, and also is easy to wash</li>
            <li> the missus says it works fine!</li>
            <li> Best bang for your buck right here. Good for every part of your body, including your delicate lady bits ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - While it can be used in the shower (wet), it honestly feels better on your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Works great in and out of the shower. Much safer than a  throwaway  which easily can nick the skin.  No bleeding with this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it, but after three months, the cutting heads are dull, and it takes three complete shavings, pressing hard, to bother to start feeling for missed spots. My hair is blonde and fine and easy to cut, too. Shaving with this is at least a 15-minute procedure now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate when products aren&#x27;t fixable and this crap goes into the landfill. I suppose if you bought one of these every year, it&#x27;d be a sufficient way to shave, but is that the legacy you really want to leave to your children, a planet depleted of resources and full of planned obsolescence items like this? It makes me long for the old fashion safety razors that opened with a screw that lasted forever, except for the very thin blade, which at least would eventually rot back to component metals in the ground.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good</li>
            <li> Worked ok.....while it worked. Looks like it is charging but won&#x27;t turn back on now. Off to find something better.</li>
            <li> just as described seems very good product brilliant delivery</li>
            <li> It does the job if you go really slowly over your legs. I would not suggest using it for underarms because it can feel a little rough.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis, so I find shaving my legs to be a battle I just don&#x27;t feel like fighting anymore. I was hoping that this shaver might make shaving my legs painless and easy, but unfortunately, it did the opposite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for those with normal skin, or even just dry skin, but my skin does not like this shaver at all. I shaved very lightly with it and still felt like my skin was ripping off. It seems to be very powerful, so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus for someone whose skin can handle it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace two battery operated shavers that I used for many years.  This is light weight and easy to hold.  So far it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  What a great price for an amazing Shaver.  The first time I used it I was amazed by our great a job it did.  My previous Shaver cost me over $100.00.  Battery died and could not be replaced so I bought this one.  Great choice.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it died out.</li>
            <li> After 3 disappointing shavers (2 Remingtons and Philips), I took another chance and change of a shaver with this Panasonic, so I ordered it. Hurrah, I have found this one to be working well. It leaves my legs smooth. I don&#x27;t have to constantly shave like I did with my disappointed shavers, this Panasonic worked good the first time like it was supposed to. I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s done as I wanted it to.  It feels sturdy, kept the charge, shaved my armpits in the shower satisfactorily and it was on the very low end of prices for electric women&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this razor shaved - pretty close.  I especially wanted a wet/dry razor so I could shave my legs in the shower.  But about 4 months after I bought this, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on when I turned the switch on.  I thought perhaps it needed charging, even though it&#x27;d been recently charged, so I&#x27;d give it a full charge but it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Then one day while taking a shower I decided to give it another try. I turned it on, it didn&#x27;t go on so I sat it on a shelf and continued to take my shower.  Around 3 minutes later, I was startled when the shaver started up on its own and fell to the shower floor.  I had left the switch in the on position and it took 3 minutes for it to turn on.  I have been able to get it to start again but have to wait around 5 minutes.  I did some reading and it appears this model is notorious for bad switches.  I&#x27;m going to throw it away - at least I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on it.. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok.  I shave with the cutter first, then I use the roller blades to smooth out the skin.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t give me a clean cut, but it&#x27;s good enough.  It makes loud noise.  It&#x27;s as loud as the man shavers.  It needs to be charged once a week, so I just leave it in the charger all the time.  Since it&#x27;s not a very powerful shaver, it works better when it&#x27;s fully charged.  I like this shaver because it&#x27;s easy to operate.  Just one simple push of the buttons.  Overall, it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li> I shave my legs and after I am down using it I still have stubble like I didn&#x27;t shave at all.</li>
            <li> Works perfect!! Tried alot of razors, happy to finally one that works for such a low price! Nice to finally get a deal!</li>
            <li> Not a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had the shaver long, but so far I&#x27;m liking it. The important fact to note here is that I&#x27;m male and finding this shaver just as effective (if not more so) than my old one. I was hesitant to use a &#x27;ladies&#x27; shaver on my face, but most of what I read seemed to say that if anything ladies razors were simply more advanced and less harsh on the skin than men&#x27;s shavers. That said, I&#x27;m inclined to agree and will recommend this (particularly for the 20$ price point I found it at) to anyone looking for a decent replacement.</li>
            <li> Shaver works perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver and tackles a lot of hair. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high because it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as I had hoped. Overall it is a very good product and will buy more as I need them.</li>
            <li> AS expected.  The price was fair</li>
            <li> Works better than advertised.  Very well built, shaves well, cleans easily.  Hold it&#x27;s charge enough to get 3 days of shaving.</li>
            <li> The weight of the shaving unit is too heavy for a wall plug charge. It falls off the wall.  It would be better if it sat on a base with a 2prong plug cable to the outlet.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 2 years and still love it. It works well on my legs and also fine hair on my face &amp; arms.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product in March and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago.  I have sensitive skin and can only shave about once a week with traditional shavers. I could shave daily with this one without a problem.  It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric shavers and this one is by far the best! I love the fact that the shaver just sits on top of the plug when charging and it actually charges quite fast. And so far the charge is long lasting! My last shaver had to be charged after every single shave. Charge this one maybe once a week (depending on number of uses). None of these will shave as close as a razor but this one is pretty darn close! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 year-old daughter. I taught her how to shave her legs last year, but noticed this year, she was getting lazy. (She has dark hair, so her leg hair is dark and noticeable as well. Going into 6th grade, I didn&#x27;t want anyone to say anything to her.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she shaved with a razor in the shower, she would be in there well over a 1/2 hour and drain our 80 gallon hot water tank!!! My son&#x27;s were NOT too happy about having to take cold showers. So, I bought her this razor to shave before a shower , after, or anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seems to like it and her legs look like she&#x27;s actually shaving them. (Must be the novelty of it.) However, as with all electric razors, your are not going to get that nice silky smooth feel. So, I&#x27;m bumping a star for that. Also, it says you can use it in the shower, but why??? I told her not to.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.  Only problem was when I took it on a cruise and had no way to plug it into the only outlet I had.  Turned out it held the charge for a week and didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in at all.</li>
            <li> Same problem as some others have had - razor just stops working, though it says it is fully charged.  NOTHING! Certainly not going to repurchase this - since others have - and continue to have it die.  Choose something else!</li>
            <li> My wife used it once.... still in the drawer and will probably never see the light of day again. Very clumsy to use and didn&#x27;t give near as good a results as her 35 year  old Remington, which gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I got TORN UP by this shaver.  Four days after using it, I still have painful scratches and poked holes in my skin.  I threw it away.  I would have returned it, but I didn&#x27;t feel right about returning something with torn out hair stuck in it.  Something was very, very wrong with mine. I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 20 years, and I&#x27;ve never had an experience like this.  It had extremely sharp edges, yet skipped over hair on up to three passes.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just did not shave my legs as close as I expected...that it would very disappointed back to the regular shaver augh</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I purchased it for and it is pretty close shave compared to most shavers out there.  Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this razor twice but I am in love with it. My last razor was so bad that it left bumps on my face and barely would shave. This one shaves close and so smooth. My skin is actually smooth when I am done shaving. I dont have to go over the area over and over. Wish I knew it could be this nice- I would have thrown out my old shaver a long time ago!</li>
            <li> sure, wet and dry, but does almost nothing when wet. only plus is battery life. veeeerry good. i wish it worked better to get the hairs. does pretty good with facial but thats it. waste of my money, id say...</li>
            <li> Good product but would not recomend using it in the shower it slippery and easy ti drop, Would be nice if it had more rubber grips.</li>
            <li> Gives very smooth shave. Also much less noisy than my previous shaver which was a different brand. I love this one.</li>
            <li> Razor is effective if shaving arms.  Has a tendency to damage underarm skin.  Does not shave close enough on legs, bikini area.</li>
            <li> I am a cyclist and we like to keep our legs smooth for no particular reason than making it easy for our masseuse to take care of us after long rides.  I had been using a standard men&#x27;s electric face razor to do my legs but It took forever and I had to keep taking the cap off to empty out the shavings.  When that one finally quit I did an internet search for best leg shavers and this one came to the top.  The price is outstanding and it does the job in 1/4 the time without the emptying.  It claims to work in wet and dry but I&#x27;ve only used it dry.  The charger is positioned so that it sits on top of the outlet.  It seemed a little weird at first but doesn&#x27;t weigh much so it doesn&#x27;t fall out of the outlet.  This ensures that it is fully charged every time you need it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  This was used maybe once a week for 3 months, then stopped charging.  I haven&#x27;t looked into returns yet but hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to get my money back.  Given the price, I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to be able to use it forever, but I hoped to get at least a year out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite pleased for the 3 months I did get to use it, however.  I was impressed by the close shave when using it in the shower with lather.  It obviously isn&#x27;t as close a shave as a regular razor...but my leg hair grows fast so a close shave never lasts long for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Well made and work fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;Batteries last a good long time&lt;br /&gt;Ladies a must have</li>
            <li> I am an avid cardio trainer. I run and I use the elliptical at the gym 5 or 6 times a week and I like having clean and smooth looking legs as I wear running shorts.  This e-razor does work dry or wet but the method I use that seems to work is using shaving cream. This will not damage the e-razor, but it will need to be rinsed out a few times; just don&#x27;t get the plug in area wet. If you do, let it dry before using it again. I wish I could post a picture of my legs to show how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my legs the old fashion way for years.  Often when I get extremely busy and behind with the upkeep, I would just wear pants until I had a chance to do it.  Not anymore !  This is so easy and quick that it&#x27;s actually fun.  When I received it, I charged it for just 20 minutes and it was ready to go.  Now, I can do a quick 1 minute shave in the mornings after my shower if I need to and wear whatever I want, especially since it&#x27;s getting warmer outside.  I would definitely recommend this product and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! Finally, I have found a shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! It glides along easily, even on my bikini area! Thank you, Panasonic, for making a great product!</li>
            <li> Beautiful but not much behind it.  I hate being negative but, truth just is.  You are better off buying a regular razor.  You know, like the type men use.</li>
            <li> Look I mainly got this because I wanted to use it for my naughty bits.  I have always had issues in my nether business because my genes while making me stay looking 10 years younger than my actual age leaves me a hairy monster who is constantly having to contend with body hair.  I like to get waxed but it is time consuming, painful and expensive and regular shaving when you are not the skinniest chick is a nightmare and can take FOREVER!  This thing works great in helping me get stuff done downtown and quick!  I have not had the issues of the pulling on my skin AND I have used it on my legs and underarms and that was just an added bonus that it works great there too!  I suggest you read the instructions about hair length and settings to maximize it&#x27;s effectiveness and so far no crazy bumps either....I would recommend!</li>
            <li> It does a fair job, just have to keep going over the areas, it doesn&#x27;t chafe or pull. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this razor it is light in weight &amp; curved for an easy shave.  This razor is great for those days you do not want to get in the shower to shave but just want a quick shave or maintenance in between.</li>
            <li> This is for the white model with pink sides, #ES2207P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other brands for ladies shavers, but this one is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than other shavers, not bulky, easy to hold, handle, and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;It fits the hand well.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to go in an up-and-down, back-and-forth motion without lifting it from the skin. I do that and I&#x27;m elated with the result. It feels almost as smooth as a razor--no, not as smooth, but close!&lt;br /&gt;I get absolutely no red lines or marks from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel I need to push it hard into my skin to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I shave nowhere near as often as people would like me to--cuz I&#x27;m a bit hairy and I hate shaving. All that to say that despite how long the hair gets, it has not pulled hair, and it does not hurt to shave. However, I believe it is because I&#x27;m following the directions and not lifting the razor as I go up and down my legs or forearms.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used this in water. It is always a dry shave for me.&lt;br /&gt;The charge stays for a really long time. If I recall correctly, I think it is supposed to last for like 8 shaves. I got this at Christmas 2013, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it 2-3 times. This is May 2014!&lt;br /&gt;Some complain about it having a narrow head. I like the more narrow head being that I&#x27;m working around legs and arms that are not flat boards. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgive my lack of writing style. Been busy with other things in life, but felt I needed to post a positive about this shaver. To date, I am completely satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Of course it is an electric shaver so it does not shave as close as a razor.  But, I have eczema so I cannot shave my legs with a razor and this is a wonderful alternative.  I use it in the shower and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used. I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and dont require me to change batteries. Plus a single charge lasts a really long time. The razor is simple to use and understand. Nice choice if anyone&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves so close, it&#x27;s like using a razor with no cuts on your legs.  I use it in the shower and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is teh second wet dry eletric I have own (the first one was a different brand) I find this one to be somewhat awkward to hold which makes just barely glidinig over your skin difficult. Also the charging base plugs directly into an outlet and its difficult to get the razor to sit properly on it.  It does however still work after having the battery completely run down which is more than I can say for the one that handled better.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave and it adjusts to the contours of my legs. Good design!</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month and I loved it but it stopped working for some reason. I took very good care of it, cleaned in between shaves, always put it away in a safe place, didn&#x27;t let it fall but it started acting weird and would slow down and speed up as I shaved and then died on me. I charged it to make sure it had enough battery but it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the price. I have only used it once but it left me with a nice clean shaven legs. It is lightweight and compact. There was no pulling or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a normal razor. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, but its good enough for me! Easy to use and clean. Don&#x27;t buy expecting a shave as smooth as a razor because you won&#x27;t get that with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It worked just as I wanted it to!</li>
            <li> I guess it is OK but not like my old one that finally died after 35 years it was a great razor, this doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she likes it much better than a regular razor.  It&#x27;s comfortable to use and she takes it traveling for touch ups.  Really glad I purchased this for her!</li>
            <li> It works well and I will be happy to have an electric razor again.</li>
            <li> Product is adequate for shaving however it has failed in less than a year of very light (travel only) use.  Apparently the rechargeable battery inside is dead.  Ridiculous to have to mail away for service to remedy the problem.  Mfg. recommends against replacing this yourself due to risk of fire/shock.  Although not expensive I would not purchase another one of these.  It might as well have been disposable for the light use it had before conking out.</li>
            <li> Purchased this, used it once, yes once.  Charger stopped working.  Unfortunately, I delayed returning it, because I was hopeful it would revive itself and come back to life so I wouldn&#x27;t have to hassle with the return.  Shame on me.  By the time I got around to it, my 90 days had lapsed.  So, I called the 1-800 number on the shaver for customer support, and was sent in an endless loop of useless automated support messages.  So, I accessed support online, and spent 20-30 minutes talking to three different people, only to be told I would have to purchase a new charger.  Extremely frustrating experience.  Never doing that again.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Panasonic Ladies shaver that I had for 30 years before it broke.  This one is also great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; it&#x27;s quiet. Great price. Comes with the bag &amp; the brush to carry easily on trips. nice product</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I haven&#x27;t had this long, but so far I am pleased.  Easy to clean, charge lasts long and good shave.</li>
            <li> This works surprisingly well. I have never liked electric shavers, used the throw away ones. I had to start using an electric one, because of health reasons. This works great. I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  Really does a great job removing hair on both legs and underarms.  No more razor burn!</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for. It&#x27;s lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand. I got a close shave in just a few minutes. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was a fine electric razor, for a couple months.  Not a great shave, but better than nothing.  Seven months later, it will no longer turn on.  The light comes on when charging, but that&#x27;s all it does now.  I&#x27;m looking for my warranty information because I did register it when I bought it.  If the warranty comes through and it&#x27;s replaced, maybe I&#x27;ll improve my rating again, but the hassle of having to do this makes it not worthy of any more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have another product to compare this to but I love this waterproof razor. It works great and it&#x27;s really really waterproof! The best part is the battery life. It lasts several weeks before recharging!</li>
            <li> I previously bought Remington shavers costing approx. $50.  I decided to try this one for $20 since it had good reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  This shaver beats my Remington&#x27;s hands down.  The shave is smoother, the outlet adapter keeps it constantly charged, and the cleaning is easy.  I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on the other shavers.  Definitely would recommend this; beats out the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li> I have had this one for over a year and decided to post when I started looking for another...It pulls and hurts.  Gets some of the hair, but not all.  I have to go over the same section of leg over and over again every time I shave and it&#x27;s still not really smooth.  The charger sits directly against the electrical wall plug and every time I put the shaver on the charger it pops out.  The only way it will charge is if I prop up something against it to stop it from popping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old  shaver worked much better and for much longer.</li>
            <li> I have a back problem and trying to shave my legs with a regular razor has become just about impossible. This electric razor makes it so easy to do while sitting and with summer(?) I can wear a bathingsuit</li>
            <li> It was just as others had said. It works great, good battery life and no issues. I recommend this shave to any girl.</li>
            <li> Its really powerful and gives a great shave.  I personally will use mine dry and shave my legs every couple of days - it only takes a minute.  The contours are great and the shave works really well under arms or at the bikini line, using the pop up head.  I thoroughly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I switched to an electric shaver, considering how much money I&#x27;m going to save! Why had I not thought of this earlier?! I&#x27;ve literally been throwing away money getting replacement shaver heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does a great job of getting a pretty close shave. Like others have said, it&#x27;s not as close as a razor but close enough. And it&#x27;s quick too. The trimmer is good too, and gets the long hairs to a short length that can be shaved. The device is easy to hold, and slender. Definitely possible to take on vacation. I highly recommend this shaver, if you are tired of buying expensive shaver heads!!</li>
            <li> It takes the off the nubs but not a close shave like you would find on a man&#x27;s facial electric razor.</li>
            <li> It has worked well in unmentionable places.</li>
            <li> its not a razor shave, but its great when you are lazy, or sleepy, or when i had a cast on for six weeks and taking a bath to shave was impossible.</li>
            <li> Only enough battery power to shave half a leg</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time for my bikini area and I am amazed by how well it worked. Dry shaving that area sounds like a nightmare, but this shaver is a dream come true for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver for the cost. I like to use it dry with baby powder - I was surprised at how close a shave I get that way. And no nicks on my skin. For the price I&#x27;m not expecting it to last forever, but for now it is great!</li>
            <li> Delivered 2 days after order placed.  Excellent price.  After purchasing 3 other shavers (which did not work at all) I have finally got one that does an excellent job.  No scratches or nicks or discomfort.  Very happy with it.  Hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor but great for a quick touch up when needed.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor for my thirteen year old daughter as I knew it would be safer for her than a hand-held razor.  She absolutely loved it.  I tried it myself and was very pleased to find that it painlessly removed hair and provided a closer shave than I had anticipated.  The razor stays plugged in to the charger and mounts on the wall without issue.  It is always charged and ready for use.  Highly recommend.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t give a perfect shave like a traditional razor, but works good when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  I used it for the first time today.  It leaves the shaved areas very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any hair.  I used it in the shower was very pleased with the outcome. It leaves no unsightly bumps either.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for light clean up shaving. It Works great and holds a charge like no other. Since purchased I have charged it once and it is currently still holding that charge. I purchased one for my neice as well she does move shaving them myself and says its working out great for her.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty awful razor. No matter how may times I went over an area, I could still feel stubble. And every pass scratched and made my skin red. It worked slightly better if the skin was wet, but oil did no good. Definitely not worth the money. Spend a little more and get a good razor. I&#x27;m using this on my face, which may make me a little pickier than if I were using this on my legs, but still, all the other razors I&#x27;ve owned were better than this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my underarms and bikini area and have looking for a way to shave without getting terrible razor burn for years now. I&#x27;ve tried different shaving creams, nice razors, not shaving against the grain, nair (which by the way was one of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve ever made it burnt me terribly I walked around like a gorilla for a few days afterwards because the skin under my arms hurt so bad and it didn&#x27;t even work) ... I pretty much settled for only shaving once or twice a week and only wears tank tops and swimsuits based off when I could shave. So anyway buying this was kind of a last resort before trying to get laser hair removal and it is amazing!! It is so gentle, from the first second I tried it I could tell there was no way it was going to irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also great that you can use it dry, this has probably already paid for itself saving me money on my water bill lol. It&#x27;s not quite as close as a shave as a razor but compared to not being able to shave with a razor, I&#x27;ll happily take it. And it&#x27;s so easy to do everyday that it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to me, I can easily touch up a shave whenever.&lt;br /&gt;The only way I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this is if you have no problem with razors and like having really really smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I replaced a razor almost like this one so was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Excellent.  Product works as promised.  When compared to razor it is MIT as close but then again no nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I recommend this razor! Very close shave. Not as close as a true blade, but closer than other electric razors I have used. I have only used it dry. The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver in April 2014.  I used it for several months and thought it shaved pretty well.  Then one day in late May, after charging it overnight, I turned it on and nothing.  It was dead.  I contacted Amazon and was told to contact Panasonic.  I did and was told to ship the razor back to them in McClellan TX.  I received a new shaver not long after.  I have only used the new one a couple of times, and this week after charging it overnight, I turned it on and again, nothing.  Just called Panasonic and they are telling me to ship it back.  The price of shipping is going to end up costing me more than the price of the razor.  Not a bad shaver but not reliable.  I would definitely not recommend this shaver for this reason.  Too bad Panasonic, I thought you guys were a better act than this :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for close to 15 years, and it just went out on me. I&#x27;m purchasing another one right now! I get ingrown hairs when I use a razor, so this works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have a bad problem with facial hair..decided to try electrical razor. So far i have only used it dry but it so works for me I hadn&#x27;t felt the need to try it wet.</li>
            <li> I am soooo thrilled! I had something similar years ago &amp; had been trying to find one like it. This one is it! Works perfectly--does not leave any hair after shaving. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I owned a much more expensive one, that lasted me about 8 yrs. It finally caved on me, so I bought this one...it gives a much closer shave. You really can&#x27;t beat the value of this product! I bought one for my sister, and I will definitely be recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> It is ok, I find I have to shave more often with this shaver, that is my main issues. The wet and dry work well. No problem with shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver and immediately plugged it into the charger. Three days later, there was no charge at all. It didn&#x27;t even come on if it was still plugged into the wall! I had already thrown away the packaging, so couldn&#x27;t send it back. A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Needed a travel shaver and this will be just what I need.  The charge seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is good, use it mostly on my legs.  Fast and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same shaver several times over the years. It is a basic shaver- nothing fancy - but it does a good job without irritation. It usually lasts for several years before the battery wears out. It is inexpensive too</li>
            <li> For the price this is an excellent product. The problem is, I have to use electric shavers due to skin sensitivity, but there are WAY fewer options for women than for men. These work fairly well, but they last less than a year before the quality is severely compromised. The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long so it takes you forever to shave, and you have to make multiple passes over every inch. This was my second one in less than two years, and I already need a new one. Not good for the environment.</li>
            <li> Bought this because razors were the same price or more.  I must say that I am impressed with it.  I plan on purchasing this item again as gifts.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect power, does the job.  Very convenient for those quick &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; and much faster than a conventional shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far and affordable! Have use this one for 2 years now. Especially if you have sensitive skin on the legs. Has helped stop itching too. No irritations. I use it for everything! Charge last long but will not finish all ladyscaping in one sitting. Good to buy two and have both fully charged.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing the last couple of years, but was really tired of the cost, in spite of the longevity of the service. I didn&#x27;t want to go back to shaving because it takes so much time, wastes so much water in the shower, and inevitably I cut myself almost every time (typically around my ankles). So after reading many reviews, I purchased this razor, still slightly skeptical about how it would work for me...but I LOVE it! I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now, and I use it maybe twice a week, and find that it shaves me very close. I have slight stubble after a few days, but nothing that would keep me from wearing shorts. It&#x27;s easier than expected and takes less time than shaving in the shower used to. It is not a quiet device, but it&#x27;s not atrociously loud and obnoxious either. It sounds like I&#x27;m using my husbands electric razor, as to be expected since it is an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works awesome. used it in the shower and out the shower and works like a charm! good charge and works well</li>
            <li> I work a lot of hours and so does my husband and we have a super tiny shower, so this worked great for shaving my legs while pregnant. I sit on the edge of the tub and use this, some slick (greasier) soap, and the spicket to shave my legs. Also it is easy enough for my husband to work, so he can help me shave my legs and i dont have to worry about him doing something dumb with a sharp razor lol. I took a star off though for it shredding my lady garden each time i use it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt while you do it ot anything but you look down afterwards and there is blood it is the oddest thing :/</li>
            <li> Very handy and the battery has long life. I only charged it once for about 10 hours since I got it and I shave my underarm every time when I take a bath. And it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Love it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver. Panasonic is a good brand for shavers. It keeps a good charge and is not complicated to use.</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher except that I haven&#x27;t tried it wet. Shaves closely enough that I don&#x27;t need to use a regular razor.  I like the fact that the charging station has no wires.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever owned. Would recommend to any one. I recently purchased a Conair wet/dry shaver terrible choice, it was noisy and didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace and old remington that died.  My wife loves it.  Does a good job and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor everyday on my legs for about 20 years now. I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 different kinds and this is by far the best model. I only dry shave, so I can&#x27;t speak for it in the shower. Its shaves the closest, but of course not as nice as a razor. But there are no nicks or ingrown hairs with an electric. I highly recommend trying this product. Too bad the replacement heads cost as much as a new razor...</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who can&#x27;t wait to shave her legs.  It is a good product and allows her to safely shave her legs.  I confess, I have used it too.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and had to replace it.  Amazon was excellent in their customer service and the second shaver I have learned to be more gentle with.  If you are cleaning the shaver, you must be very gentle or it will break.  However, the shaver does a pretty good job of delivering the close shave one always hopes to get with an electric shaver.  The price is excellent as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and what a waste of money. It doesnt come close to a regular razor and will leave your legs prickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have said the same thing that this wet/dry shaver is just OK. And it truly is just that. It&#x27;s nothing fancy. Pretty straightforward to operate. I&#x27;ve used this a handful of times and went back to disposable razors. Why? Oh let me count thy ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to razor blades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This unit is clearly heavier, thicker which makes maneuvering around your knees a bit tricky. I have small hands so holding this particular shaver wasn&#x27;t comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2. Blades are not as sharp and leave stubble in their wake. The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as good as with disposable razors. Period.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cleaning this is a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the most important aspect of any shaver should be its ability to give you a fine, close shave without leaving stubs. Not so with this unit. Perhaps if you applied more pressure you might get a closer shave but then you risk cutting yourself. And I don&#x27;t think so. Oh, and I&#x27;ve always used this wet with shaving cream and still the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth. I&#x27;m not a hairy person to begin with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have my two cents. I&#x27;ll keep it in case I run out of disposable razors but my first choice will not be this.</li>
            <li> It works just fine. I have nothing more to say and dislike the minimum number of words required in order to give you feedback.</li>
            <li> This razor works very well, however it is the 3rd razor I have purchased because the other brands only lasted 2 or 3 months and quit shaving.  If it works for a year, it will be a pleasant surprise.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had it 3 months as yet.</li>
            <li> For the price it works better than I had expected.  I am very pleasantly surprised. I have not yet had a chance to use the replacement foils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my shaver. I love the fact that I can use it dry or wet. The shaver stays charged for several days which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than more expensive razors. After I tried mine I ordered 2 more for my daughters!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable value. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this women&#x27;s shaver.  Best I&#x27;ve every had and doesn&#x27;t nick my skin or cause rough spots. --Mary</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.  Much more than I expected. I would certainly recommend this product to friends of mine</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Close Curves Ladies Shaver works very well for under arms and legs.  So far, the rechargeability of this particular model is also working well.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product it...I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...love it....</li>
            <li> I had always sufferedvfrom horrible razor burn especially around the bikini area. I would almost immediately develope wealts &amp; the next day have a horrible rash that would take a week to go away at the least. during that time Id also be in extreme discomfort &amp; have to address ingrown hairs. not exactly what a nice girl needs to hv going on down there w/ very delicate skin! I hv no idea how much$ I speny over the past 20yrs trying to resove this issuebut this electric razon has been a dream come true! No cuts, no bleeding, no ingrowns afterwards, &amp;&#x27;NO PAIN! Sheer perfection!</li>
            <li> My legs are the pinnacle of my body. This shaver treats them like a goddess. As well as my underarms, my bikini line, my everything! NO embarrassing cuts anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been quite happy with this shaver.  My daughter had purchased one and I tried it.  Just make sure to keep it fully charged but it works great.  Very happy and delivery was super speedy.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace one that I had for many years!  This one is lighter in weight then my old one and it works great.  It also has a wall charger that you plug directly into a socket, with no cord!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected but I&#x27;ll still keep it.  Just doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> We are so tired of the new machines which are a piece of crap and never work or never last. This is a welcome change from that. We are well pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Charger is a little awkward for horizontal outlets. Either hard to position or have to move razor to open cabinet -- not a huge deal. I bought a 1 to 3 GE adapter because the razor charger takes one more outlet than I had available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many reviewers here, I was tired of razor burn, which seems to get worse with age. Tried every cartridge there is. I had tried an electric years ago that didn&#x27;t cut close enough, but I thought the class might have improved. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I was right -- it&#x27;s close enough for what I need. Nice to save shower time that used to go for endless rinsing of the cartridge, too. And there is a savings when you consider what cartridges cost. I&#x27;m satisfied. I agree that it cuts better dry so that&#x27;s what I do.</li>
            <li> It works as well as a regular razor!  It holds its charge.  I love it!  I highly recommend it! Great razor!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shaver. The charge seems to last forever. Easy to hold, even when wet. A great shave too! I expect to have this one for many years!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver seems to work well.  I have had others that did not.  My only complaint is I don&#x27;t like the wall mount charger, I feel like the shaver could fall off the wall.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave after using it I still have stubble</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market. I previously bought the Braun razor &amp; had to return it. Total jumk!  This panasonic razor shaves very well &amp; is easy to use. I love it.</li>
            <li> It has been working just fine and it was a replacement for another one of the same type. I was not able to find it on Target store shelves as I had before, so I was very pleased to find it online. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This shaver is so much gentler than a regular disposable razor.  I am 52 years old and have a few liver spots and tiny moles on my legs.  With a regualr razor I used to get cut quite frequently.  This shaver gives me a close, smooth shave without the bloody mess.  I definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I used it ALL the time. It works much better for sensitive skin than normal razors. It never irritates my skin, so I can use it every day if I want to.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this shaver based on the positive reviews and because it is for sensitive skin. I used it one time, I had it charging the whole time after that, and, when I went to use it the second time, it did not turn on. I kept trying. After a couple of minutes, it did start. Third time I tried, same thing again, except then it just did not turn on again, even after several minutes. So I packed it and it&#x27;s on its way to the return center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with Panasonic. I will have to find another brand that&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin. Also, it does not give a close shave on the legs.</li>
            <li> Worked well at first. Now it&#x27;s just over 3 months and it&#x27;s deader than a doornail.  I guess if you can afford to replace it every 3 months, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love how it works....when it works. I wish there was a light on it that indicated battery level but even directly after charging it won&#x27;t consistently start. Sometimes if I leave it on for several minutes and it magically begins to work but there is no consistency. Sadly, I cannot count on it working when I want/need it to.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my daughter and one for me.  It works good for an electric shaver but not as close as a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I cannot use a blade to shave due to health reasons and this does the trick.  I&#x27;m very, very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> will go back to my smaller shaver...this one doesn&#x27;t work the way I am used to.....my fault in the choosing the shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve only charged it once.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with a little brush and pouch for storage.  I like how it fits to your hand.  I can use it on my armpits and bikini area.  If you have longer hair it pinches a little, but there&#x27;s no ingrown hairs or redness afterwords.  I am confident that I can&#x27;t get hurt with the guard.  I haven&#x27;t tried my legs, but I don&#x27;t think it would work since the hairs aren&#x27;t stiff enough.  It&#x27;s easy for travel and it works!</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor to take with me on a month away.  While it worked very well for the first 2 weeks of using it, I could not get the razor to charge at all after that.  While this was disappointing to me, even more disappointing was the response I got from Panasonic: they would not help me, fix the product, or replace it.  I would NEVER buy another Panasonic product after this experience.</li>
            <li> I have used it on dry skin and am pleased with the good job it does on my legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i dont think this deserves more than one star!!! There is no difference between this product and usual raiser! No difference at all!</li>
            <li> About 15 years ago I got a Remington shaver as a gift, and it worked great.  About two years ago, I dropped it, and a piece broke off.  Since I had a great experience with Remington, I bought another of their shavers from their website; it was junk, barely cut the hairs.  So I was really hesitant about buying any new shaver again, but based on the great reviews for this Panasonic, I took the plunge, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  You have to go over the spot a few times to get that great close shave, but that&#x27;s fine.  This doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn like real razors, and the shave is very comfortable.  It holds its battery charge for a very long time.  This works great even for places other than my legs.</li>
            <li> (The following&#x27;s from my wife, since it&#x27;s her shaver.) - It gives me as close of a shave as a blade razor and it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, no razor burn, long lasting charge. Needs a brush with it to help you clean it out. works.</li>
            <li> Simple design, totally reliable and easy to use, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Sucks! Broke within a few weeks. I just threw it away and called it a loss.</li>
            <li> This product came fast and well packaged! works great, months later now. this electric razor is so easy to use and leaves me with smooth legs and arms with no pain and easy clean up. great price and overall value :)</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Long battery life</li>
            <li> I liked it. It works well dry. I wouldn&#x27;t say it works too well when wet. Cleaning it is a little difficult but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Ya know sometimes you just need a fast shave..  and I tell you this has really spoiled me in getting a good close shave in a blink of an eye.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Really pulls on the hair when it clips.  Seems to be a common issue with such shavers, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it does the job fairly well.  If your hair is thick, trim it with scissors first.</li>
            <li> this is the best electric razor I have ever owned.. I have only used it dry but get a very close shave.... love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wet/dry shaver due to recently being put on blood thinners and this has worked well for me so far</li>
            <li> I my wife is very please, and loves the convenience of shaving with out water.  It seams to work better dry and works great on the face.</li>
            <li> I brought these for all of my daughter in laws, who claim this is great.</li>
            <li> Just stopped working after a month or two of use, now won&#x27;t even turn on. I was not impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this little shaver!  It does a good job!</li>
            <li> Been using this shaver for years. I have went through a few, because I&#x27;d rather just buy a new one than replace parts since it is such a good price. But it always works a fair amount of time and does a lovely job. I have sensitive skin that becomes irritated and gets ingrown hairs (yuck) whenever I use shaving cream and a razor. This never does it, and gets close enough to the skin to give that nice used-an-expensive-cream-and-razor look. It is gentle enough for sensitive areas like under the chin and the bikini areas, but tough enough to tackle legs that haven&#x27;t been shaved in a while. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> This product only worked for a few weeks before breaking. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the life of the product!!! I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It an ok shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t really get close</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cut your skin, it is washable and it is really okay for using in the shower or outside.</li>
            <li> This replaces one that was about ten years old.  It really allows me to keep up with keeping the hair off!  TMI?  Sorry. It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it ....</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a young lady in my home. What a nice razor. It&#x27;s size is perfect and the shave it gives is absolutely wonderfully close. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this razor for a few months now and she loves it.  It works great and it nice to not have to buy razors all the time.  It doesn&#x27;t nick the skin like disposable razors do and it leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft. Would definately recommend!!</li>
            <li> Works well on flat skin.  Has a little trouble around curves of ankles.  Comfortable. Easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li> works ok not as close a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works well, great price</li>
            <li> Works as promised: on wet or dry skin. Does not work on damp skin. Keeps charge a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this razor it&#x27;s the best one I have used so far. It is soooo sleek so handy so easy to use and absolutely clean shave I have dark jet black coarse hair n it does a great job I haven&#x27;t touched my razor since I got it.. I have used it dry so far n it&#x27;s fabulous.its tiny enough to carry in ur purse and big enough to shave legs in less than five min. I loved the pop up razor it&#x27;s absolutely brilliant for delicate areas n very easy to clean</li>
            <li> LOVE this! For the first time ever, I can shave my underarms without prickly rashes and cuts as a result. I will purchase another in the future when this one dies. Can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li> good shipping and product works as expected</li>
            <li> so far a great product.  no issues and keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! This is the second one I have ordered!</li>
            <li> This is the third generation I&#x27;ve had of the Ladies shower shaver. It&#x27;s much lighter weight and gives a closer shave than the first two. It&#x27;s quicker, too, because it cuts well on the first pass</li>
            <li> I like the way it handles, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I was hoping.  But will be good for travel.</li>
            <li> Item received as advertised in good time.</li>
            <li> For me this shaver was no where near what I expected.  The cut was not smooth and left stubble.  I used it a few times  and finally threw it in the trash.  No, I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> After struggling for a year and a half with a Remington (which needed multiple passes to shave a hair), I just got this---and it&#x27;s great!  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, since each successive shaver I&#x27;ve purchased over the years has been less efficient, but I was pleasantly surprised--especially because of the reasonable price.  I use it dry, so I don&#x27;t know how it performs in the shower--but it&#x27;s great for me.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had limited experience with electric shavers but this was, by far, the best one I&#x27;ve purchased and tried.  I just got it today and did the bottom part of my legs.  Now, this may be too much to share but I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in several months because I hate the whole production of using a manual razor and shaving cream.  Plus, I have sensitive skin and get nicked several times even with good razors like Venus.  Because of the amount of time that had passed, my leg hair was wirey and coarse.  I attempted to use the electric shaver on dry legs even though the instructions said to use shaving cream.  I didn&#x27;t need the cream!  It cut the leg hair REALLY close and did not cause any abrasions or rashes.  I was able to get a close shave around my knees and ankles which, any woman knows, is VERY difficult to shave without nicking your skin!  I am very happy with this razor, especially for the price I bought it.  I just hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it does not get a super close shave as would a normal razor blade would. But other than that. It&#x27;s ok, especially in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave and the trimmer is good also I take it in the shower it gives a close shave</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten as much use out of this as I&#x27;d like, but when I do use it, it works well. It&#x27;s not a smooth shave, obviously, but if I need to wear a skirt and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs, I use this and you can&#x27;t tell. It&#x27;s also very durable because I&#x27;ve dropped it a number of times without damage.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a smooth and close underarm and leg shave, doesn&#x27;t cause any rash or allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This product is far superior to my previous shaver which was a Braun.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Only design flaw thus far.  You have no indicator (light, etc) to show the remaining charge or when charging is finished.  So, when it runs down, she sets it in the cradle overnight and moves on.</li>
            <li> I have had electric razors in the past that shaved a lot closer than this one. I also do not like the base/charger that has to be plugged into the socket with the razor sitting on top of the wall socket.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2207P ladies shaver gave a close shave while dry and also while wet in the shower. Great shave when completely dry and great shave when completely wet, but don&#x27;t try to shave skin which is tacky or sweaty because it will not glide properly. I chose this ladies shaver as a replacement shaver after my aqua colored ladies Remington died (got 10 years out of it so it was time, rechargeable battery refused to hold a charge at all).</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, only dry. Like most electric shavers, it&#x27;s not the closest shave, but if you use it every couple of days, (instead of waiting until you have a forest), then it works well enough.</li>
            <li> Works great for price.  Easy to charge and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter and it is perfect for her.  Easy to use, easy to charge and it comes with a travel case and small brush, which is great for when she goes to summer camp.  She hasn&#x27;t tried it as a &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver yet, but I like that it is versatile and can be a wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver does an excellent job, although I have just used the dry mode and for legs only.  I like the fact that the charger is small and there is no chord to get in the way.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Happy! Wife loves it and so do I!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 4 in 1 Braun epilator/shaver which I really liked! This panasonic gives you a close shave, battery life is pretty good. I usually shave once or twice a week in about 10 minutes and I can use it without charging for at least 4 times. One thing I like a lot it&#x27;s that is cordless. What I DON&#x27;T like is the size of the head is too big for shaving in areas like vikini line or groin area. The extended shaver pulls the hair every now and then especially if hair is too long. Another feature I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s the charging light. The red light never turns off or changes color or nothing so I never know when it&#x27;s done charging or when battery is low! Unlike the Braun it has a light that blinks red when battery is red and solid green when charged. So in other words I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect electric shaver for women!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot.  It works well for at least 6 to 9 months on my legs - maybe more.  At that time I should buy new shaver blades.  However, the blades &amp; the set cost almost as much as the whole razor.  So sometimes, I simply get a new razor.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Easy to use, charge lasts a long time. It is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Easy to hold and not heavy.  Would have liked charge cord that plugs into the wall and sits on the end table where the shaver sits in a charge cradle.</li>
            <li> Had a similar shaver for years which just died so I wanted another.  It works well and meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much because it cuts close to the skin and it does this the first time, without having to shave the same spot again and again. Also, it is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have this same shaver and when the battery died (after about 2 years?), my husband got me a Remington WDF-4820, which I hated. The Remington was absolutely useless (made me itch and shaving took for ever), so I bought this Panasonic again.&lt;br /&gt;Its rechargeable battery&#x27;s life might be limited to 2-3 years, but at this price I think that is forgivable.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to consider is that the charger uses 120V, so if you travel to Europe, you need a converter.</li>
            <li> wonderful close painless shave. great for bikini area. will recommend to friends. worth the price and then some. great buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised by how good of a job this razor does.. its a great value as well.. I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> it is safe and easy to use.  it is good price, good product.&lt;br /&gt;it is a good product for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Like the use of electric, but they usually won&#x27;t butter.  This razor works better than any women&#x27;s (or men&#x27;s) razor I have ever used and the Wet is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I like it but I was hoping for a closer shave! I like how it recharges and it is easy to work.</li>
            <li> Got this for myself for Christmas and it is well worth it it gets all my hair I am a very hair female mostly on my legs and neither lands so it does the job this is my first electric shaver so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than a certain brand make sure it&#x27;s fully charged before every use</li>
            <li> Good price and did the job- in fact much better than I expected. I am comfortable recommending this to others.</li>
            <li> ** Original Review (5 stars) **&lt;br /&gt;This works great. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months now,  and still works perfectly. Charges easily and I can get a few shaves out of one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update **&lt;br /&gt;I bought this about a month after my son was born. With the exception of a few shaves with a razor I have used this religiously a couple times a week for almost 2 1/2 years. It was working great up until about a few months ago. The charge over the years has slowly been decaying. For the first year I could get in about 3ish shaves in between charges. The second year was closer to 2ish. Now I can&#x27;t even get in a full shave. I&#x27;m pretty thorough about shaving and go over areas a few times to get the closeness that I like. I didn&#x27;t mind because I could watch TV while shaving and it was relaxing. Now it dies within about 5 minutes after a full charge ( it takes me about a minute to do under my arms, and a few minutes for each leg). I downgraded the review because I had hoped to get more out of this but I am still keeping the review high because I only paid $20 for this thing, and it has given me over 2 years of great performance. I have sensitive skin and shaving with a razor usually results in pain and a rash unless I use the super expensive razors and high end shaving cream. This has saved me easily hundreds of dollars and paid for itself after the first couple months. This is one the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get from an electric shaver. Nothing compares to a razor shave and you will not be able to obtain that with any electric shaver. To me this shave feels like next morning after a razor shave, or the next day after a razor shave. I am now starting to look into buying another electric shaver. This is a contender for me to purchase again, but I haven&#x27;t finished researching the market yet. Overall I&#x27;m still happy with this purchase, but I did want to update my review with my experiences.</li>
            <li> I  have had one for about 8 years and it needed replacing  Wouldn.t be without it  I use it regularly</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for the price.  It gives a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; shave tho not a clean shave.  It&#x27;s okay to use when in a hurry or you cannot shave in the shower.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I keep one at home and in the car! Always have in car in case I decide to run to the beach for some sun on a whim. Definitely worth the money for what you get-excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome! I researched electric razors before buying one and this one was rated #1. It gets a pretty close shave, but of course, not quite as close as a regular razor with shaving cream and water. But I wanted an electric razor to cut my shower time down because it takes forever shaving my legs in the shower! I also have sensitive skin and would get itchy after shaving my legs with a regular razor (from pressing down too hard). So, this electric razor eliminates razor burn, cuts and knicks, etc... I especially love this razor because I can now shave any time of day, versus only when I shower. I like to shave with this right before going somewhere and I usually do it while watching TV. It&#x27;s a little noisy with its buzzing sound but not enough to really bother me. My sister used mine several times and loved it too so she bought one also. This thing is just plain convenient and AWESOME!!! I have to go over each stroke more than once to completely get all the stubble. But if you angle it right with all areas of the razor head flat against your skin and press down, you can get a pretty close shave quickly. I truly am in love with this razor!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wet/dry shaver, but since I&#x27;m older 54, I never use it wet due to being brought up on extreme taboo of putting anything electric in the shower/bath. So I use it dry.  I didn&#x27;t know there were so many excellent dry shavers like this one. Oh well, all that aside, this is still an excellent dry leg shaver, which is what I use it for.  Just turn and shave dry legs for an excellent shave.  Best not to have just put lotion on.  Great product and now I see it has all the replacement parts you mignt need. Panasonic does it again.</li>
            <li> Does not pull on armpit hairs and skin doesn&#x27;t get sore.  Threw away my old shaver.  Will just use this one.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent ladies shaver! Recently I broke my right femur and it was very difficult to move the leg, but this little shaver floated into each difficult to reach area like a charm. It did a great job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because I am a woman of a certain age,and unfortunately,with the aging comes the facial hair.That&#x27;s why I wanted an electric razor because disposable razors are too harsh to use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves well,and closely and is gentle to the skin.It also works well on legs and underarms,too.I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly,keeps a charge,and is comfortable in my small hands.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It is good. Easy to use. it is pretty quite. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin. Glad i bought it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this razor! It shaves so close and so comfortable, and it stays charged up for a long time. I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing an electric shaver and so far I am happy that I did.  I would give it 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t have any experience with other shavers to be able to compare it. I am just over 60 and the hair on my legs isn&#x27;t as heavy as it used to be, but I really wanted to try this because I have a red blood dot (don&#x27;t know what it is called) on my leg and if I knicked it with a razor, I would bleed for about 2 days, so shaving my legs was a major annoyance.  This shaver is almost as good as a razor.  In reality the closeness of a razor only last for a day anyway. I can go right over the red blister and not worry about cutting it.  I am on a learning curve still.  Discovered you still need shaving cream or soap with the shaver.  I like the fact that you can take it into the shower and that it is meant to get wet.  Very easy to clean also. This will travel easily and charges up right at the outlet so it doesn&#x27;t take up counter space.  The color is pretty too.  I would recommend this shaver and I am happy I purchased it.  I read the reviews of all the shavers and thought this one sounded the best.  It also has the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval and that means a great deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/14:  Hadn&#x27;t used my electric shaver for a while.  I wanted to use it today, and the battery is dead and will not charge.  I didn&#x27;t really use the shaver a great deal, so I suppose if you do not keep charging it up, it might go dead permanently.  Just thought I&#x27;d give an update.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very convenient to use.  Provides a quick and close shave so no more razor cuts.  Recommended to friends including the parents of a daughter who wants to start shaving.  Great for post surgery patients with limited mobility also.</li>
            <li> works well for an electric razor.  Not as smooth as an actual blade.  Stays charged for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using women&#x27;s electric shavers forever. Mostly for the bikini area and sometimes legs. I&#x27;ve never been very happy with any of them and most of them &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; the skin to some degree or other and cause pain and bleeding. This Panasonic is the worst offender in that category. I tried it a few months and then threw it in the garbage because I hated it so much.  After some research I just ordered the men&#x27;s Panasonic electric shaver (model #ES8103S) and it is the most amazing shaver ever!  If shavers are cars we women have been driving the Flintstones car and I just upgraded to a Mercedes Benz. I will never buy another women&#x27;s electric shaver again!  Shame on you Panasonic, Braun, Remington for cheating women out of a great pain free shave!  Women, get out of the Stone Age and start shaving in the 21st century.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work very well when you use it dry. I tried it. My husband tried it. It removed NO hair at all. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it. It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this electric shaver for a month and find it does a very good job.  It gives a close shave without the mess (one notch below using a razor).  It&#x27;s easy to clean and it holds a charge for about 12 or more uses.  This shaver saves lots of time verses the razor.</li>
            <li> For a $20.00 shaver, it does ok. Better than some shavers, not as good as others. Battery has held up, no reportable issues with quality or performance.</li>
            <li> It works great!!  Just hoping it would shave closer then it does.  But, overall does a great job like it a lot!</li>
            <li> My beard hairs are particularly thick and tend to get passed over by shaver heads with small foil holes. This little gem has larger foil holes and is honestly the best &amp;#34;man face shaver&amp;#34; I have ever owned. One minor downside, the twin trimmers on each side of the foil make shaving beneath my nose and ears a little more difficult. Thank you Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Why have I never used one of these things before!?!? Sure, it doesn&#x27;t give you as close of a shave as a razor, but it is SO much more convenient! I actually just use this all the time now, though. It leaves my legs just barely stubbly, but they look clean shaven. Such an easier alternative. The trimmer is great too! I will never use regular razors again.</li>
            <li> This razor stopped working after about a month of wet shaving, could not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these I purchased. They work great, the charge lasts a long time and they continue to recharge after years of use. I&#x27;ve had no issues with rust. Didn&#x27;t even need to shop around when I needed a new one. Only reason for my third purchase is because I dropped mine in the shower and it broke.</li>
            <li> Does NOT give a close shave.  Pass on this one!</li>
            <li> this shaver is just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot, but it does tend to pull just a little when I first start using it. I have to make sure I hold it at exactly the right angle. But it works great and leaves my skin very smooth. I love that it can be rinsed under the water to keep it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing, she said that its the best electric razor she has ever used &amp;#34;anywhere&amp;#34;. No cuts or razor burn like others she has had in the past.</li>
            <li> This razor works as well as any electric razor.  I bought it to use while I was restricted from using a traditional razor.  I was never able to get a close shave that lasted more than an hour.  Using a shaving lotion helped a lot but I still was bristly in a few hours.  I do have a fast growing course beard.</li>
            <li> Does the job in a pinch-I don&#x27;t SEE my stubble, but still feel it. Not even close to a razor, but I can use this when I don&#x27;t want to get in the shower, like right before exercise.</li>
            <li> I love the razor and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, no problems, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Had this for a year now and it still works great.  No, you&#x27;ll never get as close as a normal razor, but it&#x27;s great for in the summer when you have to shave more often.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not going to give you the world&#x27;s greatest shave. But, it&#x27;s much better than the products of yesteryear, which is when I last used an electric device on my legs. I purchased this after learning I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave my legs in the shower before and after knee surgery for fear of infection. It&#x27;s more than adequate. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry. The battery, so far, holds its charge for several sessions. Staying well groomed can help a patient feel like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; person.  That&#x27;s important on the journey through recovery.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair removal products that has actually worked on my bikini area without causing irritation (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).  Never had an ingrown or redness after use.  Of course it won&#x27;t get as close a shave as an actual razor, and you have to go over each area more than once, but it&#x27;s just fine for keeping a bikini line neat.  The pop-up straight blade is helpful and the whole things comes apart easily for washing.  I get a dozen shaves before needing to recharge.  I just wish that the storage bag would fit the razor AND the charger, instead of just the razor itself.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the worst purchase you will ever make. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not a very frequent groomer. Maybe once every two months. This shaver lasted me a little over the year before it died. The last two times I used it I would have to give it a few good smacks to get her going. And when it would work, let&#x27;s just say it acted more as an epillator than a shaver. I would often end up with bloody wounds all over my very delicate area.&lt;br /&gt;Worst purchase ever. Going back to the Remington that I abandoned only because I lost the charger and Target was out of stock the night I was forced to purchase one.</li>
            <li> These dopes think I&#x27;m going to write something here. Nuts to them.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for just a few months and it just died! I followed the charging directions but for some reason it won&#x27;t turn on even though the light on the wall charger says it is connected properly. Since it is past the 30 days I can&#x27;t get a refund or exchange it. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I had a nice, expensive electric razor that worked great. After about 4-5 years, it wore out, though, and they had discontinued the model. I&#x27;d tried some other decent and mildly pricey razors and after going through 2 of them and being really dissapointed, I tried about 2 more of the lesser priced ones (under $30). I&#x27;d actually given up on electric razors for about the past year or two which is really annoying for somebody who has SUPER sensitive skin and gets razor burn almost any time I use a regular, non-electric one.&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I finally broke down and got this one after seeing so many good reviews and I will definitely say I&#x27;m very happy with it. For being a $20 shaver, it does a really good job. Once I get up to the fine hairs on top of my thigh, it doesn&#x27;t get it 100% but, really, those aren&#x27;t the ones I&#x27;m worried about. It gets the thick hairs down on my shins, calves, and on my inner thighs very well and those are the ones that always end up with razor burn. I&#x27;ve only been using it a day but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with pinching or pulling and it goes over uneven surfaces around my ankles and knees well. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a special needs child who we were afraid would cut herself with a regular razor. After showing her how to use it, she used it on her other leg and her underarms with no problems, no cuts, no discomfort! It was her first time shaving and the hair was rather thick on her legs, but this shaver had no problems tackling the hair. She grinned, giggled and wanted to shave her arms next! It was also a surprisingly closer shave than I thought it would be. Though not as smooth as what can be achieved with a standard razor, it was very close. Close enough for that trip to the beach or public pool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: It took about 12 hours to fully charge after receiving it.</li>
            <li> It works great and is very easy to clean. Only thing negative I have to say is that the charger is very heavy and unless it&#x27;s held up by something it will fall out of the socket.</li>
            <li> Works fine and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but as others have stated, it is better used dry. It is quick, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It actually shaves closer than I expected. Great PRICE too!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on dry skin. It gives a very close shave for an electric and so far the battery lasts longer than expected between charges.</li>
            <li> The shaver works good for about 6 months.  Then it needs new blades.  The replacement blades are nearly the same price as the whole shaver.  So I end up just getting a new shaver.  It&#x27;s cheap and works good but won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the performance.  Worth the money .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave many product reviews, but I must for this item.  It is amazing!  I have always hated shaving.  My skin is not super smooth, so I would always have razor rash (ouch).  This razor works beautifully on my skin.  The skin on my legs has never been this smooth after shaving.  I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  Well, I get a close shave!  I am truly in shock at how happy I am with this item.  It has exceeded every expectation!!  I&#x27;m in my 40s and wish I had this decades ago!  Thank you, Panasonic &amp; Amazon.com for making this product available.  I will NEVER use another disposable razor.  Never.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different brands of electric shavers and this one is by far my favorite.  I have very sensitive skin that prevents me from using a regular razor on the bikini and underarm areas.  I have tried the more expensive dual head shavers and I don&#x27;t feel that they get any closer of a shave than this one; and this one is much quieter!</li>
            <li> This has been so great for me. The charge lasts a long time, I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. Gets the job done that I seem to not be able to do right in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works good.&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning the cover can too easly be put on the wromg way which leads to being damage.</li>
            <li> it hurts as a bikini shaver</li>
            <li> Great shaver ! So easy to use and it does it&#x27;s trick on all curves where it is needed! I&#x27;m sorry that I waited so long to get the new model.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.</li>
            <li> one ccharge lasts for months</li>
            <li> Shaves close for an electric.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it!!!!</li>
            <li> works as advertised. this is a product i should have purchased years ago. don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Worked for 5 uses then stopped working.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Works fast when you don&#x27;t have time to shave. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Easy to use, close shave, and keeps a charge for a LONG time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Works great , you can use it in the shower. It&#x27;s easy to clean  charging is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Does NOT shave the hair it just trims it I wont cut the hair down to the skin. I wanted to return it and never got any help so now im stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver!  This shaver holds charge for a long time and it shaves really well.  I have not charged this shaver for at least 2 months plus. It just amazes me, unlike the conair that I previously owned, which I had to charge every time I wanted to use it.  Lovely shaver, a must have. I am in the process of purchasing another for a friend.</li>
            <li> Have had this for awhile now and it works like a charm.  Great little Shaver.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to purchased this for her. She seems to like it, I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Great product with long life rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t happy with her old electric shaver (also a panasonic shaver) so I had her give this one a try. She liked it a lot better, especially at removing longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I had tried an electric razor several years ago and was very disapointed. It worked well on very short hairs but not longer ones.  So when I was told to stop using a regular razor due to blood clots I was worried.  But I checked the aggregate site (free) Consumer Search and this was the top women&#x27;s shaver and I can see why.  You can take it in the shower!  It is very smooth on my skin and no razor burn.  I absolutely love it and shave more often because it is so easy.  I find that the battery lasts a long time between charges. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a women&#x27;s electric razor.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my granddaughter, she had used my wifes and asked for one for her birthday.  Very fast shipping and packing  was very good.  My wife charged it and tried it and said it comparied very well against hers ( A Remington, I could not find one for sale and picked this one.  I&#x27;m sure the grand kid will enjoy.  Recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> I have had my old Remington electric shaver for over 30 years.  I can&#x27;t even get a new blade head for it.  Also couldn&#x27;t find a new Remington that matched my new qualifications.  I must say, the Panasonic new does not sufficiently surpass the Remington old in terms of shave closeness.  But it does the job.  However, it will be a long time--hopefully--to see if it lasts as long as the Remington.</li>
            <li> I had an old electric razor that I loved and can no longer get a foil or blades for.  It was as good as shaving with a razor but I have not been able to find another the even comes close.  I went back to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a shaver for a while.  I bought this one because it got good reviews on Amazon and some other websites.  I tried some other shavers which I didn&#x27;t like.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t give me shaver&#x27;s rash.  I never used the shaver in the wet so I can&#x27;t give a review on that.  Deliver was prompt and good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a countless number of shavers.  This one is inexpensive and works well.  It works on dry and wet skin.  My only complaint is the charger.  You need to plug it upright into an outlet and stand the shaver on top.  It limits where you can recharge the shaver.  It needs to be pressed tightly into the charger to charge.  It works well especially when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to run into the shower.  It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Saves water in shaving but doesn&#x27;t cut especially close. Often have to go back over again and again.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing i got in Amzon! i were shocked when i got this! This is so awesom!</li>
            <li> Works as well as you&#x27;d expect. Obviously not as close as a blade, but you can&#x27;t tell by looking.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome battery powered wet/dry shaver. Easy to maintain and charge. Battery last a long time between charge.</li>
            <li> Really a great first shaver for my third grader. She is very hairy and has been teased at school so she asked me if she could shave her legs. I was concerned about her using a real razor and cutting her legs. This helps remove the heavy hair safely.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times because I have missed spots and it seems to do a very acceptable job. Not as close cutting or as smooth as a real razor but a great thing to have for missed spots or for young girls just starting to shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic ladies&#x27; shaver I&#x27;d bought 8 or 9 years ago.  Unbelievably, this shaver works worse than the old, dull one.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I solely use this shaver for my \\&quot;woman area\\&quot; and I LOVE this. I&#x27;ve been using this style/brand of shaver for ~7/8 years. And the one I&#x27;m currently using has been around for about 5/6 years and has survived PLENTY of drops! Still holds a charge for 3, maybe 4 shaves- (~8min/shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is amazing. Very close shave- leaves me smooth &amp; irritation free. I use the shaver after I shower and have thoroughly dried myself off- I feel it works best then for me. ((a side note if you shave down there- follow with unscented regular deodorant to prevent bumps/irritation, too))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have charged mine after every use, but after reading another review about preventing the horrible skin pull/rip in the shaver- I will start doing that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely well worth the $20- highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and I was told that it is the very first shaver that does not nip at your skin when shaving your underarms.  I was very pleased to hear that She was so happy to have this and so pleased with how well it works. It has a handy plug in recharging station so you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging around the bathroom.  It just neatly sits in the cradle ready to be used.  Great gift/investment.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is my favorite travel razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an electric razor, but I wanted to give it a shot.  I have had a pretty good experience with it so far.  I use it without the water (dry), hence my reason for wanting to use an electric razor instead of a normal razor.  It does a good job and cuts my shave time in half.  In comparison, the only negatives is that it&#x27;s not as close of a shave compared to using a non-electric razor with water and shave cream.  I also have to shave about a day sooner, than if I used a regular razor.  I find it&#x27;s great for the summer though, when I&#x27;m shaving more frequently and it keeps everything smooth and clean in between major shaves.  So overall a good product!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her cordless razor. Great present for any young lady starting to shave her legs. No nicks, bleeding, or stinging. I have one and love it.</li>
            <li> I liked this shaver while it was working. As other reviewers have noted, you get a closer shave using it in the shower with shaving cream than using it dry. I used it about once a week for 4 months with no problems; then one day it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I sent it in to Panasonic for repairs nearly 2 months ago, but still haven&#x27;t heard anything back from them. I want my shaver back!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using it for months now, and I get a wonderfully close shave with nice skin exfoliation.  I love this more than my Gillette Quatro.</li>
            <li> Love this so quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I needed a shaver that would give me the ability to quickly get a decent shave.  This is it.  No, my legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I use a blade, but they are close enough if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  If I&#x27;m getting a pedicure I can use this shaver the same day and not risk cuts and nicks which could be infected at the salon.  The head is small enough to quickly wipe out unwanted facial hair as well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> My wife needed a new Shaver and this one really filled the bill. Panasonic quality at a very reasonable price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Like the razor/trimmer itself, but seriousl dislike the charger - IT MUST PLUG DIRECTLY TO A WALL.  Much like a nightlight is set-up.  You plug the charger into an outlet and sit the razor on it, like a room air freshener.  If you prefer it on a counter-top, get yourself an extension cord.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not such a close shave that I get ingrown hairs. Great price, easy to use, quiet and light weight.</li>
            <li> Best shaver to date that I have bought. It gives a close shave for an electric razor. Was a worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps a nice charge.</li>
            <li> Great razor for on the go and a quick smooth leg appearance.</li>
            <li> This, like all electric shavers I have tried do not shave legs nor arms very well.  I am on blood thinning medicine which makes all cuts bleed profusely.  Unfortunately, this did not help the problem.  I am disappointed because to get the shaver to cut, you have to press so hard, it scratches my skin.</li>
            <li> Got one of these for myself and one for my daughter. Gives a nice close shave with no nicks or pinches.Holds a charge well and you can get several shaves of decent length before having to recharge it. The price is great too. I was a die-hard Remington user for years but this little shaver has really held its own and it was much cheaper than all the Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> Works well at shaving both facial and body hair. Rinses clean with water. Holds its charge and is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it. She said it is one of the better razors she has had. No nicks no cuts just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note from me only thing I see it I have a gripe is how it charges. the charger has no cord just box plugs into outlet and the razor sitting on top of box. I don&#x27;t like that much wight hanging on an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting a short pigtail extension cord plug charger into it and let it and razor lay on counter.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews said that this razor pinches but that has not been my experience even though most razors I have used in the past have done that.  This razor shaves really close.  I prefer to use it dry and I still get excellent results.  It fits in the hand well and makes for a quick shave.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor based on other Amazon reviews and I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I use this razor mostly for my legs and underarms. Works very well for a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it quite a while now and after the initial charge, I have not had to recharge it yet. Long life for a battery.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t plugged it in for weeks and it just keeps on shaving! It shaves well, not too noisy and it keeps a charge for like eons!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  Great Price and great results.  It fits comfortable in your hand.  Easy charge.  Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> It works ok. A bit difficult getting it plugged into the charger. The cleaning brush could be bigger and better bristles. Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Makes a great first shaver for young girls. I was terrified for my 11 year old to use a razor, so I bought her this and it works great!</li>
            <li> When my old razor broke, I decided on this one. It works, is easy to clean up, and is easy to fit in the charger. So far, it&#x27;s ready when I need it.I didn&#x27;t need the extra features some razors have. This is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> sometimes instead of cutting, the hair gets stuck and it pulls the hair</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is working very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  I have small hands and it fits perfect!  It really is good wet or dry!</li>
            <li> close shave, I get razor burn with a regular razor even the over-priced razors. I get a really close shave even in the sensitive areas :-)&lt;br /&gt;great electric razor for a great price. although , I;ve never tried to use it wet. and it works better if you use about 15 mins after bathing before using lotion. Love this razor. just make sure you fully charge it the 1st time</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Cuts great. Other shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and finally quit charging and didn&#x27;t cut that great.  This brand is better.</li>
            <li> Decent razor for the price&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a close shave.  I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It was wasted my money ! Only works the first day</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver for someone who hates shaving! I apologize for the long review beforehand, but I promise you, the details will help you make an informed purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------ BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to getting my legs, arms, arm pits etc. waxed professionally once a month, back when I was in India. When I moved to the US, I realized how super expensive it is to get it done here, especially on a student budget! I tried waxing at home but there were always difficult patches which would turn sore and red because I couldn&#x27;t hold the skin taut. Hence, like every one else, I started shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that I had never shaved before. Maybe once or twice in high school but that too when my mother was supervising me. I hated it. I hated spending extra time in the shower. I hated that it had to be done more often. I hated the cuts and razor burns. I tried shaving my arms once and it was a disaster. That&#x27;s when I thought that I should probably look up electric shavers, and I found this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------ REVIEW------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Close shave:&lt;br /&gt;I think the main issue most people face with electric shavers is getting a close shave. If done right, this can give a close shave. hold the shaver perpendicular to the surface, so that the foil and both side of the trimmer are touching your skin. The trick is to go back and forth several times over the same area. There is a little bit of a spring action, so that you can, very gently, press it down on your skin, giving a closer shave. If you have longer hair, apply some talcum powder/baby powder and run a dry towel across the area in the direction opposite to the hair growth to lift the hair up. If you have really long thick hair (or if you are a guy shaving his legs), use the pop up trimmer to trim first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: Even though it said that it needs to be charged for 12 hours before the first use and between every use, I used it right out of the box to test it out on a small patch. It shaved well. I decided to wait 24 hours just to make sure I&#x27;m not getting any reaction, and charged it in the mean time. The blades did spin faster. So I believe it&#x27;s a good idea to charge it between shaves. The manual says that 12 hours of charging gives about 20 minutes of shave, which sounds ridiculous at first. However, it took me, the amateur shaving person, 10 to 12 minutes to shave both legs, both arms and underarms. I think 20 minutes is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving: Since I hated shaving, I don&#x27;t think this is a feature I want to try. The manual says I can use this with some shaving cream, and I lot of reviews say that your skin needs to be soaking wet to shave. If I ever do try it, I will update this. I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to wet shave when I&#x27;m getting very good results shaving it dry, however, I feel it&#x27;s a good feature to have in case that&#x27;s your only option, for example, if your sharing a hotel room with friends and don&#x27;t have the privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrowth: Surprisingly, the regrowth was not as blunt as normal shaving, which is what gave me the confidence to shave my arms! You do have to let it grow a little longer than usual to shave well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: It is extremely easy to clean. It comes with a dual ended brush to brush of hair during the shave. After I am done shaving, I pop the head off and rinse both, the head and the blades inside in water. It&#x27;s a good idea to press your finger onto the faucet so that it gives out a sharp forceful stream. I first rinse the head, then put a some hand soap in some water in a cup, and leave the head in that to soak while I clean the blades inside. I first rinse the blades in the sharp stream, then I dunk the blade only in the cup full of soap water and swish it around, and then rinse both the head and the blades. I use a q tipto get into the corners of the plastic inside. To dry off, I sort of shake both the parts vigorously so that the water falls out, put the top back on to protect the blade, and leave it to air dry for a few hours. Once I know it&#x27;s fully dry, I put it for charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics: For dry shaving and washing, it&#x27;s very easy to hold. It fits well in my small hands and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip. I don&#x27;t know if the surface will become slippery if you&#x27;re shaving wet with shaving cream. The placement of the buttons is good so that you can start and stop the shaver or open and close the pop trimmer with the thumb of the hand you&#x27;re holding it with. I believe the design is good for both, right handed and left handed people. The side of the the blade is big enough for quick shaves, and small enough to get around difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability: If you have the right case to carry it in, it&#x27;s easily portable. The case that comes with it is too small to fit both the shaver and the charger. This is my only complaint. Other than that, it&#x27;s not too bulky and heavy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Only time will tell. I have had it only for a few weeks and used it 3-4 times, and so far it&#x27;s great. The blade and the foil are replaceable, so that&#x27;s a good think. Other than that, if you read the manual, follow the instructions, keep it clean and charge it timely, you&#x27;re doing everything on your side to maintain the product. If anything goes wrong or I face any issues, I will come back and update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, very affordable (I bought it for 14.99, the original price is 29.99, which is still great if it lasts for more than a year), it does the job well without nicks and cuts, and it is FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!

            <li> So much better than razors and water and mess. Works great so far.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave. I&#x27;m bummed. Bought a 5-blade razor that my husband uses and it&#x27;s like night and day. Wish I had not bought this.</li>
            <li> After owning it for two months it just stopped working. I probably used it about 5 times in total. It was never a close shave so I&#x27;d shave with a razor when I was done using it. But then it just quit working out of nowhere. S*** product.</li>
            <li> Have only had this producta  few weeks, but it has been working well.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to nic or cut.&lt;br /&gt;It does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  No as close as a razor shave but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I have used.  Fits hand and is comfortable.  Packaged very well.  Operates very smoothly and is fairly quiet.  Love it!  Would buy again.  Would make a great gift!![[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my 11 year old for Christmas.  She used it and loved it.  It is very easy to use.  I feel more comfortable with her using this instead of a standard razor.  Excellent item!</li>
            <li> I have not tried an electric shaver since my teenage years....what a pleasant surprise when I decided to try this one....the price is wonderful and it works great....</li>
            <li> got razor burn on one armpit.  Go easy.  Like the design, and charger.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Bikini trimmer useful too.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price.  i researched a bunch of ladies razors and this got the best reviews...now i see why! close, painless shave.  so happy i decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> So, let me preface this by letting you know my body hair is blonde. VERY blonde. Sure, there&#x27;s a ton of it. Peach fuzz everywhere and long blonde hairs on my legs, arms... you get the picture....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this shaver does a great job and gets closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve encountered before. The wide head is GREAT for carving across your legs and chest, if you happen to have a furry chest you gotta get rid of. I don&#x27;t btw, but my boyfriend does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boyfriend is a brunette. So you can see a TINY bit of stubble left behind. It looks like if you shaved closely with a razor and then waited about 5-6 hrs.... just tiny specks of hair left behind. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, I can go two days before you can even see a thing because I&#x27;m blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great... DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -- It sucks wet. Even if I sweat just a bit, or have too much lotion on, it clogs and then surprise, becomes an epilator and yanks out your hair left and right in the most agonizing ways. And, if you hit it wrong against certain delicate areas, it will gouge a quarter inch chunk of skin off of you. But I&#x27;ve shaved with it about 10 times and this has only happened twice.... so uh.. stick to your legs and other flat surfaces and you should be fine....</li>
            <li> I really like wet dry shavers, but this one died and the one before that in just one year.  I had the first one a bit longer and thought it was error, then again- Poof! Dead!  Too bad the product doesn&#x27;t last past warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently part Wookie, so having let my leg hair grow out for a few months, it was this or a weed-wacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This got the job done, though it did start to drag toward the last part of the session even though I stopped frequently to clean &#x27;er out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would recommend this product pretty readily.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand that was worthless. I sent it back once &amp; finally gave up after a couple of years. So I didn&#x27;t have much hope when I ordered this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. This does an excellent job, although I must say I have never used it wet, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. It shaves without pulling hair, does a great job on legs as well as a Brazil trim.</li>
            <li> This works on my ENTIRE body with no irritation and a close shave. The battery lasts longer than it takes me to shave *everything*. Very convenient to grip, maneuver, and charge. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This has really saved me so much time. It quickly handles my leg shaving. The charge lasts and lasts. Also saves me the cost of blades!</li>
            <li> So I should say, that if you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor that works as well as a manual razor; this is not the item for you. However, as far as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, this works really well. It cuts close enough to do away with stubble. I had to stop using manual razors due to sensitive skin that I cut quite easily and so far, this has been perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Bought two, one for me and one for my daughter.  No problems, charges fine, light weight, cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my gal and she loves it, after hers got lost in the hospital, just vanished. She said it was better than her last and the price from Amazon was great as was the shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Really like this, don&#x27;t crap out like others I have had and don&#x27;t yank your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver it pulls and hurts it needs to be taken off the market. I don&#x27;t recogmend it.</li>
            <li> This product is just as advertised..I love, love,love it!  Works perfect..I highly recommend this shaver..I know I will enjoy for years to come!  Give it a try..;)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this razor! Exceeded my expectations. Leaves your legs with the same smoothness as a shower razor!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!! I was sceptical when i saw another review that said it would not hold a charge. It held a charge, after the intial charge, for 1 week using it about every other day. Shaves not as close as a blade, but no electrics do, but it&#x27;s the closest shave of any electric i have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have been getting razor burn and breaking out in horrible rashes ewwwww! I did some research and found out that electric razors are the best route (other than laser). I also reviewed different products and this razor kept coming up. The price was right so I bought it. I love it, great close shave simple to use, easy to clean and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> this is one of my mother gift and she love it and I glad I did get this one and I&#x27;m very please with the close curves wet and dry shaver</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin is quick and easy to use the only downside its the weird charger that is a square instead of a cable so that takes space in the wall outlet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best results with electric shavers but I absolutely love this Panasonic Ladies shaver!  It offers a great trimmer and produces a nice close shave without razor burn. I plan to purchase several others to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my adolescent daughter as a beginner wet/dry shaver.  It is difficult to maneuver in small hands.  Does not remove hair efficiently...must go over a few times...and then chafes.</li>
            <li> This works as described. Shaves well and pop up trimmer is useful. Trimmer blades aren&#x27;t as scratchy as my old razor.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, fast service....I recommend product and seller</li>
            <li> This works as advertised. It&#x27;s great and holds a charge, and it&#x27;s easy to keep, clean. Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if your in a pinch but it leaves stubble.</li>
            <li> Great product and great results.  Very happy with it.  It works as described and love the cordless charger it comes with.</li>
            <li> This razor works great. So glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> Women have a need for shaving too, in fact, they likely shave more area than men, and yet there is so little attention paid to the quality of their electric shavers.  I have had the name brand that is the best known, historically, in my opinion, and it is loud and does not shave that well.  This shaver is much quieter and shaves my legs and arms easily.  I have yet to try it on my facial hair, Dr. Oz says that is the best way for women to remove unwanted facial hair.  There are other areas that we are expected now to keep clean shaven, and I have yet to find a razor that does that job, on such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on me, left visible stubble after multiple passes on my legs.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Close shave.  Holds a charge a long time.  Comfortable to hold in your hand.  Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Nice for an &#x27;oh crap it&#x27;s been a week since I shaved and I have to wear a skirt or shorts&#x27; event or for my husband who shaves his legs but just doesn&#x27;t have the patience to do the upkeep in the shower every day.&lt;br /&gt;A fresh charge is a must. I have fine hairs and I&#x27;ve sucked my skin up a time or two and I won&#x27;t use it without charging for a good 10-15 minutes just to be safe.</li>
            <li> My last shaver died on my so I bought this one based on numerous positive reviews on Amazon and on QVC.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I did, this shaver is awesome! It gives a very close and clean shave, without cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I had this issue with my old shaver when I used it under the arms, but this one cuts close but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice and lightweight and the sleek design and color is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving my legs, I make sure I apply the Vitaville [[ASIN:B00GJ48NVO Argan Oil: Virgin Cold Pressed, Grade A, Odorless. No Preservatives, No Dyes, No Animal Testing. 4 FL OZ, Super Size.]], which puts back the moisture and calms down the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Beside, it makes my legs look even smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but was hoping that in the many years since I had last used an electric razor that they since improved the closeness of the shave. However, it hasn&#x27;t changed.  I purchased this for my daughter that just started shaving and it seems to work really well for her, especially since she can use it in the shower.  For her it is perfect to use in between using a traditional razor and shaving cream.  it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Four stars because I don&#x27;t like the charging station.  I would like to see a stand with cord.  A bit inconvient, but working with it.  Other than that, the razor itself is five stars and for the price I felt was a bargain.  I thought it would be cheap but it&#x27;s well built.</li>
            <li> Is good for quick touch-ups, but is not a close shave that will last . It is super easy and quick to use though so using it daily doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li> I just tried this out and it is good for legs but not underarms. It was uncomfortable to use on my underarms and my skin became red, rashy and sore. It was fine good comfortable shave for my legs.</li>
            <li> If you have dark coarse hair- do not buy this electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I have dark hair and olive skin and my hair on my legs grows like wild fire!&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it, yes it left me partially smooth but left yucky black dots all over my legs like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Is NOT flattering or feminine. But DOES help with some grooming down below. Overall I think my men&#x27;s 5 blade razor from king soopers works way better!</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Shaves close with no abrasions.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this for about three months and has only used it a handful of time, and it&#x27;s already stopped working. Won&#x27;t even turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> Giving great relief to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little skeptical, but so far this has been doing the job nicely.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Although I followed the directions and make sure it&#x27;s charged up before using.</li>
            <li> I have kinda thicker leg hair. And it will help me get a closer shave but not remove my completely. I still have to lather up and use a razor.</li>
            <li> I started using this one several years ago and it works great- I always have smooth legs with no stubble after.  Be sure you put lotion on first so you don&#x27;t get dry streaks all over your legs.  I use it at home in between shaving with a razor.  It is a bit big for travel though so I have tried other smaller ones meant for travel but they just don&#x27;t work so I am back to traveling with this one.  Lost the charger though and there is no replacement charger so now having to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Best ladies electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Hey--for $16 can&#x27;t beat it.  Not the best, but OK between shower shaves</li>
            <li> This gives a super close shave which leaves my skin very smooth. It hold a pretty good charge...I&#x27;m at approximately 8 shaves (5 mins each) with no drop in power. I have only used it wet with shaving cream...it can still give a few sharp pulls tho. The pop up trimmer gets taller hair down and then the foil blades mow it under the skin. I only got hair bumps the first 2 shaves, probably because I let the hair grow out fully for a week without shaving again to see hat happens, but now I&#x27;m shaving every 3/4 days I get no problems. I tried other shavers and now my Wahl is catching dust. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, out of the 8 items I purchased on Amazon this is the one I will write a view for.&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man and I use this to shave my beard.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> 2nd one so we like it but they don&#x27;t last very long.  Had to replace it after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This razor works above and beyond my expectations. I look forward to having it for many years.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned!  This is my 4th</li>
            <li> I bought this April 2013, so it is just 2 years old.  It no longer holds a charge.  I can shave one leg- and not the entire leg- on a full charge.  Put it in the charger last night and after 9 hours it ran for less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for something else to replace it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done with no irritation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for shaving the legs because electric razors don&#x27;t produce as close a shave as a regular razor. Good for the bikini zone.</li>
            <li> Would very well for all areas of the body, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great! Only cordless electric razor I found that works.</li>
            <li> Deal met expectations.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well for the price of it.  It does a good job and I have been using it for quite some time.  Holds a charge well and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how easy this was to use.  It is light and compact.  It really does a great job on leg hair!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11.  She has light brown hair on her legs and a lot of it.  I thought it was too soon to let her use a regular razor and bought her this one.  She was very happy with it and I was happy that she was not self conscious anymore.</li>
            <li> This razor literally pulls at the hairs as it removes them and it hurts...A LOT. I will not be purchasing another panasonic razor. I purchased this because after several years of use, my last razor (another brand) broke and this seemed reasonably priced. But it actually is a waste of money because it hurts so baldy I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve used it underarms and bikini. Disgusted.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing over 5 years so they don&#x27;t last a crazy long time but plenty long for the low price. Shipping from the seller I purchased from was a bit lengthy.</li>
            <li> My mother and my mom are both satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once. I was quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I love this shaver.  I haven&#x27;t used a regular razor  in years.  After about 2 years or when it dulls, I just buy another....much cheaper than razors.</li>
            <li> Love It!!! Love It!!! Especially when u have no time to shave! This shaver makes my legs feel smooth and ready to go!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver but do not know if I would order again. Does not seem to shave as well as I thought it would at  the time that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Was never a close enough shave, and then nothing. It broke a few weeks after using it. Price point was so low, I just chucked it. Switching to Safety Razors.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is so sensitive, that no matter what brand of razor or product used, she breaks out in a rash. She spends half the summer in long pants because she can only shave once every other week. I bought the Panasonic ES2207P ladies shaver to see if it produced the same effect as traditional razors.  The good news?  It doesn&#x27;t.  She can shave daily with no ill result.  It shaves remarkably close for an electric razor and the charge holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old one died. I had the same model and owned it for nearly a decade. I love this electric shaver, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it hurting but I&#x27;ve also never used it wet, maybe that&#x27;s the difference? Anyway, a great product and hope my new one lasts me as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this razor</li>
            <li> I bought one for my daughter and she lost the battery so I purchased another one for me and was share the battery - works well for both of us :)</li>
            <li> Works for those &amp;#34;omg I forgot to shave my legs but I&#x27;m in a hurry!!&amp;#34; Moments, but definitely not smooth to the touch. But to the eye, no hairy legs!</li>
            <li> It pulled my hair out.  Did not cut it.  Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 4 months now.  After looking for years...and sometimes using my hubby&#x27;s shaver....I decided to purchase this one.  Boy was I surprised!  Not only does it work great, but it holds a charge for a long, long time.  I have not had to replace blades yet....and that may be some $$ shock, but for now....all good.  Be very careful not to move the switch to the side or you will off-line it and may not be able to get it to function again.  I mean for the money.....you can&#x27;t expect German workmanship!  As for the shave...it is clean and close.  So far...5 stars.  It also comes in a very handy little bag for traveling....it is durable and very usable</li>
            <li> My bride really likes it!</li>
            <li> Much better than disposals.</li>
            <li> This product lasted just under 6 months under very light use. Panasonic&#x27;s warranty and customer service insist the consumer pay shipping to return for repair or replacement. Customer service says absolutely no exception. In my case, the cost of the return is $9 for the $18 item.  I am not amused. I will not purchase any Panasonic product again.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I get a very smooth shave with soap both underarms and legs.  I had a bad allergic reaction to disposable razors and have used electric since.  The price for this razor is comparable to what you would pay for a year&#x27;s worth of disposables so if this lasts a year I don&#x27;t feel like I have lost anything, nor have I created more waste than disposables would.  I think I have had this for 6 months now and it is still going strong so I anticipate more than a year&#x27;s usage.  UPDATE 11-04-14:  Still love this razor. Actually did the math and this is cheaper than disposables.</li>
            <li> I wnated a electric razor I could recharge and be able to use with simple cleaning afterwards. My old one needed to be bathed like in an alcohol product that was getting expensive. Also I had gone through 2 razors &amp; 3 charging stations. So when my last one died I said enough and checked reviews on Amazon for next one. After reading several good ones on this one, I bought it. I love it. It&#x27;s not the greatest razor, but for my needs it has worked great &amp; cleaning it is very simple.</li>
            <li> Great product to use in the shower or anywhere. Have been using for 2 weeks and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister in law. I have to assume she likes it I haven&#x27;t heard otherwise.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Remington.  Gives a consistently closer shave especially when using it wet with a good shave lotion.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I removed 2 stars from this razor becasue I really don&#x27;t like it. After having it for about a month I have only used it a couple times. It works great on my legs so if that&#x27;s the only area you are using it on then it&#x27;s a good razor but I cannot use it on any other area becasue it pulls and cuts my skin. The second time I used it it cut me to the point where I bled and had to use a bandaid. It&#x27;s horrible on my underarms. I found replacent heads for my remmington that I was using and I am going to purchase those becasue I loved my remmington but it was a few years old and started to cut me. I didn&#x27;t know I could buy a replacement head but now that I do I will definitely purchase them becasue my remmington is great on all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with Remmington.</li>
            <li> I returned the Panasonic shaver because it pulled the hairs on my chin.  I purchased it mainly to get rid of the &#x27;chin hairs.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Yup.. you can shave in the shower with this shaver.. Amazing ...I don&#x27;t know what else to say.. It works !!!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Much easier and faster than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver!  It really works well. The charger plugs into the electric socket so there is no cord to mess with. The shaver gives a very close shave on whatever body part it is applied to.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft product&lt;br /&gt;Nice styling, fits good.</li>
            <li> Best leg shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver. Does a close clean cut even on those annoying facial hairs.  I own a No-No and have been very unhappy with it. This does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This worked well but the base had a small clip piece that broke and now it does not stay on the charger. I will not be replacing it.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s not nearly as close a shave as a blade.</li>
            <li> My wife is so very happy...</li>
            <li> This ladies shaver is just the right size and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Loud, but extremely effective. My wife loves this shaver. Thanks,</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  Just go slow and there is no problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter to shave with so that she does not have to deal with a razor that might cut her.  While showing her how to use it, I fell in love with it as well!  It is a quick shave on my legs and can be used either wet or dry.  I love it!  I found that I cannot use it on my underarms, but my daughter has no issues with it on hers.  I definitely recommend this to someone starting out or someone who is looking for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Have used a few times and am happy with it.  I do find that when I shave under my arms, for a day or two, they seem to itch.  Because I am older and don&#x27;t have to shave my legs very often, this works great on my legs and no more nicks from a regular razor and much easier doing it outside of the shower than trying to bend in shower.  My daughter recommended this to me and so far, have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I was always nicking my legs when shaving and my husband didn&#x27;t want me using his razors. I love this&lt;br /&gt;shaver it&#x27;s a good quality, doesn&#x27;t nick my legs, I can use it wet or dry and it was a excellent price</li>
            <li> Wonder why I waited so long to mald this switch from safety razor to electric, love it so easy and never a nick</li>
            <li> We have purchased 2 of these shavers for my daughter, both have stopped working. The 1st was a throw away, the second was this:  [I can tell you that I took apart this shaver, as my daughters quit working as well. the charge disengage slide switch had some corrosion on it. I used 600 grit sand paper, cleaned the contacts, dabbed some tri flow (protectant) onto the contacts and now the unit is working again. This should not happen, though even a little moisture with allow for corrosion.]</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s easy to use anywhere, any time, and it doesn&#x27;t chap your skin. Say goodbye to nicks and scrapes accidentally caused by a razor! It saves lots of time and keeps the water bill down if you&#x27;re like me and need 30 minutes to shave in the shower every week. It is a close shave so there&#x27;s no stubble. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any ladies electric shaver can. Relatively close shave and good battery life. I am able to get a shave close enough that I can wear shorts or a skirt but it doesn&#x27;t give me that silky smooth that I want. I&#x27;d recommend it, just realize that you&#x27;re getting an electric razor and they can only do so much.</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly wonderful.  Shaves close and is easy to clean.  Charger is perfect.  Bought a second one as a gift.  Much better than traditional razors.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for over a year for a good shaver. I&#x27;ve had many bad ones in those long months. This is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Ladies, this works perfectly for those &#x27;special&#x27; sensitive areas that need a close shave. Arm pits too. No nicks, no hair pulling, no razor burns. I don&#x27;t care what any other reviewer says, best shaver hands down. Plugs into wall charger and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver.  It does a great job and is comfortable to use.  No negative issues.</li>
            <li> I like this electric shaver because of the flip up trimmer and because the handle is easy to hold on to. It does a pretty decent job of shaving but leaves stubble but it&#x27;s an electric shaver so I expected that. I like to shave my legs and armpits and I like to take my time going over those areas so the thing I didn&#x27;t like about this shaver is how quick the battery runs out. I hadn&#x27;t used it for a few days and when I went to use it the battery was completely dead so I recommend charging it a few hours before yo plan to use it. All in all I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent electric shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Best purchase of my life! I absolutely love this razor. Such a smooth shave every time and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to shave my legs anymore like with my old razor. 5-10 minutes and I&#x27;m done. I keep telling all my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> the wife says it good for her legs ...  ..I keep my legs hairy ...</li>
            <li> My wife loves these shavers. I have always had Panasonic shavers so we rate them well.... very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with razor burn for my bikini area. This electric razor has saved me from so much pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin and red hair (pretty much blonde hair on my legs). I only use the electric razor for the bikini area and not my legs, as it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave for my legs. Though, on the bikini line it&#x27;s perfect. I use the adjustable extending single blade only and it does exactly what I need it to. Does it come out perfectly smooth? No, it doesn&#x27;t... but it&#x27;s way better to have tiny hairs you can&#x27;t really see, than atrocious, painful, red bumps everywhere. I don&#x27;t know if the results are the same for someone with darker hair. Though, it really does get pretty close to smooth if you really try, so it may work out for those who have more pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an older version of this model, which I had to replace due to the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer. With that being said, I will continue to buy them as needed, because it is a life saver. Overall it is 4 stars for the product, but 5 stars for doing what I need it to at a good price.</li>
            <li> It shaves without pain.</li>
            <li> This razor is about a 2Stars...&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good for legs ,arms,and pits but i wouldnt recommend it for bikini area .</li>
            <li> I have only had this shaver for 3 months and for the last month the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as Remington wet/dry shavers I have</li>
            <li> Love this E razor. I have back and knee problems and I thought I would never be able to shave my legs again. BUT I can and with ease. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best ladies electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  Nice close shave with one swipe.  Leaves my legs feeling smooth, clean, and comfortable.  I can finally get rid of my other shaving stuff.  This one will take care of me.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a electric shaver, so I thought I wouldhelp out.&lt;br /&gt;This had some of the best ratings of all the shavers I looked at, and rightly so.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used in the shower, which is perfect.  Holds a charge for multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  No more nicks and scrapes.  Probably will not use it with water. Would highly recommend. Price is incredibly low for a shaver of this caliber.</li>
            <li> **Update**&lt;br /&gt;This razor battery lasted me less than a year before it would just drain quickly after being charged. I&#x27;ve since changed to a man&#x27;s highly rated razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Old Review**&lt;br /&gt;As a kid I had so many cuts from awful disposable razors. About ten years ago I finally upgraded to a Venus which was mediocre, then a Schick several years later [which I still love], but then after stealing my brother&#x27;s beard trimmer I realized that electric razors are WAY better. I did some research, and this was something in my price range that sounded good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this Wet/Dry shaver to so many women! All with the same reaction, &amp;#34;They make those for women?&amp;#34; Yes! And I don&#x27;t get awful bumps any more! I still get ingrown hairs, but not painful ones. I generally use this dry in the morning before running out the door, but it works well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*No more nicks, cuts, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;*Small enough to store, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.&lt;br /&gt;*Reusable, and cheaper than buying disposable blades/razors.&lt;br /&gt;*Has close shave, and a pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Trim longer hairs before using the trimmer [otherwise they get caught].&lt;br /&gt;*Have to charge after each use, otherwise if it sits in the draw for a bit I only get one leg shaved the next time.&lt;br /&gt;*It has to be plugged in to charge--there&#x27;s no cord to charge it while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;*Hard to plug anything else in the outlet other than this.</li>
            <li> Razor is ok, nothing special. Nice size and shape but does not give a smooth shave.  Would return if I kept the packaging.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 89 year old mother and it works fine for her. Easy and simple for her to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave but for me it is fine. What I love the most is that it charges right on the wall and takes up no space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before, but the charger was different.....I like this as it can be used wet or dry...and give a fairly close shave...you don&#x27;t cut yourself like you would with a razor.  Works best right after you get out of the shower and before you put on lotion.  The charge last for several uses and I take it camping with me!</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver at a really good price. I love the battery lasts as long as it does, and it does a good job overall. A lot of my previous shavers have been Panasonic, and each time I try something else I come right back and wonder why I left. I&#x27;ve had no issues to date after many months of ownership. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT!!  I am really impressed with the way this works!  I have always hated electric razors, but this one really works well and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver for a quick dry touch up shave, especially on my legs.  I used it wet under my arms and it caused the little red bump thing.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.  It holds the charge, it&#x27;s light weight, and fast.</li>
            <li> Good product, Fast service.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice now, but am impressed by how well it shaves.  My only concern is the way you have to charge the item.  It seems rather flimsy on how you are to attach the razor into the charger.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well on legs, but using it dry on underarms, it is not very good.  It leaves raised marks.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and immediately used it. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL!!! I&#x27;m not very flexible,  nor am I very stable... so shaving standing is impossible,  and shaving in the tub.. well, it&#x27;s a pain in the you-know-what. With regular razors, I get cut EVERYTHING TIME!... So getting this was a life saver! Instead of taking an hour or so to shave only half of my legs, now it only takes 20 minutes or less! Even better? No cuts, no blood, no nothing!  YAY!!!</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get, and a 2 year warranty for parts and labor. Not as close as a regular blade of course, but faster and more convenient.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace a stolen one.. Have been quite pleased with this item. Am keeping it hidden&lt;br /&gt;when not in use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife was skeptical when I bought this for her, but after using it a couple times she loves it. She loves being able to use it dry for a quick touch up or using it wet while relaxing in the bath. Only had it about 3 weeks and would highly recommend it, the only thing that could use some improvement which is why I only gave it 4 stars is the connection to the charger which is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> I have been using razors for years until I had hit a vein; so I decided to purchase an electric shaver; I wish I had done it years ago, there is nothing better for my legs and for the price it has real value.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 14 yr old daughter, this is her first razor ever! I read the reviews first cause I didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be painful to her. She had a lot of underarm hair and leg hair and was scared to use a regular razor. Which I can&#x27;t blame her. So after I read the reviews and said for price the value was worth trying this for her. I ordered it and received it and we both read the directions on how to use it. I asked if she wanted me to help her for the first use she said no and she did it on her own. We did let it fully charge for 24 hrs first by the way. So it took her about 10-15 minutes to do her underarms and legs dry. I asked to see, she showed me, and I was amazed!!!!! It did a fantastic job!!!! I asked her if it hurt at all? She said no not at all. I looked there were no cuts or nicks or anything, clean as can be. So YES highly recommend this, matter of fact I might even get one for myself!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife for x - mas she loved it when she opened it and uses it with no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used. I will never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good close shave on legs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the exact same razor from Target because it was on sale for $17.99 because I wanted to be able to return it if It didn&#x27;t work out for me without paying return shipping since I&#x27;ve never tried an electric razor.  I gave it a try because the razor blade cartridges are just so expensive.  What a pleasant surprise!  This little razor rocks!  I use it on my legs, arms and bikini area.  I use a traditional razor on my underarms because I just can&#x27;t seem to get the right angle, but I think it would work for most people.&lt;br /&gt;You use the pop up adjustment for your bikini area.  It works equally well wet in the shower or dry outside of the shower.  I prefer to use it dry because I can watch TV while I&#x27;ve shaving and it doesn&#x27;t seem like such a chore.  No more nicking my legs and no more red razor bumps!  You do need to be a little careful on certain areas of your bikini line because you can cut yourself with the pop up adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to go over your legs several times, unlike a traditional razor.  I think this is why some people plain that the shave isn&#x27;t as close.  They&#x27;re just giving it one pass by.  If you expect a close shave on your legs with just one swipe you will be disappointed.  It does take several, but who cares it you&#x27;re watching TV?  I do just one swipe on my bikini area and arms and works fine.  I&#x27;ve had my razor for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its better then my old shaver but Not as good as the $15 men&#x27;s travel razor I bought at the same time as this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she takes blood thinners and could bleed out if cut with razor.&lt;br /&gt;She has used this shaver many times and she loves it! Some how she got the idea this costs lots of money. What you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I owned this razor a few years ago and it finally wore out.  I purchased this one because I trust Panasonic and I have great results with this shaver.  I have never used it in the shower, I prefer to see my underarms in the mirror as I am shaving.  It works best if used every other day, allowing a bit of hair to grow back.  I would recommend this shaver as an easy alternative for those of us who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t use a blade.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it, what can I say happy wife happy life.</li>
            <li> This works wonders!  It really does get  a super close shave!</li>
            <li> Needed a new shaver, and this one is doing great.  Just use it dry, but will try it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Was a gift.  She enjoys it.  Works fine,  easy to use.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews of many units, was looking for something that would not irritate sensitive armpit areas, and could be used in the shower.  It indeed did not irritate, so it fit the bill perfectly.  The pop-out cutter pulls slightly so is not used much; if there is a need to cut hair shorter (in less sensitive areas) a light partial blade shave &amp;#34;with&amp;#34; the grain usually gets it short enough; but can&#x27;t get longer growth.  Will do 2 long sessions and will need a recharge, but will last many more sessions for limited areas and time.</li>
            <li> Finally an electric razor that works!!!!  As long as you trim long hairs first, there is no pulling when you try to get a close shave. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use on my underarms, legs, belly and bikini area and it works well on pretty much all the areas, but not 100%.  I have some short hairs around my belly button and it does get rid of those and leave me smooth there so im very happy with that, although there is some minor itching for about a day or so.  On my legs it also works well...great below my knees.  I was able to use it on my thighs which i usually never shave because of the terrrible itching but this left me pretty smooth and no real lasting itching, just a few minutes.  On my bikini area I cant really say if it worked well or not, as I did use another product down there before but needed to bring in some reinforcement as I didnt get the close shave i wanted with that product.  It did take care of some of the hair left behind by that product but not all, so i guess its not 100% there.  Dont know how it would have worked if I had not used that other shaver first though.  For my underarms, it works well though it does leave some stubble that i can feel more than see so no real complaints about that.  I love that i can use it really quick when im running out and need a quick touch up of my underarms.  I use it dry...tried it wet once and gave up pretty quickly on that.  Seems like it would take forever to shave wet and i really cant spend that much time in the shower what with all the itching.  All in all, a good shaver, works well all over.  I gave it 4 stars because it works well, but isnt perfect.  Oh, and I love that its rechargeable and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry this shaver pulled hair and left my skin and me, irritated. i am returning mine.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my facial and chin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have very soft hair on my face and this works well.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing and threading are too harsh and make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> well this was a replacement gift for my wife, I had purchased the ES2205 2 yesr ago which is no longer availible I guess. Of course the Es2205 is still working, my daughter loved it too and took it to college, my wife whined for weeks when it was gone.....so far my wife likes it and says it works as good as the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now 2012,,still in use &amp; no complaints,the older model(3 years old) is also too by my duaghter,  thank goodness the Panasonic name is holding up, one less item for the gift list, lol</li>
            <li> It works ok. A little better than a standard razor but I still need to use the standard to touch up. Battery life is passable, but needs a charge at least every other day. Pop up razor for longer hair is not useful. Decent for the price, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works just as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal.  Delivered on time and without any damage.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best electric razor I have found so far, and what makes it even better is the relatively low price. It gives a smooth shave without pulling the hairs, and doesn&#x27;t leave scratches or bumps behind. You can use it wet or dry - just don&#x27;t use it if the razor is wet and you are dry, as that doesn&#x27;t work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic razor sits firmly on the charger, which I like, as I have knocked other brands out of their charging bases and ended up with broken pieces. Also, it is fairly quiet. Unlike most shavers, it can go forward and backward and still cut hair; it doesn&#x27;t matter which way you hold it. Works well for underarms, too.</li>
            <li> Great little razor.  My tween loves it!</li>
            <li> Just love it!!!  It is so practical.  Love the fact that it is rechargeable and so easy to handle. Been shopping for months and spotted it on Amazon.  How convenient is that!! Delivered right to my door!!</li>
            <li> Not a real close shave for your underarms, but it you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I purchased as replacement for lost shaver.  I like the size and the wet and dry feature.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor !  I had tried other electric razors and did not get a close shave.  This one is excellent.  No more cuts every time I shave.  THANKS</li>
            <li> rips my hair out, hurts, i was hoping it would be good but i can&#x27;t handle it, it hurts too much to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really pretty happy with this so far. It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very close but for just trimming it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and lasted over 10 years. I am expecting this to do the same. It is very practical.</li>
            <li> Works very well, holds a charge, and gives my legs a close shave. If it had a light on front, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Barely works! I have to dig it into and drag across my skin, and even then it barely cuts hair at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. This was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair out.</li>
            <li> Yes . . . I liked it enough to buy three more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many different foil razors over the years, and this is the best by far.  Does a great job - close shave. Doesn&#x27;t require frequent charging and doesn&#x27;t snag your skin or pull as it is shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaved my legs right after taking it out of the box. It was fully charged and ready to go . The hair on my legs was longer than I would like to admit and this did a really good job. This is the first electric shaver I have ever used. I used it dry and was able to sit while doing it. Helps went you when you have knee and back problems.</li>
            <li> Buying disposable razors or even razors with disposable blades gets tiresome and expensive.  I decided to just go with something that didn&#x27;t need the constant attention.  This works perfectly for me and gives a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this sooner.</li>
            <li> GF loves this thing. Shave pubes and armpit hair, hell it shaves my chest in the shower. Charge lasts about 2 weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver for the price!</li>
            <li> The only problem my wife experienced was abrasion on underarms presumably from the trimmer head.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent! It cuts down so much time in the shower and while it may not be the suuuuuper smooth shave you get with a manual razor, it&#x27;s pretty darn close! It holds a charge great and it&#x27;s really easy to clean. I would highly suggest this to anyone looking to just keep things cleaned up. It also helped greatly cut back on razor burn on my under arms.</li>
            <li> get the job done...nice-neath and clean...</li>
            <li> Handy for quick touch ups</li>
            <li> This cute little shaver is a trooper! It works great and the battery lasts for a few times. I will buy again when mine dies.</li>
            <li> Tons of power,  smooth shave with almost zero chance of cuts, holds charge for several shaves</li>
            <li> Really surprised me how great a work it does compared to a normal razor. I didn&#x27;t expected that at all. Just thought &amp;#34;why not buy hen it is so cheap&amp;#34; and I am glad I bought it. Had to use on the same spot a few times but not irritating or anything at all. A great buying and really does the work, especially compared to the prize! :-D</li>
            <li> For its price its great, it gives me a pretty close shave.  I do have to shave everyday unlike with regular razors.  I have had absolutely no problem in the month I have had this shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t pull, easy to clean.  Quick and easy so I really enjoy having it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my aunt, she is very happy with it. It has a smooth shave, it has a very comfortable handling and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used my husband clippers on my bikini area &amp; end up with a few cuts. This shaver is so smooth and easy to use. No cuts &amp; it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> After all these many years, I finally broke down and got an electric razor.  Why I didn&#x27;t do this years ago is beyond me.  I love it.  It works great and is so easy to use.  It sure beats sitting in the shower with a straight razor and soap!!</li>
            <li> Use it several times a week and love it. I&#x27;ve had other razors but this one is the best I&#x27;ve had. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Stopped cutting after six months or so.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and works perfectly and meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver! and I was very impressed with how close a shave it gives.</li>
            <li> Works well dry or wet!  Good price...easy to use and recharge!</li>
            <li> I charged this bad boy for the initial 12 hours and after a month I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it. I use it just to shave armpits and probably average about once a week, so not very long, but it works great. A few things to note, use it in shower with water pouring down or when you are completely dry. Do not even think about attempting to shave a sweaty or damp armpit. You will have a razor burn unlike anything you could imagine. Wet great. Dry great. Damp&#x3D;screaming armpit agony.</li>
            <li> Funny, no sooner had I plugged in the shaver to charge, than my husband came to me with a grin on his face and showed me his freshly shaven neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said, &amp;#34;Hey, that&#x27;s not yours!&amp;#34; (but it did a good job even on his chicken neck)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me -- I&#x27;m thrilled to have an electric shaver again and this is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I guess no electric razor can give you the same shave you get from a blade, but this does an acceptable job. My legs feel nice and smooth when I shave them, but are stubbly by the next day. It is more convenient for me to shave this way than in the shower, though, so it is a good option for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in March and was so excited about using it for the summer season.  I have thick, dark hair on my legs so shaving would often be irritating, not to mention the annoyance of razor burn and cuts.  I thought an electric shaver would eliminate these things.  (Plus, this is a great, cheap shaver to try out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it has!  I had resorted to shaving with the grain with a traditional razor (to avoid ingrown hairs) and this shaver gets my legs smoother than that.  Granted, I usually would use this shaver every day or every other day, but the fact that it can be used dry makes it so much easier to use daily.  I&#x27;ve never tried it wet, but dry is just so much easier (just make sure your legs are actually dry and not damp, otherwise it will hop around).  I also put it on the charger every day after I use it (mostly so I know where it is), so I have never had a problem with the battery dying mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only annoying thing has to do with the nature of the foil shaver itself... so if you get lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a week or two, you really need to use the trimmer blades to shorten the hair before using the foil portion.  I think you can do maybe three, possibly four days in-between foil shaves.  Regardless, I still prefer it to a razor.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no irritation and very very few (if any) ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told most of my friends about using an electric shaver, and after feeling how smooth my legs are, almost all of them want to try it!  This shaver has made summer (and shaving) so much easier for me and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote:  If you wear glasses, this shaver is a great idea.  It&#x27;s so hard to see your legs in the shower when you can&#x27;t wear glasses, but the ability to use this shaver dry makes that problem non-existent!</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for the price.  It is fairly sturdy, does a pretty good job, and the battery carries a good charge.  I have to recharge it less than half as often as previous, more expensive models.  It&#x27;s light-weight, which is a plus for someone like me with carpel tunel issues, and easy to use.  It may not get as close as old-fashioned razors, but for an electric shaver it does well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that the shave is as close as my previous shaver. Otherwise, it is OK. The price was very good.</li>
            <li> ...and Buy New $19.88 new, $19.99 for blade set only.&lt;br /&gt;The new razor is less expensive than the blade and foil set that would be necessary to get her old razor up and running again.  I&#x27;d call this contrast a no-brainer,  but I wouldn&#x27;t want to offend anyone who has recently purchased the blade set for the Panasonic ES2207P.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves the shave these razors provide.</li>
            <li> close shave and quite. Not as loud as my old shaver.Love clor too!</li>
            <li> This shaver &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; fairly quickly. I can barely get both legs below the knee done before it needs to be charged again. Charging takes about 18 hours I think the instructions said. Also, as expected, it doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave but it does work for giving a shaved appearance.</li>
            <li> I think this item is the best It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your skin I wish I had purchased it long ago</li>
            <li> Not a heavyweight or close shaver but perfect for quick whisks to keep my legs looking neat.&lt;br /&gt;Cordless means I can use it out in the backyard.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts at least 10 minutes, which is the longest I have used it at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my dog, a Lhasa Apso, but it didn&#x27;t work - need a tougher clipper for that.&lt;br /&gt;For about $20 I can buy one a year if necessary and still not pay as much as it would cost for a presumably high-end shaver.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience no electric shaver gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I like that the charger plugs directly into the outlet - no cord to bundle! The shaver holds its charge well and does a good job. I have only used it dry, but have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Worked for six months now its dead in the water</li>
            <li> Got this as a starter shaver for my 10 year old.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I didn&#x27;t find any other suitable options for a starter.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor in many years.  I was thrilled to find that they are much improved.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I had one before and liked it, but the battery did not keep the charge .Since the battery cannot be replaced, I had to replace the shaver after about 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> Works well and I like the color, it even comes with a warranty. Would recommend to purchase one and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This works very well for me.  Older now and can&#x27;t seem to shave without cutting myself.  This solves that problem.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this shaver. Does not give me nicks or any cuts. I feel confident that I can shave off unwanted hair and not start to bleed. Great shaver!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before and it has always done what it needed to do.  No bells and whistles, but it gets it done.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job...... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver!  Does a good job consistently.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I read some reviews that said their&#x27;s stopped working, but I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and a half and it&#x27;s still going strong! When I first bought this I was desperately trying to find something to shave with for my twin brother&#x27;s wedding. I was a bridesmaid and the dress was short. Every time I used a razor I got little red bumps that burned and itched. I tried numerous razors, shaving creams, soothing products, etc. NOTHING worked. I really didn&#x27;t want to have polka-dotted legs at my brother&#x27;s wedding.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I came across this. I was really excited at the idea, since it said it was great for sensitive skin. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive, so I tried it. It worked great! My legs were smooth and there wasn&#x27;t a bump or burn in sight! This is the only thing I will shave with!&lt;br /&gt;It works both wet and dry for me. Dry is great when I get sudden invites to go swimming or hot-tubbing, and wet is great for in the shower. It&#x27;s quick, easy and painless! If mine ever breaks (and that will be a sad day indeed) I would definitely get another one. No more razors for me!</li>
            <li> A great shaver for the money.  I have really used it a lot and is nice and sharp.  It holds the charge quite well.</li>
            <li> I am testing, but for now, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave, but works well enough for a quickie shave in between shaving with a real brazor.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 10 weeks ago, looking for an alternative to cartridge razors.  It worked fine for awhile; it didn&#x27;t give me a really close shave, but I prefer that to the hell that is razor burn EVERYWHERE.  However, one day I picked it up after charged, and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on!  I thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s OK, that happens, I&#x27;ll just call warranty service to get a battery replacement.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Panasonic&#x27;s warranty service is a joke!  Their phone tree never lets you talk to anyone - it just advises you to try online.  But their online warranty website appears to be inoperable - you can&#x27;t do anything without an account, but account creation appears to be irrevocably broken.  So the 2-year limited warranty for product failure is essentially null and void from the start.  I found this very frustrating - not really because of the money I lost, but because of the poor business practices exhibited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to any women considering this product due to sensitive skin: try safety razors instead.  You get a closer shave, free from razor burn, and since it&#x27;s all-mechanical, the chances of the razor randomly breaking one day are about zero (Michael Ham&#x27;s book on shaving is a good beginner&#x27;s resource).  But if you&#x27;re really set on an electric razor, buy one that either has a removable batteries, or a razor with a company other than Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good product and uneventful service.</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectations for an electric shaver.  It is great for quick shaves for hitting the pool or beach at the last minute.  The charger is nice and small and takes up little space.  The blades are sharp and I have not experienced any pinching or pulling when shaving.</li>
            <li> Fits well in your hand, easy to use and good result.  I use dry - not in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a year now. It&#x27;s held up well. Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and no problems thus far</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Compact shape, easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;* Works wet or dry, making it wonderfully flexible.  Personally I think it works a bit better on dry skin, but if I forget to do it first thing, I can just as easily bring it in the shower.  (It does not work as well on skin fresh out of the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;* Good battery. Lasts for a few shaves and if you don&#x27;t shave often, does not seem to drain between shaves. I&#x27;m not sure of its max charge since I tend to recharge it after a few uses, but I&#x27;ve never had the annoyance of having the charge run out mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;* Does not shave as closely as a razor -- no electric shaver will -- but closer than the other two electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy enough to clean. Bottom third pops out partially, blow on it.  Whole thing pulls out if additional cleaning is needed.&lt;br /&gt;* Surprisingly durable.  I heard an odd buzzing sound from our front-loading washer one afternoon. Opened it up mid-cycle and found this shaver, buzzing away.  It had somehow fallen into the hamper and then made its way to an unintentional deep cleaning, and been switched on as it bounced up and down and around.  Pulled it out, shook it off, and crossed my fingers.  Months later, it still looks and functions as if brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* None that I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas (2014) after reading the reviews.  New Years Day, I asked how she liked it so far.  She says it&#x27;s great for her legs as it causes no skin irritation, unlike razors.  But, she refuses to use it on more sensitive areas because it pulls hair occasionally.  I doubted this, so attempted to shave my 2-day facial hair growth with it.  Ouch!  Every once in awhile, it in fact DOES pull hair!  I researched the Panasonic website, users manual, and can&#x27;t see that we&#x27;re using it wrong.  It has sat on the charger plenty. It just is what it is, I suppose.  I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic ES8243 for 3 years (Christmas present from wife) and have only changed the blades ONCE.  No hairs pulled and it still runs like a top.  We both agree that mine is the better razor.</li>
            <li> Like using it in the shower, but shave not as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to write this review, since I wanted to be absolutely sure before I gave it the glowing recommendation I felt it deserved. I first purchased this razor 2 years ago, and it drastically changed my life. It cuts close enough to be smooth, but not close enough to give me ingrown hairs or razor burn. It&#x27;s a dream around the bikini line--so much easier and cheaper than waxing, and (as long as you exfoliate afterward) no little red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About three months ago, I started getting very sad, since my little razor just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore (haha). I had to do three or more passes to get my legs really smooth. I started doubting if this panasonic razor had ever been as awesome as I had thought it was. So do you know what I did? I came back to Amazon and ordered another one. It came in a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;m back in the dream life. Quick, fast, close shaves that leave me falling in love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, here is the conclusion. The warranty on this buddy is 2 years long, which is how long it takes the blade to dull with constant use. Either way, you&#x27;re going to be getting about 2 years of good shaves out of the Panasonic. Is that worth $18? Why yes. Yes it is. I think I saved that much on shaving cream alone by using it. I wholeheartedly recommend this one to anyone interested in making the switch to electric. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on usage: If you have anything more than stubble on your legs, you&#x27;re really going to want to use the pop-up trimmer first. This doesn&#x27;t slow you down too much though, since you can just do some quick swipes and then switch to the foil. Also, this is a wet/dry razor, but I definitely prefer to use it dry. It gets closer, and it means no shaving cream involved. I just take it into the shower, shave, and then turn on the water. Finally, make sure that your razor is fully charged each time you use it, or you won&#x27;t be seeing it at 100%.</li>
            <li> Obviously doesn&#x27;t work as well as a razor.  But does what you&#x27;d expect from an electric</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worked properly... not only that, on September 2014 I bought it for my wife and now on January 2015 it stopped working. I don&#x27;t know what the hell is happened to it.Probably my wife used it for 8-10 times. Amazon delivered me so many things but in between all of them this is the worst.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin - shaving makes me break out into hives....and I always have at LEAST 5 nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using this, no more hives, no nicks. I left the charge base behind at a hotel before - it was cheap enough that I could just order a new one.</li>
            <li> This razor works really good. I have very sensitive skin and it has decreased the amount of razor rash I get under my arms. I still get quite a bit on the bikini line but overall this razor has been great; the charge lasts a long time and I prefer to use it dry versus wet.</li>
            <li> This product is as ad. states. Very please with it. It is durable, My wife drop it in the bath room. Parts went everywhere but it worked when I put it back together. She loves it. Received it it four days, yea yea.</li>
            <li> This shaver works fine for me, it remove the close hair under my chin.  After trying many other brands, this one really did the JOB.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I would recommend this shaver to others.</li>
            <li> This shaver is all that it was advertised to be. It is especially quiet, nice shape for holding and does a fine job shaving (a little slower than using a razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected). I love the fact that it is rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t use batteries that just have to be thrown away and cause more garbage. It is also a plus that it can be used wet or dry and that it is easily rinsed to keep it clean. If you get razor burn from a razor, consider trying this shaver as I find that doesn&#x27;t happen at all. There are not that many budget priced rechargeable wet/dry shavers out there so if this is what you want, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Is this the same as a razor in the shower?  no.  But wow.  It is close enough for me!!  Especially considering the price is so low.</li>
            <li> When attempting to clean item with the brush that came with the kit, the inside blade fell off and I could not get it back. The shaver is not working due to the above.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for legs if you are pressed for time or missed some hairs in the shower around the ankles. Tried it on underarms after operation and it just ripped up my skin...</li>
            <li> was worried this wouldn&#x27;t work well but it works very well.  holds charge great, easy to clean, good price. would buy again</li>
            <li> I got this for my young daughter who is too young to shave with a razor but was worried about teasing at school for her dark hairy legs. She loves it and uses it regularly. It stopped her from refusing to wear shorts and dresses. Now she feels confident and happy about her legs.</li>
            <li> This product is very handy if you just need to shave because you&#x27;re going out or its a surprisingly nice day outside, however you will start to notice stubble the next day! A great dry shaving option (though I would recommend moisturizing beforehand, not too heavily!) that is easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing, has used it for some time now, and has yet to charge it.  No issues thus far.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for about 1.5 years, then dies.  I have purchased two of them and the same thing has happened all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind spending about $20 and using it for approximately a year to 1.5 years then you will be really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great shave, however I might try something different to see if it will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. The price is great. It&#x27;s easy for a woman to hold. It does a good job. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....nothing special, but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch or for a travel razor.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Razor I have bought like this. Bought one for my Daughter and she&lt;br /&gt;liked it so much I bought one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Works Great</li>
            <li> so far I have used it several times and it does not pull or cut my skin...I can only say that I really like it and glad I bought it, I also didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric razor. No nicks or cuts and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon a few years ago and it&#x27;s still running strong.  I&#x27;ve not had a single complaint about it.  I have sensitive skin and this works perfectly for it and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  The shave, of course, isn&#x27;t nearly as close as it would be if you were to use a blade, but hello, I don&#x27;t want to use a blade!  I can live with it.  It gets pretty darn close.  I use it on my legs, pits, and my chin and sometimes my upper lip and it&#x27;s never given me a rash, pulled hair, or any of the other horror stories that some of the reviews are saying.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those women in their 40s who have those wild hormones. I&#x27;ve had facial hair since my mid-30s, and tried a variety of things to get rid of it. I have coarse hairs, so using anything for finer hair? Forget it! I came across this shaver online, and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! It gives me a close shave, and is easy to use and clean. I know I&#x27;ll always keep one of these handy for years to come. Thanks to Panasonic for making this little gem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver, but I love it.  It gives me a close shave without the hassel of shaving cream &amp; water!  Also it holds a charge so you can use it anywhere, but not while driving!</li>
            <li> Not a close shave at all. Left red bumps.</li>
            <li> Did not remove any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Was given as a Christmas gift and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver since I was 16 or 17 years old. I don&#x27;t ever recall it giving a great shave always felt I left hair behind. I haven&#x27;t used the shaver in years as I am in my mid 20s now but my sisiter tried to use it a year or two ago and the battery was so dead it no longer charged anymore. It has been so long since I used it I don&#x27;t remember much of the results. If I don&#x27;t remember much then I guess it&#x27;s not all that great. I think I remember the bikini shaver extention scratching me. Which was my fault not being to careful.</li>
            <li> Decent razor, especially for the price. I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it! I have had a couple of instances of it pulling hairs, but that seems rare.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, wet or dry it does a great job on my corse italian hair. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not too noisy and it gets the job done comfortably. Really happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looked and looked for a woman&#x27;s razor....this one is great...very pleased and very reasonably priced..a WIn Win..thank you so much....</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> great price works great</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 11 year old.  Easy to use, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to charge and hold while using</li>
            <li> Like this a lot...handy and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who is a bit bothered by normal razors.  It is well build and guaranteed safe for use, even by the novice.</li>
            <li> Works well, light weight and quiet. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, works great for my legs. I used to get allergies from shaving, since using this I am allergy free. I have been using it for about 2 years now, maybe longer. I have had several other electric razors, (conair, braun.. you name it ) and none has worked as good as this one. I would recommend it to anyone, based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This works okay for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me, used it once and it did the job.  I did my legs and underarms.  I was a little skeptical after seeing the picture where the ladies legs are all scratched up after shaving using this product but glad I made the purchase.  Hopefully it will last!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. It&#x27;s her first electric shaver and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than my old Remington shaver. Have only used as dry shaver so far and it does the job you&#x27;d expect from an electric versus blade. Visually no hair, but not as smooth of course as a blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I was tired of spending so much money on razor blades. I love it! If you go over your legs twice, you get a close shave and no razor burn. I have super sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not very good for shaving your legs</li>
            <li> The charger plugs directly into an outlet.  If you don&#x27;t have a convenient outlet then it&#x27;s not convenient.  I had to plug it In the laundry room.</li>
            <li> Our 90 year old recipient loves it for her chin!!!</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job for an electric. I still use a regular razor on my pits but this works fine on my legs. If you need your legs to be absolutely smooth &amp; silky to the touch a regular razor might work better for you. If you want to look clean &amp; smooth, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it seems like ladies electric shavers have been getting worse and worse as the years go by.  I purchased this solely to trim my bikini area and it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave at all.  I went back to the device that I used before this, even though it is old and slightly rusty.  I&#x27;ll take my chances since at least it gives me results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Still leaves a little stubble, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor leaves leg skin completely smooth, so I am reasonable happy with this&lt;br /&gt;razor and am using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Nice and safe and works well</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get, but it&#x27;s so easy to use that if you want to shave again the next day it&#x27;s no big deal. Works just great.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and it still works great.  If and when it gives out I intend to get another one!</li>
            <li> Seems to be great product since my wife loves it, and is happy to use it every time.</li>
            <li> I love it.....beautiful to look at and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for a men&#x27;s razor that has this design. The leading clippers make this the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I generally use a straight razor but was told post hip surgery to use an electric shaver. I just wanted something reasonable to use for 8 weeks pre and post surgery, but the shaver works so well, I might never go back to my straight razor.</li>
            <li> Gf loves this razor.  Ordered this one after she was unhappy with one she bought at target for $10 more than this.</li>
            <li> Pretty good electric razor.  Does not give the close shave I am used to with my regular razor but a great time saver when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Love this baby! With soap, it left me as smooth as a razor, but without the expensive blades and razor burn. Tried it with conditioner on my legs once and it gummed up the blade so I wouldn&#x27;t do that again. And for $14, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I had the first for many years and loved it. I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my preteen daughter to start shaving her legs and to avoid razor cuts.  It worked great!  Her first time shaving and it took all the hair off and left a smooth leg.  I could not believe how good it did on a never before shaved leg.  I decided to use it too and have not picked up a razor since.  Although it is not as completely 100% smooth as a razor it is very close and the hair seems to take longer to grow back than when using a razor.  We are both very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone of our female friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent working, without battery exchange and using the charging instead, I like it that way, it saves much. And also, it&#x27;s working efficiently.</li>
            <li> Overall, no real complaints. It is great for a quick shave. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor does, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to. I can usually use it a few times before I need to charge it again.</li>
            <li> i received shaver yesterday. packaging was great. i&#x27;ve already used the shaver works great. i would recommend to anyone. nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this on here, before a year passed the battery died. Or the charger. Idk. I didn&#x27;t have a receipt obviously. I went and bought a new one because I have faith. When it works great, it works GREAT. Close shave. Fast shave. All the good stuff. I did keep the receipt this time though.. and will update if it cruds out on me again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new one on July 26th, it is now October 22 and it is lasting a mere 2 MINUTES before dying :(</li>
            <li> Good product especially when you have very fine leg hair,  maintains a charge for a good time, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this Panasonic, especially when compared to the Remington I have been using for the past several years.  The closeness of the shave for something at this price point is exceptional.  I should be glad the Remington quit holding a charge and forced me to buy something to replace it.  Great job, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> works pretty good ... doesn&#x27;t bite knee bones or ankles and manages armpits pretty well.  I have had it for a few months now and it still works fine.  Read some other reviews that it dies after six months, but if I can get six months out of a $17 electric razor I will still save money over disposable razors.</li>
            <li> this shaver is great  it shaves very close and quick good for travel i only wish it was a bit smaller overall i love it and i am so glad i bought it and great price too</li>
            <li> This does so many body parts, I may never shave anywhere again! I had to run out the other day, so while showering I took care of all body hair that was bothering me in record time. I looked and felt great!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would save money from having to buy razors all the time but this is not for course  hair. If it is I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it. It was a waste purchase for me. The generic razors at Target meet my needs much better than this did. May work for finer hair.</li>
            <li> I should have read more of the 1 star reviews before purchasing this item.  I had the same results many of the 1 star raters had.  This worked great while it did work, however, mine also died without any reason after a few months.  Plugged it in after it slowed down and the next day, nothing.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Plugged it in for a longer period of time, nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Works great- holds the charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful--Simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this. I hate shaving, and i hate using the stinky creams. I will usually try to wear pants as much as possible to avoid shaving my legs but i thought i should try this and found it easy, fast, and pain free.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to just give up on electric razors.  None of them work well.  Seems easier and safer, but not if they aren&#x27;t efficient.</li>
            <li> Had for months.  Great for touch ups when you don&#x27;t have time to shower and shave. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is a convenient alternative to shaving with a razor in the shower, but with a few big caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, no matter what technique I try, the shaver always pulls some of my hair and occasionally knicks me. The trimmer is even worse - it pulls hard enough around areas that would be veiled should I be in a bathing suit that I refuse to use it anymore.  Again, this occurs no matter how slowly I go, how charged the shaver is, or from what angle I approach my legs. I have yet to have an ouch-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the dry option doesn&#x27;t work very well for me. By this I mean that I have to go over the same spot about three times in order to get an even shave.  Even then, the final result is still just okay. I can feel and see more stubble than my old (OLD) Remington wet/dry shaver used to leave behind. The wet option does a much better job for me, but only when I use a thick shaving cream. As long as I do that, and don&#x27;t mind the shaver knocking off a good bit of the cream on surrounding areas not yet shaved, I get a very smooth and close shave with only minimal tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the power charger annoying, as I do not always have access to a plug that has space for the razor to sit on top in the vertical orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these issues, I keep this around for the times when I need a quick touch-up and don&#x27;t have access to or time to take a shower, simply because I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve never had an electric one before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but the shave wasn&#x27;t quite as close as I was hoping for. BUT it&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning and I feel like wear shorts that day!</li>
            <li> For the price this is worth a try.  I love it.  I shave my legs dry and it does a fabulous job.  My underarms are a little more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and the first time I used it on my pits, I used soap and water.....it did the job better than a razor but I had alot of irritation and a rash, so the next time I lathered up with sensitive shaving cream and had no rash or \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.  Haven&#x27;t used it in my \\&quot;girl\\&quot; place yet, but I&#x27;ll be lathering up with the sensitive shave cream first :-) I will recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Just got mine yesterday and I&#x27;m already in love. I have a spinal injury and shaving is terribly difficult. I have to sit in a chair in the shower and can&#x27;t do all the bending over to shave. I can only shave my legs once or twice a week and it&#x27;s MADDENING!! As soon as I got it yesterday I tore open the box and tried it out. I shavedvmy legs sitting in my chair in about 10-15 minutes. I love it! Shipping was super fast, it arrived already charged, and I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO LIVE WITH HAIRY LEGS ANYMORE!! WOOHOO!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this razor when I bought it. It worked well both wet and dry as advertised, gave a very close and non-irritating shave, and the charge lasted a long time. However, after using it 2 or 3 times a week for about 3 months, it randomly stopped turning on. I&#x27;ve tried charging it and it seems to be completely dead. I think I&#x27;ll invest in a higher quality razor so that I don&#x27;t have to replace it every few months.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a personal shaver for a long time and settled on a cheapy one that hardly worked (costing me about $8) then I saw this one and read the reviews which are mostly good. It is a great buy for the price and quality of the shaver! It definitely works better dry than wet though it does specify that you can use it in the shower. I love the pop up trimmer blade and the close shave blade leaves my skin feeling smooth all day. I do think it works best for the bikini area - I tried it on my legs and underarms one time on a trip when I forgot my regular none battery operated razor and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it does in the bikini area. I would totally recommend this razor and I am actually going to buy one for a friend of mine who has tried most methods of bikini hair removal with little success.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the answer to my hectic week. It work dry, and takes some getting use to wet. But yes it does work. I love the design and the punch. I comes with cleaning brush and adjust to trim close in.... a must have for busy young women { mothers this is awesome} Great for the 3 minute showers. trying to look their best. The charge is OK. it&#x27;s good for 10 or so 3 minutes session.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading the other reviews for this item.  The price seemed like a good value and the ratings were good.  I used the razor for the first time yesterday and it seems to work well without cutting the skin on my knees and bikini line.  My old razor that was a different brand has been cutting me under my arms and I threw it in the garbage and ordered this one.  This is comfortable to hold and does the job.  I haven&#x27;t use to for my underarms yet and have only used it once, so that is why I am giving it 4 starts instead of 5. I think for the price you will not be dissapointed in this razor. I charged it for the recommended 12 hours and it is fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I finally found an electric shaver I like! It works great. I mainly use it dry, but tried it wet and liked it. The shaver fits my hand good, and the charger is small and convenient.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Este fue un peque&amp;ntilde;o regalo a mi esposa y cada vez que la utiliza me dice lo buena que es esta afeitadora. 100% Recomendada</li>
            <li> I purchased this rechargeable shaver to reduce the waste of disposables. However, the quality is poor and I do not recommend this model. It stopped holding a charge almost immediately and within four months was unable to be recharged at all. Even when fully charged, it was difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It works pretty well on dry skin but barely works at all on wet skin. This was my first electric razor so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other brands.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was great, but it only lasted 7 months before it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for the wife, she loves it!</li>
            <li> For the price it does a better than average job. It is great for quick touch shaves. I would order it again and feel any user would appreciate having one.</li>
            <li> It does the job for sure, but not the close shave as a razor would. Because of its convenience I dry shave my legs whenever I wear shorts but I find that the shave lasts maybe a day. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower however my purpose of this purchase was to not have to take the long showers to shave. Overall it works to my needs and it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Does everything that the manufacturer said it does and does it very well. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to any one considering buying a ladies razor.</li>
            <li> working as expected and no complains so far. Worth for the money we are spending I would recomend this who are expecting best restuls in a budget.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite electric razor.  I&#x27;m on my third one.  And not that the product is defective, it is just been on the market many years now and I give it a workout.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a closer shave, but it holds it charge well.</li>
            <li> not what I expected, it does not work as good as my $5 battery powered shaver.  Three blades that does nothing but glides over the skin, useless for me.</li>
            <li> Just a good electric razor. No more bumps</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased sooner, just a nice little tool that makes grooming quick &amp; easy !</li>
            <li> My shaver arrived quickly and I was delighted to find it was charged and ready to perform right out the box.  It handled well and was fairly quiet to operate.  The compact charger eliminates the awkward cord, is easy for travel and a space saver to store.  Cuts close the first time. I did not need to go over the same area several times.  I am extremely hairy and usually wax, however, great to have something reliable for those times when you can not.  Previously pucrhased a Remington WDF-4820 wet dry shaver for a lot of money.  Attempted to use it on 4 different occasions, each time it left scratches on my legs and in my armpits but failed to remove the hair.  Unfortunately, I did not use it till it was time to travel and by then the receipt was no where to be found.  Still plan on sending it back and writing them a nasty letter.</li>
            <li> As a fella, I tried three different brands of electric shavers for men, all of which were horribly disappointing and extremely expensive, before giving this one a try, which turned out to be far superior than the others.</li>
            <li> very nice first electric I have had</li>
            <li> Everything is good, except that the battery need to charge so much longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Good as quality point of view.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but my wife still hasn&#x27;t used it. I guess it will last longer that way.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because I don&#x27;t like shavers that lift and cut off the hair below the skin. Basically you get a close shave enough to not see the hair but there is still hair there. To me that is wonderful because I use it on my face and I don&#x27;t want my face hair to grow back darker and thicker that is why this shaver is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried on my legs and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are one that wants a really really close shave, this would not be for you. If you are one that wants a good enough close shave, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> For real its useless it is making sensitivity and cleaning is hard too&lt;br /&gt;battery is kind of good but its still useless</li>
            <li> I still prefer the close shave of a razor, but this works well for touch-ups and when there isn&#x27;t time for a detailed shave. The battery lasts for several weeks if only used now and then. Overall best electric razor I have found so far.</li>
            <li> i have used it for several weeks, do not have any complain.  it works well, much more efficient than blades</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these shavers, because they always seem to die on me. Mostly I shave my underarms and legs, but it seems the motors like to burn out after a few months. I keep coming back to this shaver because it is the only electric shaver that has actually worked for me. I spent a considerable amount of money on a Braun shaver, but the shave wasn&#x27;t as close and it left me with razor burn. I have used disposable razors in the past, but I feel like I am constantly throwing them out and buying new ones (and they are so expensive nowadays).</li>
            <li> OMG, this thing hurt so bad.  It felt more like plucking than shaving. I did everything that first reviewer said to do but still it hurt so bad.  It just seems like the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough or something. The trimmer&#x27;s a joke and doesn&#x27;t do anything. The close shave does come very close to an actual razor but at the pain of plucking or waxing. Good God I returned this thing immediately.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter last Christmas, she love&#x27;s it, it does the job nicely for the price. Would recommend to anyone looking for a basic shaver. A plus that it is rechargable.</li>
            <li> I have searched for years for this product. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but every time I shaved the more sensitive areas, I had terrible bumps. This razor eliminated that problem from the first time I used it. Never going back to the disposables.</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver for price!&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well, though I thought it would shave closer. It shaves about as close as a manual shaver. Just thought it would be closer than it did. I shaved with it dry and it did good so maybe wet it will be closer, I will give it a chance and update my review.</li>
            <li> I returned this.  It pinched and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic close curves rechargeable wet/dry ladies shaver and it has been a lot more than I thought it would be.  My legs are smooth and silky after each shave either wet or dry.  It is so easy to maintain and I would recommend it 100 %.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well dry, and haven&#x27;t gotten up the nerve to try it wet.</li>
            <li> Close shave, The carrying pouch isn&#x27;t vertu big. It&#x27;s hard to fit the shaver &amp; charger togather in it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving in and out of shower. Love it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Leg shaving has always been a daunting task for me. One of my hips is very inflexible so it&#x27;s difficult for me to reach everywhere on my leg to shave. I&#x27;m also blind as a bat without my glasses, so while in the shower I am often missing huge portions of hair because I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing (and my glasses fog up in the shower so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see through them any way). As a result I almost never shave my legs. And once they get to sasquatch proportions, forget it. I can&#x27;t get a razor through that. I had an electric leg shaver many years ago that left a lot to be desired. It never gave me a close shave so it just never seemed worth using. I decided recently to give electric shavers another try, figuring if I had the same result as before, at least it would get my hair short enough that I could shave it with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is nothing like my previous one. While it doesn&#x27;t get my legs as smooth as a razor it comes pretty darn close! And now I can shave my thighs which I did even more rarely than shaving my shins! I haven&#x27;t tried using this in the shower, I&#x27;ve only dry shaved with it. The only reason I give this shaver 4 instead of 5 stars if because of the pop up trimmer. This thing just grabs hair and yanks on it. It&#x27;s painful to use so I don&#x27;t bother with it. If I have longer hair to trim, I use one of my husband&#x27;s shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say this shaver died after 6 months of use. I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review if that happens to me. But for now, I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well.  Pulls my hair a little but noting bad</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She likes it so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on past reviews - it really works good.  I hardly have to charge it.  I only use on my underarms every couple of days but it seems to work great.  There is a pop up feature that allows you to shave longer hair and then just push it back down to get a clean shave to the skin.  I clean it with a little alcohol on a tissue after each use and it has been doing a great job! I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower just yet, even though it is waterproof, so I can&#x27;t comment on that feature.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry and I&#x27;ve never cut myself since using this to shave. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> For the price of this razor, I am thrilled. It does a better job than my much older and much more expensive razor (which recently died). I have only used it dry as I use a regular razor in the shower. But it works great, giving me smooth legs without any skin irritation. I have only had it about a month so I cannot attest to its long-term durability. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with the other model. This one has a much smoother shave. I hope it lasts longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> It works great. Better than a razor.</li>
            <li> Great for in between razor shaves.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much but it&#x27;s not very sturdy.  Won&#x27;t make it past two drops in the shower.</li>
            <li> Panasonic:  you have out did your with this shaver, and I have been using these type shavers since they came out years ago.</li>
            <li> I like the angle and the curved head.  It makes a for quick clean up before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like very much.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 2nd one for the misses, she loves this razor and I loved the price.&lt;br /&gt;1st one has been working for over a year and 2nd one is for her travel bag for work.&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
            <li> After looking at many of these types of shavers and going through their reviews, I chose this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It works well and is perfectly suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely, is quiet and collects hair inside the shaver rather than leaving a film of hair on the floor or toilet seat where I usually prop my legs for dry shaving.  I only use on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years. I have also tried everything short of expensive laser hair removal, and this razor, so far, is wonderful. I&#x27;m not yet seeing the ingrown hairs I usually get, so maybe this is FINALLY the method that doesn&#x27;t cut the hair below skin level to where the hair can&#x27;t grow out of it successfully. I usually end up with a tweezer plucking ingrown hairs out, and then waiting for those spots to heal up, and then shaving and having the all-clear for legs and skirts for about a week before the ingrown hairs show up again... Time will tell, I guess, but so far I&#x27;m pretty excited about this one!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m purchasing this Panasonic shaver.  I liked the first one so much, I bought another.  It does a wonderful job, gives a nice, close shave and goes a long time on a single charge.  What I don&#x27;t understand is why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as the whole shaver costs.</li>
            <li> Okay gals, so here&#x27;s the scoop on this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver for my daughter after my frustration grew listening to her complain about constantly nicking herself with her Venus razor.  I put it in her Christmas stocking last year, and she just recently revealed to me that it was her favorite (and most practical!) present she received last Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her favorite feature is the wet/dry feature.  She is a busy college student and says that she loves that she can use this shaver dry and for quick touch-ups.  She has very sensitive skin and the hypo-allergenic blades and foils are a perfect match for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas, I plan on buying the ES2207P for all of the women in my life. Please ladies I beg you, do yourselves a favor and buy this shaver! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This shaver worked for one battery full and now wont charge.  Tried several sockets but still not working.  And of course, its not returnable because of the  time constraints.  What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It worked well for the short time that it worked. You can&#x27;t really be too picky about the close shave of an electric razor, so I can&#x27;t say anything negative about that. However, the product itself was very cheap. After about two months of using it a few times a week it just started being very difficult to turn on. I discovered that the switch had come loose on the inside - the product turns on by pushing up a large button on the outside, but that actually just flips a very small, flimsy plastic switch on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed, because I truly liked the razor. After seeing the poor design, however, I decided not to purchase another one. I just counted my losses, tossed it, and ended up purchasing a [[ASIN:B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]], despite its bad reviews... I&#x27;ve had it for about double the time of the Panasonic one and it&#x27;s still working great. It&#x27;s possible that my experience with the Panasonic shaver was a fluke, but I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance.</li>
            <li> Very good design &amp; easy to use.  I bought the item when I injured my right hand and it proved very functional.  It definitiely met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Well, as others have said, it will last a good 5 years. Mine finally started acting &amp;#34;wonky&amp;#34; after 5 1/2 years. I just ordered another one. Also, I replaced the head last year and the new blades were great. I&#x27;ll keep it for a spare. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Love my razor. It was a replacement. I do enjoy it. It&#x27;s always ready to use when kept on the charger. Easy to hold, &amp; cuts well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shave and runs very quiet. The price was right! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver.  Beats a lot of others I&#x27;ve had that cost a lot more. Holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver in the shower and have little issues. There are occasions where I get a nick here and there on my armpits, however, I&#x27;m not too worried about that. I have used this shaver outside of the shower a few times, but I find myself using lotion afterwards, because my legs would get too dry. I would still recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using this every other day since then also tried it myself on my face and does work great wet or dry</li>
            <li> This little razor is easy to use, does a really good job leaving me feeling smooth after the shave with no razor burn and no nicking!  It is light and compact and charges quickly!  It is also very easy to clean!  I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I would give the shaver five stars if the light would go off showing that it was fully charged. It gives a smooth shave and like the styling and the colors. Of course I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves were lovely, but the cutters lost their edge. Even so, this product represents good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for an amazing product!!! I have very sensitive skin and this is the first electric shaver that I have been able to use on my underarms without any cuts or reactions!!! It will pull on longer hairs so do be careful... This has given me the closest shave out of all of the electric shavers I have tried... It is very light weight and fits well in my hand... The charging base is a block that plugs right into the outlet, there is NO CORD!!! As with any other electric shaver, you DO need to open the top and clean out the hairs regularly with the brush that is supplied... Taking care of it will ensure a longer life!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all skin types!!!</li>
            <li> The older I get the lazier I get!!!!! This razor is a breeze and fits my hand well. Like no cord and yet it plugs right in to recharge. Great product; close shave without any nicks. Panasonic is a brand I can trust. Priced right [[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve]]</li>
            <li> Im not a hAIry person, so I don&#x27;t know how people say this  thing shaves well. It does not. I am including its legs and arm pits--don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> works very well. purchased for my teen new to shaving. wonderful product. i plan to order for myself as well. can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She prefers what she already had.  Not to waste, I tried it.  I have a beard, but I do shave my neck.  Being lazy, I don&#x27;t shave every day and the hair grows out.  With a beard, I can get away with it for about 3 days before it looks tacky.  I have a Norelco Rotary, a Remington standard, and a Braun, from when I had no beard.  I also own a beard trimmer with attachments.  None come close to this razor for trimming my neck.  The other razors do not work unless I shave every day.  They can&#x27;t pick up the hairs if they are longer.  The beard trimmer attachment works, but must be followed up with shaving to remove stubble.  Safety razors clog when the hair is a bit long and then do not cut until the hair is rinsed off.  With this razor, I can run it along my neck and the trimmers on both sides of the foil cut the longer hairs, and the foil portion finishes it off.  With a few passes, I get the quickest shave with the least pain.  Kind of surprising that using an inexpensive \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; razor works far better than my men&#x27;s razors that cost 4-5 times as much.  Although a very, very light stubble may remain, it cannot be seen, only felt. So on special occasions, (about once a month), I finish it off with a safety razor.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have RA, and shaving with a razor can be cumbersome and difficult, after charging the required overnight, I used ti and I have to say, it shaved much closer than I thought it would, I did feel a couple hairs being &#x27;pulled&#x27; out rather than trimmed, but no to many, have not tried the extendable trimming edge yet. over all I happy with it so far. Package arrived quickly, and not damaged at all :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I love this razor, it still holds a good charge and I get 2 maybe three shaves before it needs to be recharged. also, I am still using it.</li>
            <li> The shaver wasn&#x27;t bad. It DOES hurt around the bikini area so i will say that first cause it was the main reason i bought the shaver.  but for the most part it works pretty well. especially for the price.  You definitely can not compare it to one of the high end shavers and if you have fine hairs like i do on my legs it wont get everything but is still good for a quick job. but the main reason i gave it 2 stars was because i have had it for maybe 6 to 7 months and the shaver just stopped working out of nowhere. I thought it was because it was not charged properly but that was not he case to beware of that.</li>
            <li> It is the first that I a using a electrical shaver and I am impressed. No pinching, no nicking of the skin. I am impressed. I having been using as a dryer shaver.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for a first time user, like a teen not ready for razors, gentle on skin and shaves close, would buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so quick and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Neither of my daughters liked this.  Not a close shave and it cut them often.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver holds the charge very well.  The shave is not as &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; as other shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver.  I use it on my legs, on those stubborn chin hairs that plague older women, and on the nape between trips to the stylist.  Does not seem to work well on arm pits, but maybe that&#x27;s just my arm pits.  Holds a charge for a LONG time; I used it about 15 times without having to recharge, and the recharge time was only a couple of hours.  Very comfortable, no razor burn.  If this one konks out, I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I used to have the remington straight head shaver like this.  Used them for 30 years.  WHen the last one broke I just stopped and used my husband&#x27;s triple head shaver instead.  I was tired of using it for the last 10 years so I saw this and tried it and WOW!!! it was great.  LIghtweight really close shave, and pretty dusty rose pink.  Very feminine looking.  I ordered a second one after I got it to give to my sister for christmas.  Make sure you check ship date.  One vendor on amazon said ship in 1 - 2 months, thought it meant days but when I went to checkout it said January &#x3D;February delivery and I am in December.  So I found another vendor and got it in 2 days.  By the way my original one came in 1 day.  How quick is that!!!</li>
            <li> This works great, charges quickly, and is so easy to use. Granted, it won&#x27;t get you as smooth as a razor, but you also won&#x27;t get razorburn or ingrown hairs. I used to get so many little bumps on my legs from ingrown hairs and I no longer have that issue. Plus, I really like getting to shave outside of the shower. I have a newborn, so I usually have to take really fast showers... now I can just shave when he takes a nap.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, good price, works just as well as more expensive brands and models.</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver.  I have extremely sensitive skin and shaving with a razor hurts when I shave more than once every two weeks (which, of course, leaves me a hairy beast by then!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as a razor, but I don&#x27;t care.  It makes my legs presentable and smooth, and better yet, only takes about five minutes for both legs, dry shave.  I&#x27;ve yet to try it in the shower.  It holds a charge for a LONG time of shaving, and I&#x27;ve had it running for over 30 minutes in one go without any dip in performance.  It shares a wall socket with our spinbrush, so it&#x27;s hardly ever plugged in, however it STILL holds a charge and I only have to charge it every 3-4 weeks.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She said it does a great job on her legs.  Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> It works great for legs... but nowhere else.</li>
            <li> Worked well initially but now it won&#x27;t charge! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have had my shaver about six months and I shave my neck mostly about once a month and it works fine.  I then decided it probably needed to be cleaned and using the instruction booklet, I removed the outerfoil.  But now I can&#x27;t get the outer foil back on and I have spent over two hour strugging with it.  For what I costs, I m tossing this razor and trying another one.  My ladies electric razors before were a snap to clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife to replace a 20 year old corded one. She says it works very well and she loves that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She does not complain of razor irritation and her legs are as smooth as can be with this device.  She has been a long time user of razor and has not looked back since owning this.  Ive ordered 2 more for friends that tried out  the shaver.  Good deal and super fast shipping if you PRIME what i Mean :)</li>
            <li> This is not a great electric shaver. I was hoping there would be a setting option so you could choose the length, but unfortunately it&#x27;s all or nothing with this shaver. It does the trick for that purpose, but is not the right razor for someone looking for a trim.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, and I did for as long as it worked.  But after about 3 months it won&#x27;t charge and is dead as a doornail.  Filled out the customer service form on Panasonic&#x27;s website to no avail.  It really was decent while it worked but I&#x27;m now looking for a non-Panasonic product to replace it.</li>
            <li> for the ladies with really sensitive skin, to the point that it cracks to extreme heat.</li>
            <li> Close quick shave. Fantastic for travel</li>
            <li> Yet again, another razor that barely does the job, and leaves more stubble then you started out with.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my Wife.  She is very pleased with the results.  Me too.  She is no longer using my razor.</li>
            <li> OK, I have one small problem, my box arrived with hair already on the inside of the box! i opened it and examined it and it had finger prints all over it! where do you purchase something that has hair and fingerprints on it and its suppose to be new?!! the three stars are for the hair and fingerprints.</li>
            <li> I like the overall product with features like rechargeable battery, wet/dry settings make this a gadget that a gal can depend on!  I have taken it on trips, use it at home and can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I have had various razors in the past. My last razor was a Panasonic and served me well for many, many years.But this new one, I think, is an even better product. It is very similar in design. I like the way it fits so comfortably in my hand. I am 70 so have a few facial whiskers I choose to remove each day with my razor.This takes all of about 10 seconds but leaves my skin smooth without any red marks.I have not tried it on legs yet but am sure it will do just as good a job there also. Thank you Panasonic for continuing to make a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this! It works well and easy clean. I love the simple charger. All around good buy!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect electric razor it is easy to use, easy to clean and delivers a close shave.  I said close shave this is not for that baby soft smooth shave you get with a razor. This is for day to day quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li> Not that happy with this.  Sure misses a lot of hairs to the point I wonder why it isn&#x27;t working.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I have long hair but this shaver works really well. My legs were very smooth after I got done and the shaver didn&#x27;t snag at all. I also love the pop up shaver for my courser hair. I love it because I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Product works well everywhere I shave. (don&#x27;t use it on my legs). Only use it dry. Keeps the charge for a long time. Easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the whole time it feel like you are either cutting yourself or pulling your hair. Doesnt matter if the hair is just 1 inch long or just newly growed haired it still has the same effect, its bordeline painful.</li>
            <li> Switched to an electric shaver on the advice of my Dr.  Takes several times going over the same spot to get the hair gone which doesn&#x27;t impress me.  I like a close shave so I don&#x27;t have to do it as often and this shaver just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  I have to use this weekly in order to keep the hair short enough.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and the head moves over the skin without any nicks on the plus side.</li>
            <li> works so so. pulls on hair</li>
            <li> I think if you go slow and keep the head tilted at the right angle you can&#x27;t really go wrong. For the price I definitely won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Perfect option for first time Pre-teen shavers:). I bought this based on another review where someone had bought these as a safe option for new shaver and so glad!!  Of course it&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  I actually like using it too as a quick shave option!  Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these shavers. The first one worked fine for a year and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore. After about 9 months I frequently need to shake this one to get it to turn on. When it works, it works well. Considering the price, this shaver is still a good buy. I will probably buy another one after my current one breaks.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean. Wish it had come with a cleaning brush. Works well wet or dry. Battery life is great.</li>
            <li> works great....I don&#x27;t use it every time cause an actual razor shave is closer and lasts longer but for quick shaves works great.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this does not shave close at all.  If you want a close shave like with a wet razor this is not the one for you.  I threw it in the junk drawer after 3 tries.  Seems to be made of good quality but just doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a dead four blade one and it actually shaves closer than the four blade. I have sensitive skin and since I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure or go over the same spot several times to get a close shave my skin isn&#x27;t even red after use. Liked this one so well I bought a second one for my daughter and she loves it too. We both would buy again and we do recommend. :)</li>
            <li> it does tell you that this does not give a close shave and that is true.  good in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Best Women&#x27;s Electric Shaver ever used! Very close shave and leaves skin smooth without nicks. Highly recommend all Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas gift, she really likes it a lot, it was what she was looking for.  Satisfied and price was good.</li>
            <li> Works great and just what i wanted for touch ups</li>
            <li> I hoped this would work for facial hair near chin but it is just not powerful enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;You have to go over the same area again and again.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor for the price.  I like that you can adjust the cutting length so that if you have longer leg hair to cut you can.  It does not give you the super close shave of a regular razor but will do for a quick shave.  I also live that it runs quieter than some electrics I have had in the past.  The razor is also very comfortable to hold while shaving.</li>
            <li> I tried using this thing for a couple of days and finally gave up.  If I pressed REALLY hard--hard enough to leave bruises--and went over every spot three or four times, I could finally get down to a day-old stubble.  But it took forever, and it hurt, and a old-fashioned twin-blade manual razor works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it seemed to work better on my &#x27;other&#x27; bits than on my legs, so maybe its just that my legs aren&#x27;t curvey enough.  But it seems pointless to only have a razor for your pits and pubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Works great if you want a clean shave, but if you are buying this to trim and want different lengths, this is not the product for you. It says it has 2 lengths, but it is either a clean shave, or what a 5 o clock shadow looks like on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver to anyone.  Quiet when using it and easy to recharge it.  The charge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Everything it said , and better.  I did not buy the more expensive version and very happy that I did not.  This ES2207 works great.  Charge has not run out after more than 7 uses. Good for legs and underarms.  I purchased this model because I wanted a razor for underarms as well as legs. I have a Remington that cost more and only could be used on my legs.  This one is half the price and gives a nice close shave.  I am impressed, and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> not bad, easy to use and gives an acceptable shave.Handy to use in the bathtub. Works well in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Nothing is as close as a razor, but this does a decent enough job in a pinch. The charge is plenty long enough to do both legs on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one that I can&#x27;t use regular razors to shave becuase I break out realllly bad. So I had been looking for something that works well and something that is gonna last, I have alot of hair so I wanted one that has power to it. I had read some reviews that it doesn&#x27;t really give you that &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; but I have to say I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors and by far this is the best. I get that close shave experience, it does it job fast and I&#x27;m not breaking out. I absoultly LOVE this razor!!</li>
            <li> Worked Great! And I would recommend this site to all I know. Same as before If I like something, than I should not have to write a letter about why. If I don&#x27;t like something or the site of purchase, I am more than glad to write a book.</li>
            <li> I have used other brand names, but, Panasonic makes electric razors giving, by far, the most smoothest shaves ever!  Almost as close as a bladed razor......which I still use in case of needing to wear a bathing suit or other events, but, this keeps me from having to take the shower shave nearly as much as I used to.  While it says it is available to use in the shower, I will use my blade razor for that, as it gives the closest shave, even better than this.  However........now I won&#x27;t have to do that nearly as much..I can wear skirts and shorts without concern when i used other electric razors!  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  5/5</li>
            <li> Nice qulity. nice performance and also nice price. It is working well now.I like it. I will recommend to my friend.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this razor to arrive. It was something of an experiment for me, never having used an electric razor before. I have thick dark hair and fair skin so I&#x27;m alsways interested in anything that might make shaving easier and less irritating. I&#x27;ve found that the razor is good to have around for quick touch ups, for instance when you want to go to the gym in shorts or short yoga pants but have significant stubble on your lower legs.The shave will not be as close as when you use a regular safety razor in the shower. It lasts me about a day. This electric razor does have one other advantage: It seems to irritate my underarms less than a safety razor does, especially when you want to do a touch up but just shaved them the day before. So, it&#x27;s useful to have around but I would not use it everyday. Perhaps for others with lighter or thinner hair this would be enough to use as a primary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big disadvantage is that the razor casing developed a crack shortly after I began using it. It&#x27;s a hairline crack that runs from the purple curve on the handle section horizontally across the white part ending at the next purple bit. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the razor at all but I&#x27;m reluctant to bring it into the shower now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of using razor blades to do my legs.  This unit has fixed my problem!  Did an excellent job and my legs feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well when it is new.  Tip: Your skin needs to be wet or dry, not damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning it for 6 months the battery only let me shave one leg before needing a new charge. I dropped it in the tub once a few months after that and it stopped working completely. Bought a guy&#x27;s razor and it came with oil and battery charge lets me do both legs all week... It has also survived one drop. Didn&#x27;t pay that much more for it either. Not sure why the women&#x27;s models are cheaper/less hardy.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I ever had. I love it. And the price was right as well.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver it is so nice, This is my 2nd one I have ordered they are so  nice!!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is not available in any of our local stores.  Was so glad to find it on Amazon!  As other reviewers wrote, also use it for facial hair.  I did purchase a competitors shaver and it was too rough on the skin.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not as close as a blade but I got tired of the nicks and cuts. This shaver works great I have used it dry and wet with no issues. I read the instructions but the battery in and no problems here!</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about this shaver when I bought it because so many people were giving semi-bad reviews or saying that it hurt... but I love it so far! It took me half the time to shave than with a regular razor! I got zero cuts and maybe some very mild hair tugging  on the super long hair, but everything else was a breeze! So fast and easy to use and the charger stand is great too! I love this.</li>
            <li> This is so convenient!!! No more razors, no more shaving cream. I just plug this in and when it&#x27;s charged, I can quickly shave my legs. I love how easy it is to work and it stays charged a long time. I only charged it once and I&#x27;ve shaved about 3 times and it was still going for when my daughter needed it. The price is great. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> When the razor worked it was great, but would not work after 1 month.  I first bought the item in January then took it back to the store because I though the item was broken.  It would take up to 15 minutes to turn on, even when fully charged.  Sometimes it would turn on after 5 minutes, but rarely right away. So, I tried another one... same problem.  After the razor was fully charged, it would take 10-15 minutes to start working.  Horrible razor.  I liked my old Remington much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Panasonic customer service which is located outside of the U.S regarding the product problems.  They would not refund my order or credit me in any way for this product even though I have the receipt from my purchase 1 month ago.  I am now fully against the Panasonic company for the absolutely poor customer service and product guarantee.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a razor in years! and I mean years probably since the 80&#x27;s. I had an electric razor and tried very hard to find another one but they don&#x27;t seem to make them anymore for women. I don&#x27;t shave in the shower so I wasn&#x27;t looking for that feature. But this is a very nice and comfortable shaver to use and I am sure I will have it for many years. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is better. I keep it charged for a full charge each time for best results</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Does a good job shaving. I would recommend to anyone who is tired of using regular razors.</li>
            <li> It provided an okay shave but the blades felt like tiny bites. I read and followed the manual carefully. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked electric shavers because I feel like they don&#x27;t get a close shave and they can pull at the hair and skin making it uncomfortable to use. This razor is nothing like that!! I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how well this shaves. I&#x27;ve always shaved in the shower with my venus razor and saving cream, but the hot water at the house I&#x27;m currently living in only lasts about 10 minutes so I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower. So I decided to give an electric razor a shot. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a regular razor and it doesn&#x27;t last as long but it&#x27;s so fast, so easy, and it does make my legs nice and smooth! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this shaver is a great quality.  I shaves very close and is exactly every thing that I expected out of a shaver.</li>
            <li> Product works well in wet and dry conditions. Hairs should be short to minimize pulling. There were no razor bumps or scratching like when I shave or use depilators. I hig&lt;br /&gt;hly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well and does a great job of shaving your legs. Handy charger and the price is very reasonable as well</li>
            <li> It rips skin and doesn&#x27;t shave well in or out of the shower I went back to regular razors they worked better and less often.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Conair I purchased first. Better cut, trimmer catches the longer hair better. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the way it &amp;#34;stands&amp;#34; on the charger in the outlet.</li>
            <li> kinda pulls hair, but works great</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! It shaves very close and is very easy to use. The price is right as well. I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I hate body hair!  Hate it!  And I&#x27;ve tried almost eveyrthing in my quest to keep it at bay.  It&#x27;s like weeds! With my epilators, I still have to use them everyday.  I am not smooth for weeks!  So I thought, might as well get an electric razor.  This one makes my legs really smooth.  Not a hair in sight!  I really like it.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and have been using it a lot. I love the feel of it and it fits well in my hand and love the color. I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great.  Top comes off for easy cleaning.  Rechargable, so no batteries and is ready when I need it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this shaver because it seemed the best option available. Don&#x27;t like it. Doesn&#x27;t cut you or give razor burn but I have to over the same area MANY times to get it as short as I&#x27;d like - even with regular shaving. Wish I could find my old Remington ladies personal trimmer again - that was the best I&#x27;ve found. Won&#x27;t be keeping this one - trashing it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and easy to use.  Handle fits nicely in my hands.  I am not too keen on the charger base, it needs to be plugged in so that the shaver is in an upright position.  Not many outlets in my home where this works.</li>
            <li> Love it so far, does not leave bumps or leave scars. It does not leave marks on your body or cut you. Recommend for everyone who  uses daily or often, great results!make sure you use it on completely dry skin or extremely wet skin, otherwise you can get cuts. Love the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it had a lot of good reviews and I was tired of spending so much money on disposable shavers. Unfortunately, in my case this shaver is not what I need it to be. I only use it as a wet shaver and must say that it takes by far more time to shave than with a disposable one and the result is not all satisfying. I must add that I have thick and dark hair on my legs and armpits so maybe someone who has less thicker hair might get good results and would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it now as I spent the money but will go back to use disposable shavers in summer when I need a good shaving result.</li>
            <li> So much easier than trying to balance in the shower and shave at the same time. Don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts or nicks. Try it. I think you will like it, especially if you are an older adult.</li>
            <li> Love this, doesn&#x27;t get as close as razor shaving but so much faster!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay razor. It does what I need it too, but the blade gets so rusted inside. Washing it like they recommend you too only shortens the life span of the blade. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, but you have to go over the hair several times or go over it really slow. It takes less time using a normal razor if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used it for just over a week now. First time I tried it it pulled my hairs like crazy but then I tried it again but did it at a slower pace, it did not pull at all this time! It does such an amazing job and does it so much quicker that the usual razor.  I am hair free and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark thick hair and this seriously did an amazing job! it does not get as close as with a razor but definitely close enough for me with out the usual bumps and razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife just to give it a try and she actually likes it and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome shaver!</li>
            <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t find a ladies shaver in local stores.  Only Amazon had a nice selection and I picked this one which turned out to be excellent and the wife was really excited to finally get a really nice ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> Wonderful wet or dry. Get close with nicks.</li>
            <li> great shaver for the price. All electric shavers will pull hair if you allow it to grow too long. If you use the trimmer first and then the shaver, it shouldnt pull. I havent had any problems with this shaver and i have been using it regulary for over 6 months. I like how little space the charger takes! you can still use the bottom plug if the shaver is charging!&lt;br /&gt;i think the only think that would make this shaver better is if it came with guards where you can just trim to a certain length(in certain areas where you might not want to be completely hairless ;P) and if it also came with oil to lubricate the blades. It did not come with oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as an actual razor, but it&#x27;s definitely more convenient.  I prefer this to a real razor.</li>
            <li> I hate that I even have to give this thing one star. It&#x27;s awful!!! Pulls hairs so bad. My husband even tried it on his neck hairs &amp; agreed it&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called lymphedema and found it difficult to shave my legs without getting cut. This shaver gives me a close shave without damaging my skin. I would definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years.  They have been just OK, and the two I purchased recently in local stores to replace an older one were downright awful.  That is, they didn&#x27;t cut anything.  This razor works as well as a blade!  I didn&#x27;t know there was such a thing.  Plus, it&#x27;s very light and truly cordless: the razor plugs directly into the outlet, so there&#x27;s no cord draping around when re-charging.  And it&#x27;s the least expensive razor I have ever bought.  Who knew?</li>
            <li> While having a waterproof shaver is really cool (and it really is capable of working in the shower), getting fine or sparse hairs with this product is kind of challenging. You may have to go over the same spot many times, and I found that getting a clean shave with this product often meant tolerating razor burn and a tedious process. Not terrible, but not great.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love it.  it cuts clean with no irritation.  My daughter has very sensitive skin, so regular razors or male shavers are not in the cards.  10 out of 10!!!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why i didn&#x27;t think about getting one of these before, because i don&#x27;t like using razors, never did.  i thought of this item only after getting a very precocious snowshoe siamese who gets into absolutely everything.  i was then paranoid of using razors.  even if i didn&#x27;t have the cat, i wouldn&#x27;t go back to razors.  this does a great job on my legs and underarms, which is what i need it for.  i use it maybe once a week, have recharged it once but probably didn&#x27;t need to.  i would buy it again and recommend it to others as a good purchase.  i can&#x27;t compare it to other electric razors, not having used any others.  shaving with this isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, but i don&#x27;t take issue with that.  to me, the safety and convenience is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver at a terrific price.  Easy to use, rechargeable and can be cleaned under the faucet.  For a girl like me who hates uses a razor this is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for keeping the bikini area under control!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great job</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand and is effective in shaving.  It is easy to charge and holds the charge</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  I use it wet and dry.  It&#x27;s very smooth and does the job well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this after buying, but I am too lazy to be constantly cleaning it, so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the shaver so far. I got a new one because my Remington was getting worn out/dull and I was tired of waiting for it to warm up before I could even start trimming hairs. So far this one has remained sharp and is a quick and easy way to buzz off real quick before you go. A nice design so you don&#x27;t have to tilt it too far to make it glide easily. Would buy again if it wears out/dulls in a year or so (with the price of blades, might as well get a new unit!)</li>
            <li> This works as advertised and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after a bad case of razor burn. She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Excellent, works better than any one I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> Great product that works</li>
            <li> Close smooth shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li> The shaver is quite easy to use. I did not think it gives a close enough shave as I like on my legs, like disposable razors do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> So I bought this shaver to replace this panasonic shaver: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0GW6K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_41&lt;br /&gt;I bought the first one back in October 2012 and it lasted a whole 5 months before it acted as though it was going to die and the blades were so dull I couldn&#x27;t use it without it pulling my hair out. I took the first one apart and cleaned it regularly...After every use to everyother use. I only used it to trim my bikini area once every other week. If I was in a hurry I&#x27;d use it to shave my pits quick. I only did that three times. So it died on me. I bought this one to replace the old one thinking maybe it was just a bad apple in the group or something. This one is worse. It pinches and plucks the hairs out, rather painfully. I used this once and I was finished with it. Now I just use my hubby&#x27;s beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great shave with no mess. Wet or dry.  Great for summer and travel. I can not say enough googd things about this product!</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product, works well, and like pop up trimmer.  Just wish it gave a little closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned and I am not disappointed. I am a senior citizen and tired of using razors, so I looked around for a shaver. I liked the reviews on this one. It gives a good shave and I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Quality of this shaver is as expected. It shaved well enough for my needs. You&#x27;ll have to shave a bit more often, but if you don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> This is a great item I like it due t the time it takes to shave with a razor and all the nicks/cuts this makes it faster and less likely to end p with little pieces of tissue all over the legs.</li>
            <li> This razor really pulled my hairs when I used it.  It was so bad I didn&#x27;t want to use it again.  Too bad because I had a different Panasonic razor that I loved and never pulled my hairs.  Shaving should not hurt like this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. I prefer men razors because they work better</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re sure your skin is either completely dry, or wet and lathered (in other words, damp skin causes pulling) this shaver is awesome!  I use it when my skin is completely dry and I experience no pulling or irritation after using it, and I have very sensitive skin.  If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth as silk shave, stick to a razor as this shaver doesn&#x27;t get that close.  However, if you&#x27;re looking to get rid of unsightly leg hairs in a hurry just for appearance purposes - this shaver is a life saver!  It is also great if you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while to get rid of long hair first, and then follow up with a razor for a silky smooth effect!  I recommend this shaver without any hesitation!</li>
            <li> Good product but it pulls the hairs a bit. Not a deal breaker.  Does a great job of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this item before and would do so again.</li>
            <li> This product is a god send. So easy to use, painless &amp; get rid of all the unwanted hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product like this and got exactly what I expected.  It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, yet is good for a quick &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave when needed, which is why I bought it.  In women&#x27;s shavers there aren&#x27;t any products on the market that give a really good close shave, so this was fine for me.  I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis, only when I have a Dr&#x27;s appt and don&#x27;t have time to shower and shave, etc.  Works find for me, but don&#x27;t expect a close razor shave, because you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I cant afford to keepbuying razors and this works great</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap!! The shaver head pulled and rugged at hair and didn&#x27;t even get most of them. I attempted to use it once in the shower until it slipped out of my hand (because I used shave lotion), hit the bottom of my tub, and now doesn&#x27;t work. I wish there was way to return for any kind of money.</li>
            <li> It is ok but does not shave very well. My underarms are a little sore and red after I use it!</li>
            <li> no problems, does a decent job for dry shaving when you don&#x27;t have time to use a razer in the shower. The charger is awkward though; sits on top of a thick plug, can&#x27;t use it in my bathroom bc my cabinet is above the outlet. otherwise, very happy with it. Holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically for the &amp;#34;Bikini&amp;#34; function, so, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to refer to, in detail.&lt;br /&gt;I think the idea of a stranger spreading things, putting warm wax there then ripping it off is horrifying, so I was seeking an alternative to get the area smooth and hair-free.  While this shaver has a &amp;#34;pop-up trimmer&amp;#34; for &amp;#34;longer hairs,&amp;#34; by longer hairs, they must mean a few millimeters, because when I ran it over hair 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch long, it constantly got tangled and yanked the hair out from the root.  And it hurt a lot. So that was a fail, and I&#x27;d recommend shaving with a regular razor first if possible or trimming with scissors before using this shaver.  (Which I wanted to avoid, which is why I bought this darn thing!)&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers mentioned, it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get a smooth shave with this device (and likely, with any electric shaver).  But for the bikini region, it&#x27;s pretty essential, as little short spiky hairs with a sharply-cut edge in that region are pretty uncomfortable.  I found that pulling the skin as taut as possible, changing the direction of the shaver path repeatedly, reapplying whatever soap/shaving cream/lubricant you use multiple times, and doing about a million passes did, eventually get a smooth finish.  And there are just places you can got with the foil-covered shaver that I wouldn&#x27;t dare with a razor or scissors.  I think the &amp;#34;20-minute&amp;#34; battery-life after a 12-hour-charge is unreasonable, but it lasted long enough for me to get the job done.  So, it works, and I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to go full Brazilian but waxing scares you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a first razor.  I figured electric was a good way to start, as the memories of knicking my ankles at her age all came flooding back.  I am happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s a good size, the battery holds its charge for quite a while, and it comes with a little travel bag.  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have 3 girls at home ,got the wife the 1st one. My mother  of 80 years old said she wanted one, my caregiver saw it and said she wants  one so i bought 3. Gotta keep the girls happy!</li>
            <li> Pulled my hair. a lot. And I gave it multiple tries. wet/dry, different angle, trimmed with scissors ahead of time. I am not going at it like a tree hugging big bush woman: at it still pulled hairs. bikini trimmer. HA! nope. pulled and pinched. I bought the Remington Ultimate Body and Bikini: and it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The shaver I have from the 1970s works better.  This does &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; on legs, but not very well for under arms.  I actually have gone back to the old shaving cream and razor because this did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Works well!  Does the job.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not as close a shave as I would like. Very convenient and does the job, but always feels like the day after a shave with a razor for me, I never get that just shaved smoothness feeling.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  This is my second time I purchased this razor so it can be in two parts of my house.  I recommend this razor and it stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor tends to miss spots at times, but once I retrace my steps it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Shave isn&#x27;t as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> Best electronic shaver I have tried.  It feels really nice in the hand and removes hair fast and easily, just make sure you are holding it at the correct angle that they suggest.  I have tried other electronic shavers and the metal that covers the blades have broken and cut me badly.  This has never happened with this one.  Instead of buying new blades, I buy a new machine every year or so because the blades I found online for this are almost as much as the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can see is that it&#x27;s quite loud and if you&#x27;re staying with friends or family, it&#x27;s not very discreet. Lol :)</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I do love this shaver.  I have only used it dry but always get a smooth shave.  I have a very badly scarred ankle from and auto accident and also some small patches of psoriasis.  I am able to go over these areas and not get the usual blood letting that a razor causes.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect and works great. I don&#x27;t use it under water so I don&#x27;t know about the rust some others have stated in their reviews in terms to that. I tend not to ever trust someone when they claim a product is water proof, as it never truly is really. So in terms of using it dry, it&#x27;s great! I was tired of using a blade. I&#x27;ve nicked my self so many times now, that I have 2 or 3 scars on my legs near the knees because of razer blades so I decided it was time to grab a shaver and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to clean it out from time to time though.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!!!  It&#x27;s fast and effective. Funny thing though, I can never see where the hair is falling.  My old one always had hair in it when I lifted the blades out to clean.</li>
            <li> Came brand new and fully charged!  Electric never gives as smooth a shave as a razor, but it&#x27;s a great touch-up tool.</li>
            <li> I did not open the box even. Upon opening the Amazon box, I was immediately concerned about my purchase for personal reasons that another potential purchaser with similar needs might appreciate knowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of using regular steel disposable razors or various Venus razors, I was put on some serious blood thinners for a health issue. For the unforseeable future, I cannot use disposable razors (too great a risk of cutting self and bleeding). I researched like crazy and landed on this ES2207P...reviews, Good Housekeeping, and product claims seemed to tout it as a best-in-class razor for a gentle shave, close as possible with as near zero chance of cutting oneself as presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure after seeing it (even in box still). Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is a BIG chunky device...as big as my entire hand (maybe 8&amp;#34;?).&lt;br /&gt;2) Granted it&#x27;s in a box still but it is HEAVY!&lt;br /&gt;3) The &amp;#34;close cut&amp;#34; blades are on both sides.of the foil and appear sharp (as any sort of double-pass razor teeth are) but they do appear to jut out at a higher elevation than the rather large foil head...would be too hard to get smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems too big, too heavy, and the double-pass &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; blades really spooked me as someone on blood thinners who can assume zero risk of cutting self. So, for the general user who has a larger body canvas this might be worthy of 5 stars. But for this petite person with blood thinner risks at hand...it gets 2 stars and without opening the product box, it will get shipped back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I will purchase something more like a Clio palm-size shaver. That was the other that I kept waffling over when finally settled on this purchase. I wish I had followed my gut then...but instead I&#x27;m following my gut now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a christmas present. My mother liked it so much SHE wanted one :) perfect gift for the ladies!</li>
            <li> Works great and is rather quiet.  The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many complaints about this and other electric shavers that I thought I ought to clarify a few things and help everyone get a smooth, non-injurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First a heads-up: you will never get quite as smooth with an electric shaver than you will with a razor, but you can get pretty close. For me, this is an advantage because I can shave more often and avoid razor burn, but if you have dark hair and light skin where every tiny bit of stubble shows, then you may want to stick with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the actual shaving advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, friction is responsible for most of your nicks and also for those extremely painful incidents where a small bit of skin gets caught by the shaver. When the blades spin fast, friction is reduced. You need to make sure your shaver is fully charged before you use it. Although this shaver theoretically holds a charge for multiple shaves, I don&#x27;t advise you to try it. Charge that baby all the way each and every time you use it! If you are using it on your underarms or bikini line, you will probably want to do those areas first, when the shaver is at its most powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, This is a wet/dry shaver, not a damp shaver. It needs to glide smoothly over your skin, and if your skin is only damp, like from the bath or from sweating in a humid bathroom, it&#x27;s going to be tacky and the shaver will skip rather than glide, and you will be forced to press down harder to keep contact - this can also cause nicks and cuts. So make sure your skin is either totally wet or totally dry. I do mine after the shower and use a hair-dryer on low to totally dry off my skin before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, unless you are just doing a touch-up shave, you must cut your hair down with the clipper setting before you use the foil. The foil is for cutting very short hair down to skin level, but it is going to catch and pull any hair that is longer. If your hair is long enough to be cut by the clippers, you need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.need to use them first before letting the foil touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this advice will give you a wonderfully smooth and satisfying shaving experience with this or any electric shaver you decide to buy.</li>
            <li> Appears to work well. Light and slim design easy to handle. I have only tried this dry, but assume the wet use will be even better. Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was sort of skeptical ordering this electric razor.  My grandmother had given me an old one back in the 1990s that never did a thing, but I was hoping that maybe ladies electric razors had improved a bit since then.  Well, not only have they improved, but I swear that I got as good as a shave on my legs as I ever have with a razor.  Well worth the very reasonable price for this razor!  I will be surprised if I even use my razor on my legs in the shower again for the rest of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the razor under my arms yet, but honestly that wasn&#x27;t really why I bought the razor.  Traditional shaving under my arms has never bothered me...it was always having to do my legs that drove me up the wall.  So you might want to read through some of the other reviews if that is why you are looking at purchasing this electric razor.  But for my purposes (namely my legs), I&#x27;m 100% satisfied (and then some).</li>
            <li> For a quick shaving fix where you just need to remove visible hair, this is okay but that&#x27;s it. Don&#x27;t expect anywhere near to a close shave. And forget using it under your arms...it will pinch like the dickens! After running it across my legs multiple times to barely remove any hair, I got fed up and threw it in the trash this morning! Good riddance!</li>
            <li> I just got mine this week and I do like that between closer shaves I can keep my legs looking pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t give a super close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t do bad. I also love that I can shave dry without getting razor burn :)&lt;br /&gt;I had an electric razor years ago that gave a nearly perfect shave, but I can&#x27;t remember the brand and I thought this was worth a try. I am overall happy with my purchase as it wasn&#x27;t super expensive and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the razor twice and have been extremely pleased with the closeness of the shave.  I&#x27;m, also, pleased at how quiet it is and the ease of cleaning the razor after using it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this razor on Amazon, received one for Christmas several years ago and it died on me. I tried others but no comparison to this product. I really like this razor because you can use it in the shower or not.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Gave me a close shave without ANY nicks or cuts. It is also fairly quiet. The pop-up trimmer is great and really does work for longer or stray hairs. I&#x27;m never going to go back to a regular razor again. I hardly have to do any \\&quot;passes\\&quot; over my skin with this shaver compared with a regular razor, so it saves alot of time. This shaver is also far more economical than a regular razor. The prices razor companies are charging for replacement blades is highway robbery. However the blade in this shaver only needs to be replaced once a year. p.s. I think it is also important to note that I previously tried the Norelco Bodygroom shaver due to the many positive reviews, however I got razor burn from that shaver and also got cut quite badly in several places. Not the case with the Panasonic. The difference between the two is night and day. This shaver will not leave you dissapointed. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, because it is light weight and easy to control, it&#x27;s not so noisy and it is a nice color.  This is a good shaver for women who have to use them and it keeps a charge for a week.  I also like the fact that it is not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use this razor and prefer a real razor to the electric because it gives a closer shave</li>
            <li> Works well. I have not tried as a wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It did a great job. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the plug in type charger.  Maybe I just need to get used to it.  Just seems to be in the way.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my bikini area and it works great.  It&#x27;s not a perfectly smooth shave but it&#x27;s about as close as you can get with a shaver.  It even cuts hairs that were too thick for other razors/trimmers/etc. to handle.  I was afraid to get it wet at first but it works great in the shower and seems to be completely water-tight.  It&#x27;s easy to clean too and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a christmas present for my mom. she has a hard time using straight edge blades and her old electric shaver wore out. She absolutely loves this shaver!</li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t expect a baby smooth finish from a dry shaver, but when you pass over a leg patch and can see that the hairs weren&#x27;t touched, the product isn&#x27;t great. If you&#x27;re in the shower, a razor takes the same amount of time and works a bajillion times better. If post-shower you are in a rush and forgot to shave and think this will help, it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I always used a typical razor I decided to get this because I needed something I could use quickly while on vacation and I am never going back to my traditional razor! Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you a clean shave- waste of money</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver I&#x27;ll need. Safe to use wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Nice grip, too. Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Actually the wife loves it. She had an older model of this and it was dropped and so she stayed with the same model and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s not worth the suffering. I read all the wonderful reviews before purchasing and I don&#x27;t understand how any woman would like this shaver. The blade is rough so you gotta be very careful when using it. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not used to this kind of shaver but it scratches my legs every time and I don&#x27;t like that. I used it on my bikini line and it cut my skin twice, the second time was pretty bad and it bled a lot. I bought this one to replace a Philips Norelco that had died after almost 10 years of use, but this doesn&#x27;t even come close. After a few bad results with this one, I decided to buy a new Philips Norelco and I couldn&#x27;t be happier: it gives me a close shave, no scratches, no burns, no cuts. It costs a little more but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my legs and under arms and this is aswome for both either in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by accident, I was looking for an epilator, I guess I clicked the wrong image.  I was truly disappointed when I seen it was a shaver.  However I hate the pain of returning stuff, and it was pretty cheep so I decided to try it out.  I was pleasantly surprised the job it does, I like to use it better dry then in the shower. Seems to shave closer dry.  That saves me lots of time,  countless gallons of water in the shower and $ on disposable razors.  It doesn&#x27;t save as close as a razer but good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be easier to shave my legs. It is a wet dry shaver and works well. A razor will give you a closer shave. You still have to go through the same movements as a razor. You have to decide what is best for your preferences.</li>
            <li> I ve very thick hair on legs almost curled up hair. This product helps to get beautiful legs in just 10 minutes. Awesome. Please go for it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my bikini area. I still buy razors for my legs but I don&#x27;t necessarily have to. The price is a steal!</li>
            <li> It is a nice shaver and easy to use. It does an adequate job.</li>
            <li> Why did I not have one of these for the past 30 years? Easy to use. Shave is close enough for public viewing of shaved areas (pits and legs) but needs to be shaved more often than using manual razor. No razor burn as of yet 5+ shaves. Remember to go up down and sideways for cleanest look.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done.  Not as good as the Panasonic ES2216PC but for the price difference it&#x27;s just fine.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Gave this one away and bought the ES2216PC,which I also reviewed and gave 5 stars.This one was okay but did not give a really close shave.It is a typical ladies shaver.Of the 3 blade types,Panasonic is the best,but I recommend their 4 blade model.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, gives a decent shave for an electric razor.  Nothing compares to the real thing, but I would recommend this for a quick shave or if you don&#x27;t want to bother with the fuss of using a razor.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but pretty good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Good shaver.  It does not get as close as a razor but I love it.  It is so much quicker in a pinch.  I&#x27;m married, have had 2 kids, going on 40, I dont need that silky smooth leg anymore.  lol  This is pretty close to me.  My legs are still smooth just not silky smooth.  Good enough for me.  Its easy to clean. Can use it in and out of the shower.  There are no cons.</li>
            <li> So far so good love this product.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely not as close a shave as a razor, even from the very beginning. I just wanted something to make shaving less tedious and even a little easier. DO NOT USE IF SKIN IS EVEN A LITTLE SENSITIVE. I have never had overly sensitive skin and this hurt. I don&#x27;t usually get razor bumps or burn, but this shaver pulled my hair and irritated my skin. The skin on my legs was sore for days. Pointless purchase. It was on sale when I bought it and shipped quickly. Charger works well and battery life isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 4 years now. Original charger &amp; original battery, amazingly. I think I paid about $17 for it. So after probably hundreds of hours of use, I don&#x27;t really blame it for dying without any notice. That being said, about 2 years in, it started getting funky. The first time it didn&#x27;t turn on I thought it was done for good. I accidentally dropped it on the floor and it magically sprung to life. Every couple uses after that it would play dead and I would have to hit it against a wall or literally throw it on the floor and it would begin working again. This went on for 2 years until it stopped working for good the other day.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was my first and only so far. It did its job fairly well. Usually not painful unless I was being quick and careless which sometimes lead to it pulling at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving definitely takes time and effort with this though. If you have coarse body hair, one pass won&#x27;t do the job. Several times over will probably get the job done. I also have very sensitive skin. This shaver generally did not irritate my skin. I can&#x27;t shave with anything but my legs with a non-electric razor, so this is a life saver. I generally used it on my bikini area and if you&#x27;re careful, it can actually be used for a full brazillian too.&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit of trial and error to figure out how to get the perfect shave with this razor. I found that it works best in the shower with shaving cream and hair length is a major factor in the success of the shave. Hair should be about 1/4&amp;#34; or it&#x27;s difficult to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it hasn&#x27;t been an absolutely amazing experience.. but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad one either, but after many years with this razor, I&#x27;m ready to upgrade. I would recommend this shaver to someone who is totally new to electric shaving. It&#x27;s cheap, lasts quite a while and is a good, forgiving shaver to start with. That way you can learn the ropes before switching to the speedy, extra sharp razors.</li>
            <li> It does everything I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Really pulls on hairs and hurts unless it&#x27;s at the PERFECT angle.</li>
            <li> broke after two uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok if you forgot to shave your legs in the shower, but won&#x27;t replace a traditional razor for me.</li>
            <li> they charge setup for this razor really really really sucks</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, nothing special. nowhere near a razor-close shave, though it&#x27;s never cut myself with this one.  The foils tend to pop out when sliding the groomer in/out. should have just bought a mens flex razor instead.</li>
            <li> I like having a cordless shaver handy when I need a touch-up, but shavers aren&#x27;t my first choice for leg hair removal. This one performs \\&quot;fine\\&quot; - that&#x27;s \\&quot;woman fine\\&quot;, meaning borderline okay. The pop-up trimmer is below par. It pulls and tugs... and hurts! I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer feature, however, so I can use something else, but since it&#x27;s right there, it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t yelp and make my family come running...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price - speedy delivery. Just don&#x27;t expect wonders.</li>
            <li> This is the first electronic shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I thought, instead of buying those pink disposable razors every month or so, why not invest in a razor that will last me at least a year? I&#x27;ve had this product for several months now and I like it. The only downside is, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work very well on wet skin, as described in the description of the product.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Sahver does a great job giving a close shave. I was hoping for a smooth shave which the product delivers.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my daughter who is 14 and she really likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a higher standard for shaving her legs than with other shavers&lt;br /&gt;she has used.</li>
            <li> I only paid $12 for this through Amazon Warehouse deals, and I am very happy with this shaver.  I think it&#x27;s also very inexpensive on the Panasonic website with free shipping, so keep that in mind.  This shaver is great on underarms, bikini areas, and knees - any skin area that can be stretched a little bit.  It takes a couple of passes to become hair-free, but I love it.  It works on legs but always leaves stubble.  It is not stubble you can see, but you can feel it, so if you want smooth legs, I don&#x27;t recommend it.  For the price, I would definitely buy it again even if it stops working in a few months, and will keep buying it.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother getting any replacement foils or blades, they would cost more than just getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using them for a good 30 years (various makes).  I often don&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade, and there are some areas of my body I don&#x27;t like to use a regular blade on, so I&#x27;ve found using electric shavers to be very convenient.  I can honestly say that this is the best of the bunch.  First time I used it (on clean, dry skin), the shave was so close that it &#x27;almost&#x27; felt like I&#x27;d used a blade.  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver, there are a few tips and tricks to know (that some of the other reviewers have mentioned).  For me, besides the skin being clean and dry, it helps when the hair is a bit longer than nub length (when the hair is a bit longer, the shaver gets a better cut), and using a circular motion is also very effective. Sometimes it also helps to pull the skin taught so that the shaver is getting as close to the surface of your skin as possible (closest cut).  This shaver is shaped nicely so that it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  I highly recommend this shaver.  It&#x27;s a bargain at $19.</li>
            <li> Great lady&#x27;s shaver and great price and shaves close and give the best shave ever .If you do like rainy says to shave you&#x27;ll get a good shave and will leave you smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Lady Sunbeam that I loved. This razor is equal to the one I replaced and perhaps even better. It gives a close shave and is easy to clean and handle. I have charged it once and it is still going strong and that was one thing I was concerned about. The price is also great.</li>
            <li> I was told by my Dr. not to use disposable razors anymore so I decided to buy this razor. It holds a charge for a very long time and it shaves really well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years.  Last one left me with ingrown hairs.  This one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using it in the shower.  It does work best with shaving cream, but I use foamy hand soap as it is cheaper and doesn&#x27;t smell so heavy.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I never owned one before. I still use a manual razor for my legs but i use this just about everywhere else and it does an awesome job. Also helped to stop razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I used to have the previous model, which was great. Unfortunately with this model, my hair comes back growing into my skin, so definitely a star off.</li>
            <li> I have bought many Elec. razors in the past and was never satisfied with them.  This one is the best!!!  I love the design, light weight,, ease of operation.  This one is EXCELLENT.  Shaves closer than expected,, and  smoother.  I would Recommend this one highly.  The price and quality is superior.  Easy to clean, also.</li>
            <li> Different bodies, different skin, it stands to reason every lady will have different types of hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark blonde hair, but my leg and armpit hair comes in between thick/thin, and dark black. When I was a kid, my mother taught me to shave with a hand held razor blade--10-15 years ago, electric shavers couldn&#x27;t compare at all. Especially with my leg hair. I tried one, once, an itty bitty thing on my legs and all it did was pull hair, scrape my skin and leave an awful red road-like rash. So back then (eons ago, when we women clacked rocks together to communicate) I dismissed electric shavers entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas (2013) I was lucky to have the family gift me a few extra dollars to spend on my own gifts. I started thinking about the fact that I shave less as I get older, and the utterly ridiculous prices on razors for women, razor kits--and wondered--how much has changed in electric razors from my rock clacking days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver caught my eye. 1.) Perfectly and reasonably priced. Wet and Dry--meaning if I was taking a shower or bath I could weed wack my legs into some semblance of smoothness or if I was just running out the door and was starting some five o&#x27;clock shadow I could fix it up and keep going. 2.) High ratings and reviews from the lovely people of Amazon. So I said, &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s do (sheer?) it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived really fast--four days; packaged perfect. No damage to the package or the box the shaver came in. Relatively simple and easy to open with no-nonsense instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noted was how super light and perfect it felt in hand. Second thing I noticed is that it recommends replacing the inner blade ONCE. A. YEAR. Comparing to how much I spend on razors a week/two weeks--I am seeing saving myself dollar signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing I did was IMMEDIATELY put it on it&#x27;s charger and let it sit all day. I read an earlier review that said to make sure it was fully charged for the better shave and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.  Turning it on revealed it didn&#x27;t sound like I was in a nest of really loud, really angry hornets--so that was an immediate plus. I used shaving cream on my legs and arm pits and began shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs: Not a single issue. No leg hairs were pulled, mangled or caught. I didn&#x27;t cut anything and nothing stung.&lt;br /&gt;Arm pits: 1 arm pit went smooth as baby bottoms. The other armpit I noticed that some of my skin was getting caught/immediate red bumps rash. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s the shape of that armpit, because I have used the razor every night since then and the same spot catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that the shape of your legs, your skin type and body hair type, how long it&#x27;s charged and how clean it is all contributes to how well this razor works or not. I haven&#x27;t had any red bumps/rashes or pulled skin on my legs EXCEPT for the one armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I haven&#x27;t tried this razor on dry skin, and I am not sure I will because the results in the shower with shaving cream is almost exactly like that of using a hand-held razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too long: didn&#x27;t read summary: I would recommend this razor for ladies with light to medium thick body hair. It works like a charm in the shower/bath with shaving cream. It&#x27;s remarkably affordable, the rechargable batteries can be replaced with better ones if you like, and it&#x27;s easy to handle. My legs are smooth and it&#x27;s already saved me money. Check it out, kay?and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--fast forward to night time, I hop in the shower and make sure to soak my legs, armpits very well and let the steam from the shower work a bit before grabbing this baby and going to mow-town.

            <li> fast ship, razor works good</li>
            <li> I have bought razors before that didn&#x27;t hug my legs as this one does.  I get a clean smooth shave from this without irritation and that means a great deal to me.  I like the way this razor performs. I was sent on time. It fits your hand and isn&#x27;t bulky.</li>
            <li> it is ok, the price was great shipping was fast, only wished it cut deeper.&lt;br /&gt;it sure does come in handy if you are on the go.</li>
            <li> Love it. Bought it because my husband and I go camping a lot with our horses. The shaver is perfect for taking with me. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, of course; but close enough and so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always do research when I buy an item like this. This  shaver had the best reviews I found of any in its price range. It is well worth the money and the battery is fairly long lasting. It hasn&#x27;t let me down yet, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve required it to go past three or four shaves so far before charging.</li>
            <li> great razor for smaller areas of shaving. not sure if i&#x27;m using it wrong, but it has a hard time shaving bikini area and legs. i have to go over that area multiple times until a few hairs are taken away. i need nickel-free since i&#x27;m highly allergic, so it&#x27;s great for underarms.</li>
            <li> Good for day to day and occasional use. It does what all it claims. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and has a trimmer on it to do bakkini line which is a bonus, and stays charged for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I use on my armpits, but not as good on my legs.  I have only used in the dry mode, so &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; part I haven&#x27;t tried to do.  My armpits were breaking out from shaving, so I wanted to stop shaving to let them heal.  This has been a great find.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This razor works Ok. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it pulls the hair instead of clipping it</li>
            <li> So far I have not had a problem with the shaver.  Does a good job.  It shaves my legs with no problem and works well.</li>
            <li> I use this dry and am very pleased. It reminds me of the old fashioned lady shavers from the 1970&#x27;s that really did the job&lt;br /&gt;without all the wet promises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times as a dry shaver, so I&#x27;m not sure how it performs when wet.  It gives me a close shave and had a long battery life.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great Shaver.</li>
            <li> I needed a new cordless razor and this one does the job well for a reasonable price. I like how it works, how you can take it apart and clean it with liquid soap and water and it is easy to recharge when the battery runs low. I have been very impressed with this razor and for the price, think you will be too.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. I have very sensitive skin. Even the best of razors left me with razor bumps and irritation. This razor works great. Better dry than wet, I think. I&#x27;ve not had razor bumps since I started using this. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one before, so I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> best t have ever used</li>
            <li> Not quite as close as a regular razor, but comes close.  Easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> This is rechargeable but did not come with a charger ....</li>
            <li> Wow.  I had to change my five star review.  This is pretty weak.  After awhile it looses strength (yes I have re-charged it, swapped tops, AND cleaned it!) but it no longer does its job very well.  You have to go over things a few times before it will fully do its job.  I guess its ok for shaving your legs... for a year even... don&#x27;t expect it to stay as good if you use it for any other areas or for it to last a really long time...</li>
            <li> just received it yesterday and tried it out straight away. im one of those many women over 40 who suddenly find hair growing more on their faces so I got it mainly for that, and I have to say this does the job just fine! I think my husband will be glad im no longer having to use his shaver :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once or twice so far but it&#x27;s very easy to use and to clean as well. I like that it comes with a little bag to store it. The instructions it comes with are pretty stright forward, which is nice. It&#x27;s a little loud, so if you&#x27;re looking for a super quiet trimmer, this might not be for you. The only thing I could complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t come in other colors.. (but it&#x27;s just me being picky) but that has nothing to do with the performance of the product which is why it still deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product comes as described :]&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is the exact same shaver that I have purchased in-store for a much higher price - AND the shipping was free which is always an attraction for me! The shaver works just like I expect an electric shaver to work.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I was VERY pregnant and not able to see my toes. I didn&#x27;t trust myself with a razor and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to get waxed. I LOVE this product. I was able to shave quickly with no bumps. It worked great. I&#x27;ve had a few electric razors over the years, and none have worked liked this one. I&#x27;m going to order another one for my best-friends. (It&#x27;s that great)</li>
            <li> I works great. The way it&#x27;s shaped, you get a good gripe, no slips. I was a little comprehensive about the charger, but I have charged it twice (when I got it and 2 weeks later) since I got it. This thing holds onto a charge, where the one I had before would die after a day. And the best thing, the buttons just don&#x27;t move around if you barely touch them!</li>
            <li> Product was great at first. After a month, it would have a hard time turning on. Now it doesn&#x27;t turn on at all. It was only used a handful of times and after a few months, it no longer turns on.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Haven&#x27;t used it wet but works wonderfully dry.  Holds a charge for a very long time</li>
            <li> I really like my shaver</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver. Better than my old one.</li>
            <li> This is a great bikini razor which I have used for years on a daily basis. It gives a close shave in the shower and only breaks when I drop it ;-)</li>
            <li> It is okay but not as good as it could be.  Battery charge is not long enough to complete shaving needs as needed by customer.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job at removing my leg hair. I only use it dry and have never used it in the water. Was pleasantly surprised at how good a job it does. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Is to tell you that I already owned this razor, but lost it on a vacation recently. Instead of shopping for anything else I immediately went and bought the same razor again. If buying the same thing twice in a 1 year span isn&#x27;t convincing, then I don&#x27;t know what is.  Holds a charge for a long time and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it does not work wet dry does not matter i tried it on my face works like crap wish i had not wasted my money</li>
            <li> Love it and would buy it again. It is convenient and so easy to use. Love that it has no cord. Does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; or nick and gives a closer shave, unlike my old electric one. Even used it on my husbands lower neck hair and had no complaints. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is good size for your hand (Its small). Its convenient. It does a good job. Has handy attachments. Would purchase again. A reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have had previous electric razors but this one really does do a good job. It makes it easy to have smooth legs when short on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Happy with my purchase. It cuts close when you need it and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;charges easily with its adaptor. I can hold it without hurting my hand,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;due to my arthritis. A wonderful product !!</li>
            <li> EDITED- This broke within 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but dry it does a good job on my legs.  When I need a quick shave when wearing shorts, I&#x27;d normally do it in the sink and make a mess.  With this I save time and mess.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!...until it came time to charge it and it would not charge. Had to toss it as it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years.  I got a second one because that was a better buy than just the parts I needed.  However, this one seems to pull out the hair rather than cut it.  Shaving shouldn&#x27;t be painful.</li>
            <li> Works well wet or dry, giving as close a shave as I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric shaver.  I like the recharging unit, which fits in the wall plug, leaving vanity or counter space free.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price. Works best on completely wet or completely dry skin, not in between.</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver to replace a Remington Shaver that I purchased a few months ago.  The Remington was a lemon that I only purchased because I needed a shaver and this was the only one my local drug store carried.  This Panasonic shaver gives a close shave, so far, non-irritating.  This is the second Panasonic wet/dry shave that I&#x27;ve owned.  My previous Panasonic lasted many years, I should have replaced it before it died.</li>
            <li> Replacement for same which lasted almost ten years.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a great lady shaver and it is very reasonably priced.  I had two older Remington lady shavers and needed a new shaver as my cord had deteriorated and I couldn&#x27;t get a new cord for my Remington.  I was looking for a corded shaver but no one seems to makes corded anymore so I had to look at shavers with rechargeable batteries.  I hated having to deal with batteries as that runs up the cost of using.  I looked and read reviews.  This seemed to be the best one and one of the cheapest.  Well, it is the best one.  It gives you a close shave better than my old shaver.  It must be charged for 12 hrs before using.  It is easy to clean as the top/blades snaps off and can be rinsed/washed under the faucet with soap and water.  You get a brush with it which helps to brush the residue from the shaving head after shaving.  The charger snaps on the bottom of the shaver and then plugs into the wall.  You get a nylon bag with it but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the bag.  It&#x27;s too small to fit shaver and battery so it doesn&#x27;t close.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how many shaves I can get on one charge.  It can be used wet or dry.  I used it dry and was very pleased.  I don&#x27;t believe you would be disappointed if you purchased this shaver.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a couple months, but now it has begun to die.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.  Great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Used this about ten times max. Was okay, nothing to write home about until the last time. It shredded my legs! Look!</li>
            <li> perfect.  totally worth the few extra dollars for the better model</li>
            <li> the wife loves it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I live in UK and didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I have Keratosis pilaris  which is a skin condition that can make skin dry etc. Razor shaving made my skin really sore and irritating but using this shaver leavers my skin smooth and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;Only use it dry though as this seems to make the  life of the shaver last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I first dry exfoliate then shower with aveeno shower oil,dry off then dust over with baby powder that seems to give me an extra close shave. Moisturise after, I use aveeno with shea butter. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I have a very rare condition called aquagenic pruritus, which is essentially an allergy to water, or to water drying on the skin. When I would get out of the shower, I would experience mild itching, especially on my arms and legs for about a half hour. Shaving my legs increased the severity of this problem ten fold. I would itch so bad that my whole body would be shaking as I tried to resist scratching until I bled. It caused me extreme anxiety, so I would rarely ever shave, and could not wear shorts or dresses. I tried lotion, nair, all kinds of soaps and razors, different detergents, showering in different places, nothing worked until my boyfriend bought this for me. Being able to shave dry and not itch has lowered my anxiety significantly and now I can feel confident wearing whatever I want. If you are expecting this razor to get as close as a regular razor will, then an electric razor is not for you. No electric razor can get as close as a regular one. You will still feel a little stubble, like you might a day or so after shaving. When I use this, my legs are smooth enough that they do not feel prickly when they touch in bed. For me, this product is a lifesaver. Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Brilliant works well. Great delivery to the UK thank you.</li>
            <li> Great for underarms and bikini area. Does not shave legs well. Haven&#x27;t been able to get a smooth shave with this electric shaver, either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> i agree with several other reviewers . It worked great at first but after a month or so ,it began to work poorly. I thought I was not charging it properly, so I made sure it was well plugged-in. Today, the razor barely cuts my hair at all. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave. I was hesitant, but soo happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not give the closest shave but it works well if you are in a pinch or a hurry</li>
            <li> Honestly...I ordered this and was ready to hate it. I did not think that an electric shaver could shave as close as a razor. It does. I wanted this because I wanted something for quick touch ups so that I didn&#x27;t have to get in the tub and lather up to shave. Once I started using this electric razor I was just amazed. Now it&#x27;s all I use. No nicks or cuts anymore it does an awesome job shaving dry. Just keep it charged and move the razor slowly. To get and even closer shave pull on the skin a bit to make it tight. I have not shaved in the tub with a razor since I got it. It&#x27;s light and fits well in the hand. Good for legs, underarms, and other areas too. The price is so cheap...should be more...really. Do not hesitate to purchase this shaver.</li>
            <li> Better to use the dry feature and not in the shower. The shower is supposed to be a closer shave but the hairs stick everywhere.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to any one looking for one. A close shave&#x3D;wet or dry and it works really well on under arms. Shipped here quickly and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great on my bikini and underarms, but I have relatively thin hair on my legs, so it didn&#x27;t work so well for that.  But I bought it for my bikini area anyway, since that&#x27;s where I would get the razor burn and ingrown hairs anyway.</li>
            <li> Although only used once so far, it is satisfactory. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor but neither does it accidentally &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; as does a razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington ladies shavers for years and based on the reviews decided to try this one and it shaves much better.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would shave a bit closer but still works great. Battery lasts forever. And I have never cut myself using this which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Does the job in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> As my three stars attest to, it is okay. Nothing great, I don&#x27;t love it. I may kinda like it, it beats shaving with a razor. I keep mine on the charger all the time and yet I still can&#x27;t make it through all the shaving I want to at one time. Oh well, for the price it is good.</li>
            <li> THIS IS YOUR AVERAGE SHAVER.  HAVE NOT USED IN SHOWER YET.  I LIKE THE LONG HANDLE AS IT IS EASIER TO REACH AROUND BACK OF LEG WITHOUT PUTTING YOUR BACK OUT</li>
            <li> Bought 4 of these (myself, 2 daughters and step daughter) in hopes to conserve water (California drought), save some money overall on blade replacements, and get a close bikini line shave with no razor burn.Read all the review in this site and other sites before purchasing. Felt I made an informed purchase. Product does not perform as described by manufacturer and reviews that say you get as close a save as with razor are def incorrect. I can&#x27;t really see scratching your legs up like I have seen in some posted pictures unless you were abusing yourself with it, but it is abrasive feeling, not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is my one, the first one I dropped, the 2nd one stopped working I am not sure why, I hope this one lasts longer I love this shaver which is why I&#x27;m on my 3rd purchase.  This shaver gives a nice clean shave I have tried others and I was so disappointed.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  Gives a nice close shave for an auto shaver. I use it on dry legs for a quick shave.  Holds the charge for many shaves and has a small plug in adapter that fits in any plug. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Very good razor for the money!</li>
            <li> Was bummed I had to go to an electric razor because of blood thinners.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the close shave it gave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this shaver, I&#x27;m one of those individuals who cannot handle nickel and other metals, and the Close Curves shaver is one of the few I can use without getting a reaction. Of course, it can&#x27;t possibly shave as close as a good old fashioned razor, no electric shaver will. I have a skin condition called Keratosis Pillaris, and I can&#x27;t use a wet razor, it makes my skin inflamed and I get ingrown hairs. This shaver has done fine as far as shaving my legs and underarms. I use it about every other day, and have for 2 yr. and it&#x27;s still going strong. The recharger plugs into a wall outlet, if this isn&#x27;t convenient for you, then you most likely won&#x27;t care for it. Since it&#x27;s a wet shaver it can&#x27;t be charged with batteries. I&#x27;ve been clumsy a few times and have dropped it, but have not had any problems with performance after that happened. I do clean it out after every shave since it&#x27;s loaded with my (gorilla style) leg hair. This shaver travels well too. I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a good deal for at least 2 yr. usage and it doesn&#x27;t give my skin a reaction. I took the advice of the first ( most popular ) reviewer here (\\&quot;rainy\\&quot;) and have gotten great results. Thanks Rainy! If and when this shaver bites the dust, I&#x27;ll probably get another one. I really doubt there would be that much difference in performance, at least for me, between this one and the next step up and I really don&#x27;t need a bikini attachment. For less than $20, I&#x27;m satisfied. The shaver really does need to be fully charged to work right. If you find that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well, I&#x27;d return it right away rather than put up with poor functioning.</li>
            <li> I last bought a Remington razor that cost more than this one, a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve never liked it.  This razor does exactly what I want it to do and is a great tool for a great price.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant given the negative reviews, but decided to get it anyway.  I was pleased with the purchase, it works just fine on my legs, and is very easy and quick to use.  I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and had no problems.  Here&#x27;s hoping it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this electric shaver for its very low price and its clean, painless shaving on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible nickle allergy and have had a hard time shaving for the past few years due to irritation. This shaver is wonderful I have had no itching or bumps or irritation. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG! The shave is not as close as a razor but it is close enough to do the job! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I realized when I went to charge this unit, that if your bathroom plug is oriented horizontally, the shaver will have to sit sideways&lt;br /&gt;The charger plug does not rotate to allow you to orient the shaver in the upright position.</li>
            <li> Great product!  So  glad I found it.  Recommend to everyone.  Glides over curves and cuts close to the skin.  Super!</li>
            <li> This thing will rip your hair out if you&#x27;re not shaving slow enough, and that&#x27;s with me trying with longer hairs and short hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based off of recommendations from this site.  I don&#x27;t feel like it gives a close enough shave without almost cutting yourself.  I feel like I get a better shave from a traditional shaver.  I do like the fact that is can be used either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Gives a very clean and close shave. Also very&lt;br /&gt;convenient in or out of the shower. Battery lasts for a while without needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I have had one for a year or more.  I bought one for Christmas for my 12-year-old.  I bought another one for back-up.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver, Light, fast, easy. Shaver is really easy to use and holds a charge for a long time. The only gripe I have is the charge time is 12 hrs!! Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;But considering it holds the charge for so long it&#x27;s not a big deal. Very close shave for an electric razor. Not as close as conventional razors but this also prevents irritation. Shaves the same wet or dry. Does not shave armpits well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s very light, love that I can just pick it up and it&#x27;s easy to use and maneuver. The shaver head is completely removable they may make new blades to replace but they look like they cost more than another razor. The grip is smooth and all one piece, no rubber pads or things to catch on. Sturdy construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE shaving around your bikini area, it can cause some irritation there but if you go with the hair it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much. If you have longer hair, you have to clean it between strokes because the bikini adjusted head that pops out gets hair caught in it, and then the bottom blade cannot grip the hairs to cut them. But if you pop the bottom adjuster out and shake it they fall out. Relatively less noisy than most razors, but still buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem I faced was my outlets in my bathroom are positioned sideways and it has to charge standing up on the charger, so having it sideways makes me think it will fall off the charger, it&#x27;s very firm on the charger but I have to plug it in a standard outlet to charge it. None of my bathroom outlets point up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor considering I have tried many others, and wax kits too.</li>
            <li> It is very fast, but the shave is not close at all. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Had my old one for about 4 yrs (bought it the day after Christmas on sale) really love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of a dry shaver. I normally use the Schick Intuition and absolutely abhor the process of shaving my legs in the shower, even without having to use shaving cream with the Intuition. My coworker swears by dry shavers, so I decided to try this one out, not wanting to drop a ton of cash before being comfortable with the whole idea of shaving outside the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is nice and I like the fact that it sits on a little charging dock, so you neither have to be tethered to the wall by a cord nor have to constantly replace batteries. It&#x27;s a good size and feels nice to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However (and it&#x27;s a big however), it just doesn&#x27;t get a close shave in any way whatsoever. If you have like 2-3 day old stubble on your legs and try to use this shaver, I don&#x27;t even think it works on hair that short. Maybe it works better if you grow your leg hair out for a week or more, but I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of not having fairly smooth legs, so that&#x27;s not going to work for me. I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver on my armpits or my bathing suit area, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness there, but I&#x27;m going to have to give it a thumbs down for legs.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and in good shape.  It does the job I needed it for.  The item looks to be of good quality materials.  Would buy again ...</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, I thought if I try a new band name maybe it just  may  work as good or better than my old one I had for so many years(for years)</li>
            <li> Does the job, when I don&#x27;t have the time to shave, this works great. Does not make legs as smooth as regular shaving but hey can&#x27;t win them all.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor and I have to say I was happy with it. It worked well both dry and in the shower, and the pop-up trimmer came in handy. I stopped getting razor bumps after switching to an electric shaver. My only problem was that after just over a year the motor burned out. I literally smelled it burning in the shower one day. I never fully submerged it water or misused it; it was just its time. But for the price I paid for it I think a year, while not an ideal lifespan, was just enough time for me to be okay with it and give it a good rating. If you want something that will last I&#x27;d spring for something a little pricier with a longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with my purchase. I hate shaving with a disposable razor in the shower and luckily I found this product. It was so worth the $20. It comes with a small bag to keep it in, a small brush to clean all of the hairs out of the inside. I highly recommend this product. I absolutely love it. It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I don&#x27;t like having to pass the same area twice.  This razor generally gets the job done in one pass, and when a second pass is needed, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Best women&#x27;s electric razor I have ever owned.  I have only used it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver, and it is everything the manufacturer says it is. I would buy it again in a heartbeat because of it&#x27;s versatility and smart design.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.  I have used others and decided it was time to try something new.  This works very well and is quiet.  My husband can&#x27;t even hear it .  It&#x27;s really done a very good job.</li>
            <li> I have tried every ladies trimmer at my local walmart they all sucked compared to this i had to hunt it back down after old one i had i believe was destroyed by an old roomate, forget to shave your legs no problem this will get you out the door and save you an extra day or two, underarms no problem i wouldnt go for that too frequently tho as you will get irritation if you use it one your underarms too often, i only use the pop up trimmer for shaping my bikini area so i dont know to much about that, only con is it does not come with a trimmer gaurd i would suggest that you add the panasonic bikini shaper and trimmer es246ac for that they make a great team. also this takes up no counter space at all the charger is a small maybe 1 1/2 inch square that the trimmer itself just sits on top of.</li>
            <li> makes shaving fast and easy.  dual action clipper and shaver combo makes fast work of longer stubble.  good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great, did have to send for another cause the battery work charge. I call in and they sent a new one out that very day. Great costumer service. But I really like the shaver works well, worth the trouble of a reorder.</li>
            <li> This shaves my leg as well as a razor but without the razor burn. I love it, getting another for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> It works and I like it. What more needs to be said? I&#x27;ve never tried it in the shower but dry it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair on my legs. I used conditioner prior to using the shaver and I also attempted to trim the hair to try and get it as low as possible before using the shaver. The blades were not very powerful and I had to repeatedly use the shaver over the same spots with little difference each time. I tried on an alternate day to use shaving cream, no difference. I am sad to report that the basic Schick double blades were more powerful than this shaver. I tossed the entire unit within a week of purchase. Fair warning...</li>
            <li> my friend recommended this to me.  I love it.  I only use it when I didn&#x27;t shave in the shower, so I cant tell you how it works wet.  It holds a charge really well, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and has a trimmer feature for that hair you haven&#x27;t kept up with and got a bit too long!</li>
            <li> The shaver has no problems doing close shaves for little hairs and it also trims the long hairs very nicely. This is one out of (5) shavers from other companies I ordered in the past that is actually still working. I&#x27;d very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After months struggling with Remington&#x27;s Smooth and Silky, I am supremely happy with this Panasonic. It only takes a couple of swipes, 3 if you are compulsive, and the hair is gone.  No going over and over and pressing hard. As far as problems plugging it into a wall socket, just use an extension cord.  Definitely like this Panasonic razor and can find no fault whatsoever. The little elevated guard works well too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor.  My daughter took the first one I bought so this is my second one.  I have stayed away from electric razors for years because they did not do an even adequate job.  But the Panasonic ES2207P is really such an improvement and I can use it in the shower or out.  It works equally well either way.  It was truly much more than I expected and since I am an easy bleeder, 4 blade razors kept nicking me and became more trouble.  This will probably be a razor I will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Muse baby powder. It doesn&#x27;t heave any razor burn but it does practically make you smooth. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so big</li>
            <li> This was not my first Panasonic shaver. It worked fine until it didn&#x27;t work at all. I thought the battery had just run down, but it is dead as a door nail. Not even big enough to use as a door stop. Glad that Amazon displayed a reminder on the web page of the date that I had purchased this item through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase another brand, hoping that Remington makes a product that lasts longer than this.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and exhibit minor hirsutism.  This is great to keep the chin hairs to a minimum when I am in too much of a rush in the morning to use tweezers.  This allows me to at least get rid of visible hair until I can get back to do a better job with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this does not do a close shave in the underarm or bikini area for me but it does reduce the hair enough for me to get a close shave with a multiblade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that is somewhat of a pain is that it is difficult to clean and using wet was virtually a nonevent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, performs decently as I was not expected a close shave, and it&#x27;s rechargeable.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The shaver is gentle on the skin and being battery driven makes it easy to manuever.  Booklet states good for about seven uses on a charge and it holds true.</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving in the shower.  It offers a pretty close shave.  But, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a razor blade&#x27;s shave does.</li>
            <li> This is the best womans electric shaver I have ever had.  A real winner!</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, using it for a little over a year now.  Not a close close shave, but close enough.  Only real complaint is it doesn&#x27;t keep charge quite as long as I want it to.</li>
            <li> Perfect shave when you don&#x27;t have much time. Only thing is some hair got caught in it and ripped out and left me bleeding.</li>
            <li> Same as any electric razor.....does an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job...nothing special</li>
            <li> I fractured my femur and had to have a partial hip replacement.  I could not shave with a razor in the shower as I had to use a shower chair and could not bend over 90 degrees at the waist.  I bought the Panasonic so my husband could shave my legs.  The Panasonic gave a smooth shave.  I will continue to use it even after I can once again use a razor in the shower.  It will go on vacations with me to the beach.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap razors for so long I forgot what its like to have easy time shaving. Light and comfortable in my hand, it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> How can a wet/dry shaver be used if your hands cannot be wet?  This was a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is great. It&#x27;s def for the on the go things. No time to shave I just use it and head out the door. :)</li>
            <li> but you probably new that.  Good for hip/knee replacement/broken bones shaving of legs....omg..that is not good enough for an Amazon review...it is useful and effective...fini</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend, who has always used this brand, and this model closely resembled the one she needed to replace.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it.</li>
            <li> Just got this product yesterday as my very first ladies shaver, I love it! I originally used hair removing creme and razors, but it either takes too long or hurts my skin. This shaver does give a close shave and it doesn&#x27;t cut my skin at all. I love the result! I guess the only con now is that since it&#x27;s a shaver, I&#x27;ll have to shave every 2-3 days, because the hair grows back very fast. However, the only thing I&#x27;m worried is that there are so many reviews saying how it dies after a while, hopefully that won&#x27;t happen soon.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my mom and it works great and she loves it!  Adjustable blade head for under the arms.  That is a big plus. :)</li>
            <li> Gave to someone as a gift,not sure what to rate it yet.</li>
            <li> My wife says that it works well, now that the one that she has been using for probably 40 years finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if it had a charging light and something to tell you that the charge is running low.  Would also be nice if you could use it corded as well, in case you run out of juice during a shave.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and works especially you are in hurry.I gives smooth looks but not feel. Works really well for working ladies , it will not hurt but gives good looks.</li>
            <li> Easy to load, use, etc.  Better than some more expensive shavers tried. My wife really really really really really really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li> Sticking to the razors.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling like a 3rd day after shaving.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed and desatisfied</li>
            <li> For bikini lines and areas where you prefer to shave, this is a GOOD BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s thinking of investing in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It had a negative run in with my armpit at one point, so I keep it below the belt and all is well.&lt;br /&gt; If you are curious, my armpits are actually quite normal.  There was no reason for malfunction. :D</li>
            <li> I only use it for underarm. It&#x27;s ok, but took much longer time to clear up than my former phillip one (around same price).</li>
            <li> I like this shaver. it works well, and doesn&#x27;t nick or bite!  no shaver rash after use, either.  I think it&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Works like a real razor...smooth and easy to use!! Great product! Fast shipping and at a great price that arrived right to my door!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and saw the reviews for this product but unfortunately it did not work for me. It is bulky but it is also just doesn&#x27;t work right for me. I think the construction and design feels uneasy and not fluid enough for me. When it came to shaving it seems like it does not get the hair completely. I am now looking into epilators instead of shaving devices. I can deal with the pain if it means shaving less frequently.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver because I was having hip replacement surgery; you have to take a blood-thinner, what if I knicked my skin shaving? Bad news! The shaver doesn&#x27;t give you a finish like that of shaving cream and a razor, but it made me feel better. Good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy shaver. I have to wake up early for work and I&#x27;m usually too rushed for time to spend all that time in the shower. I also hate spending the money on razors. They are way too expensive. This shaver is great. I have had it for a couple weeks and it&#x27;s still on the original charge(charge it for 12 hours before first use). Great price as well. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it. Nice close shave. Great price. Delivered on time. Replaced an old electric shaver that I had for years. Love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than my last one for legs and underarms. It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s so quick and can be used dry. My only complaint is that there&#x27;s no guard for a trim vs. a close shave for bikini area.</li>
            <li> Definitely pleasantly surprised by this electric shaver. I have been highly disappointed in the past by both men and women&#x27;s shavers. Yes, I&#x27;ve splurged on expensive electric razors meant for men. Some were great. Some were not-so-great. Most of the shavers meant for women were very disappointing. By far THIS is the BEST electric shaver I have purchased. It cuts close for an electric shaver, it keeps its charge for long periods of time, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t had to buy replacement foil razors, yet, but it seems like an easy and affordable process from what I&#x27;ve read online. Additionally, it&#x27;s great as both a wet and dry shaver. It&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s convenient. I definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Works really well, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and leave you baby smooth in one swipe and the stubble attachment hurts when using it ...&lt;br /&gt;Other than that is a pretty good buy</li>
            <li> This razor is stylish, well made and cost effective. My girlfriend says it works well and glides over the skin such that you don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> It truly does shave as closely as a blade (worth two or three passes). I&#x27;ve only used it dry. I&#x27;m disabled and it&#x27;s quite easy to use and clean. I recommend it so highly that I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for my mother!</li>
            <li> Great razor for my wife</li>
            <li> This works just as well as any expensive model I&#x27;ve tried. The charge lasts a really long time a well!</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Needed an electric razor that worked well. It does. Fits spaces that are small.</li>
            <li> 1/5/15 so far awesome fast shipping as well</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor. Gave as a gift and the person who received the gift loves it. She has commented on how much she loves it several times.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after years of using disposable razors. I would always get irritated skin and red bumps after using disposable razors, thinking it was normal, but then found out that I had a nickel allergy, which is commonly found in disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I found this razor, and, after some research, decided it would be the right choice, based on many good reviews and it&#x27;s very reasonable price. I picked one up from a Target for around 22 dollars, and was excited to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave I had was perfect: I thought this machine was incredible, as it worked nearly flawlessly (not completely close like disposable ones, but that was to be expected), but it also left no irritation, and I have yet to come across a cut or even the tiniest nick from using it. I wanted to make sure it lasted a long time, so I clearly followed the simple cleaning instructions (and loved the two-sided brush it came with!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after my honeymoon period of about a month, the razor started lose its function. I would charge for the suggested 12 hours, but it would lose battery in a matter of minutes. Frustrated, but still convinced it was a good machine and the problems were my fault, I went back to Target and they gave me credit to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I let the shaver go completely out before I charged it. I also charged it once a week, as directed. For a while, that worked, but now I&#x27;ve found myself back in the same predicament as before. At this point, it doesn&#x27;t even turn on when I click it, unless I slide it on at least 10-12 times. Even then, the shaver doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few minutes, and the battery runs very slowly. Today, however, I accidentally removed the outer frame while it was on and found that when I did that, the blade started running at full-speed! I was ecstatic because I thought that the problem was fixed. I put the frame back on while it was running, but it stopped again. I was stumped, so I decided that the problem had to be the foil, and went online to find another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I decided that the 12 dollars that I might spend trying to replace the one part that may not be the answer would be better spent in another shaver. So, I have decided not to give up on Panasonic (which still seems to be acclaimed as the best), and have decided in upgrading to the more expensive ES2216PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product worked very well when it actually did, I just can&#x27;t get over the battery/outer frame issues enough to keep using it. It can be a great device, but if it&#x27;s not always going to be like that, it&#x27;s just not a good match for me.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  Thought it would give a closer shave.  Little disappointed in how much razor stubble it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned so far! It cuts closer that other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand wet/dry shaver that just stopped working so instead of ordering from QVC, decided to try this one. So far, I really like it. I use it mainly for dry shaving mainly of my neck/hairline so don&#x27;t have a review for wet shaving. It handles well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just what I needed to shave my legs  and underarm hairs  just charge and use..I really like this,easy and fast...</li>
            <li> I was happy with this razor, though I didn&#x27;t use it very often.  In fact only had to recharge it 4 times.  Well, on the 4th time, the razor quit working.  It won&#x27;t take a charge, and is not worth sending back.  I suggest looking elsewhere for a ladies electric razor. I know I will.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in January 2014 as a travel razor. I was impressed with it then and use it regularly at home. The trick to it working for me has been to keep it thoroughly clean after each use and to charge it often. No issues and it&#x27;s been a year.  I came on to buy another ands a gift for my mother-in-law as she also liked it.</li>
            <li> Gads I bought this years ago (about 4) and the battery is still up and running.  I leave it plugged in.  Great little unit!</li>
            <li> Gift for my teenage granddaughter. It is easy for her to use, smooth close save on her legs. A very successful gift</li>
            <li> ugh...awful...I must have Attila the Hun hair because after reading some of the other reviews, I thought this would be wonderful.  It wasn&#x27;t.  I wish I could give it a no star because honestly, it did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. I was surprised at how it holds a charge. Very easy to use, close shave for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Was told this was amazing and performed better than expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well but haven&#x27;t used it in &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I can no longer use a razor for shaving my legs. I like the Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thankyou&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Patti</li>
            <li> My electric shaver fell and the button broke and could not be replaced.  I used it at least four times a week.  When my new razor came with in days of the order i was thrilled and used it right away.  it has a very nice handy charger and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by how well this razor works, especially for the price. I used it dry for the first couple of months. I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor in the shower, that just seems weird to me. I finally got past the weirdness and tried it wet. I&#x27;m glad I did. In the shower and with the addition of shaving cream, it&#x27;s effective and close. I have very sensitive skin and find that I am much less itchy after using this in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works great for an electric shaver. Keep it fully charged at all times and use short strokes. No electric shaver will ever be as good as a manual shaver but at full full charge it comes close.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and easy to use. Gives you a very close shave without burning. Works well on underarms and legs. Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can shave with no razor burn</li>
            <li> This is the best women&#x27;s shaver around...I had a Panasonic for several years and it finally died.  I was determined to find another to replace it and I&#x27;m glad I stayed with Panasonic.  It holds a charge longer than other shavers I bought over the years, the shave is close, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> OK. Not as powerful as my old Remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a fair number of razors and never stuck with one.  This one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it does a much better job than any of the others.  I have really fine hair and a lot of it, so it clogs up most razors, but I haven&#x27;t had trouble with this one getting clogged.  Occasionally I find I&#x27;ve missed places and have to go over them again, and it leaves a bit of fuzz.  I don&#x27;t think my husband would admire how smooth my legs are with this razor, but for day in and out it keeps my legs looking presentable.</li>
            <li> Works great! Bette than a razor.</li>
            <li> So very nice to take in the shower or out.&lt;br /&gt;Easy peasey.</li>
            <li> Actually I bought this for my wife. I haven&#x27;t heard her cpmplain si I guess the product is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, nice size for a woman&#x27;s hand,  but need to get the right &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; for the close shave.</li>
            <li> I had to return this Shaver because I read in the instructions that it should not be used around oxygen.  Since I am on liquid oxygen 24/7 I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> The recharge system is awkward to use.  Seems to work well bit plugging it to recharge uses a whole strip.</li>
            <li> simple product, works great.</li>
            <li> Great product!! works really good but breaks easily. But it worth of its price!! Gives me pretty close shave!</li>
            <li> It works but not that great</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  I especially like to use it for bikini area.  I would get another one.  Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave well at all, especially in bikini area.</li>
            <li> No sh**, this product changed my LIFE! Of all the hundreds of purchases I have made on Amazon, this is my absolute FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!! I no longer keep any razors around, this electric shaver has replaced them FOREVER! I use this for legs, underarms, bikini area, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: It is SO much easier and quicker than traditional shaving and just all around BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;Razors always got me that close shave, but left me with irritated and inflamed skin 12-24 hours later. This electric shaver gets me incredibly smooth skin (ALMOST as close as a razor!!) with absolutely none of the resulting irritation. BONUS - my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; when it grows back like it did when I was shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on how I use this product to get the best results:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of experimentation, I now use this only on **completely** dry skin (aka NOT after a shower or even within 30-60 minutes after a shower). I was never really interested in trying out it&#x27;s wet shaving capabilities, but when I have tried on damp skin a while after a shower, the shaver does NOT glide across the skin and is pretty much rendered useless. This is not a fault of the product of course, rather this is pretty much to be expected. Sometimes I just forget to to shave before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Moving on.&lt;br /&gt;****I recommend using the trimmer first if the hair you are shaving is any longer than 2-3 mm.****&lt;br /&gt;For legs: If my hair has grown a bit long I start out with the pop-up trimmer and glide that along my legs (if not I skip to the next step). Then I go back over the same area LIGHTLY GLIDING along my skin with the foil. THEN, if I want an extremely close shave, I go over the skin yet AGAIN but this time pressing down a bit more. Even though I go over the same areas several times with this process, it takes less than two minutes to shave my legs. For all three steps, I use the shaver AGAINST the direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;For underarms: I *press* the foil piece across each underarm area two or three times, going in a different direction each time. Thirty seconds and they are done. Boom.&lt;br /&gt;For bikini area: I usually only use the trimmer piece for this area and I *always* go only WITH the direction of the hair. Thirty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, why the need for the detailed directions? I recommended this product to a girl friend of a mine and she HATED it! I still can&#x27;t for the life of me understand how anyone could dislike this product. She claimed it didn&#x27;t work...?!?! What a shame. I didn&#x27;t bother giving her the instructions I laid out here because after all, she did insult my favorite product of all time! (Joking but also serious)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver has stopped working twice since I bought it. The first time was after, instead of cleaning it with a damp rag, I dunked it under a faucet (still don&#x27;t fully understand what happened). Second time was after dropping it on hard ground off a 3 foot counter. Both times I thought it was a goner for real. But instead of throwing it out right away, I let it sit for a while (not in the charging stand) and both times, 24-48 hours later, when I tried the power switch it magically turned back on like it was never ever mad at me in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just madly in love with this thing. When it does reach the end of its life, I will not hesitate to buy the exact same model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself the greatest favor of all time and buy this product. Experiment with it to determine how it works best for you.</li>
            <li> if you have fine hair it doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
            <li> Bulky but get&#x27;s the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this at the end of November and it worked great for 1 month. Then when I attempted to recharge it, nothing...... It won&#x27;t charge at all. The light on the charger says its going but no matter how long I charge it, its dead. Bummer because when it was working I loved the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of women&#x27;s shaver.  This one is, by far, the best. It cuts closer and more thoroughly than all the others.  The blades last longer than the other brands.  The shaver does miss a few leg hairs,  but it is a &amp;#34;keeper.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for young/beginning shavers.  It does not shave super close (There is no &amp;#34;touchable smooth&amp;#34; here).  However, it does work and my girls love it (since they were/are afraid of cutting themselves).  It really only holds enough charge for about 20 minutes or one shave.  But if you keep it plugged in when you&#x27;re not using it, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> works AMAZING! very smooth and NO irritation. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic for men for years and really loved it. This one is very good and much less expensive than the mens model. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Wife uses it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have had this for many years and it finally broke. It was my fault though, I dropped it face down in a cast iron tub. I will not be ordering another one. It wasn&#x27;t my favorite model. I want more of a trimmer than a shaver. The shaver pulls long hair and it hurts! I want a trim, to keep hair neat. If you keep your hair short and want to shave every day then this is for you. I want to shave a few times a week if that just to keep it small. Make sure you know what type of tool you need, it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> So far all ok. Has not been used much as of now.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well until it just stopped working one day, within a month of the warranty expiring.  Problem is, there&#x27;s no good alternative shaver at this price range - the others at this price have poor reviews or seem to be just for bikini lines, whereas I want a good one for shaving my legs and underarms.  Sadly, I may end up buying this same model.  Nice marketing strategy by Panasonic .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, but great for thighs.</li>
            <li> I received the item and it wont turn on I Even put it on the charger over night and nothing. I was really looking forward to this item. I have heard these are amazing but would love to know why mine didn&#x27;t work :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> Nice close shave. Too close!</li>
            <li> I normally do not care for this kind of shaver but needed something due to having back surgery. I bought this based off of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I am very pleased with this purchase. And I can&#x27;t believe for the price of about $18 what a great job this shaver does! I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure how well a shaver would work. Needless to say, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased that does what it says it will do. And all for what I feel is a very low price. I also love the fact that I can just pop the top off and rinse it off. Low maintenance at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my wife.  She has used it regularly since it arrived, and gives it rave reviews.  As far as how long it lasts, we haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell. I think we have had the razor about a month.</li>
            <li> My first mistake was that I thought it was going to do an amazin job. Its a shaver, i dont know how close i thought i was going to get with this but....i rather use a disposable shaver. If you&#x27;re looking to do a quick fix, this product is for you. U get a more temporary effect than if you use a disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this  razor due to all good comments about it, excellent choise, I am very happy. great</li>
            <li> i prefer to use this product dry, i tried wet and it pinched me. Some people would argue it doesn&#x27;t get close enough but to me its perfect because even tho it doesn&#x27;t get all the way to the skin it shaves off unwanted longer or short thick black hairs really quick without having to jump in the shower or get water everywhere, especially if you are rushing out the door and the outfit that looks best after changing 5 times shows legs or underarms a quick trim down and slap some lotion on you are good to go! it gets pretty close but you can feel just a little tiny bit of stubble but for me as long as you can&#x27;t see the hair thats all i care about .</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the exact one I had purchased many years ago.  I needed a new blade but the new shaver was cheaper than the blade!</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin i give it 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;but i didn&#x27;t like it that much cause its not TOO Strong.. i wanted something TOO strong :D</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Not as close a shave as a manual razor but close enough.</li>
            <li> It works well but is kind of heavy; I like the rechargeable feature which is the reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Easy to use. Works really well.</li>
            <li> It does that work. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It pulls on my hair at random, so I stopped using it after the first use.  Now its just collecting dust, not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor! Love the way it shaves close and clean. It is also compact and very easy to recharge. Lightweight and easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever, super easy-to-use, and looks so cute too! Works well in water, as well. Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> The best! Chargeable, sleek, sturdy, effective.  Cleans easily. Use in or out of the shower. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Just ordered this wet/dry one to replace the old dry one I dropped in water and broke.  I love it so far! I love that there is not a long cord on the charger and the razor works great!</li>
            <li> not as great as I had hoped or as advertised, I use it but it does not shave close enough and will not purchase again</li>
            <li> iam alergic to wax so i was searching for a shaver which will give me a very close and smooth shave. finally i found this and iam now very happy that it gave me a close shave without burns. i love it.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years so I wasn&#x27;t sure which to get.  This one was cheap and still had what I was looking for.  It worked great!  I used it dry on my legs that hadn&#x27;t been shaved for a month (gross I know).  It worked great.  You do have to go slow or it will pull the hair which I had to learn the hard way.  It&#x27;s not as clean as a razor but I think I&#x27;ll actually use this so it&#x27;s better by far.  It looks like I&#x27;ve shaved with a razor and that&#x27;s all I really care about.</li>
            <li> The item was as described. Very good deal. My wife is very satisfied (used for two weeks).I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to let everyone know how well this shaver performs. It is worth every cent! I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a product like this! I did look several other places and sites and this was the best price anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;  Again you will NOT be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the best place to shop. I will say I have never been to any store or site that carries so many A+ products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;  :):):):):):):</li>
            <li> I have used the ES207P for years, but earlier this year, I decided to try the Panasonic ES2216, which I assumed, because it cost a little more, would be a better razor. That was a big mistake. I wasn&#x27;t getting the close shave and the razor, even when fully charged, wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge. So I ordered another ES2207P and am a happy shaver once again. I am getting my close shaves and I don&#x27;t have to rush to finish my second leg(before the razor dies).</li>
            <li> This shaver does not give a close shave on the legs, and I still have to go over them 3-4 times to get all the hair.  (I have fine, sparse leg hair; nothing heavy duty.)  Even after going over the legs several times, I can still feel little nubs.  For some reason it gives a closer shave on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s easier and faster than using a hand razor, but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter since she kept cutting herself while trying to shave her legs. She is very happy with the results and she isn&#x27;t using up all the bandaids.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis. I can&#x27;t use disposable razor because I always get razor burn or ingrown hairs. This is as close a shave as my body can tolerate. It will never be as good as a disposable but if you have sensitive skin and want something inexpensive this is the one. This is my second one, the first lasting about 3 years before it died.</li>
            <li> Great for people who practice lots of sports or just simply work out, it reduces the shaving time by a lot.</li>
            <li> Works as described, seems well made.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving my head (I&#x27;m a man) and the trimmer blades on both sides were always jumping in when I didn&#x27;t want them to and sometimes nicked me.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that if it worked on a women&#x27;s legs and sensitive &#x27;bikini&#x27; area, that it would work on my scalp. Wrong. I gave it to a girl friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use razor. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> So convenient. No water needed, or can use in shower. Great service and delivery</li>
            <li> Okay nevermind the name here, its the wife writing the review.  I got this about a year ago and still love it. I&#x27;ve read that some had issues with the charging. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the charging.</li>
            <li> Still working&lt;br /&gt;Still working&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;And working under water in shower&lt;br /&gt;Read this. Above I mean&lt;br /&gt;Read this. Above I mean</li>
            <li> It works well, but it does pull and tug at the hair, which can be quite painful!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about 4 months ago and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It shaves closely, is easy to clean, and is rechargeable. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more; it&#x27;s everything that I needed it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the above aspects, I&#x27;m most impressed with the ease of cleaning. The entire top of the razor pops off by pushing 2 buttons on the side of the head, making it easy to get to the interior for deep cleaning. It comes with a dual-ended bristle brush for sweeping between blades and all the crevices. I found that I could even use the short bristle to sweep out the trimmer part of the razor while it&#x27;s running, making for shorter interruptions during larger shave jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a small square brick that plugs into a top spot on a power outlet and the razor stands upright on top of it. I like that the charger is small enough not to block other outlet slots. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and highly recommend it for someone looking for a decent electric razor on a thrifty budget. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> gave this to wife, she said it&#x27;s one of the best shavers she ahs used.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of an electric shaver. I love it. It works well on facial hair as well as the legs. I haven&#x27;t tried it on the bikini line but I expect it will also perform well in that area.</li>
            <li> Had to finally replace my old rechargeable shaver and got this one. The charge seems to last forever, so great for camping or beach trips.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully. I like the ability to use it dry or wet. I have a hard time with razor burns with razor blades, not a problem with this electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas (she asked for it).  It charged easily and she said she loved the job it did.  She was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. So does her Mom and now she wants one too. It is easy to handle and shaves very smooth. I highly recommend this product. Please read all instructions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for over 20 years, and they have come a looooong way, baby! This razor gives a beautifully close shave, leaving me far more smooth feeling than I had anticipated, and leaving not a trace of stubble to be seen. I usually dry shave with it and am quite happy, although I did use it in the shower without any issues as well. Love this shaver!</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;This is what you&#x27;re looking for&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I arrived in good condition&lt;br /&gt;The packaged good&lt;br /&gt;Used comfortably and can be used dry and wet&lt;br /&gt;Excellent I felt comfortable with it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who uses it EVERY day.  She loves it!  I used it a couple of times as well and it works great!  I am thinking of ordering one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> It yanks hair out...no matted what length, wet or dry. I literally just threw mine in the trash. This product was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for many years. Due to health issues it was suggested I use only electric shavers. I researched on line and chose the Panasonic Close Curves. I am NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li> Never owned one before, but glad I ordered this one. Am very happy that this is my first and hopefully it will be my only razer</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with this shaver.  It does a great job. I like the rechargeable feature. It is always ready.</li>
            <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I give this electro shaver 5 star comment excellent I buy it again and tell friends and everyone to buy  thank you</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have had to use men&#x27;s shavers in the past.  I&#x27;m impressed that I can use it wet or dry and that I there replacement parts are available.  I&#x27;m not sure what makes it a ladies shaver, except for the pink color.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Really like this electric razor!  Very long battery life and love the way it makes your skin feel soft and barren of hair!  I recommend it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far but I can see, if a couple years down the road it gets a low battery quickly, at least it won&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; a leg to replace it. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for the money I paid. I works WAY faster than my last one. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Effective, very good product,  and it is not expensive. You can use it dry or wet, easy to use, and safe.</li>
            <li> I got this for someone with a heart condition who is taking blood thinners.  They loved it as it shaves really close without the fear of a cut or nick that could cause excessive bleeding.  It holds its charge for days.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after 2 other brands were a miserable failure, she really likes it. not quite as close as a razor, but she is very pleased</li>
            <li> Always a bit hesitant to write a review after only using a product three or four times, but the shaver works well on underarms and legs so far and is much quieter than the Remington that it is replacing. It is quiet that I keep wondering if it is actually fully charged, yet it is doing the job well.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the shaver. Works very well and I liked the shape and design of the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I gifted my sister with one just like it, she needs it cause she has to be on blood thinners, and this is a great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this incredibly affordable shaver 9 months ago. I am happy to report that despite being less than the cost of replacement blades for my former shaver, it has stood up to the task so far and has done fantastic! It shaves closer than my old shaver did, and that one probably cost over $50. I am very pleased with how long it holds a charge. The small wall charger is also convenient. Often I will charge the shaver for 24 hours after using it, then come back to it about 2-3 weeks later, and it always has enough charge to do my legs and armpits. It also does well if you are using it more frequently than weekly, and seems to consistently cut without pulling or scraping. For the price, I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> Would expect this to cost considerably more.  Almost did not purchase because price was so reasonable.  Would recommend it and will purchase the same if  it should ever conk out. Had the previous same  issue for many years.</li>
            <li> Since this was a recent purchase I&#x27;ve not had a chance to use it much (the reason for only 4 stars), but so far I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it dry, as I was wanting one I did NOT have to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;So far it seems to work great. Comfortable, &amp; a close shave. I like the fact the charging unit is extremely small. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  Great value for the price.  My wife had a hip replacement and needed something to use while she was recuperating.  She liked it so much, she may use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> After using the shaver twice, I removed the head to clean it. When trying to remove the outer foil (screen), one of the little white side pieces broke off as soon as I touched it. I put it back together and decided it probably wouldn&#x27;t make a big difference. The next time I cleaned it, the other piece broke off the foil. It would not work at all without those pieces. When I called the warranty department, they said I had to mail the whole shaver to their MCAllen, TX, store at MY expense. A new foil is only $9.95. It would be cheaper for me to just buy a new foil. I had one of these years ago and it worked well. That&#x27;s why I purchased another one. I don&#x27;t care for their warranty service. I will not purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> The shaver cut well without grabbing hair or biting my skin.  I was very satisfied with the results and impressed at the improved technology compared to years ago.</li>
            <li> This is nice and sturdy but it does not shave close. I bought one of these before and the same thing. I bought this for my 12 year old daughter because I did not want her using a reg razor. I have since had to purchase something else that shaves closer.</li>
            <li> I like that this can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for any lady, especially the preteen girl whom this was purchased for.  It&#x27;s a great option for a young girl to learn to shave her legs without having to worry about cuts  &amp; nicks from shaving.  It has a nice travel bag.</li>
            <li> I like the this unit, it shaves close and charges quickly, easy to clean and store. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my old Remington with this Panasonic version. They both look very similar. I plugged it in overnight before using it and was pleasantly surprised at how quick, smooth and close the shave was on my legs. This new version has a one-piece charger/plug instead of a charger stand attached to a cord. The shaver sits upright directly on the plug, which is much nicer as far a storage (no messy looking tangled cord). Comes with instructions and a small fabric drawstring pouch.</li>
            <li> This shaver is quiet, holds a charge for several dry leg shaves, easy and comfortable to use.  My old electric shaver cut my skin this ones does not.</li>
            <li> This is the second we have bought.  Had another brand but it did not work very well nor last very long.  So back to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Finally! You know how hard it is to find these things locally when it&#x27;s not Christmas? What&#x27;s really messed up about that is what woman wants to receive hair removal products for Christmas? That&#x27;s like showing up on her doorstep bearing Massengill and mouthwash. So why these things are available only at Christmas is beyond me. End of rant. Anyway, it works like a charm, and not only did it work wonderfully on my legs but also under my arms, so I was very happy about that. I have a small shower and it&#x27;s a pain to shave in the shower. I don&#x27;t care about an extremely close shave, I just don&#x27;t want to feel like there is a silky mane of a braidable length on my legs, and it would be nice to go to the gym and not have to warn the trainer to avert his eyes when I have to lift my arms. Not that he cares. You know what I mean. Good product, glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love this razor!  I like to use it for touch ups on areas I missed or to travel with. I get to travel to developing countries and plan to take it with me so I can avoid nicks in questionable water and shower facilities while staying smooth. The quality is good, charge lasts a long time and I like that it is re-chargeable. This razor DOES NOT get you the super smooth feel like traditional razors, nor does the results last as long as a traditional razor, but you get the look of smoothness that most women want.</li>
            <li> This is the best women&#x27;s electric razor I have ever owned. It holds a charge for weeks and it give a pretty close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> 2 years weekly twice use, it is still working fine and also has never shown wear and tear. good product. good value for money</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a wet / dry shaver.  It does a great job !! I didn&#x27;t use shaving foam, just clear water in the shower, and it gave a nice shave.  It&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> i am loving this. my ingrown hair are fading just by using princereigns shaving gel and this electric razor. i absolutely feel hope. i have been struggling with ingrown hair for some time. recommended</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It hold a charge for a very long time and can be used both dry and in the shower.</li>
            <li> Sometimes women just need a quick shave also. Works well for an elelectric and stays charged a long time. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> When I first got this package I was so happy with it, it arrived 2 days before scheduled, it charged very quickly, it was so easy to use and the price was good. But it didn&#x60;t last long, in less than a month it  stopped working, the little vibrating unit slowed down and faded away every time I turned it on, it wouldn&#x60;t work even for 1 full minute. I tried recharging it, but no result. In the description it said waterproof, I didn&#x60;t use it in water just to be on the safe side, but it still came up with problems. I don&#x60;t want to deal with all the hassle of returning the product and asking for my money back, I just want to let you all know that think twice before buying this. I  DO NOT recommend this, and it is a total waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver for \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and this one is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, works easily and leaves everything smooth and clean.  I use it dry after showering.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;March 2014: I&#x27;ve had this shaver over a year now and it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve had.  Still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a rechargeable razor that works well. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. The charger is great. No cords. It plugs into the wall; the razor plugs into the top of the charger. Very handy.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter as a first razor and it works as intended and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned! Bought one for me and one for my best friend, she and I both have 2 different types of hair and growth. I have dark course ingrown hairs in certain areas and she has fine soft blond hair with hardly any ingrowns. With they being said, I bought this on a whim for myself first. I&#x27;ve never owned an electric razor before and actually considered an epillator. I looked thru tons and tons of reviews but couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted and what was best for me both for hair and $$. I have no problems springing the money but it better be worth what I&#x27;m paying for! When I saw the recommendations for this razor and the price, it was too good to be true. Shipping was fast and easy Thanx to amazon prime and the box/product was all there the way it should be sent. I let it charge 1st before using it. My hair was a little on the long side on my legs and bikini area (was going to wax before I made my decision to get this razor lol) so I figured why not try it now. The results were impeccable! It got every little hair and the ingrowns!!!! I&#x27;m not over exaggerating. This worked beautifully! If it makes a difference, I used this razor dry. No it didn&#x27;t give me the silky smooth finish like a razor in the bathroom would but throw some lotion on your skin and problem solved. It also cut my shave time down in half! Usually I&#x27;m in the shower for a lengthy amount of time and this just took 10 min to do my whole body! When I bragged about this to. My best friend she demanded shed get one too so I picked one up for her on amazon too and her shaving experience was the same but closer to a smooth finish since she used hers in the shower. We are very proud and happy with this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I know it says \\&quot;my name\\&quot; is Richard but I&#x27;m Jill, I use my finances amazon account to buy stuff :-) didn&#x27;t want women to think a man wrote this lol</li>
            <li> Good price and works very well, this is the first time I have bought the 3 blade wet/dry shave, thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Shaver of this kind that I&#x27;ve bought. It works so great that this time I purchased one for my daughter. Its great for new shavers and experienced. My only issue is that the battery isn&#x27;t that great after 1 year. With this new one however I found it comes with a 2 year warranty.  I&#x27;ve tried other&#x27;s and always come back to this one. Best bang for your buck</li>
            <li> I gave this item 5 stars because it is the most comfortable razor to hold and gives such a close and perfect shave  - I love that I can use this item in the shower as well as using it dry - It arrived really fast and was very well packaged - Excellent service and an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, but. It&#x27;s not as close as a real razor, but it&#x27;s very convenient and nice to use. The instructions say it can be used wet or dry, but I recommend wet with a good shaving lotion. Otherwise, the hairs pull some. No matter what, you are going to have a little bit of stubble. Next time, I may try a men&#x27;s electric razor, but I&#x27;ll use this one till it dies.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this shaver when I first purchased it.  Close shave, easy to use.  After two months, the batteries wouldn&#x27;t recharge.  Seems like many are having the same problem.  I checked the price on replacement batteries and found it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  Just another disposable razor!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I like it better than my previous more expensive brand of rechargeable shaver.  It shaves close to the skin but is not abrasive and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my razor broke and I chose it because it was rated #1 in the women&#x27;s razors category. I completely understand why. It&#x27;s an amazing razor. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, gets all of my hair in one or two swipes and feels smooth on my body. Only two things I dislike about it is the upright plug-in charger  (it is hard to get out of the charger and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t look discreet) and the razor is louder than I would like it to be. Overall, best razor ever.</li>
            <li> I consider it an excellent product, performs the function for which it was created, my wife loved much. hold a charge, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> For the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife swears by this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just loves it.  Need 6 more words ok all done.</li>
            <li> This thing is so nice and easy to. Its even better when im in a hurry i love this razor</li>
            <li> Excellent product, inexpensive to purchase, sount not very loud,  simple to recharge, light weight easy to handle either left or right hand, provides wet or dry shaving (can be used in bath tub or shower)... My wife highly recomends this product...</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever  had.  It gives a very clean and smooth shave.  I would highly recommend this razor to any one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for wet and dry shaving of my legs.  I do not have thick hair at all and this shaver should have been able to do the job effortlessly if it was even close to the wonderful reviews written about it. This shaver cut the hair about half way leaving horrible stubble and the hair it did remove did so by PULLING it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was able to return this item it would&#x27;ve been done the first day I got it!</li>
            <li> The presumptuous \\&quot;this works fine if you know how to use it\\&quot; is absolutely absurd. This is the worst electric razor in its class that I have come across. The foil doesn&#x27;t catch 90% of your hair, and the trimmer makes for an incredibly uneven trim. Cleaning it is ridiculous, I actually had to use an old tooth brush to get it clean. Also, it does not hold a charge-- I&#x27;m a very short, thin person, and after [attempting] to shave both my legs, the battery was about done for.</li>
            <li> I have multiple tattoos so I regularly use a shaver for my arms and chest. After my older shaver [[ASIN:B000KQJNNO Remington WDF-5000 Smooth and Silky ladies shaver]] started becoming dull I decided to try this Panasonic after reading great reviews. However, speaking on behalf of men using this product, it does not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Razor is dull. Leaves little bits of stubble. Feels cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work great for ladies. For you guys, spend a little more and get a Remington product instead.</li>
            <li> It works well and is better than my cutting myself with a razor. My legs felt smoother when I used it in the shower with shaving cream. I would recommend the product to any woman who is tired of cutting herself with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> gift to my daughter.  She loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Not a perfect shave, but great for a pre teen.</li>
            <li> This a great shaver!  It gives a nice clean shave and I love the fact you can place it on the charger and don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. I have tried quite a few different electric razors. This is the best one I have tried. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I am still hoping that I am doing something wrong and that with time I will work out how to use this shaver without it hurting as it pulls out hairs and snags on them.  First experience with an electric razor so like I said maybe its me but for now I&#x27;m definitely not impressed!</li>
            <li> Used this product only 4 times and the outer foil already has holes in it.  Contacted Panasonic and of course this part is not covered by warranty.  Waste of money, will never by this brand again.  A company that does not stand behind their product is not worth doing business with.</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect. shave is quite close without the annoying razor cut</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shaver. Smooth and strong. It holds its charge much better than most. A winner!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  no cord plugs tightly into the recharger in the outlet.  Nice pop up trimmer for the hard to reach spots.  Cleaning a breeze with parts that come apart and snap back together easily.  Very pleased with this item.  Under $20 is an amazing price.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do the job it said. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor but I like it. The charge lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to put it on the charger every day.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money... bought two as gifts both my girls hate them. Battery on  a full charge is good for four minutes......if you can shave in that amount of time your good..</li>
            <li> I like this razor. It gives you the basics and does a good job. I&#x27;m not crazy about the charger or that there is no indicator when the charging is complete but for the price I really like it!</li>
            <li> Got this bad boy for myself a few months back and I think I am in Love. Shaving has never been easier and more pleasant without all the mess and fuss. I use for dry shaving, never tried the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charged this 2 times since I have had it but I ain&#x27;t gonna fib and say that I use it all the time. I am more of a in-the-moment kind of a gal and will just shave my legs when I get in the tub, old habits die hard.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor. Charges great. Owned for a year and still works like new.</li>
            <li> I really like the shave this razor gives.  Used mostly on my bikini area I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave.  But 5 months after purchasing the power is on the fritz.  I had to bang it on the wall to turn on and it jumps in power.  Not impressed that I have to purchase something else already.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it- during the winter we ladies get a little lazy with leg de-forresting. More so if you&#x27;re a super busy student. I love the hell out of this razor. I was super (and pleasantly) surprised with how great a shave I got with this thing. It is kind of loud but it&#x27;s not a tragedy. My roommate loves it too. I&#x27;ll be ordering her her own and I&#x27;m getting one for my mom, too. This razor exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this Shaver it is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver. Does a good job in the bakini area. I can&#x27;t say it never grabs a hair and gives it a good tug like all the other ones do but I&#x27;d say there are less ouchies than the others I&#x27;ve used. Works great on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of the same razor.  I was advised to use this during chemo to reduce risk of infection from cuts, and after my breast surgery as a lymphedema risk reduction measure.  I have used this in the shower once but prefer to use it in dry mode..  Since purchasing this razor, my daughter asks to use my razor from time to time so I purchased one for her too.  The cut may not be as close as from a standard razor, but by the same token, there is no razor burn left behind as sometimes is the case with a standard razor.  The panasonic razor can&#x27;t be beat in terms of picking up and trimming upper hair from the thigh.  The pop-up razor is great for the bikini line as well.</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, easy to clean.  I did have to find an electrical outlet where the unit could stand upright, since the charger demands that position.  Be aware that there is no cord; the charger plugs directly into the base of the shaver and this unit must be upright when plugged in.  So when plugged in, it is NOT in my bathroom due to lack of open and properly situated outlets.</li>
            <li> Works well and is convenient to use.  Big improvement over blade razor.  Exceptionally well built and obvious quality.  Gives close shave.</li>
            <li> SO FAR, I am in love with this shaver. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far so GREAT! Now I do plan on editing this review after some time has passed, because it seems that some other customers didn&#x27;t have the best luck with the product lasting. At this point, I was able to shave my legs (which I had let go for a bit too long-luckily I&#x27;m in a comfortable relationship, lol), my underarms, and the more delicate areas of my body with no problems whatsoever. I&#x27;ve only used the product dry, and it gives a VERY close shave! I was afraid it would leave a small stubble, but I was wrong! I&#x27;m really hoping this thing lasts, because so far I am in love with it! This is all coming from the lazy girl who despises shaving in the shower. If it lasts, I intend on buying more as gifts for my equally lazy friends! :)</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this. According to her, if the hair is long, it would pull it out rather than cut it. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I only use it for my underarms, but I like it better than my shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first tried out this product that I bought my little sister one for her birthday. I&#x27;m very sad to say that these just don&#x27;t last. The battery burns out really quickly and then refuses to recharge. Honestly spend the money and buy something that will last.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my wife she loves it. Keeps her gorgeous legs smooth. Great product great price. I might just buy one for my girlfriend. Stay up player</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is not water proof ladies, don&#x27;t buy it. I tried to up load pictures of the product after two use in the water and got stains, but they won&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> Works great for an electric shaver.  Much quicker.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Many people talked about the battery that stopped recharging after little time. I thought i would be lucky... Nope. Stopped working after 1 month. And Panasonic does not want to do anything. So, from 1 to 10?  Less than 1. Dont buy will be my advice.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic grip, gives a great quick shave. love the pop up trimmer and easy to clean. I buy a new one about every three years after I drop the old one and tear the foil up. worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally used it, but the person for whom I bought it likes it, so...yay!</li>
            <li> love it arrived early</li>
            <li> the wife: never had a foil-type razor before. i used to have to take a shower to shave my legs wet or my skin would get irritated, even with different brands and different shaving lotions/creams. i bought this and have gotten a clean and super quick shave on my legs. it&#x27;s great to be able to shave my legs dry and run out of the house.</li>
            <li> Does everything it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target for 19.99 cause I&#x27;m too lazy to shave with blades and shaving cream all the time. This is a life saver! It&#x27;s a lot faster and it works great! Close shave, great find for $20. The charger is weird. You have to mount the shaver on the charger, but everything else is great!</li>
            <li> Worst Shaver EVER!!!! I bought one in July, and it is not working only after 6 months!!! It just does not shave at all, makes a bad noise and pulls the hair! PAINFUL and definitely not worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these, they are a a great value for the money. It comes  with a convenient carrying case, and it has 2 heads for different size areas. My first is still going strong after 5 years, I just forgot it while I&#x27;m away for 4 months. It&#x27;s easy to charge too.</li>
            <li> Razor worked great until it stopped charging after 6 months of light use.</li>
            <li> NOT TOO GOOD - Very surprised so many like this shaver.  I find it  irrating and cannot finish shaving.  Also, the battery life is shorter than my previous shaver and not as expected.  Even though the price is low, I am looking for a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> very happy great product</li>
            <li> I like this and later bought one for my daughter. Price is great here compared to the store. Works well...</li>
            <li> very happy, find it does a better job using shaving gel. easy cleaning</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for my oldest daughter.  They both love this shaver!  Its got a nice design that is compact and easy to travel with.  Since its rechargeable, you can take it anywhere and even use it on the go.  This is a nice little ladies trimmer that won&#x27;t disappoint and its good for a broad range of ages, from a preteen girl on up.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old daughter because I wasn&#x27;t quite ready for her to start using a razor. I like that it can be used wet or dry and that it is rechargeable. However when she used it dry it gave her razor burn and when used wet still requires shaving cream. Also it does not give as close a shave as a razor, but for the cost and safety compared to a razor I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> UPDATED: just stopped working after less than 20 uses (it was awhile ago but I just decided to edit this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything--shaving with razors that cost a fortune, waxing, hair removal creams for sensitive areas--and everything has left my bikini line stinging, bumpy, even pimply no matter how well I exfoliate or what soothing products I apply. It even gets re-inflamed when hair grows back in. Before buying this, I tried a cheaper electric shaver to see if this route would be successful and it broke within two months. I traded up with this and I&#x27;m glad I did! My skin is smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> Charger doesn&#x27;t charge all the time but gets the job done. Wish it was a bit more close of a shave but you can&#x27;t really get any better with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Safe and easy to use .  If you can&#x27;t use a wet shaver and have tried products like no-no [expensive and uneffective], please do yourself a favor and try this shaver.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is perfect for me because my skin is thin and other shavers cause nicks this one does not. I also considered Consumers recommendation which rated this shaver excellent.</li>
            <li> My wife raves about it.  Good find! The shaver sells for the price of replacement cutters.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver because I&#x27;ve spent years with my leg in the bathroom sink trying to balance on the other leg and shave. I&#x27;ve cut my self hundreds of times not to mention running out of the blades i&#x27;ve used for years in my little personal shaver. I&#x27;m 67 years old and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to just sit on the couch, no water, no cuts, no shaving cream, no mess to clean up and be done in less than 10 minutes. if you hate shaving this shaver is for you. It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;d buy another one tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Works OK if you are in a hurry, but doesn&#x27;t really get very close unless you go reeeeeeeeal slooooooow.  Inexpensive and a good travel item.  I would not say this is an everyday razor.</li>
            <li> Its a good razor😊 for everyone who used it as a regular razor for their legs are not really thinking💁😒. I&#x27;m pretty sure its used for you downstairs area and your armpits. You don&#x27;t use electric razors for your legs I mean you can but most of you results will turn out wrong👎 Its just Common Sense💁 Also iont think its waterproof either cause when your shaving down there your only supposed to damp it then shave smh.</li>
            <li> best shaver i have ever used. i have too much hair on my face. being a women i want a smooth hairless face. this does the job if u use it correctly. i use it daily. but at first i was just moving it up and down like i shaved my legs. didn&#x27;t get the hair close enough and was not smooth. then i started to use it in a circular motion. what a difference. felt no stubble and left my face smooth</li>
            <li> Does a good job, even with aging eyes! Would recommend. I like to use it in shower. Charged pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this shaver , for the price, expect years of service the contour makes it easy to use the blades will stay sharp for the life of the battery. the one I had previously worked great until the battery finally played out which is the weak link with most rechargeable devices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having mixed feelings about this product. The first time 3 or 4 times I used it, I thought it was great. However, after that I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. It gets the job done if you&#x27;re willing to go over your shaving areas a few times and thoroughly clean the blades and take it apart to do that especially, while you&#x27;re in the middle of shaving. If you&#x27;re a woman who shaves everyday, or every other day this will work fine. Unfortunately, the 2 that I bought broke in under a year.</li>
            <li> Simple easy and relatively inexpensive. Why buy replacements when buying a new unit is cheaper. Great for travel and for those who are susceptible to razor burn.</li>
            <li> Although it does not shave as close as a razor it is great for a quick shave and shaves well enough. I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a year and also bought another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to get an electric shaver but I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a few months now and it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I use it for my underarms, my legs, and my bikini area when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just feeling lazy. I usually shave dry and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Works poorly both in the shower and out.  So dull it feels like the hairs are being pulled out.  Spend more money and get a useable shaver.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product! Not worth it! I thought it would at least serve as a leg razor! NOT</li>
            <li> This razor has been great so far.  I have been using it for a while now and it works pretty well as far as electric razors go.</li>
            <li> i wish i could return this piece of crap. i hate it. it was a waste of money. I&#x27;m not a hairy person....at ALL and this razor would not  even rid me of my nearly transparent arm hairs, let alone my 3 underarm hairs, or anything below that. it suck suck sucks!&lt;br /&gt;i can only imagine how much people with real hair hate it.</li>
            <li> This shaver gave a decent shave when it worked.  After 6 months, it just stopped coming on even though the wall charger showed it to be charging.  Although it has a 2 year warranty, I would have to ship it to California or New York for service, since those are the only two places that have service centers for this shaver.  And that&#x27;s way too much of a hassle for an $18 shaver.  No more Panasonic products for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most convenient thing to have, especially when I&#x27;m in a rush.  I reccomend this products to people that need to shave but hate too!  I know I do.</li>
            <li> It is starting out just fine.  I use the trimmer on the longer, neglected hairs, then use the shaver and that works well. Does not provide a close shave, but a close-enough shave.  Based on my experience with these shavers in the past, I expect that it wll last about 6 months, then die.  So far it is doing okay.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon, but I came here to read reviews before purchasing it at my local store (didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping).  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me only about 5 minutes to shave both legs from the knee down.  The shave was nice and smooth (as smooth as you will get without using a real razor in the bath or shower).  The razor did not nick me or irritate my skin or give me razor burn or rash of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this!!  Especially for the price!  (and if you are like me and never have time in the morning to shave in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver!</li>
            <li> This review is not about the product&#x27;s functionality at all, I couldn&#x27;t get to use it to assess if this works or not even, as soon as I opened the package I could see the shaver was used!!! The protective plastic cover on top of the shaver had a short hair plainly on the inside &amp; stubble near the blades! I would think a well known company like Panasonic would care to screen their merchandise for quality control. And to think they would be sending me something that someone else used before me (shudder !!! ) this is a personal grooming item &amp; who would want to share that??? one of the other reviewers stated that the item chopped up her pubic skin into pieces &amp; she returned the item, I unfortunately got something that someone else used like that, contaminated by who knows what!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning the shaver at once &amp; demanding that the seller make sure that they have better quality control over their wares! I am uploading pictures so that people can clearly see what they market. Future buyers beware, they clearly send back items people used &amp; returned (gross)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a loyal Amazon customer for many years, I am thoroughly disappointed about the negligence on the seller &amp; marketplace&#x27;s part on this transaction.</li>
            <li> easy to operate and does a good job.. definitely pleased with this product. also, very easy to clean and very compact.. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints with this one. I only use it dry, but the battery lasts a very long time and the shave is close without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> After losing my old standby, go figure how that happened, I was delighted to find this one here. My old one cost $75, so the price was almost too good to be true. But I have put it through the ringer, and it is standing the test of time.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver for when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor. Doesn&#x27;t make your legs completely smooth to the touch, but makes them hairless. Perfect for when I have last minute outfit changes into skirts and shorts and haven&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li> I have always used a Remington shaver but did not want to spend that much. I opted for the Panasonic shaver and love its sleek design and charger.  I hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get this shaver from Panasonic because the previous model was fantastic.  This one is similar, but what I miss on this shaver is the dual shaving heads. I found this model to be pretty good and for the price, it is well worth getting.  Has the raised trimmer if needed.  The on/off button is much easier to move than the previous model, so that is a nice feature.  Charges well and can get plenty of time to shave all major areas without battery dying out.  Price is good too.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver is very useful to me ,If you buy it ,you can find it is very easy tou ues and very nice.</li>
            <li> Works great for an electric razor. Close shave. So happy I made this purchase. I recommend this product, if looking for a portable, electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Do not expect a super close shave....it is an electric razor after all....not as close as a blade...BUT, I take this on week-long trips and I never bring the charger. It works on day 7 as well as day one. Although it is not a super close shave by feel, it is close enough to wear shorts without seeing any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it daily, it works great....if you wait a week and have longer hair....it does pull and hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> This razor is incredible smooth and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my skin.  Wet use is a great option and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> So far it has been really easy to use and I got it because a friend recommended it..  just pinches and pulls on longer soft hair..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful on the angle, sometimes this will pull the hair - but overall much less than other razors I&#x27;ve used. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> very nice product.  works great.  easy to use.  timely delivered.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t shave with electric razors because they don&#x27;t work. this one is the exception. It works great on legs. I use it dry just to be safe. it has never given me a problem so far. i feel like the charge lasts longer than other razors. i don&#x27;t experience razor burn either.</li>
            <li> Why have I been using a razor all these years?  This morning I said to myself that there HAD to be a better way.  I then got dressed and ran to my nearest department store and purchased this exact shaver.  It came with the charger which does not have a cord.  Just the wall brick and the razor sits right on it, cute as can be.  It comes with a two sided brush to clean the unit as well. This unit is wet/dry, meaning that you can use it in the shower.  I used it dry. First apply some lubricant like baby oil to the areas you want to shave.  I used my Neutrogena body oil with wonderful results. I went over the areas that I was struggling with when I was using the razor and OMG!!!!! What a miracle!  One, two, three...easy peezy and no fear of nicks. Took me all of five minutes to get all smooth and clean.  Seriously folks...this thing made me feel like I have been living in a cave for the last three decades.  Put down that old disposable and buy this baby.  You will be so happy!</li>
            <li> So soft and smooth. I couldn&#x27;t believe it for the price! I am very impressed, excellent product.</li>
            <li> A friend has one,,  I bought one for an elderly lady, she loves it,, and then I had to have one as well!&lt;br /&gt;shipped quickly,, worth the every penny</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectily for about 30 days.  However, after 30 days, it stopped working. It will not turn on even though it is fully charged. I&#x27;m not a happy camper. I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li> This purchase was more to do with water conservation than expecting a close shave.  That I am not spending time in the shower shaving aids in our conserving water and being smarter about our water usage.  That I have to shave more often isn&#x27;t a huge deal.  Electric shavers are not known for close shaves and this isn&#x27;t the exception, but it does do a good job as long as one follows the directions provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars is this isn&#x27;t a purchase that is a &amp;#34;Love It!&amp;#34;, I like it it does the job as intended.</li>
            <li> Its too good. Silky is the only word to describe it!</li>
            <li> AFTER 2 MONTHS, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.i bought this for my daughtet and she has  used it several different ways and it still leaves stubble</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who says it works as advertised for a modest price which by todays standard is great.</li>
            <li> Bought at $12.39 and works well for underarm hair</li>
            <li> My girl is a tween and so I was not comfortable using a razor on her yet, this really does the trick to get all that long hair off the legs. I used to foil top once we clipped back the longer hair with the comb end. Just go slow and do not use the foil on long hair or it will hurt. We used it dry because I feel it has better slip that way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this little razor . Its a great size and cuts wonderfully. However the charge only last a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working a little more than a month after I ordered it. And I missed the return/replacement option by just a few days. When it was working, it was great, but now I am thouroghly displeased and very disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Good&lt;br /&gt;works well&lt;br /&gt;good power&lt;br /&gt;I like the fluid adjusting angle options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The semi-Bad&lt;br /&gt;It sits directly on top of the plug charger. In the bathroom, I only have one bathroom outlet and other things to plug in, so it&#x27;s a bit of an outlet hog. I have an extension cord, but it would lay horizontal and on the floor, so I plug it into an outlet that isn&#x27;t in the bathroom. Not optimal.</li>
            <li> Was good while it worked but did not work for long. My buttons near the shaver head got stuck the second time I used it. Would return it if I had a choice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shaver, very impressed with results and how much faster it is to shave!</li>
            <li> I dont use this as often as I thought, mainly because it is so LOUD. Would have given 5 starts if it was silent, and didn&#x27;t snip the skin when not 100% charged. I do recommend this product, just be aware of snipping. Always use when 100% charged, and use when skin is completely wet &amp; completely dry. Using when skin is damp will cause snipping and discomfort. The shave isn&#x27;t completely close,like getting a wax but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a super shaver! It is not cheap in quality, like a lot of shavers are and it does shave to a smooth, baby bottom feel! You do have to move the razor in either circular movements or in numerous directions, but that is true with most electric shavers. I like the idea that it charges without a cord, but rather on a base which you plug into the wall. Keeps it off the counter and out of the way. Can use it wet or dry. I love mine! They do sell replacement screens and blades for this razor. It&#x27;s a good buy for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the second (they are not identical model numbers, but essentially the same) Panasonic razor I&#x27;ve bought.  This one was given to my elderly father-in-law. His health care aids say the razor works better &#x27;wet&#x27;. When used &#x27;dry&#x27; it pulls some.</li>
            <li> Works every time and does not cause skin rash....love it!</li>
            <li> old one went bad and replaced it with the same model and happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ever.  It gives me a nice clean shave and I use it dry tho I know it works both ways.  I also doy husband beard, mustache and thin his eyebrows. That lift up is great on the area under his chin and it really gets in close.  Works nicely on him.  Think he enjoys my shaver as much as I do</li>
            <li> I hate shaving with a razor because I would always get cut. I used to use my husbands old Norelco but this one works a lot easier. Works great at a great price.</li>
            <li> I used it a couple to times ot worked fine but not as close as a real razsor. Yeasrerday I was going to use it but I would not turn on and it was fully and it not turn iand is completely broken.</li>
            <li> Very dull.. seems old and rusted</li>
            <li> Great price! It was cheaper to buy this than get replacement blades for my old shaver. This one is great because it&#x27;s rechargeable. Not having to buy batteries anymore makes this an even better value.</li>
            <li> it worked when i first got it, but now it doesnt, its like i didnt shave at all, im going to just end up throwing it away ! and buy a norleco</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for 10 months and I love it. The price makes it even more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;You have to remember that this is an electric razor, it&#x27;s never going to provide the exact same shave as a traditional razor. It is convenient and easy to use and charge. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> best razor ever for under arms</li>
            <li> Works quite well. Sometimes feels like it catches a little - I&#x27;ve said ouch a few times, but it&#x27;s not really painful. Most of the time it&#x27;s good. I certainly don&#x27;t avoid using it for pain reasons. It&#x27;s a good shaver. I would recommend it. It just wasn&#x27;t as good as my old one which they don&#x27;t make now.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets impressively close. Nearly as good as a razor. Only problem is the battery doesn&#x27;t last long. About long enough for me to finish one leg.&lt;br /&gt;Over the year the battery started taking longer and longer to charge with a shorter and shorter life. unfortunately it&#x27;s not the kind of shaver where you can simply pull the battery out and buy a new one to insert in. You have to use a screwdriver to take it apart.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  I love how there are no wires and how you charge it upright from your outlet!  Definitely convenient product to be wet/dry.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE PRICE!  WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who had nicked herself badly using conventional razors (even 4-blade razors). She can use this in the shower; it glides over curves, gives a smooth close shave. No more band-aids!</li>
            <li> This is okay...not as close of a shave as using a regular shaver, and also isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling when using...feels like it pulls on the skin too.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I think this is the 4th one I have owned.  Very close shave, almost as close as a manual razor.  And I didn&#x27;t have to go back over the same spot more than once, like I had to with my old one.  The charger is small and plugs directly into an outlet, with no cord to have to worry with.  I plan to order another one, just to have a spare.  Great product and very affordable!</li>
            <li> I had this same shaver for many years and when it \\&quot;died\\&quot;, I was afraid it was not still being made.  The pop-up blade is perfect for shaving your bikini line and leaves no skin irritation.  That alone, is a big seller for me.  I normally shave my legs with a regular blade and cream, but this shaver is perfect when I am pressed for time and need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver ladies and this is a very good one.  You plug the whole thing into the wall and wait like over night for it to charge.  Yes, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th shaver from Panasonic and this is by far the best so far. Holds a charge and lasts for several shaves.</li>
            <li> Read reviews prior to buying. It gives a fairly close shave and works well. Easy to clean and use. Just what I wanted. Closer shave than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy device, but does not provide as clean a shave on my legs as I expected.  Will continue to use it as I tore up my legs with the disposal razors.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver,but not perfect for arms.Anyway,I suggest you to buy this item as it is very useful.</li>
            <li> I have had a Panasonic for many years and it just stopped working . I knew the reliability of the product so I wanted to order another. I was so surprised when I received the new Panasonic, It had a larger curved head and much quieter than the old one. The best part was the charger, I no longer have to search for a place to stand the charger unit on, I just plug it in to the socket and there it perches until ready...Many companies today seem to make things smaller or not as sturdy as the old versions,  that is why it is so good to see the new Panasonic has the same quality that I expected. Thank You...</li>
            <li> Love this Panasonic cordless shaver.  Had one from another manufacture. Not good:-(.  This Panasonic shaver holds a charge for a long time, and does a great job.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> definitely works but i kind of had to struggle a bit at first to find the best way to get a close shave on my nether regions, lol. . had to pass over the area several times. it is not silky smooth but good enough for my needs. next time i&#x27;ll do a wet shave with shaving gel to see if that works better. had no problems with charging it. this is much better than using a razor, and hopefully it will save some money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have never used this razor while my legs are wet, but it works great on dry legs! And the best part is no razor burn! Yay!</li>
            <li> This was just as promised. Charged easily and hold a charge well. My legs are very appreciative of the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver!  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to buy one.  I had always heard they didn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor.  They don&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s close enough.  I can&#x27;t stand to have any stubble on my legs so I like to shave every day.  This makes it so easy--I can just run this over my legs when I have 2 minutes.  No soap, no water, no shaving cream.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> not extremely close shave but when in a hurry, this does the trick. Battery seems to last long.</li>
            <li> I was so scared of this but I had to give it a try. I wasn&#x27;t sure why but I really wanted it. So I bought it. It arrived in a good shape and with information plus a little brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading so many people saying this stops working and stuff. I used it without charging it for the first time. On my legs. I was ready to cry my heart our but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. What you have to do is have it all against your skin. It won&#x27;t rip it off even though the sound the thing makes tells you otherwise. I was so amazed I told my girlfriend and we bought one for her too. I still feel no pain when I use it but I do not charge it for 12 hours. NO WAY! Anything that is plugged for so long it breaks easily. It is common sense. I charge it for 3 hours before I will use it if I haven&#x27;t used it in like a week and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did absolutely love it the first time and now I just really really like it but it is because I wish I didn&#x27;t need to keep shaving! It&#x27;s a personal issue though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how easy it is, how good it is with my skin (no cuts or anything) and how fast I can shave now!</li>
            <li> good product, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very happy with this Panasonic and the purchase process with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Needed a shaver after knee replacement.  Could not use a razor for 6 weeks.  This did a great job. ...</li>
            <li> My previous electric shaver worked well for 20 years but did not shave my underarms.  I bought a new Panasonic ladies shaver.  I was not sure which shaver to buy.  I am very pleased to say that this shaver works great on legs and underarms.  I get a close shave with no nicks or pulls.  I use the shaver dry.  I have not tried it wet.  I like it so well, I bought one for my daughter for Christmas.  Yes, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product and thus far it has held up to every single one.  Great shave and exactly what I expected from a foil razor.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed. have been looking for a wet dry shaver and found this one and to actually be rechargeable? great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Read a lot of reviews on different brands and decided on this one and very very happy with it!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Spend your money on something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m usually the one to ignore the most extreme best or worst reviews, reasoning that some people love a brand no matter what you put in front of them and some people write angry about the manufacturer because they can&#x27;t find the power button. This time though, I definitely wasted my money as this may serve better as a vibrator than a razor since it doesn&#x27;t cut / trim / razor anything the first 6 times, either with the pop-up trimmer or flat. I only gave it 1 star because that&#x27;s the lowest you can go and I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the battery charge. (For the love of all that is holy, if you decide to try this &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34;, please don&#x27;t actually try it except as a razor. Someone really needs to get on developing a sarcastic font...)</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my daughter who&#x27;s learning to shave her legs and allows her independence.  She really likes it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver for the money, what more can I say.</li>
            <li> I hate buying razors all the time so I picked this up.  I have only had to charge it like maybe once a month or 6 weeks.  Doesn&#x27;t pinch the skin, great for shaving your legs and pits :)</li>
            <li> I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described. It&#x27;s always great getting what was advertised at a great price.</li>
            <li> Best cheap, electric shaver out there!  Love it!</li>
            <li> FINE PRODUCT----LOW PRICE !!!</li>
            <li> Just an average shaver.  I used to have a Remington that my daughter &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34;, and I was hoping to replace it in the same price range.  I will replace with another Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer is a nice touch though.</li>
            <li> shaves all area perfectly came on time&lt;br /&gt;nice features all around havent got sstuck better than any raor ive tried its great highly recommended</li>
            <li> SHOPPED AROUND A LOT FOR A SHAVER FOR MY WIFE, MOST WERE BATTERY OPERATED. THIS IS RECHARGEABLE AND WAS A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  It is sharp and cuts cleanly.  This is a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> My old one broke and was skeptical about buying one online but I must say I&#x27;m very satisfied. It actually shaves better than the one I had. Has a charger so no more batteries, even better #</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an electric shaver for women that does as good of a job as a good man&#x27;s shaver, but haven&#x27;t had any success finding anything, until I ordered the Panasonic ES2207P from Amazon. It shaves closer than anything I&#x27;ve tried to date (dry shave). And for 1/3 of the price of this Phillips Ladyshave Sensitive HP6366 that I bought from Walmart, that&#x27;s going back tomorrow. Seems that Phillips knows how to make fantastic men&#x27;s electric shavers, but gets a failing grade on their womens&#x27; models. Good job, Panasonic!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. It keeps charge good and is very easy to use..</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  I wish I had used one of these or had been told to use one of these a long time ago.  I have psoriasis and a straight blade causes a blood bath but this electric razor is a thing of beauty on my legs.</li>
            <li> It was great for about 2 months. Now it pinches skin and doesn&#x27;t cut hair well. I regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great light weight electric razor. Very quiet and also a close shave even when using it dry on short of longer leg hair.  The shape of the razor itself makes it very easy to hold and position correctly to shave.  The extra feature of the trimmer is very nice and easy to set and use, just a flick of the button up and the trimmer is raised.  Easy to use on the head neck trim line.  The shipping and packaging was excellent and easy and quick shipping, earlier than expected.  The changer unit is small and easy to use with the razor attached.  Will travel nicely in the travel bag included.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job, but by no means as close as I expected.  OK to trim, but not close at all.</li>
            <li> The wife is on blood thinners. She started &#x27;squirting&#x27; from the nicks of her traditional razors. Dr recommended an electric. Found this one highly recommended and it was worth it. Rechargeable and wet safe. Works well. ;-)</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to - holds a charge well (lasts me over a week!). Easy to grip. Very glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have a reason to shave all the time and it is fantastic. I leave it on a charger which is prob not the best idea but overall it does its job.</li>
            <li> Great razor - you want to use it in the shower with soap - glides on your legs and underarms.  Very close shave too</li>
            <li> Excellent product. That’s why have ordered it 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend. Good product in cheap price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does a great job, very close shave.  Love it.  I do wish it had a corded charger instead of just a plug, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase and it works as stated. I get a close shave and I am happy to give up the single edge razor now. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t leave stubble behind - very smooth results. Not bulky, so portable. Charges quickly and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I am glad I try this shaver. My previous electrical used to pull my skin and I gave up and went back to razors. This little thing saved me a lot of money already and works just the way it should. I got several shaves with one charge (legs and armpits). The bikini area is best when is fully charged, and it do the job in a snap. I decide to wait a while to see how long it would last and so far so good. I got mine September 2014, it is June 2015 and still going strong. I use shave cream, but once I run out and use soap only with no problem. I do not use dry because my skin get dry with any dry shave and even moisturizer shows it for two days (but that is just the way my skin is). Very smooth if you get the right angle (close to the blade opposite the trimmer for me).  Also, I used to have the skin darkened after shaving in the bikini area and armpits, but no more. I guess the razors were irritating my skin and i did not realize it. Now there is no dark spots anymore. Very have with the product. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> im really happy with this product</li>
            <li> Great for a battery powered shaver.  Real blades are the best....BUT they can cut you and then you have to deal with the mess.  I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife, and she likes it very much. That is about all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had had the same Panasonic product previously and it lasted for-ever! This one looks and works just as well. The design fits your hand comfortably; light-weight.</li>
            <li> I normally shave in the shower, but after developing a blood clot and being on blood thinner for 6 months, I had to come up with something else.  This works well.  No pulling.  I have to run over an area two or three times, but I expected that.  It stays charged much longer than I expected it would.  Don&#x27;t expect a close shave.  You will feel very stubbly, but you look clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Works well until it stops working. After 6-8 months the thing will not take a charge.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping?? Item as described would recommend it</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. Very comfortable and easy to use. Well worth the $ to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> So far , so good !  3 years</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for the previous model from Panasonic. It performs exactly the same as my old razor (that took a nose dive from the shower shelf and broke) and I haven&#x27;t had any difficulties with it staying charged or the foils remaining sharp. It&#x27;s not the best for a close leg shave, but works great for bikini and other trimming. I thoroughly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no match for my bikini area. It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my husband&#x27;s Norelco. It pulls and nicks. I suppose it works well enough on my legs. It does work wet or dry, as it should.</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle five weeks ago. So I thought I would try and electric razor since I am very limited on my mobility as my broken ankle is nonweight bearing. This has been my best friend. I wish I had tried an electric razor before this. Very close shave and very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive razors in the past that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.  It cuts well, is quiet, and I really like its small charger.  Its predecessor had a large and bulky charger that wouldn&#x27;t fit onto my bathroom vanity.  I don&#x27;t hesitate giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my longer hair, and even has a popup trimmer for hard to shave areas.</li>
            <li> This items was great until it just stopped working 2 months after I purchased it.  I would not purchase this again because it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this razor.  It gives a very close shave for an electric and is even good for underarms.</li>
            <li> This is the second one that I bought for my wife... Its build quality is awesome... Works very well and really handy... The only problem is its battery life. I am not sure if the previous one was a bit faulty or what.. the battery went bad after around 15 months of use. But overall it is a good one. Very well worth for its price.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned, it is fast and works perfectly, I cannot live without it</li>
            <li> After years (and a huge expenditure of cash) of having my legs waxed, the downturn in the economy put such indulgences out of my budget. But by then, I&#x27;d been so spoiled by having my legs waxed and never having to tend to hair removal myself, that I got too lazy to use a razor once I couldn&#x27;t afford the waxing. And now, with water use restrictions in California, shaving in the shower is out of the question anyway. So this electric razor is an almost perfect solution. It doesn&#x27;t provide quite as close a shave as a manual razor, but then I didn&#x27;t expect it to, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied. It&#x27;s a breeze to use, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it pinching skin, as some other reviewers have reported. I&#x27;ve even used it on longer hair without first using the trimmer, and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling or pain at all, though I would recommend following the instructions, and first using the trimmer on longer hair before shaving it closer. I&#x27;ve now used it on both wet and dry skin, and it works equally well on both. It initially gives a pretty close shave, but you may have to use it more often than you would a manual razor. But it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use that I don&#x27;t find that a problem. Love the fact that you can rinse it clean as well as use the brush if you want to clean it while dry. Have only used it three times to far, and the battery seems to be holding power well. Bottom line: a pretty decent little shaver.</li>
            <li> SOOOOOO NEEDED THAT WAS TIRED OF USING MY VENUS SHAVER I RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE</li>
            <li> How many times are you going to ask people to review the items they order.  What I have used &amp; read got a better preview.  Some I have not read or no longer have got a worse review.  I figured if I did not go ahead &amp; rate them you would just ask me again.  I hope this will satisfy you so you will not ask again.  I have had a number of problems with the Kindle Fire.  It has been replaced twice already.  The last replacement seems to be working better even though I had to reset it by turning the power off twice yesterday alone.  Hopefully it will correct itself &amp; continue to work like it should.</li>
            <li> Awesome turn around. Payment issue alert and resolved in a timely manner which made the purchase flawless!</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way.</li>
            <li> Very nice shave. MUCH better than the Remington I had for years!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so much, I use it dry and has had it for 9 months and it still cuts good. I&#x27;m going to have to order another one because my boyfriend has began to use it to cut his facial hair in between barbershop visits, Ugh!</li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver, and it was so cheap. It does a great job shaving.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes but doesnt give a close shave at all. Back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a while now and its always worked perfect. Holds a charge and travels great.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is the second one I buy. My first one lasted 4 years and then finally died. I also didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old one was - getting a new one makes my legs as smooth as shaving it with a razor. I don&#x27;t recommend it for the bikini area as the hair on the bikini area are thicker than on the legs and armpits and dulls the blade faster.</li>
            <li> very pleased with item!</li>
            <li> For the price, this was an excellent buy......it works perfectly......I mean it glides smoothly on my skin while leaving my legs hairless.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Sent it back, thought it was something different. No problem with return.</li>
            <li> bought as a replacement for my daughter who stole my first one (was a replacement for another brand 6-8 years ago) when she went to college three years ago which then husband bought my second one, so this is the third one, tells you how long the first one lasted, Impressive- I wouldnt let her take it a second time - other reviews posted. lol</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters in middle school. They both started shaving and kept cutting their legs. I figured I would try a cheap wet dry razor. This one is awesome. Works so well and is perfect to prevent cuts. It can be used several times without charging and works best in the shower or tub. I imagine you have to use it more often for a really smooth leg but truly when you shave you have to shave the next day anyways. It is so fast and easy. I had one of those epi type razors before and had to return it. This is FAR better. So PAINLESS!!</li>
            <li> I love this rechargeable razor.  It gives a decent shave dry or wet.  Very pleased with the design.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this. use the buzzer to break down the stubble / hair, then use the &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; (part with holes)</li>
            <li> This is more like 4.5 stars.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and it still works great.  I don&#x27;t use it continuously, but it&#x27;s been frequent enough to know that it&#x27;s a good product with longevity.</li>
            <li> very close shave, great to keep legs pool ready</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Does good job.</li>
            <li> Good basic electric shaver. Probably not as good as a razor shave, but not an appropriate expectation. Only complaint I have is the charging base has no cord so you must charge it on the plug, as I store mine out of the bath this is obnoxious but workable.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Arrived on time. Provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Very close shave and gentle. I use it dry and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Ridiculously poor battery life, and it requires 12 hours to recharge.... Hope you weren&#x27;t planning to shave both legs in one day!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly the way it&#x27;s supposed to, whether dry or in the shower. Careful with the side trimmers though, it can knick you if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> It works for me. Not a skin-close shave, but it works for when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the time to use a razor and shaving cream. I&#x27;ve used it with both wet and dry skin... works the same! I only use it for my legs... so don&#x27;t ask me anything else. ;) Lol!</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive razor, it sure works.  It gives a very close shave, just as good as when I used a plain razor.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it 2 months, used it daily and it won&#x27;t power on today. It&#x27;s fully charged. My only choice is to ship it back to the Panasonic service center for repair or replacement. Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> after a few uses, it&#x27;s dull and takes a LOT of effort to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realise it was marketed for Ladies, but it works great on MY beard in the shower or anywhere else, like the camp site...</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, use and does a fine shaving job.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, cuts, scratches. I use this before I shower, and it&#x27;s great for everything. I just leave it plugged in when I am not using it. usage time seems to be about an hour.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my legs and NO irritation!</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor. I am in a hurry most of the time and use it dry and it does a good job. Doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of bumps either. I also like that the charger plugs into the outlet and the razor sits on tip to charge so no cord to worry about.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal. The blades are nice and sharp. Excellent charging capabilities. Very goog deal.</li>
            <li> Because of a review by a male customer that said this shaver was one his wife really liked, is why I bought this shaver. At that time I was trying to decide on a more expensive razor for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lady who is over 60 years old and when women start to age their tissue in the face some times start to produce testosterone (or so my doctor tells me) and when this happens you grow hair on your face--especially around the chin area. This is very embarrassing for women. So this is what I needed this shaver for. Before I bought this shaver I use to have to shave my chin area at least once a week to prevent having a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow. When I first got this shaver I thought I was really going to like it because it seemed to shave my chin a lot faster than my old shaver. But alas it must not be shaving as close as my old shaver (14 years old) because now I find I am having to shave at least every other day. And because I am having to shave more often my chin is left feeling sore. I would not buy this shaver again for what I needed it for. I will probably go back to looking at those expensive shavers. It does shaves my legs OK, no problem there, and that is why I gave it 3 stars--it just does not work for my chin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and now that i live up north in the winter my skin was so thin that I could not shave regularly. This really is great for both in shower and out of shower (i primarily use it out of the shower). I love that its rechargeable and in my experience I do not have to charge it between uses every time.</li>
            <li> Smooth, works well. Definitely worth the price. I replaced a more expensive shaver when it died, and like this better!</li>
            <li> I have bought this shaver twice now. The first one lasted a year. The second one only made it six months. These were bought to replace an electric shaver that worked for about 35 years before I dropped and broke it. They don&#x27;t make them like that anymore.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s intimate groomer.  What can I say, she loves it having clippers and shaver in one - and wither wet or dry (mostly used in the shower).  If she is happy then I am happy!  A very good buy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sensitive skin. Typical razors cause ingrown hairs or painful skin. Though I knew the shave wouldn&#x27;t be as close, I needed it. I do think it pulls more than other electric razors, and misses a lot. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a shaver I can use without having to whip out the shaving cream and razor whenever I wanted to wear something that may show a little leg. Considering that my hair grows relatively fast, shaving gets really old, really fast. I mulled over which electric razor I should get and decided on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first (and only) electric razor I had before this was this little purple Remmington that used batteries that I purchased from Dollar General. It didn&#x27;t work too bad, but I was always worried about the batteries. I finally got fed up and bought this one here. I plugged it in and let it charge overnight because I wanted to make sure that it was fully powered. The first time I used it, my technique wasn&#x27;t the best (pulled some hair, missed some hair, etc.) That may have been because I prefer to shave dry with electric razors... But I WILL say that the shave is really close considering its not razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep it short, it&#x27;s nice for a quick shave to wear shorts or a skirt, but if you&#x27;re expecting someone to rub on your silky smooth legs try a regular razor. (Schick Hydro Silk is my preference)</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase.  I use it every day! I use it for my facial hair.  I have really course hair on my chin and it literally becomes a beard if I don&#x27;t remove the hair.  I have a &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; to prove it.  That came from using a trimmer on my face for many years.  But I had no choice as the hair removing creams just don&#x27;t work for me.  Upon my first use with this product I saw the difference in how close it shaved my chin.  I use the foil blade first and then I use the pop up trimmer to shave it even closer.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve tried. Keeps a charge for a long time, and cuts about as close as you can get from electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I crashed my bike and broke my hand and of course have lots of road rash and bruising as well. These injuries have made it difficult to do lots of things I normally do including shaving my legs with a razor. I usually shave every day or at least every other day. Recovering from an injury like this is difficult and very humbling.  Small things like not being able to take care of basic hygiene issues are a little demoralizing. Finding this razor really lifted my spirits as I can now shave my legs, and with a little help, my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does a very good job on my legs. I shave them dry before my shower. The armpit shaving seems to work best in the shower. My legs feel very smooth after shaving and the armpits are pretty good as well. It fits nicely in the hand and as long as you shave in segments going one direction up the leg you can get a fairly close shave. The price point is unbelievable and I am grateful I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean and very attractive. Two things I would change to make this a five star rating:&lt;br /&gt;1. Have an indicator that tells you when it is charged, or at least just have the light go out.&lt;br /&gt;2. Add a cord for charging, as it is too tall to charge in my bathroom, as the outlets are located under the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even pay more to have these changes, as this is an unbelievably good product for the price. thank you Panasonic for helping me feel better.[[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade \\&quot;Close Curves\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, always wear a helmet when riding a bicycle! Had I not been wearing mine, my injuries would have been much more severe.</li>
            <li> It does not do well to shave hairs on the face.  It is too large ---- unless one has a very large face.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.  It does a really good job without pushing very hard.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor. Use it in the shower, and I love it. Holds a great charge. It is a great little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because she was sick if disposables and this one said it gives a close shave...well, it doesn&#x27;t! Stick with the disposables over this one!</li>
            <li> Bought so many electric shavers and have been disappointed.  This is a great bargain and it works better than any I have owned.  Wet or dry - excellent.  Charges quickly and holds a charge.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This little razor does a great job.  Good investment.  I would recommend this to anyone who does not want to put a  lot of money into a product, but wants a good working tool.</li>
            <li> Cuts close - works very well wet, and/or dry - easy to clean - Charges quickly and is easy to store.  I&#x27;ve used this shaver for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.  Works well and at a good price.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I have had one for a year or two now, I use it for quick touch ups or when I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower with a razor and cream. I have not had any problems, no nicks or cuts, battery lasts a long time. I like that the shaver sits on the charger that plugs into the wall- out of the way. I had to buy one for my son, who is fairly new to shaving, he kept borrowing mine because he didn&#x27;t like shaving with a razor and the men&#x27;s shaver I bought for him (which was not cheap at all) kept cutting him. Now he has his own, he&#x27;s always clean shaven without nicks and/or cuts!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well in dry mode.</li>
            <li> This razor was awful, it kept nicking my skin, and it hurt beyond belief! It did not shave any of my hair off, and I got more scratches than anything! DO NOT BUY. Thank goodness amazon has an awesome return policy. They refunded my money super fast. Make sure that you save the box when this comes so that you can ship it right back to the seller if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic Ladies shaver for a while now and I feel that it works very well. I get a good close shave on my legs and it does not irritate my skin. It keeps a charge well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this particular product because my old shaver was the same brand.  It lasted for years and I&#x27;m sure this shaver will perform as well.  Very smooth use and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor about 8mo ago and it worked fine but now it stopped working. I did not drop it or anything like that just woke up one morning and the razor didnt work. It still charges because the red light goes on when I plug it in but doesnt work...I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the very best shaver I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the design fits my hand great. Nice shave for my delicate skin. Like the fact I can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This is my shaver. There are many like it but this one is MINE! Movie quotes aside, you will not regret buying this! Fin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I have had a hard time finding a way to shave my underarms without irritation.  I decided to give this product a try.  I love it!  It works excellently.  Easy to use.  No pinching or pulling.  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in the charger after every time I used it.  I do find that I have to position it just right for the light to come on, indicating that it is charging. I think the reviews that talk about it just dying probably have to do it with it not charging properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this and especially for the low cost compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It works well.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, very close for an electric.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous product. worked for a few weeks and died.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I was using the original one and thought I should get a backup for when it eventually dies and they stop making it...  the next day my order was placed I dropped the original one on the floor and it&#x27;s been acting quirky ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really glad I got this backup!</li>
            <li> Dirty item. Would not recommend buying, esp. from Amazon. All the reviews said the item was good, but how will I ever know. The shaver I received was dirty and covered in little black hairs... gross!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year now. The battery life is really long. Great quality. Works great. Need to buy another in case this one ever breaks!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it sits on the charger which plugs directly into the wall versus having a cord. Some may find this more convenient, but in my household as we only have one outlet in the bathroom and many devices to use with that outlet it&#x27;s a bit of an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, however, works as it&#x27;s supposed to so I have no complaint there.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, gives a fairly close shave</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking this razor...wasn&#x27;t sure at first and after reading all the reviews.  I use it on bikini area mostly, but did try on my underarms and it worked great there, too.  I had no problem with it tearing up skin on underarms at all.  I do think as with any razor, you have to be careful in the bikini area, but when the razor is flat against the skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem and gets a much closer shave than I ever did with my other razor.  I always use this in the shower, so definitely glad it is usable in wet conditions.  This razor does have the pop up feature, but it did seem like it has a tendency to pull the hairs, so I generally don&#x27;t use the pop-up feature.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  My razor gave out - won&#x27;t charge, doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer than 2 years.  Maybe that&#x27;s how most products are nowadays (I feel so old saying that).  Sad!</li>
            <li> I used this shaver several times and have had no issues.  It did a close shave but, of course, you have to realize nothing shaves as close as a razor.  With this being said, I would suggest this shaver if you prefer an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; pretty close.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic Ladies razor I have used over many years. I&#x27;ve always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> The best one on the market!</li>
            <li> Wow. This is awesome. Didn&#x27;t think it would be so good for the price but it&#x27;s awesome. Charges quick and it hold a long time. Does a great job - I only use it when dry, not on wet skin. Definitely helps since I have sensitive skin and I cannot always use an actual razor.</li>
            <li> Received and everything is great</li>
            <li> A close shave with out a blade, safer for the young and older lady.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect; I love it! :)</li>
            <li> Yes!! I&#x27;m so happy!! I am prone, PRONE to ingrown hairs so I hate shaving because I have to wait so long to get out of the painful bump stage. I just got this in the mail and it was charged (idk how much it was charged) but today I have to go to class and I&#x27;m not about to find pants and guess who hasn&#x27;t shaved? Me. So I got this thing out of the box and it worked surprisingly well. The results are like you just shaved in the morning and you&#x27;re starting to get prickly in the evening. I was expects like beard prickles but it&#x27;s not!! Like I&#x27;m gunna use this all of the time. The only time I&#x27;m ever going to have to SHAVE is when I&#x27;m going somewhere fancy fance or something. I&#x27;m pleased. Like if you&#x27;re not sure which shave thing to get. This one is a good choice. It&#x27;s not too small and it&#x27;s not huge. It&#x27;s like a perfect size. YAS</li>
            <li> This will NOT give you that smooth as a razor shave so I do not suggest this for legs unless you do not plan on having them touched or seen.  If you are like me and cannot stand the feel of stubble at all on your legs when you sleep, then turn to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for younger girls that are getting into the act of shaving without having to worry about accidentally getting cut.  This works great on arms to get rid of that excess hair.  Works great on faces, as well.  I use this on my upper legs where the hair is not so thick and it works great there, too.  Works great wet and dry, as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits easily in my hands though I think some sort of gripping material would be better on the sides as it can get slippery.  The plastic cap to protect the foil does not allow for the drainage of water so be sure to let it dry thoroughly before putting the cap on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she loves it.  She says it does a great job and is completely waterproof and holds a charge well.  It is easy to clean and even though she has dropped it a couple of times, it still has no signs of wear or malfunction.  It does shave the hair close, invisible to the eye, but it, like most electric razors, do not get razor close.</li>
            <li> Neat and compact. Works well and the battery holds a charge. Does a nice close shave on your legs. The service was fast and the price fair.</li>
            <li> It glides on your legs smoothly.  i recommend  this product for women who like a smooth, close shave and don&#x27;t like getting cut by their shavers. :3</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Would have preferred a cord leading to the charger from the shaver, rather than having the entire unit perched on top of it on the wall as it charged (and therefore unusable until it was charged).</li>
            <li> This does a good job to *closely trim* without leaving razor burn .... This is my third purchase of this. I bought 2 last year (when shaving the battery sometimes dies so I wanted to have a back up to avoid a half shaven pair of legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- battery dies quickly as time goes on, leaves stubble, lasts about 6mos- 1 year (pushing it). The blades become so dull that you feel like nothing is happening after about 10 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is much more cost effective than buying disposable raZors on a constant basis. For about $20 this lasts 6 months working properly but be prepared to use another electric razor after you&#x27;re done if you want *smooth* legs. I use a men&#x27;s face razor to quickly go over my legs and get the stubble after I&#x27;m done using this product. It&#x27;s a strange routine but I do it to avoid razor burn and achieve smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Just love it.  Works very well for an electric shaver.  Easy to use and ergonomically friendly.  Cleaning isn&#x27;t easy, bit overall I still am really happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this shaver. It worked well for me to get all the stubble after my initial shave with a regular razor. Left me feeling baby soft. However, after a little over a month it has randomly broken. It will not turn on. I do not know why. It has been more than a month, and I am ineligible for a return. What a shame.</li>
            <li> For any woman who wants to make the chore of shaving more pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close on legs, under arms, even around bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;And does so without scraping or chafing. Also, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have never used wet but like the fact that I could.</li>
            <li> This product works like wonders!!!! The first time I tried it the shaver tickled. When I use the shaver, every few minutes I have to stop and clean it, personally I don&#x27;t mind, ( You only have to clean it out every few minutes on first uses, or you have to do that after you have&#x27;t shaved in a few days.) This is great for young and elderly ladies. Also you have to be careful about pressing to hard, what I mean by that is, if you are shaving short hair ( hair on your legs,) YOU SHOULD NOT have the thing on the front up, that is for bikini hair! Before use CHARGE for 2-3 hours!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love everything about this item.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I have found it to shave the closest of all the electric shavers. Also like that it has a separate razor for longer hairs. It also came to me VERY fast and in perfect condition. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother.  She has arthritis and she did not feel comfortable using a razor for her underarms.&lt;br /&gt;The design helps because it is easy to hold and reach the areas of her arm.&lt;br /&gt;She had no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive Remington razors and this one by far is the best I have owned and it was only 1/3 of the price of what I paid for the Remington. It is a smooth shave and it is easy to clean. I love the charger is compact and has no cords!! Easy to travel with too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how close this thing shaves! I think it is better than my disposable razor. It is comfortable-doesn&#x27;t pull or cut me either. Woudl highly recommend to anyone and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it ... works great.... Im very delighted with it</li>
            <li> I am a very optimistic person&amp;#62; This piece is 100% WORTHLESS and takes three times as long to shave with results leaving nothing desirable. I bought this hoping to cut time shaving on the go &amp; was appalled that i spent so much time in the shower with results as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all :( I had no choice but to use my Gillette Venus Breeze (which I now love even more lol) and reshave!&lt;br /&gt;Later in the week I decided to give the Panasonic another try with a dry shave, thinking this might come in handy with travel or camping... Again, a huge waste of time! My boyfriend even tried to help me use the devise and we both laughed as he referred my results similar too that of a porcupine.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very loud and embarrassing considering how long it takes going over the same area repetitively.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product like I did!</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good razor for the bikini area. The pop up trimmer is not designed well for this and it is both incredibly painful and ineffective at the same time. Bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I get for myself and I was a little nervous about it but it was easy to use and the shaving was smooth.</li>
            <li> nice and easy to shave in no time.</li>
            <li> really close shaves for a electric shaver, easy to use and charge.  fits the hand very well and gets hard to cut area well</li>
            <li> I was leery about trying an electric shaver.  However, I needed something I could shave quickly with when I didn&#x27;t have enough time to use a razor.  I&#x27;ve used this shaver multiple times now, both wet and dry, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  Shaves close (not as close as a razor, yet that is to be expected) and the wide head makes for a fast shave.  For me, it seems to glide best when used dry and no bumps or irritation to speak of!  Easy to clean and the charger is a single unit plug in (no cord) which allows me to utilize a kind of an out of the way plug when recharging.  Great buy for the money too!</li>
            <li> Works good. Use all the time.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job for a very good price!</li>
            <li> This shaver does a very good job.  It saves me money because I do not ever have to buy razors.  The package is convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anybody looking for a good shaver in the shower, it was a great buy and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This  Shaver is the Best on the Market. I have had others But I am telling you this is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, so much better than my old one.  It gives a pretty close shave and I really love how light it is.  Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Have only used it a few times, since I have had it less than a month. It works great dry.  I have not tried to use it wet and don&#x27;t know that I will, as it works so well dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a straight razor for many years and wanted to try the electric, again.  I am glad I did. It works quickly. Some people complained that you had to go over an area more than once.  I believe that is how these razors work.  With a back and forth motion.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem recommending this item.  The price was right, too.</li>
            <li> I have COPD and sit on a bench in the shower to shave my legs, which is not easy!  So I got this wet/dry shaver to see if I could dry shave before getting in the shower . . . and, I can!  I sit on the toilet and shave my legs and then get in the shower.  So much easier.  Great shave too!  I got so excited the first time, I shaved my legs and under my arms, and then shaved my arms!  Good thing I got tired . . . there&#x27;s no telling what I would have shaved next!  Ha!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind saying, I try to get the best deal possible and I think this was the best deal I could find for the money. I&#x27;ll use this seller again... as long as they have the best deal.</li>
            <li> my wife needed a shaver because of a blood condition,  it is light weight and easy to handle, it also holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I hate having to buy disposables, this works great.  I would prefer a corded shaver, but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is pulls some when shaving underarms but if you want a good close shave guess you got to deal with that part. Good quality. Bought 2 more for teenage daughters because they kept taking mine.</li>
            <li> This razor does not cut any hair at all, it is pure junk! Buy a remington razor instead.Save your money please!</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price. I would buy again and I will recommend to friends/family. Delivery ahead of promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally satisfied, I&#x27;d give it a 10 of 10.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving.  HATE IT!  In the winter especially.  But since it is winter, I say who cares about a skin close shave?  Even if I do use a razor, I get the goose bumps the second I step out of the shower, and hello stubble!  So I thought what the hey.  And I LOVE it.  No it&#x27;s not razor close, but I&#x27;m not getting razor burn, nicks, or dealing with insta-stub when I get out.  I may razor shave throughout the summer for that smooth shiny look and feel (even if brief), but in the winter this is the BOMB!  Plus, it&#x27;s AWESOME having something I can grab and do a quick dry shave minutes b4 having to be somewhere.  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I decided to wait a few days after using the product before posting a review, because with previous items I have brought, for the purpose of shaving, have caused irritation a while after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that this has caused no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only tried it dry and it was easy to use and comfortable (both on removing hair and being held). There were a few moments of skin nicking (no bleeding occurred and a mark could not be seen) but I put that down to moving the razor to fast over the area. As with previous comments and reviews I have read I would recommend not moving the razor to quickly to avoid your skin catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave a close shave and even with my naturally dark hair (dark brown to black) it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is also good, I managed to do both legs up to my bikini line and both arms without running out of power. I however would not recommend using for your armpits. I tried it and it did not work well. Too much skin nicking and it was uncomfortable to use there due to the angle as I was unable to see where I was going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very good product in my opinion, and even though I ordered this from America and had it shipped overseas (to England) it arrived amazingly quickly. It took less than 7 days from ordering to arrival, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li> Returned the product.</li>
            <li> not a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Doesn&#x27;t work the way I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I had a razor; it broke (simply stopped working).  I replaced it but that one didn&#x27;t shave at all; not sure what kind of hair it thought it was useful for but it certainly wasn&#x27;t mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is great.  easy to use, works great on even coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;The charger doesn&#x27;t have a cord and plugs directly into the outlet.  While this does save space, it makes the 2nd outlet useless (whether you plug it into the top or bottom outlet, it partly blocks the other one).</li>
            <li> Regular (supermarket) razors started leaving my skin ragged and inflamed. I found electric razors did not cause the same problems but this was the first that has been consistently reliable. I also love that I can replace the heads and don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor just because a part has worn out.</li>
            <li> This worked great until it didn&#x27;t. It costs too much to crap out so quickly. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had and the first was about 20 years ago..my things have changed.  I love this razor as I&#x27;m physically unable to bend over for any length of time.  While this may not shave as close as a regular razor, in my opinion, it&#x27;s certainly close enough!  Easy to use and keep clean with the brush that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;So helpful for a disabled senior!</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. No razor burn!!</li>
            <li> I have owned a wet/dry electric shaver for yrs. This is actually my 3rd one, the original Brand I have bought in the past is no longer available &amp; it cost a lot more! I was a skeptic, largely due to the cheap price, but gave it a shot anyway! Glad I did, it works just as awesome as the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past for a fraction of the price. Mind you, this one may not last as long, but unless it dies in a year I am very impressed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never used a wet/dry electric razor; It&#x27;s not a good idea to try to shave growth that is longer. So to have the best experience you may need to hand razor the 1st time around before you try. If you do it dry, make sure you are really really dry...not when you get out of shower dry. If you do it wet, make dang sure you use soap or shaving cream, not just water. If you do these things you will have a convenient little gadget you can use on the fly without big productions! Obviously the wet method will shave closer, but most of the time the dry works just fine!!</li>
            <li> I am on blood thinners and cannot risk using a blade to shave. This is the perfect solution for me and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! Smooth, close, comfortable. I&#x27;ve been using it dry.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, this is my second one and I gave it to my granddaughter.  The price was too good to be true!  I only use it as a dry shaver and use it just before going out.</li>
            <li> I dig it! Wish I would have bought one of these sooner. I have super sensitive skin on my legs, so shaving every day just isnt an option...even when I use shaving creams, expensive razors, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a star because it doesnt work well for underarms...it actually hurts and/or just doesnt get all the hair. But for a quick shave of the legs, this is a magical lil thing and I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Only used it once, but it gave me a close shave on my legs.  I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close a shave as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razor.  It was well made, great price, and would have kept it if it was a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver,  nice close shave on my legs.  I don&#x27;t use it wet, though, but that&#x27;s just me.  I would buy another one if needed.</li>
            <li> Love love love love!  I was going to spend hundreds on a new razor because mine was kaput.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t!  I get a fast, close shave.  I do get facial hair, so I am shaving lots of different body parts, including occasional landscaping!  I almost always use it dry while I catch the news in the morning.  I frequently forget to throw it on the charger, but it doesn&#x27;t hesitate to work just as well the next day.  I have never gone 3 days, but I&#x27;m sure it would do at least a quick shave.  It sits on the charger, which is somewhat annoying,  I would prefer a cord so that I could put the razor in a drawer out of site while it charges, rather than hanging from the wall!  But that is the only thing I would change about this super cheap option, anything else would raise the price, I&#x27;m sure.  So, if this lasts a year, I&#x27;ll be ecstatic!  I&#x27;ll be ahead of the game if it lasts 6 months, but it shows no signs of slowing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 joyous weeks-no scratchy stubble if I take an extra minute or two, zero ouches or burns, and it gets my bumpy underarms completely!</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job with a full charge and a very good job on not a full charge.  I&#x27;m happy w/ this product and better than they used to make them.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am really impressed with this razor.  First a little background.  I have been using disposable razors for several years now only because my previous electric razor died and at the time I was unable to find a suitable replacement.  It always seemed to me that the focus was on men&#x27;s razors and the ladies were left with few good options.  I didn&#x27;t mind spending the money on a razor, but could not really find what I wanted.  I finally broke down and began to look at electric razors again since I was cutting my legs up terribly no matter how careful I was trying to be and no matter what type of disposable or cream/gel I was using.  I again did not see that much in the ladies&#x27; market (as compared to the options available for men and aside from the new crop of epilators that I was not ready to try).  Then I came across this razor and saw that there were several models ranging in price from this $16 and change up to $60ish or so.  I was contemplating which model to get but then decided to give the least expensive one a try since it had gotten so many good reviews.  I have been using this razor for several months now and I am surprisingly more than satisfied.  For the good points, it appears well made, is easy to hold, and does a very good job with no nicks or cuts!  I can&#x27;t say it is exactly as close as a blade shave, but if you keep up with regular shaving, it is certainly very, very good and better than being cut up.  The bikini area trimmer that pops up also works very well.  It was compact enough to take on vacation with the little charger.  Although this is a wet/dry shaver, I have only used it dry so that it is what I am reviewing.  The only negative is that it is recommend to charge for 12 hours.  I really would like to have a much shorter charging time, but it does hold a charge through quite a number of shaves and I try to be mindful about charging it so that I have it ready when I need it.  It would be great if it also came with a base type charger and a better case for travel (comes with a very thin drawstring bag and small cleaning brush), but for 16 bucks, it is well worth the price.  I waited several months to do my review and so far so good!</li>
            <li> good if you have irritation with the razor, for me does not last suffiencient enough for my both legs, wish it could last longer or have the corded option. I have a silkepil braun but the razor attachment sucks</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Gives a close shave, and can be used on longer hair too. Other shavers won&#x27;t work on longer hair and must be used only on short stubble. I don&#x27;t shave as often as I should in winter so my hair gets longer. This beauty takes care of the hair with no problems. Highly recommend this shaver. It holds a charge for a long time too. No need to keep it plugged in 24/7.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of the reviews, but it hasn&#x27;t worked too great for me :/  Maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old razor that broke )-:  It was the third one I tried!!  Finally found one as good as my old one..&lt;br /&gt;It really works well, gives a close shave and the battery stays charged for a full shave (-:</li>
            <li> Dose  the job well for me; easy to use; stays charged for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  I have only used it dry, on my underarms and have gotten a little bit of razer burn, so next time, I think I will try it wet.</li>
            <li> This is a decent wet/dry shaver, although sometimes I feel like you get what you pay for. The reason why I give it only four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t do the job 100%. I still feel like there are small portions of hair where you get the scratchy. The shaver does not do a close shave like a razor would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I avoid the general nicks that I would get with a razor.</li>
            <li> These we/dry shavers are perfect for any area of the body. I had to buy 2 since I didn&#x27;t want to share. My daughter is just beginning to shave and I feel more comfortable with her using an electric than a blade. Charger is convenient and the razor holds a charge for a complete leg shave.</li>
            <li> I would get my money back and I will NEVER buy this product again! I was so disappointed. It didn&#x27;t shave smooth like it advertised, I had &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my legs and the blade seems dull. What ever happened to the Moi Razor?? That razor rocked but when it came time to replace the foil head I couldn&#x27;t find any!! I think I will be throwing this away and looking for something that does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li> Great razor, dry or wet it works.</li>
            <li> It shaves hair but not long or thick and it still leaves stubble. This isnt good for long lasting hair free skin its like a regular razor</li>
            <li> This little razor can get the worst of the hair off, but if you have fast-growing hair (like me), you&#x27;ll be stubbly again by the end of the day. That being said, it does a good enough job that I&#x27;m not afraid of going sleeveless. It gets me smooth enough for everyday, just not smooth enough for date night. If somebody&#x27;s going to be super-close (or touching) you&#x27;ll want something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pop-up trimmer to keep downstairs neat and tidy, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to make sure this is fully charged before attempting it. The trimmer does cut things pretty close -- closer than I would have chosen, but it keeps the hair long enough that ingrowns aren&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> The box says wet or dry, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job on my wet hair. It worked OK on my dry hair, but it got very hot on my skin and was not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> really nice, just what I wanted I am going to have knee surgery, so this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for her first razor she likes it and it is very simple to use&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for a young lady beginning to shave</li>
            <li> This razor is great. Shaves real well and close. Thanks Panasonic I love it. Finally got a razor that shaves close and you don&#x27;t have to go over the area several times.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver. My wife has one of these and I decided to try it. It did such a great job that I decided to purchase one. I am a black man with moderately course hair. I use the shaver to shave my facial hair and my head. Overall, this is a great product as it produces a close shave. It has excellent battery life and is easy to clean. The shaver has a great construction and comes with a brush and a carrying bag. Also, the price is great. As a side note, the replacement blade has an equivalent cost to the shaver. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If wife happy so am I</li>
            <li> This little razor holds a charge for a long time and it gets a suprisingly close shave! I only use it in the dry setting on my leggs and it works great!</li>
            <li> Originally, I really liked this shaver. It&#x27;s shaved well, was light weight and pops open for easy cleaning. However, I&#x27;ve become quite frustrated with the very short charge life. Even with a full charge I&#x27;ve often run out of power with only one leg shaved. (Doh! That does&#x27;nt look so great at the beach!) This would be a much better product if it had an optional electric cord so it didn&#x27;t run out of power half way through a shave (presently it is only powered by wall charge and a full re-charge can take up to 8 hours).</li>
            <li> I had great luck with this little razor.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost two months now, and had no loss of power or dulling of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is no long cord to the charger.  It just plugs into the wall, and the razor just sits right on top of the charger.  Very economical use of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews that mentioned tugging and ripping hair out, so I was nervous, but I have had NONE of that.  I read and followed the instructions, which were short and to the point.  Whether that made a difference, I don&#x27;t know, but the results were as expected and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well, but cuts pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems using this razor for underarms, legs, or bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor met and exceeded my expectations, and I would (and have) definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> What a powerful unit and a clean shave.  Only problem is there is not a base with a cord.  It must be placed into an outlet so if you have a limited amount of these in your house it may present a problem.  It does hold a charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver, I loved it.  I used it maybe four times over a three month period because I was out of town and forgot to take it.  When I tried to charge it this first time on the little charger that came with it.....no charge.  I left it on the charger for three days thinking I had just not charged it long enough....nothing.  The thirty day guarantee is up and to return it I have to pay shipping charges which does not compute to any monetary gain for me.  The replacement charger costs more than the shaver cost and also not sure that is the problem.....so in short, I am stuck with the thing and it won&#x27;t charge.  Would have been a great shaver if it had worked longer than a month!!</li>
            <li> the best 20$ spent!! battery lasts long, really shaves and softly, not like others pulling the hair.Nice pouch. Only thing, but not worth taking stars away, is that the plug  in my case, only fits to the side, not up like the display. have to rest it on top of something just in case. but so far not complaining!!</li>
            <li> Works great, love that it&#x27;s rechargeable.  I am able to shave close with this which is great but also have gotten a few ingrown hairs because it does shave so close and my skin is incredibly sensitive ( hence why I use this)</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic ES2207P - the first one lasted a few years until the battery stopped charging.  I liked it so much that I replaced it with the exact same model.  The second one lasted about nine months.  The third one didn&#x27;t even make it three months.  Skip this product - it&#x27;s not worth the hassle!</li>
            <li> Not the best razor out there, but great for the cost. I keep it constantly plugged in for instant access.</li>
            <li> No more throwaway razors, no more nicks and cuts.  Right price, too.  No big hassle to shave the legs anymore!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> As always, Panasonic is the best brand in shaving. Comfort handle shape in design, long battery holding charge and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> Close shave. Haven&#x27;t used the wet yet.  And have only has it for a month. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I know the recharging method is not the most important aspect of the razor but there is no stand, no cord just stick the charger on the razor and plug it into the wall.  The razor works great.  I usually shave my legs before taking my shower and go over them again when I&#x27;m dry.  Good product.</li>
            <li> i HAD ONE JUST LIKE THIS- BUT THE BATTERY WENT DEAD, SO THIS WAS WONDERFUL TO BUY THIS AND GET A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> This shaver, which has one cutter, (dissappointed,) shaves slightly above average.  I give it a 7.5 out of 10 for closeness.  I use it on my skull. :) .  It will last, however, because of the thicker foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO MAKE A BATTERY LAST:  To avoid getting a bad case of battery memory, (look it up,) run the shaver down, and then charge it for 18 or more hrs.  The directions say 12. I only got about 4 shave from a 12 hr. charge. I get about 7 from a long long charge.  The ddirections do say to secure the shaver to the stand after use; but what they mean, but don&#x27;t say, is when the charger is unplugged.  Recharging too much, or when there is a lot of charge left, will lower battery longevity seriously, (especially with nickel batteries.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get this shipped to north of the 49th parallel, (Canada,) but the shipping cost &#x3D; owwww!!! A customs fee charged is not necessary for an item of this price.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE SHAVER.  CHARGES VERY EASILY.  EASY TO USE.  NATURALLY IT DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A REGULAR RAZOR...BUT FASTER.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and she especially like the cube charger since there&#x27;s no cord.  The long hair trimmer is also handy.</li>
            <li> Good prodict for the price.</li>
            <li> A bit bulky but does a good job.</li>
            <li> I picked up this shaver 3 years ago. I don&#x27;t use it every day but several times a week anyway. I leave it on the charger 24/7 except when I&#x27;m using it, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the battery holding a charge. I always use it dry to shave my legs either before I take a shower or when I change into shorts but didn&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower. It works great, as well as any electric shaver I have tried. It&#x27;s never pulled my hair or given me razor burn. Recently I realized that it seemed to be functioning properly but wasn&#x27;t cutting hair any more. I ordered a replacement blade [[ASIN:B00007E833 PANASONIC WES9752P replacement inner blade]] and it&#x27;s good as new!</li>
            <li> Impressed by this shaver!  It give a very close shave for an electric razor, definitely does the trick for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very easy to use. I had a different brand bbutt it quit. This one works better than the old one.</li>
            <li> The only shaving tool I use. Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The shave was not as close as I hoped</li>
            <li> I love shopping with Amazon.  But not this time. The product arrived in a beat up box.  There is a restocking fee.  I don&#x27;t like it, its not good quality and I suspect it may have been a returned product, but the unpleasant literature in the box about returns really turned me off, as did the restocking fee.  I&#x27;m not sure if I went to the effort to return it that I would actually get money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would suggest that you select your partners carefully -- they are a reflection on the Amazon brand.  I will hesitate to buy products other than books and music from you going forward.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine.  I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot as yet.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used....it&#x27;s  well balanced; comfortable in my hand; it&#x27;s quiet and gives a smooth shave....doesn&#x27;t tug the skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife. It ran well for about a month then would not turn on. I filled out a return and shipped it to the Panasonic returns department for a replacement. I decided I&#x27;d call customer service to make sure we&#x27;d receive another. The representative said they were out at the warehouse and after receiving a new shipment in 2 weeks they would ship us a replacement. Never got it. The wife decided instead of waiting for it not to show up she would just buy another one instead of waiting a while to shave. This one worked for about 2 months then again, stopped working. I do not recommend this product unless you&#x27;ve leveled up your Luck+ stats. I&#x27;ve heard Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have great customer service when it comes to warranties, and for me this proves it.</li>
            <li> This razor came to replace my prior Panasonic.  I do like it a lot and it holds a charge for quite q while.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It does well trimming, but probably not the best item to use to shave your underarms or legs. Doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin and not a smooth finish like using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> for a first time shave it is alright and you can&#x27;t beat the price-- package arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love the charger, no cord, plugs right into wall.  Very compact to store.  Feels very comfortable when holding it.</li>
            <li> Works even better than I expected.  Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor. Ino longer have to fight with my daughter to shave</li>
            <li> very handy. not the closest shave, but great for mornings when I&#x27;m pressed fur time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Just used it dry for the first time (after a 12 hour charge) and it is very smooth and painless due mainly to the curved head. No pinched skin or nicks. You can&#x27;t tell you are shaving until you see the results. I rinsed out the removeable head and left it off to dry before reattaching it. It comes with a little cleaning brush too. It is light years ahead of razor blade shaving, but I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the close shave this gave, for such an inexpensive shaver. I own a Remington that I have had to replace the blades twice already. I bought this because it was less expensive than just the replacement blades for my Remington. I may stick with this from now on.</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivery faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Nice and cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they had no use for it but other family members own and are pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver .gettinf another one!!!and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter it pull and pinches.</li>
            <li> Did not shave as close as my cousin thought it should. Will try it wet next time.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> I used electric in the past, but back then no matter how much money I threw at it, I always had issues with stubble and hair catching (I have very thick and coarse stands which can be hell on any kind of blade... And sensitive skin, which just makes it worse). I decided to go back to electric during my last pregnancy so I wouldn&#x27;t have to be hairy in the final stages, and at first I was using cheapo $10 electrics because honestly I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between them and the note expensive ones I used in the past, plus at $10 a pop I could just toss them when the blades wore out. But recently I couldn&#x27;t find those so I ebbed up getting this since it was the next cheapest. WOW. This is hands down the best electric I&#x27;ve used to date. It really works well on my hair and skin type. The shave is close to manual razor quality, and it glides like butter even when I use it on my armpits, dry. I&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave. Even the trimmer, which normally hurts more than the blades on other electrics if you&#x27;re not careful enough with it, doesn&#x27;t pinch, pull, or even scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got sturdy construction and a nice contoured, heavy feel in hand. The foil and blade seem to be top notch and not likely to go dull quickly. I anticipate it may get slippery in the shower due to lack of rubberized grip and mostly flat switches, but I don&#x27;t use these in the shower anyway. The clear protective cap fits snugly and doesn&#x27;t wiggle or come off on its own. One charge lasts several shaves before losing full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small brush, protective cap for the head, charger, and a small travel pouch, which it and all the accessories fit into easily and nicely. The pouch is also handy for hanging it to dry after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  It is smooth and glides over my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cut or scrape like my last razor of another brand.</li>
            <li> Great little razor! I sit on the edge of the tub &amp; shave my legs before getting in the shower. This razor does a great job &amp; I can go 3 days til I shave again.</li>
            <li> works great! I use it dry for a close cut. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet. its lightweight a bother to clean. but over all great</li>
            <li> This shaver was priced so much less than the others and I was a bit nervous about the quality/function. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it. It gives you a close, smooth shave with no pulling or discomfort. I would recommend this Panasonic to anyone who prefers not to used a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like it to, but I never get razor burn or cuts!</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t get a really close shave but it is so much easier on your skin than a straight razor.  I can get pretty close and no nicks or cuts and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry and irritated.  Great for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 6 weeks ago (at a retail store, not Amazon) and it already doesn&#x27;t work. Like one of the other posters, I thought it just needed to be charged. After charging for several hours on multiple occasions, it won&#x27;t turn on at all. Completely dead. Although it was not expensive, still a waste of money. I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this thing. It is HUGE. The size does not exactly make it easy to shave your bikini area. Hair gets caught in the shaver and is impossible to rinse without taking apart the entire thing. I hated this thing so much I ended up throwing it out. I definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased.  It works exceptionally well, holds a charge for a long time, and MOSTLY it is easy to use in the most private area that I shave.</li>
            <li> I thought this price was great and it recieved good reviews so I ordered it.  My personal experience is that it pulls hair so badly that I&#x27;d prefer to not use it.  Its just sitting in my drawer.  My daughters $5 electric razor works more comfortably than this electric razor.  I personally would not reccomend this product,</li>
            <li> I have never used this shaver in the shower.  If I am going to shave my legs in the shower, I will use a razor.  As a dry shaver?  It is fantastic. Really does the job.  A little practice goes a long way.  You get the right angle, and you will never be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The battery in the razor I had for the past 10 years just died &amp; I had to buy another razor &#x27;cause the battery isn&#x27;t suggested for replacement . This is the same brand &amp; style that I had &amp; hope I get just as many good years / results from this one. I recommend it for it&#x27;s durability, compactness &amp; style &amp; it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This razor holds up nicely to daily use. It does not pull at the hairs or skin. After reading other reviews I agree that you need to be sure that your skin is either wet or extremely dry when using it. There is no in between use. I have found that I get a close enough shave with this product. If you have dark hairs than I would just stick with shaving but for those who have light hair this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver because it had good reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I used it dry and it did a great job on my legs. Only had it a day so don&#x27;t know how long it will keep a charge but is easy to recharge so that&#x27;s okay. Would  recommend it if looking for a good shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have had for over year.  Still works great~~~</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s razors for as long as I remember because I like getting a close shave but didn&#x27;t realize that it was possible to get a pretty close shave with an electric razor with none of the razor burn and pain and ingrowns. Hands down best electric razor ever and the price is amazing. Love</li>
            <li> I like the charging station for this, it&#x27;s a plug that goes into the wall and the razer stands on top of it and it keeps the counter clear. So long as it&#x27;s fully charged. I only use it as a dry razor.</li>
            <li> i love this shaver.  i&#x27;ve used it wet, i&#x27;ve used it dry, both work perfect. one full charge can be used multiple times. i love it so much i bought one for my friend.</li>
            <li> Having health issues and not always feeling up to standing in the shower, this is wonderful.  took it on vacation and it holds a charge great</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one I had used for a long time. It&#x27;s price is what attracted me to the purchase.  The quality of the product make me review and love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the performance of this shaver,  however  I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I will revise if I have issues.</li>
            <li> My goodness! Finally something that works to shave legs arms etc for my 12 year old!  I even used it to see if I likes it and I love it!! I&#x27;m buying my seconded one!</li>
            <li> Handles underarm curves with no pulling or catching.  Priced right.  Am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> does the job, doesnt nick and give s relatively close enough shave... like it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I bought one for my daughter a couple years ago and it is still going strong so I purchased this same one for me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  This razor gives an OK shave (not great but not horrible), but it is uncomfortable on my skin -- pulls and scrapes.  I was willing to put up with that, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.  I&#x27;m getting rid of it.  Probably I should have purchased a more expensive razor....  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> works fine - not as great as the close shave of a razor in the shower but does a decent enough job for those times when I&#x27;m in a pinch. Would definitely recommend this product. Cleans up well too. Good Product!</li>
            <li> I have a vein problem and can never use a straight edge again.  This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m wondering why I waited all these years to buy one!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works best wet in the shower,  but is useful out as well</li>
            <li> I bought this as a beginning razor for my preteen.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well.  I like the small charger that holds the product against the wall where you plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like chargers with long cords that have to sit on something while being charge.  It is just one more thing to clutter up  your living space.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li> Very easy and comfortable to use. This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I received this a month ago and it worked like a charm!  I bought it for my 10 year old and I ended up using it also. We used it once a week and after one month it is completely dead. Will not turn on at all. :(</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my sister and she loved it</li>
            <li> Good starter rechargeable razor for teens, also great for women who like an electric razor.  Perfect for travel in US. No worries about cuts or electrocution. No need to buy batteries. Awesome price. Panasonic is the brand of rechargeable I&#x27;ve had 20 +years, still works, needs new head, cheaper to buy a new one of these and these are prettier. Essentially same design though. A bit more curved.  I bought 2 for step-daughters last Christmas, they love them.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Just charge it for a few hours before using.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and could not keep plucking like I always did on my chin, so i bought this great razor. It&#x27;s like ZIP ZIP I&#x27;m done. I should have done this years ago. I do my legs while watching TV. I pop up the trimmer to do under my arms, then get close there with the trimmer down[ diagonally ]. I love it. So easy to use. If it starts to pull or run slow I plug it in for 24 hours and it shaves good again. I just blow on it after I shave and put it away. Thanks</li>
            <li> After only a few months of occasional/light use, it isn&#x27;t working. If I can get it easily replaced I may increase the stars. Sad. :(</li>
            <li> Not bad although not as close as a shave as I would like.  Also after a couple of year&#x27;s use it doesn&#x27;t always come on easily.  Have to hit to get it going.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple razors for those personal areas and this is by far the best! Others often pull at the hair (painful and ugly) or just don&#x27;t even try...  Shaving legs gets a good shave, albeit, not terribly close. However, it will do for that in a pinch. Seriously, just buy this one as it is the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> Handles nicely and gives a fair shave.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter is very pleased with this shaver. Just wish there was a place on the razor or the chrager to store the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for an electric razor that actually works.  This one fits that bill!! I love that you plug the razor right directly into the charging plug so it has no long ugly cord laying around on my counter. The razor sits up against the wall while charging. It has a blade that can be raised to get at long hair. Then you can finish up with the screen area of the razor. And wow.....I was so pleased with the closeness of the shave. I am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, so finally decided to buy an electric razor.  It actually shaves pretty close considering it&#x27;s electric.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> the charging station was not what we liked,we thought it would be a station that stood on it&#x27;s own and plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> I bought this for wife she wishes she had her remington back so bad she said. the only reason that i even bought this was because her remington had just completely worn out.It is not even close to what her remington was !!</li>
            <li> I just received this very recently and so far, so good!  Faster and easier than using a blade razor.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shaver for me. I find the blade shaves close, easy to handle and easy to recharge.  The price was very affordable and I would recommend it for women who don&#x27;t require a daily shave.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting a disposable.</li>
            <li> My life is hectic and this is a great convenience for me.  It works very well.  I replaced a different brand with this shaver because the older electric shaver fell apart.  This is sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> Initially,  I thought it might be a bit bulky to used, based on the design. However, it fit nicely in my hand, &amp; glided over my legs with ease. I was very pleased with the close shave! One thing of note - do NOT expect this to shave as closely as a blade razor. Having said that, I was very satisfied with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic really needs a better charging option. The shaver sits atop a small plug charger that plugs directly into the wall outlet. If the charger had been better, I would have given this shaver 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! I used it to remove underarm hair and I no longer get painful razor bumps and ingrown hairs in my arm pits like i did when using a disposable razor (venus). I have very thick leg hair and this took care of it with no problems, and I had none of the itchiness that affected me with the use of disposable razors (venus!). I also used it on my bikini area without fear of pinching or discomfort. It&#x27;ll mow through your jungle with no problems. While the shave this unit gives isn&#x27;t as close as a disposable razor, it still left my underarms and legs very smooth. Not to mention, the darkness and discoloration that my armpits suffered from the constant trauma of razor burn has gone away! The idea of going back to a disposable razor pains me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that many reviews for this item mention the shaver dying after 8 months or so. I&#x27;ve had this shaver since January of 2012 and as of now it has not died on me. However, after 10 months of moderate use the blades have become incredibly dull. When I realized the blades were failing I was only going to replace the blades rather than the entire unit, but I decided against that because 1: the replacement head is nearly as expensive as the shaver itself and 2: from what I can see from the pictures of the replacement blades, it only includes the foil and not the pop up trimmer. Over the last 10 months the pop up trimmer blades have become so dull that they no longer remove hair effectively. The foil still works great, so a replacement foil wouldn&#x27;t help me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I still believe this shaver is very good for the price. Good enough that I&#x27;ve repurchased this exact same shaver knowing that it will become dull within a year and I&#x27;ll have to replace it again. Disappointing, but honestly, since I purchased this for nearly half off of Amazon&#x27;s listed price I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Had another brand that was constantly needing new screens and foils.  Not true with this one.  Charges on the wall.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect started razor for a young girl!  Safe, fast and does a great job.  Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased a Panasonic electric razor.  This razor is lightweight and there is no cord from the chargeable base to the outlet to worry about.  The base plugs directly in the outlet saving room.  The razor gives a close shave without irritation and this razor is quieter than other electric razors I have had.  I am glad that I decided to buy this razor.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a razor since I was in my teens that worked as well as this one.  I received it as a gift and I love it.  It works great and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR - GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has stated, this razor does in fact do what it is intended to do. However, it does do what everyone else said -- if you don&#x27;t have hair trimmed already, it will yank on your hair.. which definitely is painful. If your hair is trimmed, then you won&#x27;t have any issues (at least I haven&#x27;t found any so far).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It came promptly and charged a little. It works ok but it pulled the hairs that were longer..</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and chose this model. It is a perfect fit for my needs. Great price too. I&#x27;m going to order another for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> Wow, much better than all the higher end electric shavers.  What a great find!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for my previous Panasonic and I have not been disappointed.  It is very compact - holds a charge for days (as I don&#x27;t leave it plugged into an outlet all the time) - and provides a very close shave on legs and underarms.  Would highly recommend this product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use this specifically for my bikini area and it does a really nice job. It&#x27;s very effective at getting a close shave and not bothering the skin with any razor burn rash. Ladies this is it for a bikini trimmer!</li>
            <li> So. . . First,I read the negative reviews, then read the helpful reviews. But, bottom line: I wanted a reasonable substitute for the ridiculous prices I was paying for the insufferable cartridge razor nonsense! I had used &#x27;old-timey&#x27; razors for years, endured waxing, converted to cartridges, and then asked my husband who used electric razors about his opinion. He suggested that I give it a try, we both have very sensitive skin. This is my first try and I love this razor. Use it as advised and the results will be extremely favorable. Thank you, Amazon and thank you customer reviewers. I feel wonderful! This is money Well Spent!</li>
            <li> I get razor burns easily. This is great and fast for a dry shave. I love that it is rechargeable and waterproof. Highly recommend this as a gift and for yourself. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this item! I HATE to shave my legs-takes up too much time and I always cut myself. I have very fine baby hair and this cuts it great! I am going to order one for my daughter. A great product!</li>
            <li> This is a medium strength, light weight ladies razor. It takes care of facial peach fuzz  if I make two passes.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good job.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this purchase. It works great and takes very little charging.Does everything I want it to do.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  They are the only ones I can use without cutting myself.  However, I have owned at least 5 of these, and they die without fail every two years!!!  My latest one died after 1 year.  I can&#x27;t keep buying these things.  And it always seems to die without warning when I need it most!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very easy to use, and easy to keep clean. If you use it right, you get a nice, close shave, not as close as a disposable razor, but close enough to be a lifesaver when I don&#x27;t have time for a full-on shower. I found that it works best if you shave dry. I bought this shaver because it&#x27;s almost impossible to get cut with it, and it works very well on dry skin. I absolutely love it. UPDATE 1.5 YRS is still working fantastically! Perhaps one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like my shave to be pretty close i bought this thinking I could use it to get a decent trim, this isn&#x27;t even a good trimmer. When I used it the remaining stubble feels like no hair came off. A waste of money I&#x27;ll stick to razors at least it removes the hair.</li>
            <li> Nomoreouchies.  Okay so I&#x27;m not going to lie...I am not a good shaver.  SO I need a really safe shaver that also gives me a close smooth shave and this one is the first one that I really feel does that.  I love that you can use it in water becAUse that really helps to give you a cleaner and smoother shave.  No cuts!  My legs feel perfect!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second of this model after the first wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after years of use. Before buying the second I purchased a Remington at a local store. It was horrible. I was so glad to find this on Amazon. No electric will shave as close as a blade but this is the best I&#x27;ve owned. The pop up trimmer is a great feature and works well. I also love the charger. I don&#x27;t need to leave something sitting on my vanity with a long cord. I just store it in a drawer in the bag provided and plug it in when I need to. I am very tempted to buy another to have for the future since companies are always changing models.</li>
            <li> This works so good. Had I known how well this worked , I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This product gives a close shave but not as close as a traditional razor. But that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I end up having to shave ever other day since my hair grows rather fast. I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs with it but I only use it on my underarms. It works really well I have to say. The charging time of 12 hours is a bit much, but it seems to last a long time between charging times. But really, how long does it take to shave your underarms.. Like 30 seconds each? So that&#x27;s probably why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely HATE the charger. For the average person who has a medicine cabinet over the wall outlet, this just doesn&#x27;t work. The shaver sits directly on top of the little square charger which plugs into the outlet. So I can&#x27;t use the top outlet (of the two) because the plug will not plug into the outlet due to the shaver hitting the medicine cabinet up there. I had to unplug my electric toothbrush cord so that I could use the shaver plug in the bottom plug, meaning nothing else can be plugged in while I am charging the shaver. I would much rather have a cord to contend with than that stupid square charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than the shaver charger, the shaver itself is great! It is difficult to clean out the trimmer heads (one on front, one on back) but since I don&#x27;t use them I guess I don&#x27;t have to worry about them. Cleaning the blades is easy with the included brush. I think the shorter stubby brush is for the blades and the long more easily bendable brush is for the inside of the foil. I wouldn&#x27;t use the stiff bristles on the foil since foils are easily torn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver isn&#x27;t as loud as I expected it to be. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s less loud than my Wahl hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to buy lubricating oil for it since it didn&#x27;t come with any, which I find odd. But then again these were rather inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel bag that comes with it is really cheap and gross so I tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all I really like this shaver. I hope it lasts for years to come, as long as Panasonic keeps making the replacement foils and blades...hope it lasts for years to come, as long as Panasonic keeps making the replacement foils and blades...</li>
            <li> I have a unique living situation that forces me to take showers at the gym. Because I didn&#x27;t want to bring a razor with me to the public shower I&#x27;ve switched to dry shaving with this little guy. Works great for me, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back even after I have a shower at home. Been using it a few times a month for almost a year and I love it. I usually blow off the hairs stuck between the razors with an air can duster after use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tweens when they started getting to where they wanted to shave -as opposed to letting them use razors alone and cutting themselves. So far they have held up well as far as recharging goes and I sometimes use them on my arms. If you have been shaving with razors then they say it&#x27;s hard to go electric which may be true, however, I am glad I started them out this way.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Close curves&amp;#34; is a bit of an exaggeration. It does not shave very closely or handle contour changes very well. I have definitely nicked myself with it when shaving though a contour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver a couple times now and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of shaving my legs because my skin is very dry and sensitive so it&#x27;s prone to razor burn and bumps when using regular blades.  I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t tried an electric razor before.  This razor is so comfortable to use, quick and convenient.  I&#x27;ve been using it on dry skin because without the water running, I can wear my glasses/contacts so I can see what I&#x27;m doing.  It&#x27;s nice to know that it does work in the water as well.  I would definitely not label this as a close shave razor, but where it lacks in closeness, it makes up in comfort, ease of use, speed, and convenience.  It doesn&#x27;t matter too much since I&#x27;m in my thirties and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow like it did in my teens.  Another plus is that it comes with a charger so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a convenient, comfortable shave and wants the look of smooth legs without the hassle and irritation of normal blades.  I would say if you&#x27;re in a situation where you need a really smooth shave (honeymoon, beach vacation etc.) stick with the razor but bring this along for touch-ups!</li>
            <li> So no shave November started Oct 1st for me, and somehow turned into WTF February.&lt;br /&gt;Normally when things get this hairy (that was intended to be a pun but it&#x27;s too literally to even try to be)&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE to use my trimmer first and then shave with a man&#x27;s mach 3. Conveniently my trimmer has been dead so this Panasonic is what replaced it. I&#x27;ve never tried a full on electric shaver so I thought for $20 why not. I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high hopes due to how coarse everything tends to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes later, the entire forest that was my body hair has been leveled!&lt;br /&gt;I was really expecting this thing to choke and die on my leg hair (never mind my bikini line), but here it is ready to go again. It was so easy to use I&#x27;ll probably even continue to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure my boyfriend is going to think this is the best Valentines Day gift ever</li>
            <li> This was my first wet/dryer shaver and love it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and gives a perfect close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it dry and wet - works great!&lt;br /&gt;very happy to have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Daughter loves it. Charges with no problems. Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my skin is pinched and instead of cutting my hair it pulls it. Maybe I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a five star rating because it just glided on my skin.. No pain.. Just follow the instructions given in the manual and you will be amazed by the finish.. A must have for all ladies who don&#x27;t like to get their underarms waxed more than once a month.. you can just trim it till your next wax session is due.. So buy it and you wont regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I am one of those rare women who have to shave everyday just like a man. I hate it. I&#x27;m embarrassed by it, but because of hormones and heredity there is nothing I can do. I used to use a regular disposable razor and it worked fine. I wanted to get an electric to shave my legs only now that I am older (62) and showering and shaving my legs is more difficult. It worked so well on my legs...that I tried it on my face...and got an even closer shave than my regular razor. Now I can shave comfortably and in privacy too. Gives a great shave...very, very close. I only hope it lasts a long time before I have to purchase another one!</li>
            <li> This does such a great job of taking care of my shaving needs. Very long lasting charge. Cleans and handles easily.</li>
            <li> This razor takes me back to my teenage years when I started shaving my legs. When I found razor blades, I vowed never to use an electric razor again. Until now!! This razor really provides a close shave when pressed for time.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to hold. Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as close of s shave as I want. Even though I go over legs several times, there is still stubble!</li>
            <li> Does a great job, gets close and no stubbles like no other I have used. does great dry and in the shower, I love I can use it wet</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job like any other electric shaver.  I have yet to find one that works as well as a regular and I don&#x27;t suspect I ever will in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my wife as a gift and she loves it, she never gets hurt with this shaver and her skin looks wonderful. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver works well. It charges fast, keeps the charge and shaves smoothly. Sturdy construction, nice feel, weight in your hand. easy to clean, looks nice and makes short work of shaving hair. Have only used it dry, but has a wet capability also.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my tween daughter, and she loves it! I have even borrowed it because mine (different brand) wasn&#x27;t charged, and it works better than the one that I have! I plan to buy this model for myself in the near future.</li>
            <li> no, product is very good, but i want to notify potential european  buyers of this product that it can  work only in USA 110 voltage range. usually most of electric product here in amazon do have 110-220v range, but this doesnt. if you live outside USA or will be travel in future in europe dont plug it in electric source, it will be burnt immediately. use voltage adapter like i do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as advertised--for the price  you aren&#x27;t going to find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Blade got dull pretty fast. Pulls hair too much, even with initial use. Will have to buy a different shaver. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Customers very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an unfussy blade shaver, but I needed something I could travel with, and take on an plane.  The airlines don&#x27;t like razor blades, apparently.  Go figure.  It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s good - not stubbly - and it&#x27;s nice and small for the carry-on bag.  The price was right, too.  Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this not expecting to really like it . It surprises me it worked extremely well . I would highly recommend this .</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. Nice comfortable and close shave.  It is also easy to clean.  Great price.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Kinda bites at my skin in the sensitive areas for sure, freaks me out a bit in that regard. It gets the job done though which is good, shave is decently close but its not like shaving with a razor blade. Battery is crap.</li>
            <li> After returning a shaver from another manufacturer, I was a bit hesitant to use this, but it is wonderful - shaves closely and does not scrap or burn even when used dry which is the way I use it.</li>
            <li> PIECE OF CRAP! I only owned it for a month and it went out, as we speak it has made it&#x27;s way to the landfill with all the other garbadge.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product but so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i think it was a different product</li>
            <li> I Bought This Shaver Years Ago In A Department Store And Paid Over $50..I Love It!..It Works Great..Gives A Very Close Shave..Without Hurting Skin Or Pulling Hair..I Cannot Find It In Stores Where I Live Anymore And Bought A Different Model The Manufacturer Is Currently Selling In Stores And Had To Return It..Because Of How Painful It Was..I Am So Happy..I Found It On Amazon And For Less Than $20 ( You Can&#x27;t Beat That ) Especially When The Product Works So Great! I Will Be Buying Two More In The Near Future..Love That It&#x27;s Rechargeable..I Highly Recommend This Product For Everyday Use And Travel..You Won&#x27;t Go Wrong With This Purchase.*</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this razor and the close shave it offers.  I have had Remington shavers for the last 10 years and have always been unsatisfied with them.  They never cut very close, and it always felt like I needed to shave.  I love the way this razor is extremely quick in giving a close shave.  I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; feature yet, but usually shave with a regular razor when in the shower.  I like to get a close shave when I need to use my electric razor.  I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as clean of a shave.  I too have had it stopped working.  I banged it against the counter and it began to work LOL.</li>
            <li> Good size; portable; does the job and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> would like a closer shave.  not as close a shave as a razor</li>
            <li> I purchased this wet/dry shaver for my girlfriend as a gift for Easter. Thankfully it works great on both wet and dry skin providing a close shave. On the downside, it does take a while for it to charge but it&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it so far.  I like that you can use it dry or wet.  It is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave, but is very good at getting the job done in one pass rather than shaving the same area repeatedly. Has great little motor and holds charge an exceptionally long time.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry, like the low profile recharging system also.  Does a great job, really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver but within 1-2 days of purchase it cracked. My old one cracked to which is why I purchased this. So basically it is not only a dry shaver and I can&#x27;t use it in the shower:(. I was so disappointed. And I am not going to purchase it a third time. It does do a good job shaving. I just wish it was sturdier</li>
            <li> Works as described. Primarily a convenience item.</li>
            <li> I Like this shaver because my gal. don&#x27;t cut her self any more. and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than no no the shaver on t.v</li>
            <li> This razor cuts much closer than I ever expected. I charge it between uses, and have never had a problem with the battery or power running low. I would definitely recommend this product to others, just so long as I don&#x27;t have problems with the battery in 6 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after my other brand died - but had owned for several years. After reading the reviews, figured I&#x27;d \\&quot;step up\\&quot; my shaver. Now, since using it, I&#x27;m not sure what all the raves were about. This shaver hurts AND didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving either. Bought a newer version of my former cheaper, reliable, hurt-free shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.  I just use it dry, but it has worked just fine for me.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> So far used this twice and I love  it!  I can dry shave,  which is convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she absolutely loves it! If you are looking for a shaver, this is a great one!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic as I lost my first one after long use.  Does the job, easy to clean and charge lasts a long while.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It sounded like a terrific shaver--and maybe it is, so far the shave seems less close than a razor but I&#x27;m going to practice more and see if that improves with user-experience.</li>
            <li> Works well. No problems. Would buy again.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> When it was working, it worked about as well as I expected a product of this type to work. Not a super close shave, but enough to get by. I really wanted something I could use on the front of my shins and down by my Achilles tendon where I&#x27;m starting to have problems with nicks since my skin is getting thinner as I&#x27;m getting older. I used it about half a dozen times without any issues and then it just stopped working. The light on the charger is on so I have no idea what the problem is.</li>
