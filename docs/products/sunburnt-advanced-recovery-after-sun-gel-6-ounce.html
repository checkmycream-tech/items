            <li>lol </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with some of the inactive ingredients in this product.</li>

            <li>This stuff is cooling and pleasant-</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant with no lingering after-odor.  </li>
            <li>#1 product out there for sunburns and for fair redheads</li>
            <li>it probably does do these things fairly well.</li>
            <li>I like this product and this was a good price.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for sunburns but am happy it&#x27;s multifunctional.</li>
            <li>Also, this product has a very light, pleasant scent and is not sticky - does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else out there for sunburn!</li>
            <li>Worked better than I imagined!</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for!  </li>
            <li>The best way to deal with a sunburn is not to get one in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and I will recommend to everyone to keep a tube around \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>After Sun Relief handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seemed to be highly effective on my sking and my toddlers.</li>
            <li>He tans up nicely, but by the time the trip was over</li>
            <li>I try to avoid sunburns but when mistakes happen, it&#x27;s nice to have this around.</li>
            <li>great for sun burn, not greasy, cool feeling.</li>
            <li>Best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Almost everyone online said this product was great and they were right.</li>
            <li>Great advice, right?</li>
            <li>Wonderfully, after applying the cream the first time, the symptoms were relieved significantly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would come in handy in the summer because I burn so easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I had one.</li>
            <li>I wish I could purchase it at more retailers.  </li>
            <li>It works, but it&#x27;s nothing phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Many of these products contain lidocaine which causes me to itch and break-out.  </li>
            <li>It discredits Amazon that a product that literally does nothing has so many five star reviews.</li>
            <li>And you can be confident that you are using a product that will help you skin heal in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>Instead of blistering up and taking forever to heal, it felt much better by morning.  </li>
            <li>Might not work that well for everyone, but if most burn treatments leave you</li>
            <li>She was very happy with the product and has recommended it to several of her friends.</li>
            <li>Aloe vera works much better, so does AC vinegar...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i ended up with more than a bit of redness on the top of my pigs</li>
            <li>I hope the company markets this stuff in more forms than just after a sunburn.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It is exponentially better than using aloe gel by itself.  </li>
            <li>I think it helped the skin staying hydrated, but that burn took its own sweet 3-4 days to get better,</li>
            <li>, my verdict, it works GREAT if you use it as soon as you notice the burn, take a while to work on an older burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burned my palm good and put ice on it and burn spray from first aid kit but after 3 hours it was still hurting and time for bed.</li>
            <li>My gut feeling is that SunBurnt could potentially do a pretty good job of giving your sunburn some relief, though of course it won&#x27;t fully heal it.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert and this procuct works great.  </li>
            <li>Have not had a chance to use it on sunburns yet, but I&#x27;m sure if it works on oven burns, it&#x27;ll work just fine on sunburns.</li>
            <li>Even though we do use lidocaine as well, this product is awesome at taking away the sting and burn after the treatments and will not use any other substitutions.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle strong smelling perfumes but this ones light scent does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>This is truly the best product to use when you&#x27;re severely sunburnt or even a little.</li>
            <li>like that it gets completely absorbed by the skin unlike most aloe gels that leave the skin sticky and feeling smothered.</li>
            <li>This product is lidocaine free.</li>
            <li>I got sunburned, after a shower that night I put on 2 light coats on and when i awoke the redness was almost gone.</li>
            <li>The gel doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, which is also nice.</li>
            <li>If you do get one, though, it&#x27;s important to keep the skin hydrated and protected.</li>
            <li>This is nice, but that&#x27;s really all it does.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and relieves sunburn pain.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has no scent.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I brought this tube of SunBurnt with me since I am fair skinned Irish and love the beach.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that burns easily even with the proper sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Originally bought for a cruise but worked well on my husbands bald head.</li>
            <li>The aloe in this gel will sooth most types of first degree burns.  </li>
            <li>This is, however, cleaner, more portable, and more culturally acceptable than spreading yogurt on your thighs.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than straight aloe for me</li>
            <li>It claims to cool, soothe and reduce peeling skin, and because SunBurnt contains aloe</li>
            <li>One thing I can say without hesitation is that SunBurnt feels good on your skin when it&#x27;s initially applied.</li>
            <li>My sister got a moderate sun burn after exposing her skin to sunlight for a good couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I love it this much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not very expensive, which is good, but you are probably better off just getting regular aloe vera.</li>
            <li>My husband burnt his finger and he couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this took the pain away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would have healed nearly as quickly (</li>
            <li>I used this for mild sunburn and it works well.  </li>
            <li>First observation: It took me forever to find a good time to test this, because we got it more or less along with the can of \\&quot;Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30\\</li>
            <li>The best part was that I had little to no peeling afterwards, which was a new experience.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the product a lot and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>about the same time my college-aged daughter got a burn of her own, so they both started using this sunburn treatment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really useful when the time comes.</li>
            <li>But, this cream was useful over the Summer on our faces and arms.</li>
            <li>Takes the sting and pain right out.  </li>
            <li>The product has a slight pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I know it is not what it is made for, but when I have any kind of itchy skin or dry skin</li>
            <li>This product works effectively for a sunburn (as much as can be done for a basic sunburn) without all the of the toxic ingredients found in so many personal products.  </li>
            <li>then at least it is very inexpensive, and good for all burns!</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation and hydration provide instant relief, and it goes on feeling clean and light, just like water.  </li>
            <li>A must have for every first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I call it the miracle cure for sunburn, I fish a lot and always get mostly wind burned but occasionally get sun burned on days when I think I can get away without using sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Is it any better than a regular moisturizer?</li>
            <li>After Sun Relief is a kind of gel that makes your skin feel cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but I never feel burned in the first place.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really why it&#x27;s worth buying, for me.  </li>
            <li>Pleased and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>On the second day of usage, she felt so much better and all the burning feelings had almost disappeared.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has been using  it as a oil free face moisturizer after acne treatments on body and face!</li>
            <li>My patients get many laser treatments which feel like a moderate sunburn.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take an age to rub it in, which can be important since burns tend to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time on my finger after getting a minor burn from touching a hot oven by accident.</li>
            <li>but this really did make it feel better instantly.</li>
            <li>expect immediate results if you get this product, but continued use yields positive</li>
            <li>I did follow it with Solarcaine that first night, for the added pain relief, but that was really</li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave me a small tube of SunBurnt gel to try, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>but this seems to mostly be aloe vera and a few other ingredients that are good for burns (calendula).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really having any pain to begin with -- more of a minor discomfort -- but this cream seemed to address what I did have.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to anyone suffering from a sunburn, it makes such a difference in the healing of your skin.</li>
            <li>I certainly helps with the burning and healing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just as well on the next sunburn we come across, although the six-ounce tube might run out if someone got a whole-body sunburn and the tube weren&#x27;t brand new.</li>
            <li>But, when I have gotten a little too much sun, this gel has been nice to use.</li>
            <li>I tried this in the evenings after the beach and it provided some real cooling relief.  </li>
            <li>so thought this would really work for me.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to use this product on a rather unusual burn: an electrical burn.</li>
            <li>It really soothed my skin and eliminated any pain that I had.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t peel at all, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;d gotten WAY too much sun.  </li>
            <li>My radiation oncologist approved it because there were no potentially irritating chemicals.  </li>
            <li>She said the relief was fast.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the comfort it afforded me</li>
            <li>and it worked very well for me for the one time I needed it.</li>
            <li>This ointment genuinely seemed to speed the healing process, and definitely soothed the immediate sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps reduce sunburn so much quicker than aloe</li>
            <li>I found that it provided temporary relief,but ended up leaving my skin feeling very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I have finally found a sunburn product that works for my allergy sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding, almost instantly the sting went again when I put it on and surprisingly, it did not come back 5 minutes later like the burn spray.</li>
            <li>The down side is that he then needed to start a job as a swimming instructor and life guard &#x3D; lots more sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra cooling effects of the cooled gel quickly reduce any sensitivity from prolonged exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and plan to keep some on-hand at all times.</li>
            <li>I tell all my friends about it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing for sunburns and reduces peeling and improves healing at least 75%, and absorbs extremely quickly so you can do multiple layers a day.</li>
            <li>We tried the normal aloe after sun gel with some relief.  </li>
            <li>I have very pale skin, and I burn very easily.</li>
            <li>Sunburns are no fun, and this -- along with other treatments -- will help make the whole \\&quot;recovering from a sunburn\\&quot; thing a tad bit easier, but I wish it was more powerful and lasted longer.</li>
            <li>noticed the burn on my right thigh as soon as it started turning red, this was around 8PM.</li>
            <li>Unlike other gels I have used before, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands and skin feeling sticky, a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I picked up a tube of this for free during a promotion from Walgreens - and promptly tossed it into my linen closet with all the other sun stuff.  </li>
            <li>I pray my family never has to live without it.</li>
            <li>(mind you, i&#x27;m already quite tan as almost live outside&lt;br</li>
            <li>The basic ingredient is aloe, but it has other homeopathic (non-lidocaine) ingredients that help calm burned skin nerves and quickly promote healing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been my personal experience that products like these can sometimes irritate sunburned skin and make you severely itchy after application, so use this product sparingly at first.</li>
            <li>However, I do not find that it works any better than other products with aloe, plus I do not like its fragrance when compared to several others on the market.</li>
            <li>I had been given samples one day at the beach and was so surprised at how well it cools and soothes the skin!</li>
            <li>The little ones say it cools the skin very quickly</li>
            <li>I agree with previous reviews, there probably is not much difference than just simply using aloe, but overall a good product and not expensive.</li>
            <li>The Aloe and the gel were very comforting and left the skin pretty hydrated...which is key to sunburns.  </li>
            <li>As it is, I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it in the future.</li>
            <li>Gel is clear and runny but isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have malodor.</li>
            <li>so it should last the whole summer.</li>
            <li>You never know when you will be in the sun too long or will pour some hot water on yourself in a kitchen accident.</li>
            <li>After putting it on multiple times during the days to the burnt spots, the skin appeared to heal much faster as opposed to my husband who did not use it.</li>
            <li>but I thought I was getting something that would really treat sunburn, such as aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>We began using this a few years ago when they were giving out free rebates.</li>
            <li>However, I can say that it offers a cooling effect on sunscreen-protected skin that has baked in the sun for hours on end at the pool, as my wife and stepson can attest to.</li>
            <li>I tried countless applications over a matter of days, but nothing really changed.</li>
            <li>Now that I no longer live in Southern California, my opportunities to burn aren&#x27;t as high.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, has very little scent, and is primarily homeopathic.</li>
            <li>My family had a chance to test this out recently-- a Delaware beach, a hot sun, some red skin.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s hardly any scent, and I feel good about using this on my skin, as it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Then the next morning, I noticed some spots I had missed on my left leg, and those did not benefit from this product as much.</li>
            <li>The first tube I bought at the local drug store was the same price as this one but only 2.5oz&#x27;s, this one is 6oz</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t on vacation in another country, with no other option, I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this product at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that unflavored yogurt gives the same results as far as soothing and pulling out the heat.</li>
            <li>The sunburn is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>My daughter initially reported that it didn&#x27;t really do much for her, but by the 2nd or 3rd day she changed her mind.  </li>
            <li>I applied a few more times that day and by night, my hand was back to pink again and NO PAIN.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a spray version of this as well because it difficult to apply it on the scalp w/</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve not experienced any peeling skin since we began using it and our burns are almost always better</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are a family of fair skinned people who do not tan because of a genetic abnormality, but we do burn like crazy.</li>
            <li>and it goes away quickly with little to no peeling!</li>
            <li>(thought it had cooled down, but apparently it was still plenty hot).</li>
            <li>In fact, after using it, I did not have as much skin peeling due to</li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve used this product, I have never peeled and it heals much quicker then with other things I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Plain aloe doesn&#x27;t seem to do that for me; my skin just needs a little more.  </li>
            <li>Worth its weight in gold if you&#x27;ve got a small one who doesn&#x27;t get the concept-- and appreciate the pain-- of \\&quot;sunburn.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Burns aren&#x27;t fun; usually, even showering, etc.</li>
            <li>I found that true to the promotion, it cools overheated skin, hydrates, and reduces peeling - which can lead to secondary infections.</li>
            <li>Works very well with keeping pain level down and hydrating the skin.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with some of the inactive ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ouchy, the cooling effect this gel delivers is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing results!</li>
            <li> This stuff is cooling and pleasant-</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant with no lingering after-odor.  </li>
            <li> #1 product out there for sunburns and for fair redheads</li>
            <li> it probably does do these things fairly well.</li>
            <li> I like this product and this was a good price.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought it for sunburns but am happy it&#x27;s multifunctional.</li>
            <li> Also, this product has a very light, pleasant scent and is not sticky - does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else out there for sunburn!</li>
            <li> Worked better than I imagined!</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for!  </li>
            <li> The best way to deal with a sunburn is not to get one in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I will recommend to everyone to keep a tube around \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After Sun Relief handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to be highly effective on my sking and my toddlers.</li>
            <li> He tans up nicely, but by the time the trip was over</li>
            <li> I try to avoid sunburns but when mistakes happen, it&#x27;s nice to have this around.</li>
            <li> great for sun burn, not greasy, cool feeling.</li>
            <li> Best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone online said this product was great and they were right.</li>
            <li> Great advice, right?</li>
            <li> Wonderfully, after applying the cream the first time, the symptoms were relieved significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would come in handy in the summer because I burn so easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I had one.</li>
            <li> I wish I could purchase it at more retailers.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s nothing phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Many of these products contain lidocaine which causes me to itch and break-out.  </li>
            <li> It discredits Amazon that a product that literally does nothing has so many five star reviews.</li>
            <li> And you can be confident that you are using a product that will help you skin heal in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> Instead of blistering up and taking forever to heal, it felt much better by morning.  </li>
            <li> Might not work that well for everyone, but if most burn treatments leave you</li>
            <li> She was very happy with the product and has recommended it to several of her friends.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera works much better, so does AC vinegar...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i ended up with more than a bit of redness on the top of my pigs</li>
            <li> I hope the company markets this stuff in more forms than just after a sunburn.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It is exponentially better than using aloe gel by itself.  </li>
            <li> I think it helped the skin staying hydrated, but that burn took its own sweet 3-4 days to get better,</li>
            <li> , my verdict, it works GREAT if you use it as soon as you notice the burn, take a while to work on an older burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Burned my palm good and put ice on it and burn spray from first aid kit but after 3 hours it was still hurting and time for bed.</li>
            <li> My gut feeling is that SunBurnt could potentially do a pretty good job of giving your sunburn some relief, though of course it won&#x27;t fully heal it.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert and this procuct works great.  </li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use it on sunburns yet, but I&#x27;m sure if it works on oven burns, it&#x27;ll work just fine on sunburns.</li>
            <li> Even though we do use lidocaine as well, this product is awesome at taking away the sting and burn after the treatments and will not use any other substitutions.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle strong smelling perfumes but this ones light scent does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best product to use when you&#x27;re severely sunburnt or even a little.</li>
            <li> like that it gets completely absorbed by the skin unlike most aloe gels that leave the skin sticky and feeling smothered.</li>
            <li> This product is lidocaine free.</li>
            <li> I got sunburned, after a shower that night I put on 2 light coats on and when i awoke the redness was almost gone.</li>
            <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, which is also nice.</li>
            <li> If you do get one, though, it&#x27;s important to keep the skin hydrated and protected.</li>
            <li> This is nice, but that&#x27;s really all it does.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and relieves sunburn pain.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has no scent.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I brought this tube of SunBurnt with me since I am fair skinned Irish and love the beach.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that burns easily even with the proper sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for a cruise but worked well on my husbands bald head.</li>
            <li> The aloe in this gel will sooth most types of first degree burns.  </li>
            <li> This is, however, cleaner, more portable, and more culturally acceptable than spreading yogurt on your thighs.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than straight aloe for me</li>
            <li> It claims to cool, soothe and reduce peeling skin, and because SunBurnt contains aloe</li>
            <li> One thing I can say without hesitation is that SunBurnt feels good on your skin when it&#x27;s initially applied.</li>
            <li> My sister got a moderate sun burn after exposing her skin to sunlight for a good couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I love it this much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not very expensive, which is good, but you are probably better off just getting regular aloe vera.</li>
            <li> My husband burnt his finger and he couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this took the pain away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have healed nearly as quickly (</li>
            <li> I used this for mild sunburn and it works well.  </li>
            <li> First observation: It took me forever to find a good time to test this, because we got it more or less along with the can of \\&quot;Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30\\</li>
            <li> The best part was that I had little to no peeling afterwards, which was a new experience.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the product a lot and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> about the same time my college-aged daughter got a burn of her own, so they both started using this sunburn treatment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful when the time comes.</li>
            <li> But, this cream was useful over the Summer on our faces and arms.</li>
            <li> Takes the sting and pain right out.  </li>
            <li> The product has a slight pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I know it is not what it is made for, but when I have any kind of itchy skin or dry skin</li>
            <li> This product works effectively for a sunburn (as much as can be done for a basic sunburn) without all the of the toxic ingredients found in so many personal products.  </li>
            <li> then at least it is very inexpensive, and good for all burns!</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation and hydration provide instant relief, and it goes on feeling clean and light, just like water.  </li>
            <li> A must have for every first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I call it the miracle cure for sunburn, I fish a lot and always get mostly wind burned but occasionally get sun burned on days when I think I can get away without using sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Is it any better than a regular moisturizer?</li>
            <li> After Sun Relief is a kind of gel that makes your skin feel cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but I never feel burned in the first place.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really why it&#x27;s worth buying, for me.  </li>
            <li> Pleased and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> On the second day of usage, she felt so much better and all the burning feelings had almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has been using  it as a oil free face moisturizer after acne treatments on body and face!</li>
            <li> My patients get many laser treatments which feel like a moderate sunburn.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take an age to rub it in, which can be important since burns tend to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time on my finger after getting a minor burn from touching a hot oven by accident.</li>
            <li> but this really did make it feel better instantly.</li>
            <li> expect immediate results if you get this product, but continued use yields positive</li>
            <li> I did follow it with Solarcaine that first night, for the added pain relief, but that was really</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a small tube of SunBurnt gel to try, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> but this seems to mostly be aloe vera and a few other ingredients that are good for burns (calendula).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really having any pain to begin with -- more of a minor discomfort -- but this cream seemed to address what I did have.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this to anyone suffering from a sunburn, it makes such a difference in the healing of your skin.</li>
            <li> I certainly helps with the burning and healing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just as well on the next sunburn we come across, although the six-ounce tube might run out if someone got a whole-body sunburn and the tube weren&#x27;t brand new.</li>
            <li> But, when I have gotten a little too much sun, this gel has been nice to use.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the evenings after the beach and it provided some real cooling relief.  </li>
            <li> so thought this would really work for me.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to use this product on a rather unusual burn: an electrical burn.</li>
            <li> It really soothed my skin and eliminated any pain that I had.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t peel at all, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;d gotten WAY too much sun.  </li>
            <li> My radiation oncologist approved it because there were no potentially irritating chemicals.  </li>
            <li> She said the relief was fast.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the comfort it afforded me</li>
            <li> and it worked very well for me for the one time I needed it.</li>
            <li> This ointment genuinely seemed to speed the healing process, and definitely soothed the immediate sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps reduce sunburn so much quicker than aloe</li>
            <li> I found that it provided temporary relief,but ended up leaving my skin feeling very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I have finally found a sunburn product that works for my allergy sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, almost instantly the sting went again when I put it on and surprisingly, it did not come back 5 minutes later like the burn spray.</li>
            <li> The down side is that he then needed to start a job as a swimming instructor and life guard &#x3D; lots more sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra cooling effects of the cooled gel quickly reduce any sensitivity from prolonged exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and plan to keep some on-hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I tell all my friends about it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for sunburns and reduces peeling and improves healing at least 75%, and absorbs extremely quickly so you can do multiple layers a day.</li>
            <li> We tried the normal aloe after sun gel with some relief.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and I burn very easily.</li>
            <li> Sunburns are no fun, and this -- along with other treatments -- will help make the whole \\&quot;recovering from a sunburn\\&quot; thing a tad bit easier, but I wish it was more powerful and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> noticed the burn on my right thigh as soon as it started turning red, this was around 8PM.</li>
            <li> Unlike other gels I have used before, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands and skin feeling sticky, a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of this for free during a promotion from Walgreens - and promptly tossed it into my linen closet with all the other sun stuff.  </li>
            <li> I pray my family never has to live without it.</li>
            <li> (mind you, i&#x27;m already quite tan as almost live outside&lt;br</li>
            <li> The basic ingredient is aloe, but it has other homeopathic (non-lidocaine) ingredients that help calm burned skin nerves and quickly promote healing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been my personal experience that products like these can sometimes irritate sunburned skin and make you severely itchy after application, so use this product sparingly at first.</li>
            <li> However, I do not find that it works any better than other products with aloe, plus I do not like its fragrance when compared to several others on the market.</li>
            <li> I had been given samples one day at the beach and was so surprised at how well it cools and soothes the skin!</li>
            <li> The little ones say it cools the skin very quickly</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews, there probably is not much difference than just simply using aloe, but overall a good product and not expensive.</li>
            <li> The Aloe and the gel were very comforting and left the skin pretty hydrated...which is key to sunburns.  </li>
            <li> As it is, I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> Gel is clear and runny but isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have malodor.</li>
            <li> so it should last the whole summer.</li>
            <li> You never know when you will be in the sun too long or will pour some hot water on yourself in a kitchen accident.</li>
            <li> After putting it on multiple times during the days to the burnt spots, the skin appeared to heal much faster as opposed to my husband who did not use it.</li>
            <li> but I thought I was getting something that would really treat sunburn, such as aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> We began using this a few years ago when they were giving out free rebates.</li>
            <li> However, I can say that it offers a cooling effect on sunscreen-protected skin that has baked in the sun for hours on end at the pool, as my wife and stepson can attest to.</li>
            <li> I tried countless applications over a matter of days, but nothing really changed.</li>
            <li> Now that I no longer live in Southern California, my opportunities to burn aren&#x27;t as high.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, has very little scent, and is primarily homeopathic.</li>
            <li> My family had a chance to test this out recently-- a Delaware beach, a hot sun, some red skin.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any scent, and I feel good about using this on my skin, as it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Then the next morning, I noticed some spots I had missed on my left leg, and those did not benefit from this product as much.</li>
            <li> The first tube I bought at the local drug store was the same price as this one but only 2.5oz&#x27;s, this one is 6oz</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t on vacation in another country, with no other option, I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that unflavored yogurt gives the same results as far as soothing and pulling out the heat.</li>
            <li> The sunburn is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> My daughter initially reported that it didn&#x27;t really do much for her, but by the 2nd or 3rd day she changed her mind.  </li>
            <li> I applied a few more times that day and by night, my hand was back to pink again and NO PAIN.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have a spray version of this as well because it difficult to apply it on the scalp w/</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve not experienced any peeling skin since we began using it and our burns are almost always better</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are a family of fair skinned people who do not tan because of a genetic abnormality, but we do burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> and it goes away quickly with little to no peeling!</li>
            <li> (thought it had cooled down, but apparently it was still plenty hot).</li>
            <li> In fact, after using it, I did not have as much skin peeling due to</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this product, I have never peeled and it heals much quicker then with other things I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Plain aloe doesn&#x27;t seem to do that for me; my skin just needs a little more.  </li>
            <li> Worth its weight in gold if you&#x27;ve got a small one who doesn&#x27;t get the concept-- and appreciate the pain-- of \\&quot;sunburn.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Burns aren&#x27;t fun; usually, even showering, etc.</li>
            <li> I found that true to the promotion, it cools overheated skin, hydrates, and reduces peeling - which can lead to secondary infections.</li>
            <li> Works very well with keeping pain level down and hydrating the skin.</li>
            <li> After my snorkeling adventure in Bermuda, my back, shoulders and tops of the back of my arms were burnt since you just don&#x27;t realize how long you are out on the water!</li>
            <li> Later I had the opportunity to use it after a long day in the Florida sun.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Mexico, I tried to be very very careful about applying sunscreen, staying in the shade, staying out of the mid day sun etc etc etc, but when you are on a vacation, the inevitable happens.</li>
            <li> My recent HS graduate son spent several days</li>
            <li> The consistency is quite nice - not too thick, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t get roasted this past summer, but this worked well for the little bit of sunburn</li>
            <li> I did feel a bit of relief upon the moment of application, but it was not nearly enough, and not nearly what I&#x27;ve felt with other similar gels and lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much of the \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; are actually in this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly ever put up product reviews but just had to put something up on here because this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> too long look</li>
            <li> stuff definitely gave me relief from a bit of over-exposure to the sun... immediate coolness, but a soothing and lubrication of the dried skin helped me recover enough so that i could wear my flip-flops the next day...</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different other lotions, but none of them comes even close to this one!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> and I have used it to relieve dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> The trick is not letting your skin dry out afterwards</li>
            <li> It soothed my sunburn, didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. . .</li>
            <li> A few months later I started radiation treatments (following chemotherapy) for breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> It actually cools the skin down.  </li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not severely burned, this thing will remove redness overnight!!</li>
            <li> I would typically have to recoat the burn multiple times but it took the sting out immediately</li>
            <li> My husband was blistered all over his back and shoulders and I slightly less than that.  </li>
            <li> I forgot my hat one day and got a little red on my forehead, so I used this product to treat it.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m spending a lot of time in the sun, such as on vacation, I use it when I break for lunch, and again at dinner, and I might get a little pink</li>
            <li> just pink</li>
            <li> The longer the treatment, the harder it is on the skin.</li>
            <li> As a skin care specialist I am always careful about what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> My fault for not reading the description carefully</li>
            <li> i did a lot of fishing and spent one afternoon standing on a pier, snagging mangrove snapper, flounder, and loads of pinfish&lt;br</li>
            <li> With in seconds we received the relief we had been searching for without the staining blue or green from the other gels and it worked faster.</li>
            <li> The gel was temporarily cooling but with no actual active ingredients, it didn&#x27;t do anything after the gel had dried.</li>
            <li> We buy Sunburnt every summer because it soothes sunburns and seems to heal the skin faster than any other remedy.</li>
            <li> This is homeopathic, meaning any purported benefits are due to the placebo effect.</li>
            <li> It works instantly cooling down your skin (watch out, sometimes I feel cold because I&#x27;ve applied too much!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;$9 is an awful lot to pay for something that is basically $2 worth of aloe vera and $7 worth of hopes and dreams...</li>
            <li> I know, the first aid book says cold water, then nothing, to let a minor burn heal,</li>
            <li> The active ingredients include Cantharis, Calendula and Echinacea.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I will at least have enough for this season... ;-D</li>
            <li> As I burn easily, I have to use it quite often too... :-(</li>
            <li> I had previously, and bought two.</li>
            <li> I vacationed with my family in Florida this summer, and I was dreading the inevitable painful sunburn that I always seem to get no matter how much sunscreen I use.</li>
            <li> The usual side effects of a sunburn, like peeling skin were minimal.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be all natural but a few of the ingredients are questionable and may have safety risks or side</li>
            <li> This was really not effective as a long term treatment for a burn.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, however, my skin was as dry, hot and painful as if I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I haven&#x27;t gotten any bad sunburns this summer.</li>
            <li> Even though I used a lot of sunscreen, I still got a little burned.</li>
            <li> This little gem has been used quite abit this summer...especially after the beach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little miracle tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times.</li>
            <li> It still took a few days for sunburn to go away but with use of this product it didnt hurt.  </li>
            <li> and you dont get the dried out been in the sun</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> all the green stuff did for me.  </li>
            <li> I got a pretty bad sunburn after spending the day touring the Painted Desert.  </li>
            <li> Whether we ever get to test it on a sunburn or not, though, this little product just earned itself a convenient place in my kitchen drawer!</li>
            <li> I was given Aquafor to help with redness, itching, and other treatment-related symptoms, but that stuff is thick and greasy and gloopy (like thick vaseline)</li>
            <li> Then last week I did a stupid thing and grabbed a pan in the oven with my bare hand</li>
            <li> All skin redness is usually gone after one night.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had to use this last night.</li>
            <li> I applied liberally three times a day, and fully credit this stuff for helping me avoid the horrible discomfort so many people experience with radiation.  </li>
            <li> When I used this for sunburn, it seemed to work about as well as Solarcaine, but my burns healed in about two days instead of my usual five to six.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> after* running the hand and wrist involved under cold water through a few minutes, then patting it dry.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, no one in our family has gotten badly sunburned this summer, so I can&#x27;t completely comment on how SunBurnt works for truly reddened skin.</li>
            <li> Now after using this &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; the pain is usually gone after about 3-4 applications and no pealing whatsoever!</li>
            <li> &quot; that prevented all this summer&#x27;s sunburns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second observation: When we had a very minor scalding-water burn in the kitchen, I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; and tried putting a little of this relief ointment on the painful area</li>
            <li> During a late summer football game for one of the kids, my wife sat in ht bleachers wearing shorts.</li>
            <li> after a minor burn is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> You can actually call into work sick and get away with doing outdoor activities and no one will be the wiser cause</li>
            <li> So addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Who wants to be in miserable pain on vacation, after all?</li>
            <li> You get sloppy and then you get burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin used to peel really badly on those occasions a few days after getting burnt and I always dealt with pain.</li>
            <li> Reading fail on my part.  </li>
            <li> and I am uncomfortable with some of the inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li> After getting an unfortunate sunburn on vacation this summer, I tried using this lotion -- to no avail.</li>
            <li> I recently got a really bad sunburn on my face, one of the worst in years.</li>
            <li> A cold cloth would work just as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blister so it wasn&#x27;t that bad of a burn,</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know, radiation treatments cause the skin to become burned, like a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Had 3 kids with very bad sunburn after finding out suntan lotion was not working.</li>
            <li> The burn was very painful but this product soothed and healed my burn as well as I had hoped.</li>

            <li> Used it for the first time on my finger after getting a minor burn from touching a hot oven by accident. Works well in cooling the skin and reducing the burning sensation. Gel is clear and runny but isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have malodor. Have not had a chance to use it on sunburns yet, but I&#x27;m sure if it works on oven burns, it&#x27;ll work just fine on sunburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would come in handy in the summer because I burn so easy. Didn&#x27;t use it though and forgot about it. Then last week I did a stupid thing and grabbed a pan in the oven with my bare hand (thought it had cooled down, but apparently it was still plenty hot). Burned my palm good and put ice on it and burn spray from first aid kit but after 3 hours it was still hurting and time for bed. My husband found this product and said try it cause it said it had cooling qualities. I&#x27;m not kidding, almost instantly the sting went again when I put it on and surprisingly, it did not come back 5 minutes later like the burn spray. So I applied again as it just soaked into my hand and went to sleep, no pain. The next day I had white spots but no blistering. I applied a few more times that day and by night, my hand was back to pink again and NO PAIN. Next morning, all but a memory. This stuff is amazing and I will recommend to everyone to keep a tube around \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;. I&#x27;m so glad I had one.</li>
            <li> great for sun burn, not greasy, cool feeling.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best product to use when you&#x27;re severely sunburnt or even a little. It helps with the pain, cooling your skin and the peeling!</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Mexico, I tried to be very very careful about applying sunscreen, staying in the shade, staying out of the mid day sun etc etc etc, but when you are on a vacation, the inevitable happens. You get sloppy and then you get burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the burn on my right thigh as soon as it started turning red, this was around 8PM. I slathered on this product about 2-3 times before I went to bed, and voila! - no redness, no itchiness, no peeling next morning. Then the next morning, I noticed some spots I had missed on my left leg, and those did not benefit from this product as much. I think it helped the skin staying hydrated, but that burn took its own sweet 3-4 days to get better, no peeling though!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my verdict, it works GREAT if you use it as soon as you notice the burn, take a while to work on an older burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it gets completely absorbed by the skin unlike most aloe gels that leave the skin sticky and feeling smothered.</li>
            <li> We buy Sunburnt every summer because it soothes sunburns and seems to heal the skin faster than any other remedy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I ave EVER found for after sun burns.  It also works well for scalding and oven burns and I have used it to relieve dry itchy skin.  I wish I could purchase it at more retailers.  I take it with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times. It works, but it&#x27;s nothing phenomenal. I&#x27;ve learned that unflavored yogurt gives the same results as far as soothing and pulling out the heat. This is, however, cleaner, more portable, and more culturally acceptable than spreading yogurt on your thighs.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a recent winter vacation to islands.  I used sunscreen, but missed a couple of spots on my back which became quite burned.  I tried this in the evenings after the beach and it provided some real cooling relief.  The Aloe and the gel were very comforting and left the skin pretty hydrated...which is key to sunburns.  The best part was that I had little to no peeling afterwards, which was a new experience.  Overall, I liked the product a lot and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> After my snorkeling adventure in Bermuda, my back, shoulders and tops of the back of my arms were burnt since you just don&#x27;t realize how long you are out on the water! Luckily I brought this tube of SunBurnt with me since I am fair skinned Irish and love the beach. The relief was soothing as I titled it but I had to continuously apply it to keep any relief from the burning sensation. Like every 2min. I didn&#x27;t blister so it wasn&#x27;t that bad of a burn, just pink so thought this would really work for me. I ended up buying a bottle of Ocean Potion Burn Relief ICE and each application, the relief lasted a lot longer without any stickiness either.</li>
            <li> Best burn cream ever! I use this for everything from sunburn to kitchen burns. I even keep a tube in the cupboard next to the stove for those occasional grease burns.  Takes the sting and pain right out.  A must have for every first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product. Works better than anything else out there for sunburn!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever put up product reviews but just had to put something up on here because this stuff really works. I call it the miracle cure for sunburn, I fish a lot and always get mostly wind burned but occasionally get sun burned on days when I think I can get away without using sunscreen. My skin used to peel really badly on those occasions a few days after getting burnt and I always dealt with pain. Now after using this &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; the pain is usually gone after about 3-4 applications and no pealing whatsoever! All skin redness is usually gone after one night. You can actually call into work sick and get away with doing outdoor activities and no one will be the wiser cause you won&#x27;t show up with a red face the next day! It works great on my kids also, they seek it out over the aloe gel we have cause they know it works. The first tube I bought at the local drug store was the same price as this one but only 2.5oz&#x27;s, this one is 6oz so it should last the whole summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically for post-radiation skin care. I use it regularly; once in the morning and again at night before bed. I think this actually sped up the healing of the skin, keeping it moisturized and preventing peeling. For those who don&#x27;t know, radiation treatments cause the skin to become burned, like a bad sunburn. The longer the treatment, the harder it is on the skin. I am almost 3 weeks post-treatment and my skin looks great. The sunburn is barely noticeable. We will be going to Florida next month so I plan to take this along.</li>
            <li> My husband burnt his finger and he couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this took the pain away. I mostly bought it for sunburns but am happy it&#x27;s multifunctional.</li>
            <li> So addicted to this stuff. It is amazing for sunburns and reduces peeling and improves healing at least 75%, and absorbs extremely quickly so you can do multiple layers a day. I use it also for any cuts, scrapes etc that our household has, and it works well as homeopathic replacement for topical triple antibiotics.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty bad sunburn after spending the day touring the Painted Desert.  Unfortunately, I am allergic to many sunscreen and sunburn products.  Many of these products contain lidocaine which causes me to itch and break-out.  This product is lidocaine free. Almost everyone online said this product was great and they were right. This gel is really good! It actually cools the skin down.  I am so glad that I have finally found a sunburn product that works for my allergy sensitive skin.  I highly recommend this product and plan to keep some on-hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a homeopathic product.  Reading fail on my part.  I should have purchased a cheaper lotion with aloe in it.  I switched to a different after sun lotion as soon as I could.  I gave it an extra star because it says it actually does contain some aloe.</li>
            <li> This is homeopathic, meaning any purported benefits are due to the placebo effect. It discredits Amazon that a product that literally does nothing has so many five star reviews. Where are these reviews coming from?</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had to use this last night. Worked better than I imagined! I would typically have to recoat the burn multiple times but it took the sting out immediately and I didn&#x27;t even notice my burn all night. So happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this several times. As I burn easily, I have to use it quite often too... :-( As long as you&#x27;re not severely burned, this thing will remove redness overnight!! I have tried a lot of different other lotions, but none of them comes even close to this one!&lt;br /&gt;Just bear in mind this is a 6-ounce tube. I thought it was the 3-ounce tube I had previously, and bought two. Oh well, I will at least have enough for this season... ;-D</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to use this product on a rather unusual burn: an electrical burn. The burn was very painful but this product soothed and healed my burn as well as I had hoped. Later I had the opportunity to use it after a long day in the Florida sun. Again, it worked quite well. I recommend keeping some Sunburnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief handy. You never know when you will be in the sun too long or will pour some hot water on yourself in a kitchen accident.</li>
            <li> After spending a day at the lake and forgetting the sunblock my husband and I were crispy.  My husband was blistered all over his back and shoulders and I slightly less than that.  We tried the normal aloe after sun gel with some relief.  Solarcaine just burned and never helped the pain.  Then we found Sunburnt. With in seconds we received the relief we had been searching for without the staining blue or green from the other gels and it worked faster.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and I burn very easily. I vacationed with my family in Florida this summer, and I was dreading the inevitable painful sunburn that I always seem to get no matter how much sunscreen I use. This time I brought a tube of SunBurnt along for the trip. Even though I used a lot of sunscreen, I still got a little burned. Each night before going to bed, I applied SunBurnt to the red areas. It worked great! It really soothed my skin and eliminated any pain that I had. I didn&#x27;t peel at all, which is unusual for me. From now on, I will be taking it with me on every trip. This product is great!</li>
            <li> I know it is not what it is made for, but when I have any kind of itchy skin or dry skin I use this!  It works for all kinds of things, not only the sun.  But that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that burns easily even with the proper sunscreen. After working outside I got sunburned, after a shower that night I put on 2 light coats on and when i awoke the redness was almost gone. The trick is not letting your skin dry out afterwards and this does the trick.. I picked up a couple extra for vacation this year.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for a cruise but worked well on my husbands bald head. Seem to minimize peeling</li>
            <li> As a skin care specialist I am always careful about what I use on my skin. Sunburnt is an incredible product. It&#x27;s clear, has very little scent, and is primarily homeopathic. You get great releif - alomst immediatley! And you can be confident that you are using a product that will help you skin heal in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> I had to use this when my family got severely sun burnt going to amusement parks and beaches on our vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to be highly effective on my sking and my toddlers. After putting it on multiple times during the days to the burnt spots, the skin appeared to heal much faster as opposed to my husband who did not use it. In fact, after using it, I did not have as much skin peeling due to all the sun burn damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback was when I had problems applying it to my scalp where I had been severely sun burnt as well. It would have been nice to have a spray version of this as well because it difficult to apply it on the scalp w/ the hair in the way.</li>
            <li> This little gem has been used quite abit this summer...especially after the beach. The little ones say it cools the skin very quickly and I have not noticed any peeling so its absolutely great for mild/medium burns. Definetly give this one a try.</li>
            <li> This product arrived just in time to treat a sunburn.  I feel it did help treat it.  It still took a few days for sunburn to go away but with use of this product it didnt hurt.  The product has a slight pleasant scent.  It is not astringent.  It looks and feels like a gel.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I haven&#x27;t gotten any bad sunburns this summer. But, when I have gotten a little too much sun, this gel has been nice to use. I don&#x27;t know if it actually reduces skin peeling as it claims, but it definitely has a soothing quality to it. Unlike other gels I have used before, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands and skin feeling sticky, a huge plus for me. The gel doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, which is also nice.</li>
            <li> It soothed my sunburn, didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. . . what more could you ask for!  This definitely will be staying in my beach bag for next year.</li>
            <li> The best way to deal with a sunburn is not to get one in the first place. Great advice, right? If you do get one, though, it&#x27;s important to keep the skin hydrated and protected. I forgot my hat one day and got a little red on my forehead, so I used this product to treat it. I wasn&#x27;t really having any pain to begin with -- more of a minor discomfort -- but this cream seemed to address what I did have. It works well to keep the skin moist and to keep the air off of it. Is it any better than a regular moisturizer? I don&#x27;t know. But I would try it again.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert and this procuct works great.  I get slightly red and this mositurizes your skin and you dont get the dried out been in the sun too long look</li>
            <li> Seems like this is basically Aloe Vera plus a bunch of ingredients that maybe will or won&#x27;t help.  With homeopathic remidies, none of this stuff is regulated so it&#x27;d kid of hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$9 is an awful lot to pay for something that is basically $2 worth of aloe vera and $7 worth of hopes and dreams...</li>
            <li> My recent HS graduate son spent several days Lake Meade wake boarding with friends.  He tans up nicely, but by the time the trip was over he&#x27;d gotten WAY too much sun.  The down side is that he then needed to start a job as a swimming instructor and life guard &#x3D; lots more sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about the same time my college-aged daughter got a burn of her own, so they both started using this sunburn treatment.  My daughter initially reported that it didn&#x27;t really do much for her, but by the 2nd or 3rd day she changed her mind.  My son, who also used it, started showing signs of recovery from his overdose of sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect immediate results if you get this product, but continued use yields positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Sunburnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief is a kind of gel that makes your skin feel cool for a few minutes. This is nice, but that&#x27;s really all it does. It doesn&#x27;t heal anything, it doesn&#x27;t lessen the reddening, it just... cools. A cold cloth would work just as well. Sunburns are no fun, and this -- along with other treatments -- will help make the whole \\&quot;recovering from a sunburn\\&quot; thing a tad bit easier, but I wish it was more powerful and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This gel has been a lifesaver for me.  I recently got a really bad sunburn on my face, one of the worst in years. A friend of mine gave me a small tube of SunBurnt gel to try, and I loved it.  So, I bought this bottle for myself.  The cooling sensation and hydration provide instant relief, and it goes on feeling clean and light, just like water.  There&#x27;s hardly any scent, and I feel good about using this on my skin, as it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.  I believe this product is what prevented my burn from blistering. I strongly recommend this to anyone suffering from a sunburn, it makes such a difference in the healing of your skin.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of this for free during a promotion from Walgreens - and promptly tossed it into my linen closet with all the other sun stuff.  A few months later I started radiation treatments (following chemotherapy) for breast cancer.  I was given Aquafor to help with redness, itching, and other treatment-related symptoms, but that stuff is thick and greasy and gloopy (like thick vaseline) so I went hunting for some aloe in my stash and found this.  My radiation oncologist approved it because there were no potentially irritating chemicals.  I applied liberally three times a day, and fully credit this stuff for helping me avoid the horrible discomfort so many people experience with radiation.  I have given it to two friends since then, and am back today to buy for yet a third friend who is soon to start radiation.  This gel ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Especially since my daughter and I r red heads and we r very fair. I swear by this product . It gets the sting and redness out overnight. I will never use anything else. And it is not sticky and smelly..#1 product out there for sunburns and for fair redheads lol </li>
            <li> Feels awesome, seems to work well. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t get roasted this past summer, but this worked well for the little bit of sunburn I did get.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible burn this summer and hoped this would provide some relief. Nope. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I used this for sunburn, it seemed to work about as well as Solarcaine, but my burns healed in about two days instead of my usual five to six.  I did follow it with Solarcaine that first night, for the added pain relief, but that was really all the green stuff did for me.  I had a similar result with a kitchen burn.  Instead of blistering up and taking forever to heal, it felt much better by morning.  Might not work that well for everyone, but if most burn treatments leave you wondering why you bothered, maybe give this one a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Sunburnt does best at seems to be burn prevention.  If I&#x27;m spending a lot of time in the sun, such as on vacation, I use it when I break for lunch, and again at dinner, and I might get a little pink but I never feel burned in the first place.  Plain aloe doesn&#x27;t seem to do that for me; my skin just needs a little more.  This stuff works for me.  That&#x27;s really why it&#x27;s worth buying, for me.  Who wants to be in miserable pain on vacation, after all?</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use it regularly after a burn and it goes away quickly with little to no peeling!</li>
            <li> During a late summer football game for one of the kids, my wife sat in ht bleachers wearing shorts. She cam home with some very red, sunburned legs. I suggested she try this to relieve the burning. She said the relief was fast. The usual side effects of a sunburn, like peeling skin were minimal. It had to have been the cooling and moisturizing effect of the Sunburnt cream. She was very happy with the product and has recommended it to several of her friends.</li>
            <li> I like Aloe for sunburn, however, this therapy product for sunburn relief is just excellent.  I appreciated the comfort it afforded me and it worked very well for me for the one time I needed it.</li>
            <li> Going through radiation, I used this before I even put my clothes on after the treatment.  Wore a white tee to avoid getting it on my clothes.  I certainly helps with the burning and healing.  Best one of all I tried, and I tried a bunch!</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work at all...  Aloe vera works much better, so does AC vinegar...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! I try not to get burned, but when I do this is my go to. Every time I&#x27;ve used this product, I have never peeled and it heals much quicker then with other things I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with some of the inactive ingredients in this product. I expected it to be all natural but a few of the ingredients are questionable and may have safety risks or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is advertised as \\&quot;homeopathic\\&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure why. I don&#x27;t buy homeopathic products but this seems to mostly be aloe vera and a few other ingredients that are good for burns (calendula). I&#x27;m not sure how much of the \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; are actually in this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very expensive, which is good, but you are probably better off just getting regular aloe vera. This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than straight aloe for me and I am uncomfortable with some of the inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li> My family had a chance to test this out recently-- a Delaware beach, a hot sun, some red skin.  This stuff is cooling and pleasant- I only wish I&#x27;d had it when the kids were smaller.  Worth its weight in gold if you&#x27;ve got a small one who doesn&#x27;t get the concept-- and appreciate the pain-- of \\&quot;sunburn.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My fault for not reading the description carefully but I thought I was getting something that would really treat sunburn, such as aloe vera.  This was really not effective as a long term treatment for a burn.  The gel was temporarily cooling but with no actual active ingredients, it didn&#x27;t do anything after the gel had dried.</li>
            <li> We began using this a few years ago when they were giving out free rebates. We&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. It&#x27;s a little miracle tube. It works instantly cooling down your skin (watch out, sometimes I feel cold because I&#x27;ve applied too much!). I can&#x27;t handle strong smelling perfumes but this ones light scent does not bother me at all. We&#x27;ve not experienced any peeling skin since we began using it and our burns are almost always better the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;We are a family of fair skinned people who do not tan because of a genetic abnormality, but we do burn like crazy. I wish I had this when I was younger and constantly severely burned. But now that I have it I pray my family never has to live without it. It is absolutely wonderful. I tell all my friends about it and highly recommend it. If it ends up being not for you (which I have never met anyone who felt that way!) then at least it is very inexpensive, and good for all burns!</li>
            <li> Had 3 kids with very bad sunburn after finding out suntan lotion was not working. Works very well with keeping pain level down and hydrating the skin. Best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, no one in our family has gotten badly sunburned this summer, so I can&#x27;t completely comment on how SunBurnt works for truly reddened skin. However, I can say that it offers a cooling effect on sunscreen-protected skin that has baked in the sun for hours on end at the pool, as my wife and stepson can attest to. My gut feeling is that SunBurnt could potentially do a pretty good job of giving your sunburn some relief, though of course it won&#x27;t fully heal it. It claims to cool, soothe and reduce peeling skin, and because SunBurnt contains aloe it probably does do these things fairly well. One thing I can say without hesitation is that SunBurnt feels good on your skin when it&#x27;s initially applied. That sensation, however, doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been my personal experience that products like these can sometimes irritate sunburned skin and make you severely itchy after application, so use this product sparingly at first. SunBurnt might work differently on varied types of skin, so use caution.</li>
            <li> This product works effectively for a sunburn (as much as can be done for a basic sunburn) without all the of the toxic ingredients found in so many personal products.  Pleased and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> My sister got a moderate sun burn after exposing her skin to sunlight for a good couple of hours. Her skin became redder and it started to irritate her. She felt the sever burn feeling on her face. It didn&#x27;t go away the next day. Suddenly, I remembered that I got this sun burnt cream, so I asked her to give it a try. Wonderfully, after applying the cream the first time, the symptoms were relieved significantly. On the second day of usage, she felt so much better and all the burning feelings had almost disappeared. She totally recovered by the 3rd day of usage. I would recommend you to have this in your house. It&#x27;s really useful when the time comes.</li>
            <li> just came back from two weeks on an island in the Gulf of Mexico... i did a lot of fishing and spent one afternoon standing on a pier, snagging mangrove snapper, flounder, and loads of pinfish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, i forget to apply spf 50 lotion to the tops of my feet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ended up with more than a bit of redness on the top of my pigs (mind you, i&#x27;m already quite tan as almost live outside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff definitely gave me relief from a bit of over-exposure to the sun... immediate coolness, but a soothing and lubrication of the dried skin helped me recover enough so that i could wear my flip-flops the next day...</li>
            <li> First observation: It took me forever to find a good time to test this, because we got it more or less along with the can of \\&quot;Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30\\&quot; that prevented all this summer&#x27;s sunburns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second observation: When we had a very minor scalding-water burn in the kitchen, I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; and tried putting a little of this relief ointment on the painful area *after* running the hand and wrist involved under cold water through a few minutes, then patting it dry. Amazing results! I know, the first aid book says cold water, then nothing, to let a minor burn heal, but this really did make it feel better instantly. Burns aren&#x27;t fun; usually, even showering, etc. after a minor burn is unpleasant. This ointment genuinely seemed to speed the healing process, and definitely soothed the immediate sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just as well on the next sunburn we come across, although the six-ounce tube might run out if someone got a whole-body sunburn and the tube weren&#x27;t brand new. Whether we ever get to test it on a sunburn or not, though, this little product just earned itself a convenient place in my kitchen drawer!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and relieves sunburn pain.  I try to avoid sunburns but when mistakes happen, it&#x27;s nice to have this around.</li>
            <li> I like this product and this was a good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Awesome help for a sunburn, but also just a great lightweight skin protector and moisturizer. I hope the company markets this stuff in more forms than just after a sunburn. I use this on my face as a lightweight moisturizer in summer heat under makeup. My teenage daughter has been using  it as a oil free face moisturizer after acne treatments on body and face! Its great and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Now that I no longer live in Southern California, my opportunities to burn aren&#x27;t as high. But, this cream was useful over the Summer on our faces and arms. It doesn&#x27;t have that too antiseptic-like smell that some after burn or post sunburn products have. I will use this cream again and suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> This SunBurnt Therapeutic After Sun Relief gel is wonderful. This is the second year that I have seen and used this. The basic ingredient is aloe, but it has other homeopathic (non-lidocaine) ingredients that help calm burned skin nerves and quickly promote healing. I found that true to the promotion, it cools overheated skin, hydrates, and reduces peeling - which can lead to secondary infections. Also, and the company does not promote this, but I do - I store this in an iced cooler when we are outside or on the water. The extra cooling effects of the cooled gel quickly reduce any sensitivity from prolonged exposure to the sun. Also, this product has a very light, pleasant scent and is not sticky - does not leave any residue. It is recommended for children age 2 and above. I love this product!</li>
            <li> My patients get many laser treatments which feel like a moderate sunburn.  Even though we do use lidocaine as well, this product is awesome at taking away the sting and burn after the treatments and will not use any other substitutions.  I get it on auto-ship I love it this much.</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat soothing when applied to a sunburn.  However, I do not find that it works any better than other products with aloe, plus I do not like its fragrance when compared to several others on the market.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I got a SEVERE sunburn a couple years back and heave used it ever since.  It is exponentially better than using aloe gel by itself.  I don&#x27;t think I would have healed nearly as quickly (and without scarring) had I not used this product.  A must have for summer!</li>
            <li> I had been given samples one day at the beach and was so surprised at how well it cools and soothes the skin! It helps reduce sunburn so much quicker than aloe</li>
            <li> After getting an unfortunate sunburn on vacation this summer, I tried using this lotion -- to no avail. I did feel a bit of relief upon the moment of application, but it was not nearly enough, and not nearly what I&#x27;ve felt with other similar gels and lotions. Within a few minutes, however, my skin was as dry, hot and painful as if I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all. I tried countless applications over a matter of days, but nothing really changed. If I wasn&#x27;t on vacation in another country, with no other option, I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this product at all. As it is, I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> I used this for mild sunburn and it works well.  Goes on smooth and has no scent.  Soothing and helped reduce redness in a day.  I agree with previous reviews, there probably is not much difference than just simply using aloe, but overall a good product and not expensive.</li>
            <li> The aloe in this gel will sooth most types of first degree burns.  When you&#x27;re ouchy, the cooling effect this gel delivers is a welcome relief.  The consistency is quite nice - not too thick, not too thin.  It doesn&#x27;t take an age to rub it in, which can be important since burns tend to be sensitive.  The smell is pleasant with no lingering after-odor.  The active ingredients include Cantharis, Calendula and Echinacea.</li>
            <li> I used this on a sunburn at the end of summer.  I found that it provided temporary relief,but ended up leaving my skin feeling very sticky.  Probably would not buy.</li>
