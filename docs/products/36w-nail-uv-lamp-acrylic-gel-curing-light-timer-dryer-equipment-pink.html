            <li>It was very cheaply built, not at all a professional product, and two of thelights didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The shipping is free and fast.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked about this lamp was the color.</li>
            <li>The timer setting is just right.</li>
            <li>i would have loved to buy a much more pro model, but since this is the basic salon and it has all i need to dry all types of polish and a timer..</li>
            <li>I know similar UV lamps (in different colors) worked better from the same supplier according to the great reviews given.</li>

            <li>And it works really well!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly how it feels.</li>

            <li>, there has been so much going on with families</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it that much and for Price it</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start doing gels</li>
            <li>Sometimes the light bulbs do wiggle themselves out between used so you just have to pop them back in pace.  </li>
            <li>already opened it and cut some wires so cannot return it and will have to buy new bulbs (cost pretty much as this lamp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth either way!</li>
            <li>The light connections are a bit loose, and I had to play with them to get the lights to work.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this lamp</li>
            <li>I use this once every two weeks and it has cut my cost down significantly!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave the product 4 stars out of 5 is because after the top coat I had to cure the nails twice to ensure they were actually dry... I put the bulbs in, turned on the timer</li>
            <li>Off to order a new one</li>
            <li>works fine, do my nails at home for way less than a salon.</li>
            <li>and we are ready to begin the next step!  </li>
            <li>You have to fully push the bulbs in until you completely can&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>it really is all i need for a long while.</li>
            <li>After reading the good and bad reviews, I usually try an item for my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>it starts to get a little hot.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it needs new bulbs or if I need a new unit</li>

            <li> and we are ready to begin the next step!  </li>
            <li> You have to fully push the bulbs in until you completely can&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> it really is all i need for a long while.</li>
            <li> After reading the good and bad reviews, I usually try an item for my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> it starts to get a little hot.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it needs new bulbs or if I need a new unit</li>
            <li> She has used it a few times so far, and everything seemed to work properly.</li>
            <li> Use to dry my gel application every two to three weeks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what its supposed to which is dry the gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open this lamp, but to my disappointment, the lamp did not turn on.</li>
            <li> So for that just back you&#x27;re hand out a little.</li>
            <li> The pink color is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes pink</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s was in pink but the one of the UV lamp wasn&#x27;t working that I had to go buy the lamp that it fits.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it at first</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more expensive and cheaper !!</li>
            <li> I did have a hard time getting the last two bulbs in-</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife&#x27;s birthday along with some other items to go with it!</li>
            <li> I had previously read all the reviews so</li>

            <li> you have to be a little forceful, but after that it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it plan (rare will bother returning 20$ item) or just my bad luck...</li>
            <li> Lights came on over off on switches but no light from bulbs.  </li>
            <li> I connected the uv lights bulbs into the machine and when I turned it on to get my nails dried</li>

            <li> I could have just burned the money I spent on this and gotten the same result as this stupid Lamp gave.</li>
            <li> I just have to buy the nail polish and no more $$$$$salon visit!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it every two weeks for the past three years!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is a very big lamp for the price ,it can be used for hands and feet ,love the color</li>
            <li> The timer on the light stopped working after one use. Not worth it. I liked the color though that was nice.</li>
            <li> When I received this item, 2 or the 4 bulbs didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure if the bulbs are bad or if the actual lamp is broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my CND Shellac Polish. It&#x27;s real simple to use and easy to put together. I kind of wish there was a fan with it. But it worked great with my polish.</li>
            <li> I got this uv light yesterday and simply love it. The seller was fast on delivery and everything works great. I love the timer I&#x27;m very happy.  I would recommend it for anyone wanting one for gel or shellac nails. I by the way  bought it for shellac. Awesome machine! Thank you.</li>
            <li> The lamp I got didn&#x27;t work.  I had previously read all the reviews so as advised, I messed with the bulbs a bit and even tried various outlets around my house.  No luck.  Returning this today. :-(</li>
            <li> I love this UV Lamp! It is perfect for doing gel nails and cures perfect every time. The pink color is an added bonus. If you want a Lamp that does exactly what it should for a decent price, you should buy this one. I was skeptical about it at first but it was worth it. The shipping is free and fast.</li>
            <li> Product works great for my needs, but don&#x27;t think it would be durable enough for salon use. The light connections are a bit loose, and I had to play with them to get the lights to work. It works well, though for curing gel nail polish and I love the color, but obviously if I had paid attention to the existing reviews, I would have purchased another brand. There was no instruction manual and/or instructions. Easy to figure out, though. I used my kitchen timer to find out that the timer is for two minutes. Bottom line, it works well for home use.</li>
            <li> Received it, plugged it in, and it did not work.  Lights came on over off on switches but no light from bulbs.  Had to return it.  Bummer</li>
            <li> UV Nail Lamp came as advertised, boxed so no damaged done to product. Came with 1 extra light bulb. Love the hot pick color.</li>
            <li> it works just fine very easy to put together even got a free file when i ordered the lamp wasnt expecting that cures your uv gel perfectly</li>
            <li> at first i was scared for all the bad reviews but I decided to take the risk and don&#x27;t regret it, i love it:)</li>
            <li> I love this lamp.  It works great and is much lighter than my old one.  My daughter likes pink so I got this one and I am very happy with it,</li>
            <li> finally can do my nails, moms and friends without the salon prices. it works well had no problem at all (as plugging it in and all came on) and it came 2 days before the deadline. i haven&#x27;t used it yet, there has been so much going on with families health that there needs to be more time in the day. it was on sale too so that was a plus. i would have loved to buy a much more pro model, but since this is the basic salon and it has all i need to dry all types of polish and a timer.. it really is all i need for a long while.</li>
            <li> The product that I received was not working and I had to return it.  So that is why I can not comment on how it is working.  The fact that it emmits UVA light is not favorable to me.  So I decided not to use this type of equipment.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open this lamp, but to my disappointment, the lamp did not turn on. After reading the good and bad reviews, I usually try an item for my own personal experience. This definitely was not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp was not of the best quality. The UV lights wobbled when they were put into their sockets and the reflective background in the lamp was peeling off. I tried to plug the lights in a different way and made sure the UV lights were not broken, neither did anything to help turn on the lamp. When the power switch was turned on, the lamp made a &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; noise I would call it, but did not actually turn on. The only thing I really liked about this lamp was the color. It really is a beautiful pink (a baby pink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be wary about this! I wouldn&#x27;t want people to go through the same disappointment I did. I know similar UV lamps (in different colors) worked better from the same supplier according to the great reviews given. Check them out as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and within 3 days I received it, before the date it stated! Bulbs all work and I LOVE the color! Only problem is there is a 3-4 inch scratch along the top of the lamp. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I use this once every two weeks and it has cut my cost down significantly! I just have to buy the nail polish and no more $$$$$salon visit!</li>
            <li> It did not do what it said it would. My nails were still tacky after 20 mins.One of the lights were broken.</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly! Highly recommend! Love the option of using the timer or manual turn on. Perfect size too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok had it for 2 yrs. I don&#x27;t use it that much and for Price it iis ok too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking I was getting a great deal....you get what you pay for. It was very cheaply built, not at all a professional product, and two of thelights didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Just like going to the nail salon. I&#x27;ve always done my own nails since I was teenager. If you&#x27;re doing nail gel this is perfect to fit both your hands in at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp for my girlfriend for Christmas. She likes it a lot. She has used it a few times so far, and everything seemed to work properly. It was easy to put together also.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife&#x27;s birthday along with some other items to go with it! (UV nail gloves, get em&#x27;)  She loves it, drys her nails quick, and that&#x27;s important when you have 4 kids!  Arrived in great condition in a timely manner!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> arrived broken and had to return it.</li>
            <li> works fine, do my nails at home for way less than a salon.</li>
            <li> I was super amped to buy this and at a good price.  I was able to do my daughter&#x27;s nails before one of the bulbs just fell out.  It is cheap because it is made cheap.  I could have just burned the money I spent on this and gotten the same result as this stupid Lamp gave.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not come with directions. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how to put in the light bulbs correctly, or work the timer so I just turned it on and off manually. But it was perfect for giving myself a manicure and pedicure. The light worked good and my nails turned out great!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this nail dryer to my friends.  it works very well and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a seller named by \\&quot;Salon supply store\\&quot;. I connected the uv lights bulbs into the machine and when I turned it on to get my nails dried it started going on flames!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not working anymore, and it&#x27;s the worst thing ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME DONT BUY THIS ITEM, AT LEAST NOT FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> Looks good works great and has a timer.I would highly recommend this to anyone working with gel or uv nails.</li>
            <li> I love this light. I use it to do the shellac nils and it is a great way to keep nice polished nails for a long time.</li>
            <li> Instead of having a nice mirrow metal removable tray it has a plastic with some cheap paper so it&#x27;s more expensive and cheaper !! Hard to sanitize!  But does the job.</li>
            <li> Dries my nails with a quickness. The timer setting is just right. Use to dry my gel application every two to three weeks</li>
            <li> This is a good product!!!</li>
            <li> It is okay product. I bought that product bc it&#x27;s was in pink but the one of the UV lamp wasn&#x27;t working that I had to go buy the lamp that it fits. (the lamp was in different size then what I have). Not happy with the product at all!![[ASIN:B004NG3QB2 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac CURING Light TIMER DRYER SPA Equipment PNK]]</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift they love it -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --</li>
            <li> Love it! And it works great. Sure saves money on my trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> Brought this for our granddaughter, and she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my dryer spa !!!! with this machine I have saved a lot of money! Paint my own nails without any difficulty! It is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is the cutest uv dryer I have ever seen! Not only did it come perfectly in package but its high quality and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start doing gels</li>
            <li> This product was shipped within a timely manor and when received I plugged in the 4 lamps and it worked perfectly.  I was curing my first set of gel application nails within minutes!  The automatic 2 minute timer is fabulous and my client knows when the light turns off she can remove her hand and we are ready to begin the next step!  I love not having to babysit the lamp!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have started doing my own nails... And it works really well! I did have a hard time getting the last two bulbs in- you have to be a little forceful, but after that it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super good price- I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Works amazing and the pink is beautiful! My color stays in well! You should get this for sure!!! It is very pretty, it works very good, and it is a nice price!</li>
            <li> Works well, but bulbs keep popping out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to do my own shellac nails at home and to save tons of money.  I LOVE this product! The only reason I gave the product 4 stars out of 5 is because after the top coat I had to cure the nails twice to ensure they were actually dry... I put the bulbs in, turned on the timer and it worked great! I was able to do my toes too, which is really a money saver because in my area they charge $25 more just to put shellac on the toes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have watched several tutorials on youtube to teach me how to apply gel/shellac at home and I truthfully could not be more happy...</li>
            <li> I got this lamp for my wife, and on test run, without bulbs, we got light and smoke show. Even it has fuse, entire board was burned. I am bit into electronic so managed to fix it, but then second issue came into picture: none of bulbs were working.&lt;br /&gt;I already opened it and cut some wires so cannot return it and will have to buy new bulbs (cost pretty much as this lamp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it plan (rare will bother returning 20$ item) or just my bad luck... but if you are not into modifying your lamp, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great little light for the money! Worked just as well as the gellish or creative lights! Would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> The only good review I have is that the shipping was fast! Timer doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t do what its supposed to which is dry the gel nail polish. One bulb was broken.</li>
            <li> This lamp works great and is affordable. My daughter&#x27;s love the color as well. I would highly recommend this lamp</li>
            <li> I am truly in love. This thing works wonders. When I received the product it took a while to  get the bulbs installed. My boyfriend had a hard time as well. It wasn&#x27;t until we looked on YouTube that we saw you have to flip the lamp over and there is a slidey thingy. You have to fully push the bulbs in until you completely can&#x27;t anymore. It takes nooo time to cure my gel polish. It&#x27;s just like having my own nail salon in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here are the cons. Well con. It can start to burn the top of you&#x27;re hand. Not burn like 3rd degree burns but... Imagine putting you&#x27;re hand next for a fire and you start to feel the heat. Then once you&#x27;re hand warms up it starts to get a little hot. That&#x27;s exactly how it feels. So for that just back you&#x27;re hand out a little. Also to prevent that from happening. Turn off you&#x27;re lamp when not in use. You&#x27;ll not only reduce the risk of burning you&#x27;re hand, you&#x27;ll also save on electricity.</li>
            <li> This UV light is great! It&#x27;s perfect for pedicures as well as manicures.  Seriously my gel pedicures can last months! Sometimes the light bulbs do wiggle themselves out between used so you just have to pop them back in pace.  Great value! Update: today my lamp wouldn&#x27;t turn on when I plugged it in. Not sure if it needs new bulbs or if I need a new unit but I&#x27;ve used it every two weeks for the past three years! I&#x27;ve definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth either way! Off to order a new one</li>
            <li> The timer was damaged</li>
            <li> I love this lamp.  Works great. Fits both of my bands overlapped on top of one another at once.  As far as UV lights go this one is great.</li>
            <li> I can do my own gel manicure at a fraction of the cost and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> This works great and if large enough that you can do your toes as well. I really love the timer on the back and it works great. I have done everyone in my family and we had a blast.</li>
