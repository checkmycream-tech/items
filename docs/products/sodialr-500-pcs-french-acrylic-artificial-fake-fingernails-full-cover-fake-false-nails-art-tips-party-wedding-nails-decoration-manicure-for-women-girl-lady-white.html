            <li>Wonderful easy to use</li>
            <li>Great value and love this color!</li>
            <li>These nails are a good length</li>
            <li>Not all of the nails will fit yours, but when you find your sizes, you have nails, nails for days!!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>So many nails, all sizes, just as pictured!</li>
            <li>Would have to do acrylics or something because they split VERY easily</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing &amp; easy to file and don&#x27;t crack or bend easily!</li>
            <li>Love these nails :-)</li>
            <li>but I am more the satisfied :-)</li>
            <li>Much better product than Kiss nails which cost $8 for fewer nails that are thinner and split.</li>
            <li>Especially great because when my nails grew out I&#x27;d take them off and reglue them back under the cuticle a bit again.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I will be getting more once my supply is gone.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to paint, don&#x27;t chip or break easily.</li>
            <li>but they seem pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are good, full cover nails but do require a little bit of filing to be perfect.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the way these nails looked when I first put them on</li>
            <li>They are more than worth the price!</li>
            <li>easy to cut and file.</li>
            <li>They bend way to easy...</li>
            <li>The nails are fine.</li>
            <li>I love these quick cover ups when u don&#x27;t have time to go to the nail salon</li>
            <li>in all, for 2 bucks, this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>These are durable, great price, and for as far as it is traveling to get to my comes in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a super clean finish, I glued a grid of straws together so that way</li>
            <li>, I understood these nails should have been full cover</li>
            <li>The sizes were good only needed 5 of the sizes</li>
            <li>This way, I can paint them perfectly, wait for them to dry, and then glue them on later.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my nails and they are very flimsy</li>
            <li>It made them look especially nice because I could have the colour a little bit UNDER the cuticle, and there would be absolutely no exposed nail, yet no nail polish on my skin! :)</li>
            <li>Wow, I love these hoodies, definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li>After 4 days, this set is still going strong, which is more than I can say for any other nails I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I love them!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re plastic nails, so they&#x27;re not super strong.</li>
            <li>I use them on my entire nail and paint them with an acrylic top coat.</li>
            <li>I would totally buy these again, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>They look nice when on, I only have one problem with them, they crack easier than professional nails.</li>
            <li>if you had a nail chip being rough, they are such a good price and there are so many that it&#x27;s simple to replace that nail.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want acrylics or gels and you still want nail extensions that don&#x27;t last forever, I highly recommend these :)</li>
            <li>So I read comments and reviews and didn&#x27;t really know what I was getting</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get #10 but didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>Also shipping was pretty fast considering they came 15 days early.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for the acrylic look.</li>
            <li>but they are more square and look like tips, there&#x27;s nothing a little filing and shaping can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>i have to keep exchanging the broken ones for the good ones.</li>
            <li>That being said, they aren&#x27;t super weak or flimsy either, lasting me a while if I maintain them, and for a super strong nail, I&#x27;d get two plastic nails per finger (the bottom one a size smaller than the top one) and they lasted a while as long as I kept re-gluing them back onto myself.</li>
            <li>look very natural</li>
            <li>The nails would be thick and super strong, and the c-curve wouldn&#x27;t hurt my nail as long as I glued them one nail at a time, and not glue them together and then onto my finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I kept painting a top coat on them every few days and gluing them back on whenever they fell off</li>
            <li>Too long, bend VERY easily... half of them are completely different shapes then the others.</li>
            <li>I am pretty careful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the shape of the nail where it meets the cuticle is more rounded than I thought so it hard to find the correct size for individual needs.</li>

            <li> is that some of them have white lines from being bent a bit (but you can&#x27;t see it with polish!), and the free edge of the nail has a little rough bit you have to file off, but it only takes a few seconds and isn&#x27;t a big problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Although they are so long for my taste I just cut them to the desired length low priced big colaty</li>
            <li> and i hate how hard acrylic nails are on my nails these work wonderfully</li>
            <li> The thing I really was disappointed with was how easily the nails will split</li>
            <li> I have ten straw ends spaced apart from each other.</li>
            <li> The nails are very long so you can make them any shape or size your heart desires.</li>
            <li> These artificial nails work fine.</li>
            <li> They are weaker and should not be used if your job or lifestyle is rough on your hands.  </li>
            <li> they ate a little long but thats nothing some clipping and filing cant fix</li>
            <li> I expected them when buying them, just try to be a little careful when wearing these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price, received well before the shipping estimation in a little manilla envelope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing them for a few days and popping them off to change them up after a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and the length is not so bad either.</li>
            <li> but I was quickly disappointed when they began to crack within the first day or two.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time with them staying on</li>
            <li> I use these alot since i have a hard time growing my nails</li>
            <li> I hate using tips because they make my real nails hurt after taking them off</li>
            <li> But they are really thin.</li>
            <li> but they are very weak to wear just like that.</li>
            <li> so I am really sad to have to put these away.</li>
            <li> i sick of wating want my money never aagin</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> The nails are fine. But they are really thin. They crack often.This entire bag of nails will be gone in about 2 weeks. i have to keep exchanging the broken ones for the good ones.</li>
            <li> easy to cut and file. look very natural</li>
            <li> Not all of the nails will fit yours, but when you find your sizes, you have nails, nails for days!!

I have even glued a cracked tip on one I broke trying to pry open a key ring, it was peachy after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, received well before the shipping estimation in a little manilla envelope. Love them!</li>
            <li> just what I wanted..I hate using tips because they make my real nails hurt after taking them off but these were perfect. Just glue, sand paint and go</li>
            <li> Much better product than Kiss nails which cost $8 for fewer nails that are thinner and split.</li>
            <li> I buy these nails all the time. These are durable, great price, and for as far as it is traveling to get to my comes in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend and I will continue to buy for myself.</li>

            <li> The plus side is you get a TON of nails. The thing I really was disappointed with was how easily the nails will split</li>

            <li> This too want my money back i sick of wating want my money never aagin</li>
            <li> These nails are a good length but they do split and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Almost flawless. They are good, full cover nails but do require a little bit of filing to be perfect. Very easy to paint, don&#x27;t chip or break easily.</li>
            <li> They are great colaty and are perfect for parties. Although they are so long for my taste I just cut them to the desired length low priced big colaty I say that they would be great</li>

            <li> So many nails, all sizes, just as pictured! Bought them for my niece who&#x27;s learning nail design. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> 500 nails!!! I&#x27;m set for life. The nails are very long so you can make them any shape or size your heart desires. I will be getting more once my supply is gone. I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for the acrylic look.</li>
            <li> cheaper than going to the salon</li>
            <li> So I read comments and reviews and didn&#x27;t really know what I was getting, I understood these nails should have been full cover but they are more square and look like tips, there&#x27;s nothing a little filing and shaping can&#x27;t do. I haven&#x27;t applied them yet but they seem pretty good. I&#x27;ll update my review as soon as I use them. Also shipping was pretty fast considering they came 15 days early.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s very durable and the length is not so bad either.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Too long, bend VERY easily... half of them are completely different shapes then the others.</li>
            <li> These are very good considering the amount i paid. i would definitely buy again but, it took over a month for my package to get here...</li>
            <li> They are weaker and should not be used if your job or lifestyle is rough on your hands.  Otherwise, perfect and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great value and love this color!</li>
            <li> Starting nursing school in the spring so I am really sad to have to put these away. They&#x27;re amazing &amp; easy to file and don&#x27;t crack or bend easily! I&#x27;ll take these over walmarts crappy KISS any day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful easy to use I use these alot since i have a hard time growing my nails and i hate how hard acrylic nails are on my nails these work wonderfully</li>
            <li> I would totally buy these again, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get #10 but didn&#x27;t really need it. The sizes were good only needed 5 of the sizes but I use the rest to do design</li>
            <li> Wow, I love these hoodies, definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> They bend way to easy...They also keep popping off.</li>
            <li> I like the durability of these for my etsy nail sets I hand paint. But the shape of the nail where it meets the cuticle is more rounded than I thought so it hard to find the correct size for individual needs.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot but they are very weak to wear just like that. Would have to do acrylics or something because they split VERY easily</li>
            <li> I love these quick cover ups when u don&#x27;t have time to go to the nail salon</li>
            <li> great price &amp; quality c:</li>
