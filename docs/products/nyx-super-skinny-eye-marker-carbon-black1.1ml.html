            <li>Goes on smooth, lasts well, good color.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten reasonably good at drawing both symmetrical and clean lines</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is great for not getting it all over your eye lashes, it draws straight, and goes on nice.</li>
            <li>I have used many kinds of eye liiners, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and I am just glad that I gave a try.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that works exactly as described.</li>

            <li>Very smooth application.</li>
            <li>For me, the Nyx Super Skinny Eye Marker is a good product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it makes a nice, clean line, BUT it comes off very easily too.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fine tapered tip.  </li>
            <li>eyeliner at the grocery store that works 10x better than this.</li>
            <li>Love it:)</li>
            <li>Gotta love nyx.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much more forgiving than liquid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find a better product :)</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Product smudges on top of eyelids throughout the day.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>if the formula was waterproof or just stayed put a lot more</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It stays on lovely.</li>
            <li>Okay, well I bought this thinking</li>

            <li>I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this.</li>
            <li>I bought this before in the NYX store and was ok, so</li>
            <li>I have ordered this twice now and plan to do so again when I need more.</li>
            <li>In love with this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes a skinny line, that you can fatten out if you want.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my eyes looks.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>This was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I had to stock up and buy more.  </li>
            <li>This is my #1 favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li>the price is ok, too.</li>
            <li>But this happens with most eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Although it looks good once it&#x27;s on, it takes some practice to get the right effect.  </li>
            <li>The line is very fine - just what I wanted - and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is my very first liquid eyeliner, and I love it!</li>
            <li>was thrilled that she was able to draw a line the first time!</li>
            <li>Great new eye liner.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use this eye liner.</li>
            <li>amazing eyeliner just runs out quick</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s very easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it does run out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>its the perfect black and is sooo easy to use!</li>
            <li>It does not give you HUGE eyes :)</li>
            <li>its okay, i enjoy using it</li>
            <li>I feel like I have full control over where it goes too!</li>
            <li>I like that the tip is shorter, so it give more control to beginners and makes it significantly easier to correct any mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can make both a skinny and fat line with this marker really easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Gave 2 stars because it is easy to apply but it smears and fades within an hour of application.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and has staying power.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>applies easily and stays on does not flake off during the day like some eyeliner does.</li>
            <li>While it works well when you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to apply and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It doen&#x27;t run either but removes easily.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to make</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use and stayed on well.</li>
            <li>This is not as easy to apply as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>You may get lucky and get an awesome liner that doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>super pigmented, glides on smoothly, and allows very precise lines.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so fine, I have to go over and over my lines to achieve the depth of color that I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine tip is so versatile.</li>
            <li>but I can be precise</li>
            <li>With the marker it is alot easier to apply the liquid eyeliner and keep it in a nice straight line.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;d be much easier to apply than the liquid eyeliners I own.</li>
            <li>It works well and creates a precise line.</li>
            <li>EVEN BEING HOW CHEAP IT IS</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect dupe for AOM cosmetics liner and creates such a perfect thin line.</li>
            <li>Created smooth lines with no jagged edges.</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner very easy to use and they have had shipped the item super fast</li>
            <li>which can also be a problem if you make a mistake), it is the right thickness and color, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and is super easy to handle</li>
            <li>easy to color and easy to wash, really worth to have it.</li>
            <li>I had been using Lancôme for years, but this eye liner has longer wear and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it make applying eyeliner easy and quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply, which is why I got it.</li>
            <li>Very fine point and very smooth application without any drag and very easy to control.  </li>
            <li>Would have been perfect if it hadn&#x27;t dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li>it sounded like exactly what I was looking for - glad I did too.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner, it does not make a mess and it works great.</li>
            <li>2 say I was not disappointed w/this purchase.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for Nyx, but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I read the reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of NYX cosmetics anyways and their \\&quot;super fat eye marker\\&quot; has already stolen my heart.</li>
            <li>If I do make a mistake, it wipes up cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Glides on super smoothly.</li>
            <li>which didn&#x27;t give me that clean look</li>
            <li>I love this , favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve used so far(:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a precision line which a crayon cannot offer but a more controlled application than a liquid.</li>
            <li>The problem I have had with most liquid pens is that they do not line over mineral makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about it is the ease that you can get the perfect wing - big or small.  </li>
            <li>so I can better control how much is put on.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife last time and it worked good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and blonde hair</li>
            <li>very easy to use im new to using eyeliners</li>
            <li>Super skinny eye liner.</li>
            <li>I purchased even after reading the reviews that it dries up to quickly.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and smooth and if used with primer it will last you all day.</li>
            <li>, it did not go on in quick swipes like I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Goes on quick.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to finally find one that works so well</li>
            <li>This was after the very first use.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the mascara, it glide on smoothly</li>
            <li>My new favorite product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to control and keep the line straight.</li>
            <li>The THIN tip and great black color makes my pin up eyes perfect for every occasion.</li>
            <li>After a couple of tries, I got the hang of using it and was able to create accurate and smooth lines.</li>
            <li>I still prefer the more natural look of pencil</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Overall purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, I had never used this brand before, I got it in a goody bag at a Guess event I attended in October 2012, and it still has &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; has not dried out .</li>
            <li>Small tip, easy application, good staying power.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, last all day and easy to remove</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of swipes to get the right color on the eyelids.</li>
            <li>The color has the right amount of darkness and its up to you whether or not you want to make it darker.</li>
            <li>I also think the liquid eyeliner is easier to put on and get right than pencil ones.</li>
            <li>and i get it right</li>
            <li>I had to keep coloring in to get my liner right</li>
            <li>NYX is a one of a kind brand that never fails to meet my expectations and this skinny marker went above and beyond.</li>
            <li>great product i will certainly purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for making a little wing tip, or a big one.</li>
            <li>Came in an appropriate amount of time and is so easy to swipe on rather than dealing with other liquid pens.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it often requires that you start from scratch.</li>
            <li>The pointed soft tip makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>black, marker like but good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self is easy to grip, and if you DO manage to screw up the application, it comes up very easily with a cotton swab and a little bit of your favorite facial cleanser - without smearing all over the place.</li>
            <li>I dont like this product very much but its not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Solid bold lines made perfecting a winged cat eye easy.  </li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day, the pen is so thin that it&#x27;s nice and easy to apply on to the eyelid, it is very comfortable to hold and gives you a steady grip.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>Never fails.</li>
            <li>sadly, it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
            <li>I applied it first and then waited a couple of minutes</li>
            <li>Physicians Formula has similar pen eye liner which is much better, I think maybelline makes one too.</li>
            <li>So much affordable makeup out there, skip this!</li>
            <li>I am so spoiled by this product that I may never go back to the mechanical pencils that I used to love so much; until I discovered this!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what i have been looking for in a liquid eyeliner pen.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use it at and angle for a winder wing at the outside edges of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Even to someone who has a very unsteady hand!</li>
            <li>The headline say skinny eye marker and that is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>When I first got the Skinny Eye Marker</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product and would be making another purchase as soon as I am done with the one I have.:)</li>
            <li>gonna buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>the first time every time with this will be buying again</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve just started using it and is is much more precise than my old type.</li>
            <li>Best eyeliner I have ever purchased, and at this price, one cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, stays on forever, and looks really clean and sharp!</li>
            <li>This did have a very thin applicator which was excellent in drawing the liner look</li>
            <li>Only gave 4 stars because although I loved this eye marker, it only lasted me about 2 weeks before it began to run out.</li>
            <li>Super skinny for that perfect thin lining of d upper lid.</li>
            <li>wont last you so many hours, maybe 3 or 4 as much.</li>
            <li>Since I am not really fond of liquid eyeliners this marker was perfect for me because I could apply as little and as much to my liking.</li>
            <li>so this is prob not a good product for me, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li>also the price is great and it doesnt dry up and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and mess free.</li>
            <li>This pen is actually too fine for my liking.</li>
            <li>For regular lid coverage, I find it too fine.</li>
            <li>It is fine enough to use on the lower lid.  </li>
            <li>This gives a clean, precise, dark line.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice dark color, it glides on smooth with a nice thin tip and is very easy to apply, but it lasted less than ten days before the ink ran out.</li>
            <li>Using the marker is so much easier</li>
            <li>Yes its cheap but take my advice and spend the $19 for the Urban Decay 24/7 waterproof liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I try not to, every time I do my makeup</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It makes forming my wings much easier.  </li>
            <li>..stays on all day and is high quality!</li>
            <li>and you can really control the shape and thickness</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This liner worked really well</li>
            <li>The person I got this for really likes this and uses it a lot.</li>
            <li>make it a whole lot easier to apply eye shadow, but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of effort into experimenting with it before using it, it can be sort of a disaster on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this item.</li>
            <li>I really like the felt pen</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s really well.</li>
            <li>Great for thin lines.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve found the Physician&#x27;s Formula eye-booster SO much nicer &amp; easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and bold black color.</li>
            <li>Not so much of a hassle and if you are heavy handed don&#x27;t worry you wont mess up! :D</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, very nice, thin lines.  </li>
            <li>It dries out pretty fast, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like it to be, and it wears off easily.</li>
            <li>and it last amazing a long time.  </li>
            <li>I did not love the price but the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I get the same great lines for far less money!</li>
            <li>To get the most out of it you will need to store with the cap end down to keep it from drying out and running out quicker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little fickle in that regard, but with the right care it should be just fine.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews for this and watching YT videos, I had high hopes that this would be my HG drugstore liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>makes it very versatile as well - if you want your eyeliner a bit thicker, just add a little extra to the top!</li>
            <li>It goes on really thin, so that it looks more natural, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s basically a fine tip marker.  </li>
            <li>this works well for getting those tiny spots by your lashes that other liners miss, but it&#x27;s not opaque enough to be good for lining your whole lid.</li>
            <li>I was sort of satisfied with it before it dried out</li>
            <li>The ink comes out good and thin the way it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>I was really exited about it, especially when I first try it it was so easy to put it on, but on the second week it totally run out.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and it really does leave a fine line, especially on the corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner delivers the darkest black that doesn&#x27;t smudge and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The color is very rich, dark.&lt;br /&gt;Was not dry like other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However for my hooded eyes it does smear.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural too</li>
            <li>Mess proof and easy to apply</li>
            <li>It was a very thin precise point which is a most for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely ruined!</li>
            <li>I love how black it is against my blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do slight &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; and this works WAY better than regular liner for that.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this type of eyeliner for a long time and was excited to find it it brown, but I only used it about a week</li>
            <li>It is very black, easy to apply, and stays on until i wash it off.</li>
            <li>was expecting a liner with full color, but you have to use it few times to get a decent black.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>At times, placing the point directly on the skin won&#x27;t allow the ink to come out, and it only comes out if you tilt it a little and use more of the side of the tip.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, very dark and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Not only is this liner smooth and easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t have that creepy &#x27;wet&#x27; feeling that I have had too many times with other liner pens.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and sensitive skin in general</li>
            <li>not dark when applied and comes off.</li>
            <li>The one thing I really like about this eyeliner is the black is so vibrant</li>
            <li>after a few more tries, I can barely get the ink out.</li>
            <li>I usually use Front of the Line by LORAC which is regularly 20$, and this liner actually works BETTER for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really, really black, it doesn&#x27;t skip and glides right on.</li>
            <li>barely had any liquid.</li>
            <li>I love this liner because it goes on so thin</li>
            <li>Love the ability to outline with thin, errorless lines.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that this item rubs off easily if you just so happen to touch your eyes.</li>
            <li>The tip of the marker is very sharp, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is so much easier to control than other liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>it runs from your eyes, although it is hard to clean off from your eyes.</li>
            <li>i really thought it would be skinny but just like any other eye liner</li>
            <li>Just always remember to put the lid back on and SHAKE IT when you&#x27;re done, or the tip will dry out and that&#x27;s why many of you think that there&#x27;s no more ink left.</li>
            <li>I used to use the twist up eyeliners but they are never sharp enough.</li>
            <li>The marker dried out really quickly and the liner did not stay on long.</li>
            <li>At other times, only the very tip works and it acts like a pen rather than a marker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first week it completely dried up.  </li>
            <li>you can make a thin or thick line both as easy as the other, and it is an all around FABULOUS eyeliner!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and it is a dark dark black.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and trust me</li>

            <li> Goes on smooth, lasts well, good color.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten reasonably good at drawing both symmetrical and clean lines</li>

            <li> Very smooth application.</li>
            <li> For me, the Nyx Super Skinny Eye Marker is a good product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it makes a nice, clean line, BUT it comes off very easily too.</li>
            <li> This has a nice fine tapered tip.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner at the grocery store that works 10x better than this.</li>
            <li> Love it:)</li>
            <li> Gotta love nyx.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much more forgiving than liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find a better product :)</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Product smudges on top of eyelids throughout the day.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> if the formula was waterproof or just stayed put a lot more</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It stays on lovely.</li>
            <li> Okay, well I bought this thinking</li>
            <li> buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this before in the NYX store and was ok, so</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice now and plan to do so again when I need more.</li>
            <li> In love with this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it makes a skinny line, that you can fatten out if you want.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my eyes looks.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> This was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I had to stock up and buy more.  </li>
            <li> This is my #1 favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li> the price is ok, too.</li>
            <li> But this happens with most eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Although it looks good once it&#x27;s on, it takes some practice to get the right effect.  </li>
            <li> The line is very fine - just what I wanted - and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is my very first liquid eyeliner, and I love it!</li>
            <li> was thrilled that she was able to draw a line the first time!</li>
            <li> Great new eye liner.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use this eye liner.</li>
            <li> amazing eyeliner just runs out quick</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s very easy to clean off.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it does run out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> its the perfect black and is sooo easy to use!</li>
            <li> It does not give you HUGE eyes :)</li>
            <li> its okay, i enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I feel like I have full control over where it goes too!</li>
            <li> I like that the tip is shorter, so it give more control to beginners and makes it significantly easier to correct any mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can make both a skinny and fat line with this marker really easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> Gave 2 stars because it is easy to apply but it smears and fades within an hour of application.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and has staying power.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> applies easily and stays on does not flake off during the day like some eyeliner does.</li>
            <li> While it works well when you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to apply and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It doen&#x27;t run either but removes easily.  </li>

            <li> This product was easy to use and stayed on well.</li>
            <li> This is not as easy to apply as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> You may get lucky and get an awesome liner that doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> super pigmented, glides on smoothly, and allows very precise lines.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so fine, I have to go over and over my lines to achieve the depth of color that I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fine tip is so versatile.</li>
            <li> but I can be precise</li>
            <li> With the marker it is alot easier to apply the liquid eyeliner and keep it in a nice straight line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d be much easier to apply than the liquid eyeliners I own.</li>
            <li> It works well and creates a precise line.</li>
            <li> EVEN BEING HOW CHEAP IT IS</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect dupe for AOM cosmetics liner and creates such a perfect thin line.</li>
            <li> Created smooth lines with no jagged edges.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner very easy to use and they have had shipped the item super fast</li>

            <li> it make applying eyeliner easy and quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply, which is why I got it.</li>
            <li> Very fine point and very smooth application without any drag and very easy to control.  </li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if it hadn&#x27;t dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li> it sounded like exactly what I was looking for - glad I did too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, it does not make a mess and it works great.</li>
            <li> 2 say I was not disappointed w/this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for Nyx, but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read the reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of NYX cosmetics anyways and their \\&quot;super fat eye marker\\&quot; has already stolen my heart.</li>
            <li> If I do make a mistake, it wipes up cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Glides on super smoothly.</li>
            <li> which didn&#x27;t give me that clean look</li>
            <li> I love this , favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve used so far(:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a precision line which a crayon cannot offer but a more controlled application than a liquid.</li>
            <li> The problem I have had with most liquid pens is that they do not line over mineral makeup very well.  </li>
            <li> What I love most about it is the ease that you can get the perfect wing - big or small.  </li>
            <li> so I can better control how much is put on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife last time and it worked good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and blonde hair</li>
            <li> very easy to use im new to using eyeliners</li>
            <li> Super skinny eye liner.</li>
            <li> I purchased even after reading the reviews that it dries up to quickly.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice and smooth and if used with primer it will last you all day.</li>
            <li> , it did not go on in quick swipes like I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Goes on quick.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to finally find one that works so well</li>
            <li> This was after the very first use.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the mascara, it glide on smoothly</li>
            <li> My new favorite product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to control and keep the line straight.</li>
            <li> The THIN tip and great black color makes my pin up eyes perfect for every occasion.</li>
            <li> After a couple of tries, I got the hang of using it and was able to create accurate and smooth lines.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the more natural look of pencil</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Overall purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, I had never used this brand before, I got it in a goody bag at a Guess event I attended in October 2012, and it still has &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; has not dried out .</li>
            <li> Small tip, easy application, good staying power.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, last all day and easy to remove</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of swipes to get the right color on the eyelids.</li>
            <li> The color has the right amount of darkness and its up to you whether or not you want to make it darker.</li>
            <li> I also think the liquid eyeliner is easier to put on and get right than pencil ones.</li>
            <li> and i get it right</li>
            <li> I had to keep coloring in to get my liner right</li>
            <li> NYX is a one of a kind brand that never fails to meet my expectations and this skinny marker went above and beyond.</li>
            <li> great product i will certainly purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for making a little wing tip, or a big one.</li>
            <li> Came in an appropriate amount of time and is so easy to swipe on rather than dealing with other liquid pens.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it often requires that you start from scratch.</li>
            <li> The pointed soft tip makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> black, marker like but good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self is easy to grip, and if you DO manage to screw up the application, it comes up very easily with a cotton swab and a little bit of your favorite facial cleanser - without smearing all over the place.</li>
            <li> I dont like this product very much but its not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Solid bold lines made perfecting a winged cat eye easy.  </li>
            <li> It lasts the whole day, the pen is so thin that it&#x27;s nice and easy to apply on to the eyelid, it is very comfortable to hold and gives you a steady grip.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Never fails.</li>
            <li> sadly, it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
            <li> I applied it first and then waited a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> Physicians Formula has similar pen eye liner which is much better, I think maybelline makes one too.</li>
            <li> So much affordable makeup out there, skip this!</li>
            <li> I am so spoiled by this product that I may never go back to the mechanical pencils that I used to love so much; until I discovered this!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what i have been looking for in a liquid eyeliner pen.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use it at and angle for a winder wing at the outside edges of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Even to someone who has a very unsteady hand!</li>
            <li> The headline say skinny eye marker and that is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> When I first got the Skinny Eye Marker</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product and would be making another purchase as soon as I am done with the one I have.:)</li>
            <li> gonna buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> the first time every time with this will be buying again</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve just started using it and is is much more precise than my old type.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I have ever purchased, and at this price, one cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, stays on forever, and looks really clean and sharp!</li>
            <li> This did have a very thin applicator which was excellent in drawing the liner look</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because although I loved this eye marker, it only lasted me about 2 weeks before it began to run out.</li>
            <li> Super skinny for that perfect thin lining of d upper lid.</li>
            <li> wont last you so many hours, maybe 3 or 4 as much.</li>
            <li> Since I am not really fond of liquid eyeliners this marker was perfect for me because I could apply as little and as much to my liking.</li>
            <li> so this is prob not a good product for me, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li> also the price is great and it doesnt dry up and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and mess free.</li>
            <li> This pen is actually too fine for my liking.</li>
            <li> For regular lid coverage, I find it too fine.</li>
            <li> It is fine enough to use on the lower lid.  </li>
            <li> This gives a clean, precise, dark line.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice dark color, it glides on smooth with a nice thin tip and is very easy to apply, but it lasted less than ten days before the ink ran out.</li>
            <li> Using the marker is so much easier</li>
            <li> Yes its cheap but take my advice and spend the $19 for the Urban Decay 24/7 waterproof liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I try not to, every time I do my makeup</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It makes forming my wings much easier.  </li>
            <li> ..stays on all day and is high quality!</li>
            <li> and you can really control the shape and thickness</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This liner worked really well</li>
            <li> The person I got this for really likes this and uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> make it a whole lot easier to apply eye shadow, but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of effort into experimenting with it before using it, it can be sort of a disaster on your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this item.</li>
            <li> I really like the felt pen</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s really well.</li>
            <li> Great for thin lines.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve found the Physician&#x27;s Formula eye-booster SO much nicer &amp; easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and bold black color.</li>
            <li> Not so much of a hassle and if you are heavy handed don&#x27;t worry you wont mess up! :D</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, very nice, thin lines.  </li>
            <li> It dries out pretty fast, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like it to be, and it wears off easily.</li>
            <li> and it last amazing a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did not love the price but the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I get the same great lines for far less money!</li>
            <li> To get the most out of it you will need to store with the cap end down to keep it from drying out and running out quicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little fickle in that regard, but with the right care it should be just fine.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this and watching YT videos, I had high hopes that this would be my HG drugstore liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> makes it very versatile as well - if you want your eyeliner a bit thicker, just add a little extra to the top!</li>
            <li> It goes on really thin, so that it looks more natural, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s basically a fine tip marker.  </li>
            <li> this works well for getting those tiny spots by your lashes that other liners miss, but it&#x27;s not opaque enough to be good for lining your whole lid.</li>
            <li> I was sort of satisfied with it before it dried out</li>
            <li> The ink comes out good and thin the way it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I was really exited about it, especially when I first try it it was so easy to put it on, but on the second week it totally run out.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it really does leave a fine line, especially on the corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner delivers the darkest black that doesn&#x27;t smudge and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The color is very rich, dark.&lt;br /&gt;Was not dry like other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However for my hooded eyes it does smear.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural too</li>
            <li> Mess proof and easy to apply</li>
            <li> It was a very thin precise point which is a most for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely ruined!</li>
            <li> I love how black it is against my blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do slight &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; and this works WAY better than regular liner for that.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this type of eyeliner for a long time and was excited to find it it brown, but I only used it about a week</li>
            <li> It is very black, easy to apply, and stays on until i wash it off.</li>
            <li> was expecting a liner with full color, but you have to use it few times to get a decent black.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> At times, placing the point directly on the skin won&#x27;t allow the ink to come out, and it only comes out if you tilt it a little and use more of the side of the tip.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very dark and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Not only is this liner smooth and easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t have that creepy &#x27;wet&#x27; feeling that I have had too many times with other liner pens.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and sensitive skin in general</li>
            <li> not dark when applied and comes off.</li>
            <li> The one thing I really like about this eyeliner is the black is so vibrant</li>
            <li> after a few more tries, I can barely get the ink out.</li>
            <li> I usually use Front of the Line by LORAC which is regularly 20$, and this liner actually works BETTER for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really, really black, it doesn&#x27;t skip and glides right on.</li>
            <li> barely had any liquid.</li>
            <li> I love this liner because it goes on so thin</li>
            <li> Love the ability to outline with thin, errorless lines.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that this item rubs off easily if you just so happen to touch your eyes.</li>
            <li> The tip of the marker is very sharp, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is so much easier to control than other liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> it runs from your eyes, although it is hard to clean off from your eyes.</li>
            <li> i really thought it would be skinny but just like any other eye liner</li>
            <li> Just always remember to put the lid back on and SHAKE IT when you&#x27;re done, or the tip will dry out and that&#x27;s why many of you think that there&#x27;s no more ink left.</li>
            <li> I used to use the twist up eyeliners but they are never sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The marker dried out really quickly and the liner did not stay on long.</li>
            <li> At other times, only the very tip works and it acts like a pen rather than a marker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first week it completely dried up.  </li>
            <li> you can make a thin or thick line both as easy as the other, and it is an all around FABULOUS eyeliner!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and it is a dark dark black.</li>
            <li> It is just the right texture and not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li> It was easier but to get the actual eyeliner out and get the effect that I wanted I had to press the tip pretty hard against my eye.</li>
            <li> Regarding the \\&quot;life\\&quot; of this marker, I&#x27;ve worn a decent amount of it everyday for around 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is not water-proof but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> All markers dry up after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once , it usually takes a couple times to get used to new eye liners like this ...</li>
            <li> Also, the very tip of my marker suddenly dried out after a couple of weeks and it was only until I stored it upside down that I realized what had happened.</li>
            <li> Applicator tip is very thin, easy to control.</li>
            <li> after reading other reviews i&#x27;m a bit weary of how long it will last, but i would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Believe me I have tried tons of brands cheap and expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> lasts long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the liners that lasted entire day, but this one, half a day only...</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, lasts for a really long time and it doesn&#x27;t smear as bad as all the others.  </li>
            <li> I will be going back to my other one i use by stilla.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle in the middle of applying it, not worth the 10 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> I am never going back to my other liquid liners again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very long</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t stay on my eye very long maybe a hour.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does dry up, but</li>
            <li> I have never used a liquid eyeliner that dried up in such a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> you can get a thick line or a thin, precise line!</li>
            <li> (  it&#x27;s not worth returns because it low price</li>
            <li> Also the line is dark enough</li>
            <li> This goes on thin which is exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, I guess you loose some.</li>
            <li> (I had to apply several layers before it looked black).</li>
            <li> thinking it would have the smudge proof lasting power as the nyx liquid black liner from the tube.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this eyeliner did smudge on me within the first two hours of wearing it (in the inner corners).</li>
            <li> I always placed the eyeliner with the tip down, so I just don&#x27;t see why else it would have dried up in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> But this one comes closed to it.</li>
            <li> When I got it , it was all dried up couldn&#x27;t line your eyes if you tried, wish I could get my money back!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just because it is a waste of money and definitely wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Dried out the second time I ended up using it!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come out 100% dark all the time, sometimes it comes out just enough to put a shadow on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I had this less than 3 months (used maybe a dozen times in those 3 months) when it began to dry up.</li>
            <li> When this was bought recently, the marker becomes dry and my wife complained about it.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensisitve skin that reacts to everything.  </li>
            <li> I like how it blends but on the other hand it smudges ...</li>
            <li> I try not to rub my eyes after applying makeup, and I don&#x27;t swim in makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would work for someone that constantly rubs their eyes or cries alot.</li>
            <li> Other than that it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> (like I always do to let the makeup dry a little)</li>
            <li> I had to press it a little harder just to get the ink out.</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time finding an eyeliner that I like</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like it to be</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> which lately I try to get as close as possible.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m all about dark eyeliner</li>
            <li> It was not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run up on the lid or down below..</li>
            <li> I have to keep turning it upside down while in the cabinet and shaking it as I am putting it on.</li>
            <li> I stored it upside down in hopes it just needed to settle but it didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would shake it and leave it upside down</li>
            <li> Slightly smudging as it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Towards the end of my day half of it was gone.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the black</li>
            <li> the tube was half empthy.</li>
            <li> And believe you me, the cap was tightly placed on it to avoid it from drying out.</li>
            <li> Had just little smudging during application in the corner of eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, my friend who is Asian and has always had a very hard time with liquid application</li>
            <li> The firm but spongy felt tip made getting close to lash line a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of eye marker for several months and have not experienced any flaking off or &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; onto my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> and it dried out.  </li>
            <li> I wear liquid eyeliner everyday.</li>
            <li> dried out after a few days</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you have smudging problems with pencil eyeliner, or the liquid eyeliner gets messy for you</li>
            <li> after wearing it for a few hours it makes me looks like a raccoon.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t have that icky wet feel either.</li>
            <li> but after the 4th time I put it on, I noticed the tip dried up.</li>
            <li> I feared this product would have dried out by now</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as harsh as others that I have used.</li>
            <li> Dried out after one use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it dried out  a bit before it was sold.</li>
            <li> and it is also very black.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is very black</li>
            <li> unless i legit press the marker down hard.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased a very expensive brand but thought I&#x27;d give this a try because the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> but I guess I was expecting it to stay on at least half the day</li>
            <li> I have used cream liners and pencils in the past.</li>
            <li> so I usually purchase brown eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Not a very good marker.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like that part of this eye marker.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I did poke my eye a couple of times also but that hardly happens now.</li>
            <li> This was dry and a very faint black.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t say it is for the mere fact it dried before my third use.  </li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it goes on thin</li>
            <li> I usually use Mac gel liner and a thin brush.</li>
            <li> It works like an expensive liquid liner, but costs half the price.</li>
            <li> I am no good with liquid</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I like how I can either make a really thin line, or thick-</li>
            <li> oEasy to apply and stays right where i put it (no smearing or some pther nasty thing), moreover, i like the fact that  it is very-very  thin.</li>
            <li> stopped working after second time using it. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 1.5 months and it hasn&#x27;t ran out of ink yet (and I draw my line thick!).</li>
            <li> The tip is so thin</li>
            <li> thin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin tip.</li>
            <li> But i feel like it&#x27;s too thin the tip, and</li>
            <li> I like the color and the tip is really thin, so you can do really thin lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> Its almost impossible to mess this up.</li>
            <li> The tip will usually dry up/clog when applying over mineral base make-up and this does not do that.  </li>
            <li> Too dry, so it was really difficult to apply. :(</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena eye make up remover,neutrogena rapid wwrinkle repair night,day and eye cream :they were fake because my skin burn</li>
            <li> Makes very thin lines and tip never flattens.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff runs if you even THINK about cutting onions.</li>
            <li> The color was very faint</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I am bad at putting on eyeliner, so I got this marker.</li>
            <li> it transfers like crazy!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product. :( :( :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was surprisingly impressed by this product. I have always purchased a very expensive brand but thought I&#x27;d give this a try because the price was reasonable it sounded like exactly what I was looking for - glad I did too. I get the same great lines for far less money!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use this eye liner. Its almost impossible to mess this up. You can make both a skinny and fat line with this marker really easily. However, I noticed that whenever I use it my eyelids are itchy by the end of the day. I have eczema and sensitive skin in general so this is prob not a good product for me, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner worked good- for about a week.  After the first week it completely dried up.  I have never used a liquid eyeliner that dried up in such a short amount of time.  I always placed the eyeliner with the tip down, so I just don&#x27;t see why else it would have dried up in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for the eyeliner that will change my life. But this one comes closed to it. Very easy to use, lasts for a really long time and it doesn&#x27;t smear as bad as all the others.  Believe me I have tried tons of brands cheap and expensive ones.  This eyeliner is by far the best.  It is not water-proof but it does last a long time. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you prefer the liquid eyeliner look but aren&#x27;t good with liquid than this is a great option. I am no good with liquid but I can be precise so this eyeliner works great. I still prefer the more natural look of pencil but this is good for adding the depth and darkness I want.</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if it hadn&#x27;t dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and trust me I&#x27;ve used a lot lol. It goes on so smooth and is super easy to handle so if your a beginner then this is for you. It looks very natural too I get compliments on my eyes all the time. It&#x27;s also very long so you get a lot of product which is good since its 8.99 at ulta but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfection!! The tip is so thin so u can get a perfect winged liner with out being a pro! Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run up on the lid or down below.. Best eyeliner for the money no doubt!!</li>
            <li> I am so uncoordinated when it comes to applying eyeliner, but this makes it so easy!! Mess proof and easy to apply, I will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Dried out really fast. When it worked it was great. Solid bold lines made perfecting a winged cat eye easy.  The firm but spongy felt tip made getting close to lash line a breeze. I had this less than 3 months (used maybe a dozen times in those 3 months) when it began to dry up.</li>
            <li> No. Just no. It only drew a light line that didn&#x27;t stay throughout the day and the tip dried out after a few uses.  I threw it in the garbage after a week and bought a $2 e.l.f. eyeliner at the grocery store that works 10x better than this.</li>
            <li> Stays all day on. Love it:)</li>
            <li> Amazing pigmentation. Easy to apply. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> This is my very first liquid eyeliner, and I love it! After a couple of tries, I got the hang of using it and was able to create accurate and smooth lines.The felt tip feels good on the skin and allows for good control. However, the pigmentation isn&#x27;t amazing. It takes a couple of swipes to get the right color on the eyelids. Also, the very tip of my marker suddenly dried out after a couple of weeks and it was only until I stored it upside down that I realized what had happened. It&#x27;s a little fickle in that regard, but with the right care it should be just fine.</li>
            <li> Gotta love nyx. Never fails.</li>
            <li> I use liquid eye liner several times a week and I&#x27;ve gotten reasonably good at drawing both symmetrical and clean lines but it is definitely a chore and if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it often requires that you start from scratch. Therefore, I decided to give this a try since it was inexpensive and I like my last NYX purchase. Using the marker is so much easier and you can go back and add to the length and thickness of the line so it&#x27;s much more forgiving than liquid. Also, my friend who is Asian and has always had a very hard time with liquid application was thrilled that she was able to draw a line the first time! I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a precision line which a crayon cannot offer but a more controlled application than a liquid.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t amazing but it isn&#x27;t bad either. The color isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like it to be (I had to apply several layers before it looked black). On the plus side, it is so much easier to control than other liquid eyeliners. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find a better product :)</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best liquid eyeliner i have ever owned!! it stays on all day and will NOT smugde, run, or fade! its the perfect black and is sooo easy to use! you can get a thick line or a thin, precise line! also the price is great and it doesnt dry up and it lasts a long time! i will never use anything else! get this product you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Not only is this liner smooth and easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t have that creepy &#x27;wet&#x27; feeling that I have had too many times with other liner pens. The pen it&#x27;s self is easy to grip, and if you DO manage to screw up the application, it comes up very easily with a cotton swab and a little bit of your favorite facial cleanser - without smearing all over the place. The size of the tip it&#x27;s self makes it very versatile as well - if you want your eyeliner a bit thicker, just add a little extra to the top!</li>
            <li> It was ok. Product smudges on top of eyelids throughout the day. Yes its cheap but take my advice and spend the $19 for the Urban Decay 24/7 waterproof liquid eyeliner. It stays on all night no smudges and it even peels off when you want to take it off by rubbing it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and in excellent condition. The eyeliner marker makes it easier to apply liquid eyeliner. I had trouble befor with just the brush to keep the line straight. With the marker it is alot easier to apply the liquid eyeliner and keep it in a nice straight line. love it.</li>
            <li> the precision, application, and tip applicator is perfect EXCEPT it doesn&#x27;t stay on! just one dab of the finger or scratching your eye it&#x27;s completely ruined! it transfers like crazy! if the formula was waterproof or just stayed put a lot more this would be perfect but sadly, it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this marker after reading the reviews. I love using NYX makeup products because they are usually very good. I bought this thinking it would be awesome having to be able to make that perfect line. Yes, it makes a nice, clean line, BUT it comes off very easily too. I applied it first and then waited a couple of minutes (like I always do to let the makeup dry a little) and then I went ahead and curled my lashes. As I lifted the eyelash curler off my eye, the eyeliner just wiped off like nothing. I was so disappointed. Never buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this eyeliner!  My daughter gave it to me as part of a birthday present and I’ve been reordering it ever since.  It&#x27;s perfect!  Easy to apply and stays on all day.  I will never use any other eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st eyeliner I can actually apply without getting it all over my eyes. I wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> I used this nyx eye liner daily and I love it. I had been using Lancôme for years, but this eye liner has longer wear and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Skip this item. Not worth it. Gave 2 stars because it is easy to apply but it smears and fades within an hour of application. Physicians Formula has similar pen eye liner which is much better, I think maybelline makes one too. So much affordable makeup out there, skip this!</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to try liquid eyeliner, and I love it! I use it everyday, it goes on thin, it doesn&#x27;t come off (which can also be a problem if you make a mistake), it is the right thickness and color, and I love it. I have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> it just didnt work well with my skin idk why. It wouldnt draw on and it took forever. I will be going back to my other one i use by stilla.  Great costs though, but still wasnt worth it.</li>
            <li> The NYX marker goes on in super-thin lines, and is absolutely perfect for winged liner. So glad I found this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!! My new favorite product. Awesome and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because although I loved this eye marker, it only lasted me about 2 weeks before it began to run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of NYX cosmetics anyways and their \\&quot;super fat eye marker\\&quot; has already stolen my heart. When I tried this marker, I found another winner. The precision is perfect and it lasts all day without smudging into your under eye area. I&#x27;ve already gotten my friends hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t working at all for me . It like a washable marker. It can&#x27;t seem to use it as eye liner or eyeshadow:(  it&#x27;s not worth returns because it low price</li>
            <li> I am bad at putting on eyeliner, so I got this marker. It is amazing. It goes on really thin, so that it looks more natural, and it is easy to apply. It stays on as well. I have used it on days it has rained and it has held up remarkably, but it is also easy to take off at night. I would recommend this product to everyone. It works like an expensive liquid liner, but costs half the price. A+</li>
            <li> I love how black it is against my blue eyes.  I have been using this brand of eye marker for several months and have not experienced any flaking off or &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; onto my eyelids.  It stays put.  I am so spoiled by this product that I may never go back to the mechanical pencils that I used to love so much; until I discovered this!  Thank you, NYX and Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Super skinny, great for doing cat eye perfectly. Easy to apply and bold black color. Slightly smudging as it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> It stays on lovely. I wear it whenever. the fact that you can just draw it on evenly. Its perfect.</li>
            <li> Okay, well I bought this thinking it&#x27;d be much easier to apply than the liquid eyeliners I own. It was easier but to get the actual eyeliner out and get the effect that I wanted I had to press the tip pretty hard against my eye. I did poke my eye a couple of times also but that hardly happens now. Regarding the \\&quot;life\\&quot; of this marker, I&#x27;ve worn a decent amount of it everyday for around 6 weeks. Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i have been looking for in a liquid eyeliner pen.  Very fine point and very smooth application without any drag and very easy to control.  The problem I have had with most liquid pens is that they do not line over mineral makeup very well.  The tip will usually dry up/clog when applying over mineral base make-up and this does not do that.  I am very pleased to finally find one that works so well and it is also very black.</li>
            <li> The liner goes on like a dream and stays where I put it! The line is very fine - just what I wanted - and it&#x27;s easy to apply. This is a keeper! buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner. It works well and creates a precise line. The pointed soft tip makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This pen is actually too fine for my liking. It goes on easily and has staying power. Because it&#x27;s so fine, I have to go over and over my lines to achieve the depth of color that I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a superfine liner for your water line, this is great. For regular lid coverage, I find it too fine.</li>
            <li> I have used pencil, liquid brush, cream brush and felt liners (like this one).  So far, this is the best product and the best deal. This has a nice fine tapered tip.  I am able to use it at and angle for a winder wing at the outside edges of my eyes. It is fine enough to use on the lower lid.  And I have very good control with it.  If I do make a mistake, it wipes up cleanly.  It dries well and does not smudge....unless I have put on too much facial cream up to my eye - which lately I try to get as close as possible.  I have extremely sensisitve skin that reacts to everything.  This item has no smell and causes no reaction.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I try not to, every time I do my makeup I end up doing wing tips. I used to use the twist up eyeliners but they are never sharp enough. This is perfect for making a little wing tip, or a big one. Very precise, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, still marks just as well as day one.</li>
            <li> thin. easy to use. lasts long. fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;i love it. i would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;i think its a great product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, it does not make a mess and it works great. I will be getting more of this. Easy to use and mess free.</li>
            <li> IT RAN OUT OFF COLOR AFTER 1 WEEK.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY EVEN BEING HOW CHEAP IT IS&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
            <li> in the package it was out of its box.. Also the lipstick I got with it was opened and smeary. Yuck</li>
            <li> Too dry, so it was really difficult to apply. :( I bought this before in the NYX store and was ok, so I don&#x27;t know if they change the formula or what happened. Would not buy this again</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.  I like the felt tip.  It makes forming my wings much easier.  Goes on smooth, lasts well, good color. I have ordered this twice now and plan to do so again when I need more.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this and watching YT videos, I had high hopes that this would be my HG drugstore liquid eyeliner.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t say it is for the mere fact it dried before my third use.  And believe you me, the cap was tightly placed on it to avoid it from drying out. Overall purchase at your own risk. You may get lucky and get an awesome liner that doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner ! Perfect for cat eye looks..stays on all day and is high quality!</li>
            <li> In love with this. It&#x27;s perfect and makes the cat eye look so much easier! Even to someone who has a very unsteady hand!</li>
            <li> great product i will certainly purchase this product again in the near future. I highly recommend this is your want that perfect winged eyeliner look.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best liquid liners I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using liquid liners for 5-6 years now. It lasts the whole day, the pen is so thin that it&#x27;s nice and easy to apply on to the eyelid, it is very comfortable to hold and gives you a steady grip. I&#x27;ve had mine for 1.5 months and it hasn&#x27;t ran out of ink yet (and I draw my line thick!). Just always remember to put the lid back on and SHAKE IT when you&#x27;re done, or the tip will dry out and that&#x27;s why many of you think that there&#x27;s no more ink left. Very good product for a very nice price!</li>
            <li> I have used cream liners and pencils in the past. I love this liner because it goes on so thin and you can really control the shape and thickness you want your line to be. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love it. It goes on smooth and stays on all day. I feel like I have full control over where it goes too! Perfect if you love doing a &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; liner.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect dupe for AOM cosmetics liner and creates such a perfect thin line. The one thing I really like about this eyeliner is the black is so vibrant, I&#x27;m all about dark eyeliner so I don&#x27;t like that gray effect. This eyeliner delivers the darkest black that doesn&#x27;t smudge and is so easy to apply. It&#x27;s definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this type of eyeliner for a long time and was excited to find it it brown, but I only used it about a week and it dried out.  I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner! its so easy to use, and it does not smudge or rub off easily!! you can make a thin or thick line both as easy as the other, and it is an all around FABULOUS eyeliner! 100000 stars!!</li>
            <li> When I got it , it was all dried up couldn&#x27;t line your eyes if you tried, wish I could get my money back!!</li>
            <li> I am not a make up guru and I absolutely love this stuff! Super easy to apply, stays on forever, and looks really clean and sharp!</li>
            <li> Super skinny for that perfect thin lining of d upper lid. Glides on super smoothly. Thumbs up NYX . Will definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> I wear liquid eyeliner everyday. I usually use Mac gel liner and a thin brush. On days that I don&#x27;t want to go through all of the fuss, this is my GO TO product. It is really, really black, it doesn&#x27;t skip and glides right on. What I love most about it is the ease that you can get the perfect wing - big or small.  I recommend this as a staple to anyone who uses liner!</li>
            <li> Super skinny eye liner. black, marker like but good. I do wish I had ordered a bit thicker, but that is my wish. The headline say skinny eye marker and that is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> This was dry and a very faint black. I have to keep turning it upside down while in the cabinet and shaking it as I am putting it on. This was after the very first use. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve had so far! Makes really great wings on upperlids.</li>
            <li> Not a very good marker. It dries out pretty fast, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like it to be, and it wears off easily. I was sort of satisfied with it before it dried out but that was only for like a week or so.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It goes on very smoothly and it is a dark dark black. It is easy to control and keep the line straight. Lasts all day too. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> its okay, i enjoy using it and it&#x27;s good for not messing up because of it&#x27;s thin tip. But i feel like it&#x27;s too thin the tip, and not a lot of it comes out.</li>
            <li> amazing eyeliner just runs out quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once , it usually takes a couple times to get used to new eye liners like this ... I like how it blends but on the other hand it smudges ... but it is good .</li>
            <li> I like the color and the tip is really thin, so you can do really thin lines. However, it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I&#x27;ve owned the liners that lasted entire day, but this one, half a day only...</li>
            <li> this works well for getting those tiny spots by your lashes that other liners miss, but it&#x27;s not opaque enough to be good for lining your whole lid. I stored it upside down in hopes it just needed to settle but it didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is also not waterproof in any way shape or form. I don&#x27;t think it claimed to be but this stuff runs if you even THINK about cutting onions.</li>
            <li> The marker dried out really quickly and the liner did not stay on long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews..&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this &amp; was happy with the results..&lt;br /&gt;You have to shake it really good..&lt;br /&gt;lasted all day &amp; night..</li>
            <li> dried out after a few days</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner pen, very accurate, goes on smoothly, and it great for designs. Don&#x27;t bother with the ones in the store that are twice the price, I have used those also and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> When I first got the Skinny Eye Marker I was really exited about it, especially when I first try it it was so easy to put it on, but on the second week it totally run out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just because it is a waste of money and definitely wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> NYX is a one of a kind brand that never fails to meet my expectations and this skinny marker went above and beyond. Since I am not really fond of liquid eyeliners this marker was perfect for me because I could apply as little and as much to my liking. This marker is one of a kind and is a lifesaver. The color has the right amount of darkness and its up to you whether or not you want to make it darker. The liner is very easy to work with and stays on all day. The best thing is that is very pigmented. I would totally recommend this product and would be making another purchase as soon as I am done with the one I have.:)</li>
            <li> I have had experience w/ALL the different kinds of eyeliners out there from regular/(twist) pencil, kohl, liquid liners, gel liners &amp; even 2 this felt tip marker liner &amp; I have 2 say I was not disappointed w/this purchase. U gotta know what ur doing 2 get the \\&quot;perfect look\\&quot; &amp; it takes a lot of practice.....&amp; patience. This is a great tool 2 acheive cat eyes/the winged eyeliner look! I love it! I&#x27;m def. gonna buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this eyeliner!! It goes on so smooth and easy and Looks Great! I Will buy again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This liner worked really well and I would buy it again. The price was right and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased even after reading the reviews that it dries up to quickly.  Yes, it does dry up, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s basically a fine tip marker.  All markers dry up after multiple uses.  I&#x27;ve had this about 6-8weeks, use it daily, and I&#x27;m just now needing to repurchase.  I love that it makes a skinny line, that you can fatten out if you want.  I do slight &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; and this works WAY better than regular liner for that.  It washes off with the rest of my makeup - no extra makeup remover required, but it doesn&#x27;t flake off into my contacts or off of my face, and it doesn&#x27;t run.  I try not to rub my eyes after applying makeup, and I don&#x27;t swim in makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would work for someone that constantly rubs their eyes or cries alot.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s thin so I can better control how much is put on. I also think the liquid eyeliner is easier to put on and get right than pencil ones.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was exactly what I was hoping for. I use it everyday. It is just the right texture and not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out as a marker former instead  thinking it would have the smudge proof lasting power as the nyx liquid black liner from the tube. It did not. Towards the end of my day half of it was gone. My wings were no longer perfectly on. This did have a very thin applicator which was excellent in drawing the liner look I was going for. Just wished it would have worked as well as the nyx liquid liner from the tube.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof. Comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works exactly as described. I love how it makes my eyes looks. It is easy to use. I love it.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great for not getting it all over your eye lashes, it draws straight, and goes on nice. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come out 100% dark all the time, sometimes it comes out just enough to put a shadow on my eyelid. I read another review before I bought it, and I do shake it after every use.</li>
            <li> I love this and im sticking to it. very easy to use im new to using eyeliners and i get it right the first time every time with this will be buying again</li>
            <li> The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations. Congratulations for the beautiful work. Back to shop with you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife last time and it worked good. When this was bought recently, the marker becomes dry and my wife complained about it.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. it make applying eyeliner easy and quickly. All the while making my liner look flawless. I will be ordering this product again. I did not love the price but the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> applies easily and stays on does not flake off during the day like some eyeliner does. I still prefer my stila eyeliner to it though.</li>
            <li> I dont like this product very much but its not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a liner with full color, but you have to use it few times to get a decent black.&lt;br /&gt;It wont last you so many hours, maybe 3 or 4 as much.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very dark and lasts all day! Perfect for that cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> The person I got this for really likes this and uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> I got this eyeliner because eyeliner pencils always smudge and give me raccoon eyes from my oily lids. This was fantastic! It is very black, easy to apply, and stays on until i wash it off. I really love this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was terrible. It lasted only 5 days and I would shake it and leave it upside down it still wouldn&#x27;t work. It was not worth the money at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this. I also didn&#x27;t stay on my eye very long maybe a hour. I have oily lids but I guess I was expecting it to stay on at least half the day but no. I am so disappointed with this product. :( :( :(</li>
            <li> The marker is amazing! It goes on easily and comes off great. I would totally but this again! If you have smudging problems with pencil eyeliner, or the liquid eyeliner gets messy for you then this is the perfect eyeliner for you! Not so much of a hassle and if you are heavy handed don&#x27;t worry you wont mess up! :D</li>
            <li> Purchased on September 2012 at my local Ulta store. So far I love it. It was a very thin precise point which is a most for me. The color is nice and smooth and if used with primer it will last you all day.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice dark color, it glides on smooth with a nice thin tip and is very easy to apply, but it lasted less than ten days before the ink ran out.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know about you guys but the one that i got barely had any liquid. when i try to line my eye nothing comes out unless i legit press the marker down hard. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just mine but maybe next time i will purchase it in store.</li>
            <li> While it works well when you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t easy to use. At times, placing the point directly on the skin won&#x27;t allow the ink to come out, and it only comes out if you tilt it a little and use more of the side of the tip. At other times, only the very tip works and it acts like a pen rather than a marker.&lt;br /&gt;It make it a whole lot easier to apply eye shadow, but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of effort into experimenting with it before using it, it can be sort of a disaster on your skin.</li>
            <li> after wearing it for a few hours it makes me looks like a raccoon.  don&#x27;t really like that part of this eye marker.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, I had never used this brand before, I got it in a goody bag at a Guess event I attended in October 2012, and it still has &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; has not dried out . Easy to apply, last all day and easy to remove</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m completely loving this eye marker! super pigmented, glides on smoothly, and allows very precise lines. after reading other reviews i&#x27;m a bit weary of how long it will last, but i would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Came in an appropriate amount of time and is so easy to swipe on rather than dealing with other liquid pens. The felt tip is a breeze!</li>
            <li> It dries out constantly, I have to add water or saliva to the tip of it to get it to work. Other than that it lasts all day. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle in the middle of applying it, not worth the 10 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used. It is really easy to apply and it lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s very easy to clean off. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great new eye liner. I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve just started using it and is is much more precise than my old type.</li>
            <li> Applicator tip is very thin, easy to control. Very smooth application. Created smooth lines with no jagged edges. Pigmentation is very black so it doesn&#x27;t require any layering for the product to show up. It doesn&#x27;t feather when you apply it... Unfortunately this eyeliner did smudge on me within the first two hours of wearing it (in the inner corners). It didn&#x27;t transfer on lids with all day wear, though. I had higher expectations for Nyx, but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of eye liiners, this is the best so far. It is very easy to use, and I am just glad that I gave a try.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. stopped working after second time using it. :(</li>
            <li> Superb  product!  Makes very thin lines and tip never flattens.  and it last amazing a long time.  It doen&#x27;t run either but removes easily.  I had to stock up and buy more.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect.  I was worried about the black but it looks really great.  I have fair skin and blonde hair so I usually purchase brown eyeliner. This goes on thin which is exactly what I want.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t smudge after hours of wear and it stays on until you take it off.  Best eyeliner I have ever purchased, and at this price, one cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> For me, the Nyx Super Skinny Eye Marker is a good product. It stays on pretty well, it doesn&#x27;t have that icky wet feel either. I like how I can either make a really thin line, or thick- and it&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to make lines.&lt;br /&gt;The only tip I have for future customers is to put the eyeliner on after the eyeshadow- if you don&#x27;t already do that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention for make up tools ever. I am never going back to my other liquid liners again.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read the reviews so I purchased the item. The first time I tried the mascara, it glide on smoothly and I thought it was the greatest thing ever but after the 4th time I put it on, I noticed the tip dried up. I had to press it a little harder just to get the ink out. after a few more tries, I can barely get the ink out. Total disappointment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I feared this product would have dried out by now but it hasn&#x27;t.  Love the ability to outline with thin, errorless lines.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and stayed on well. The color was great. I was happy with the quality and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner very easy to use and they have had shipped the item super fast I will toyally recommend it</li>
            <li> I realized that you need to avoid getting cosmetics from amazon.I bought this product from Amazon and I used two times it and run.I paid it but I didn&#x27;t used it .I don&#x27;t know what can I do now?I bought also Missha BB cream:the tube was half empthy.Neutrogena eye make up remover,neutrogena rapid wwrinkle repair night,day and eye cream :they were fake because my skin burn</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this liquid pen eyeliner.  It goes on easily, very nice, thin lines.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> When they say skinny, it is skinny indeed. The tip of the marker is very sharp, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like this item. It stays on all day. I really like the felt pen, it&#x27;s not as harsh as others that I have used. The only complaint I have is that this item rubs off easily if you just so happen to touch your eyes. For the price it&#x27;s really well.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 favorite eye liner. The THIN tip and great black color makes my pin up eyes perfect for every occasion.</li>
            <li> Dried out after one use.</li>
            <li> easy to color and easy to wash, really worth to have it. the price is ok, too. i like this eye marker</li>
            <li> The ink comes out good and thin the way it&#x27;s suppose to. Also the line is dark enough so I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time finding an eyeliner that I like and I love this one! It is very easy to use and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I guess I got unlucky. The color was very faint, it did not go on in quick swipes like I anticipated. I had to keep coloring in to get my liner right which didn&#x27;t give me that clean look I was hoping for. Maybe it dried out  a bit before it was sold. Oh well, I guess you loose some.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for thin lines. Not waterproof though.. So it smudges!</li>
            <li> Small tip, easy application, good staying power. Had just little smudging during application in the corner of eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this a month ago and it doesn&#x27;t come out on my eyes. I try it on my hand it works perfectly and then when on my eyes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this!! It lasts a long time and it really does leave a fine line, especially on the corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> Goes on quick. The color is very rich, dark.&lt;br /&gt;Was not dry like other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;However for my hooded eyes it does smear. But this happens with most eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I love this , favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve used so far(:</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it does run out pretty quickly.  To get the most out of it you will need to store with the cap end down to keep it from drying out and running out quicker.</li>
            <li> it runs from your eyes, although it is hard to clean off from your eyes. Also is realy dont look good :X</li>
            <li> i LOVE IT, VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> oEasy to apply and stays right where i put it (no smearing or some pther nasty thing), moreover, i like the fact that  it is very-very  thin. It does not give you HUGE eyes :)</li>
            <li> not dark when applied and comes off. i really thought it would be skinny but just like any other eye liner</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. This gives a clean, precise, dark line. I usually use Front of the Line by LORAC which is regularly 20$, and this liner actually works BETTER for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner but i&#x27;ve found the Physician&#x27;s Formula eye-booster SO much nicer &amp; easier to apply.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner pen! I like that the tip is shorter, so it give more control to beginners and makes it significantly easier to correct any mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will without a doubt buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This is not as easy to apply as I had hoped.  Although it looks good once it&#x27;s on, it takes some practice to get the right effect.  Over all, this is a good product and it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is awesome. It&#x27;s super easy to apply, which is why I got it. The fine tip is so versatile. I will be buying it again as soon as I use up my current marker!</li>
            <li> Dried out the second time I ended up using it! Don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
