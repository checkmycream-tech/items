            <li>and i love it...</li>
            <li>love this perfume because it&#x27;s so light and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I honestly think its way too much perfume for one woman.</li>
            <li>Light and airy.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim and absolutely love the scent it is light and subtle but beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Sensational is the only perfume I&#x27;ll ever wear.</li>
            <li>I love the soft sensual scent it leaves.</li>
            <li>She also received a very expensive bottle of Coco but liked the Sensational better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better smelling or longer lasting perfume yet.</li>
            <li>I found a 100ml bottle for so much cheaper than what I paid</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I wear, and don&#x27;t like things that smell too strong, too loud, or just plain smell funny.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume many years ago when I was at some random little shop not far from my house, and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Real mild and subtle and lingers over for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong or weak, just enough for folks to notice you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>

            <li> great, my wife loves it</li>
            <li> The stuff stinks, and I&#x27;m very disappointed, because I&#x27;ve always liked most of Celine Dion&#x27;s fragrances, but not this one. Even in the bottle, it just smells awful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. My parents bought me a gift set of a perfume, spray, and lotion when I was fifteen. I finished that off in less than a year. Then I found this perfume at Sears and bought it on my sixteenth. BIGGEST MISTAKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake because I paid more for less. When I ran outta that bottle, I decided to search on Amazon. I found a 100ml bottle for so much cheaper than what I paid previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume because it&#x27;s so light and not overbearing. It lasts the whole day and, since I work in retail, all my customers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. Sensational is the only perfume I&#x27;ll ever wear.</li>
            <li> My friend got this perfume for Christmas. It smelled wonderful,so I had to have it. I was extremely happy with the price and the shipping time. I didn&#x27;t know how much 3.4oz of perfume really was till I got the bottle. I honestly think its way too much perfume for one woman. But it smells amazing and I love it so much. I think this would be best for two or three people to share. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely floral scent. So if you like floral, you will like this. I simply love the scent.  :)</li>
            <li> Wish they would put this fragrance back in stores..love it. and nothing was broken.</li>

            <li> Some how this scent is faded. Its not like d other 1 had. I&#x27;m from Trinidad and its so unfair when I order some thing and its not the quality it suppose to be.</li>

            <li> I found this perfume many years ago when I was at some random little shop not far from my house, and immediately fell in love with it. Ever since then, it has been my favorite perfume. I&#x27;m very picky about what I wear, and don&#x27;t like things that smell too strong, too loud, or just plain smell funny. Just a couple mists of this, and it lasts a very long time (even after the day is over and it&#x27;s sitting in your dirty clothes basket kind of long). I haven&#x27;t found a better smelling or longer lasting perfume yet. [:</li>

            <li> Beautiful scent! Light and airy.....I don&#x27;t feel like I can be noticed because of the scent. It&#x27;s just very refreshing.</li>
            <li> fast and i love it...</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Real mild and subtle and lingers over for a long time. Good for day/night use.</li>
