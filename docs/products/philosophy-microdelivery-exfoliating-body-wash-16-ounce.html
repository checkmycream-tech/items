            <li>Love this and use it to shave my legs.  </li>

            <li>Great scent-skin feels soft</li>
            <li>It was nice but too highly priced for me, scrub from bath and body works better</li>
            <li>This body exfolitor is fantastic.  </li>

            <li>You will love exfoliating those dead cells off your body, and enjoying fresh bright skin.  </li>

            <li>It leaves your skin feeling amazing and soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an intense smell like most Philosophy products do</li>
            <li>so that was also really nice as I have sensitive skin and am prone to headaches from scented products.  </li>
            <li>Love gentle exfoliation of this product, not alot needed to do the job,no excess perfume,natural,clean smell.</li>
            <li>and my skin stays nice and soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty rough (which is a good thing), hardly scented, and very effective!</li>
            <li>and I really thought I would need a heavy-duty scrub to keep them smooth</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast and free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Shower&#x27;s not as fun</li>
            <li>I sampled this first and then purchased a larger bottle as I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>Bring the microdelivery into the shower to reveal soft, smooth, healthy-looking skin\\&quot;,  and leaves my skin VERY smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>but it did not react to this product, which makes me super happy because it can be hard sometimes to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Light clean scent and major exfoliation.</li>
            <li>while the exfoliating material (sort of like very fine grains of sand) is not coarse, there is a lot of it in the scrub</li>
            <li>I love the granules that really do make my skin soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Also like that it really does not have a scent!</li>
            <li>First time trying this Philosophy product</li>
            <li>I wanted an exfoliator that would leave my skin soft and smooth and this does the job.</li>
            <li>best thing about Philosophy stuff is that a little goes a very long way-</li>
            <li>If you ever get those little bumps on the backs of your arms or get dry patches on your knees or elbows, this product works great to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>I have an issue with dry skin on my elbows and feet, and this is like magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not coarse, but it really, really makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li>so it really works well without scratching your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>It works very well. . . . . .</li>
            <li>.. . . . . . . . . .  Thanks</li>
            <li>Oh and it seems to be going fast too..</li>
            <li>The lightweight, creamy formula contains a unique blend of natural oils and botanicals to moisturize and help maintain skin&#x27;s natural moisture barrier to improve smoothness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have dry skin because it will wash off all the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Grains are small but effective and can use on my sensitive skin as well as my over exposed arms and legs.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin super soft, and I find I only need to use it once a week</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t live up to the brand.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very soft skin.</li>
            <li>only problem is that they don&#x27;t sell this product in stores in Norway! ;)</li>
            <li>The product does what it says it does, \\&quot;Give your body a complete skin makeover with the microdelivery exfoliating body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for everyday use as it really scrubs deeply, but it leaves your skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>Specifically formulated for the body, it cleanses and gently, evenly exfoliates to remove dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>which is a major accomplishment during the winter.</li>
            <li>It sloughs off dead skin and leaves my body, epecially knees and elbows, really soft, and it&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use 3 times a week.  </li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t large crystals scratching at you, but fine, subtle particles exfoliating your skin delicately</li>
            <li> I use just a small amount on my shower puff daily ( so that I don&#x27;t have to use as much) and the product by itself about once a week</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t soap up that much.</li>
            <li> so even though the price is a little steep compared to body scrubs you&#x27;ll find at the local drugstore, this bottle will last you months, if not a year or so, even with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even helped soothe by dry skin so well that I haven&#x27;t had to use lotion since I got it.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of dry skin from swimming and gardening</li>
            <li> My legs get very dry.  </li>
            <li> (my knees are particularly rough)</li>
            <li> Not much of a scent</li>
            <li> Takes off all the dead dull skin and leaves a shine like new money.</li>
            <li> Works on both face and body - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Extremely please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> faster than other soaps/exfoliators I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is the most boring productive shower gel ever!!</li>
            <li> Also, I mix a small amount with my face cleanser a couple times each week.  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a real fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works well even in hard water, makes your skin tingle with life and elegance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to friends to at least try.</li>
            <li> but at least it does the job.</li>

            <li> This really is one of the best exfoliating body washes I&#x27;ve ever bought. It even helped soothe by dry skin so well that I haven&#x27;t had to use lotion since I got it. Will for sure buy more of this once I run out</li>
            <li> I sampled this first and then purchased a larger bottle as I loved it so much.

It&#x27;s definitely not for everyday use as it really scrubs deeply, but it leaves your skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live up to the brand. It is incredibly coarse! It feels like your grinding your skin with tiny rocks. There&#x27;s no way this is good for any part of the body...and for those who might think it&#x27;s good for the face too, NO WAY!!</li>
            <li> Best on the market. Works on both face and body - a little goes a long way. Also like that it really does not have a scent!</li>
            <li> Love gentle exfoliation of this product, not alot needed to do the job,no excess perfume,natural,clean smell.Margaret Porath</li>

Bring the microdelivery into the shower to reveal soft, smooth, healthy-looking skin\\&quot;,  and leaves my skin VERY smooth and soft!  I highly recommend this product through Amazon.  At places like ULTA you would pay $25.  I like the ease of having it sent to me!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!&lt;br /&gt;PS---do not use on your face!!!</li>
            <li> Light clean scent and major exfoliation.

            <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Love, love this  body wash. It exfoliades you</li>
            <li> Good purchase!  You will love exfoliating those dead cells off your body, and enjoying fresh bright skin.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT scrub- it&#x27;s not coarse, but it really, really makes skin smooth. I get a lot of dry skin from swimming and gardening (my knees are particularly rough) and I really thought I would need a heavy-duty scrub to keep them smooth but because I&#x27;m a fan of Philosophy&#x27;s bath products, I thought I would give this a try before switching brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully- while the exfoliating material (sort of like very fine grains of sand) is not coarse, there is a lot of it in the scrub so it really works well without scratching your skin. The smell is great- very light and clean. It rinses very clean, as well- no leftover grit or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about Philosophy stuff is that a little goes a very long way- so even though the price is a little steep compared to body scrubs you&#x27;ll find at the local drugstore, this bottle will last you months, if not a year or so, even with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the granules that really do make my skin soft but I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a real fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliant with a nice amount of soap.  Love it, recommend it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> First time trying this Philosophy product and I may come to love it.  Not quite as great as Philosophy&#x27;s olive oil body scrub but perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want any scent.  I&#x27;d recommend it to friends to at least try.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub all over every time I take a shower. It leaves my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Philosophy fan. I have never tried the exfoliating body wash and I&#x27;m glad I did. On the day&#x27;s I shave I just use it to exfoliate and not as a wash. It leaves your skin feeling amazing and soft. The perfect product to get your skin ready for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> It was nice but too highly priced for me, scrub from bath and body works better</li>
            <li> Philosophy is a product that its name says its ll but when you get this home, you will see why. I love this product. It makes you feel smooth, clean and well groomed. I love it and will be or ding it every three months like clockwork. I love it. Works well even in hard water, makes your skin tingle with life and elegance. You will love the way your skin feels and looks. Takes off all the dead dull skin and leaves a shine like new money. I am Loving it. Thank Amazon</li>
            <li> Love this. I have an issue with dry skin on my elbows and feet, and this is like magic in a bottle. My skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> Great scent-skin feels soft</li>
            <li> Love the way this cleans.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is the most boring productive shower gel ever!!</li>
            <li> It works very well. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . .  Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this! Not much of a scent and I feel very clean after using. Grains are small but effective and can use on my sensitive skin as well as my over exposed arms and legs. Not greasy, not drying, just right!</li>
            <li> This is a godsend for my skin!  I use it every other day.  Has helped my eczema a lot, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin super soft, and I find I only need to use it once a week so it will last a while! Would definite recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of a magazine recommendation.  My legs get very dry.  I recommend it.  Be careful not to use it near the face.  I made that mistake and took a while to get it out of my eye. LOL.</li>
            <li> This is really the best exfoliating body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s pretty rough (which is a good thing), hardly scented, and very effective! Very soft skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> This body scrub is so amazing. It&#x27;s great if you have dry skin because it will wash off all the dead skin cells. If your looking for something moisturizing I would suggest you look elsewhere. The shipping is fast and free.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  When used in the shower, it&#x27;s convenient to use &amp; sure does the job.  I use the Philosophy Exfoliating Face Wash &amp; it is also a very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it price.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since November.  It does a great job of exfoliating, but I do recommend putting lotion on afterwards.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is the best micro wash you will ever buy! It isn&#x27;t large crystals scratching at you, but fine, subtle particles exfoliating your skin delicately</li>
            <li> I wanted an exfoliator that would leave my skin soft and smooth and this does the job. The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t soap up that much. I wish they would have added in a bit more &#x27;soapiness&#x27; for the sudsy effect but, ah well. Shower&#x27;s not as fun but at least it does the job. Oh and it seems to be going fast too.. faster than other soaps/exfoliators I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Love this and use it to shave my legs.  Works great as shaving gel and makes great preparation for self tanner.  Also, I mix a small amount with my face cleanser a couple times each week.  Great product.</li>
