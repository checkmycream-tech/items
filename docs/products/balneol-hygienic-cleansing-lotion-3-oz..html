            <li>(If there is a lot of material, remove that first.)</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product just to see why it cost so much and planing on re-using the nice small container filled with Cetaphil that I buy in a large pump container.  </li>

            <li> It really make a difference when I am physically active.  </li>
            <li> Applied easier with a tiny wad of toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used other lotions in an effort to find relief but those lotions were not designed for the heavy duty work that this lotion handles very, very well.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle lotion for minor genital irritations; or, just for extra cleanliness.  </li>
            <li> Being 64 years old I am starting to get those little aches and pains that we all know are coming</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Facial Cleansing Lotion works as well as Balneol and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> It will softly remove any remaining material from the sore area and prevent the tissue from pulling at or abrading the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> the spout closed when not in use or it will dry in the spout and plug it slightly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only an extremely small amount required to get results.</li>
            <li> I felt it was pretty expensive though for the size, however I probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I see from the other reviews that a number of people also use it for hemorrhoids -- that makes sense, it&#x27;s just not my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but you use only a tiny amount and a bottle lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it seems expensive to me, but I have used the same 3oz.</li>
            <li> That is the equivalent of trying to wipe thick mud from your car with a dry paper towel.</li>
            <li> Just put a little bit on a cotton ball and place the cotton ball where it needs to do</li>
            <li> and I definitely don&#x27;t want to be putting on broken skin.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested using plain aloe gel, so I might try that.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will purchase it again as it is too expensive to use daily.</li>
            <li> For rectal irritation there is no better.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review base on my first hand experience as someone without a colon anymore and never-ending bowel problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted (comes in discreet packets too).  </li>
            <li> bottle now for about 5 months, so $32 a year, not so bad for the relief offered, and much less expensive than the Tucks pads which contain alcohol - Ouch!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> but if you use it sparingly it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells, looks and feels like Elmer&#x27;s Glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And doesn&#x27;t work for me. The Witch Hazel lotion I ordered seems to work better.</li>
            <li> The best stuff for you know where. Immediate cooling. Works best when teamed with Aquaphor. Balneol inside, Aquaphor outside.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time.  Great product, Doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> Being 64 years old I am starting to get those little aches and pains that we all know are coming but hope they are still in the future. One of those problems is the irritation and burning that happens after bowel movements. My doctor recommended that I begin using this lotion to sooth those irritations and it really works. I&#x27;d used other lotions in an effort to find relief but those lotions were not designed for the heavy duty work that this lotion handles very, very well. I have a bottle of this in each of my bathrooms. And I can take one with me as I travel on business since it meets TSA requirments for lotion size. It is flip to say, but \\&quot;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great for everything anally related.</li>
            <li> Best for butt cleaning. Creamy &amp; no irritation.</li>
            <li> It works and keeps that area spanking clean.  The only donwside is the cost but if you use it sparingly it&#x27;s not too bad.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle lotion for minor genital irritations; or, just for extra cleanliness.  There&#x27;s only an extremely small amount required to get results. It&#x27;s great to have on hand! Be sure to follow the instructions to get the most out of its use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member who has problems with itch.  His doctor recommended this and the itch has greatly improved.  He feels this works much better than medicated wipes which can be drying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.This is the second bottle I have bought,it is a great product that really works.Fast service. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> No other cleaning solution on the market that compare to this one.  Perfect cleaner lotion and do not irritates the skin</li>
            <li> Nice to have in any bathroom. Works great.</li>
            <li> I like using this better than buying cleansing cloths.  Works well for daily use.  Definitely recommend for personal use and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have IBS and frankly, my life (ahem!) cannot be the same without it. It really make a difference when I am physically active.  Just put a little bit on a cotton ball and place the cotton ball where it needs to do it&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of fine product.</li>
            <li> There is no other product like this on the market that I know of. This is the best solution for irritation &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve never found anything else that works as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Find it really works very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it works very, very well for flare-ups of anal pain (hemorrhoids and/or irritation from retching or diarrhea).  I understand what the 3-star rater (A. Hankins) means, but it&#x27;s just not the case.  This stuff works better to soothe and helps clean at the same time than any other cream or lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  Ingredients are safe and there is no greasy or oily feeling afterward.  I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a colorectal surgeon.  This OTC product makes a sore tush hurt less during and after wiping and gets it clean without scrubbing. But it is no substitute for medical attention if it doesn&#x27;t provide immediate relief!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by brand prior to a colonoscopy.  It really is a wonderful protecting lotion and anti-irritant.  I&#x27;ve used it on cracked heels and hands and on chapped bits here and there on babies and me.  It really is a marvelous lotion...</li>
            <li> Very soothing, not scented at all.  Definitely a blessing to have during those &amp;#34;tummy trouble&amp;#34; times.</li>
            <li> Great for men and women.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin or irritations in your &#x27;areas&#x27; .</li>
            <li> For some reason, I forgot to look at the ingredients list before buying. First off, it&#x27;s got parabens in it, which is a no-no ([...] and I definitely don&#x27;t want to be putting on broken skin. It also has lanolin, which is the oil from sheep&#x27;s wool, which is just sort of gross. Either way, I will use up this bottle and then try something else. A friend of mine suggested using plain aloe gel, so I might try that.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001MSET8I Balneol Hygienic Cleansing Lotion, 3 oz.]] - I purchased this product from Amazon.  The product is soothing and excellent for sensitive areas &amp; skin, but it is way too expensive to use on a regular basis. Cetaphil Facial Cleansing Lotion works as well as Balneol and costs a lot less. I am not sure if I will purchase it again as it is too expensive to use daily.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from a rectal prolapse and I use this for cleaning.  It does not burn and cleans well.  I really like it a lot.  It isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> I had never heard or used this product before I tried it.  It is THE BEST THING for a fast and easy way to keep yourself hygenically clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for both male and females&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest you checkout the Balneol Hygienic Cleansing Lotion Convenience Packets for use when travelling.</li>
            <li> The use is obvious . . .  I&#x27;m addicted (comes in discreet packets too).  I don&#x27;t not know how any human is clean without this.  That is the equivalent of trying to wipe thick mud from your car with a dry paper towel. No itching, no smell, chicks will think you are the cleanest guy they ever met . . . and you actually will be :)</li>
            <li> Best thing for sore behind ever made.  Started using it to prep for colonoscopy .</li>
            <li> I have used this for years on the advice of my doctor. Yes it is expensive, but you use only a tiny amount and a bottle lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion soothes quickly and works all day. For rectal irritation there is no better. No bad odor. Applied easier with a tiny wad of toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the spout closed when not in use or it will dry in the spout and plug it slightly.</li>
            <li> Well if you are looking for temporary relief, this is good but it will not take the problem away.  Talk to your doctor about your specific problem.  I did and was given Diflucan and asked to take Align Probiotics and this solved the problem for good.  Sometimes understanding the problem/causes or reason why your body is doing what it is doing is a much better way to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product just to see why it cost so much and planing on re-using the nice small container filled with Cetaphil that I buy in a large pump container.  I was not at all sold on this product, yes it is nice but so is Cetaphil for a fraction of the cost. I am a daily user so cost is important to me.  This product falls short on delivering value.</li>
            <li> This product provides cleansing relief and was delivered promptly at a very competitive price. I recommend it to all who need such a product.</li>
            <li> Soothing. best healing for ANY private region?....sitz bath!!! THAT worked REALLY well. This cream is easily absorbed and is not at all greasy. Didn&#x27;t work as miracle cure.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Balneol Hygienic cleansing lotion. Would purchase again if needed.Very soothing, cleaned well. felt clean after use.</li>
            <li> When i use the restroom and want to have some extra freshness, this is my best friend. rather than using soap and water in a public restroom, this actually feels like you have extra cleanliness because it does have like a powdery scent.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Soothing cream. I felt it was pretty expensive though for the size, however I probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to wipes</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! Remmber, whatever she loves, I love!  She deserves only the best and that is what she got from Balneol!</li>
            <li> Everyone should have this stuff right next to the toilet. Silky and cooling. Cleans pretty well too. I wish they made a purse sized option.</li>
            <li> This lotion comes in this bottle which I keep at home and packets which I keep in a toiletry bag in my purse. It is the absolute best product for its intended use and for those who need it. Please note, if the skin is already too abraded, a sitz bath and water is the only thing that should be used -- Never use any soaps or cleansing solutions in this situation. I am writing this review base on my first hand experience as someone without a colon anymore and never-ending bowel problems. I see from the other reviews that a number of people also use it for hemorrhoids -- that makes sense, it&#x27;s just not my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this lotion when I am soiled and sore from leakage or a full accident by simply putting some of this on toilet tissue. (If there is a lot of material, remove that first.) It will softly remove any remaining material from the sore area and prevent the tissue from pulling at or abrading the delicate skin. It will also leave behind a little of the lotion -- do not try to clean it all off, this is also good for the skin in that area. Just make sure that most of the soiled matter is removed. There is something in this lotion that also help to neutralize the stinging/burning that is left behind and it works great!  if you have sore skin and frequent diarrhea get this and a tube of Calmoseptine Ointment right away and get feeling better fast!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my proctologist. MUCH better than Tucks. Only downside is that it seems expensive to me, but I have used the same 3oz. bottle now for about 5 months, so $32 a year, not so bad for the relief offered, and much less expensive than the Tucks pads which contain alcohol - Ouch!</li>
