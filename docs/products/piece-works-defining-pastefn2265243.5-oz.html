            <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hair product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it !!</li>
            <li>Excellent product I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a wonderful product and I have been using it every day since my first pixie cut in July of 2009.</li>
            <li>It is great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>So easy to use...easy to take for travel too!</li>
            <li>Most pastes end up making my hair look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;, but Eufora&#x27;s defining paste does not.</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can purchase it from you.  </li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>This the best for short hair style!</li>
            <li>I love this styling paste.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for control without the stiff control of hairspray, this is the perfect product.  </li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy it for much cheaper on amazon than I could from my salon in town.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the front out of my eyes, the sides piecey, and the top spikey.....as lilltle or as much as I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it in salons around where I live now, so I was glad to find it on line.  </li>
            <li>Been using defining paste for several years, love it!  </li>
            <li>I use it on wet hair and my curls are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job holding my hair all day, but does not leave my hair stiff or feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>sent right away, and it is as advertised.</li>
            <li>hair stylist used this in my hair after my first pixie hair cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add more later to refresh or change your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and still love it.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you that I really don&#x27;t like messing with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>She knows me well and told me it would really work for me....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t feel it in your hair and it really holds.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Had new packaging, so it needs an updated photo!</li>
            <li>this product is a great base product to help give fine hair some depth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually spend this much on hair products, but this is worth it!</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and although this paste may seem heavy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lightweight (can&#x27;t feel it in my hair), looks natural</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re full and thick.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine &amp; thin but it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>

            <li> My hair is fine &amp; thin but it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it when I had short hair and use it now with my long hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has thick hair and wants some separation &amp; definition to hair.  </li>
            <li> always looks natural and there is never any slick or greasy look or feel to</li>
            <li> It was as expected but rather pricey.  </li>
            <li> I rub it between my hands, put it on wet hair, blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have blonde, relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li> It allows my hair to have body; the chunky look; does not weigh down my hair either.</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut and this holds my style but is not crunchy and not weighted down at all.</li>
            <li> Gives it bill and body without weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> (tousle your hair after it dries), smells nice, doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair or get nasty.</li>
            <li> just a little dab will do you...ha!  </li>
            <li> Annoying but not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and is what she had been looking for and was unable to find until it was spotted on the website</li>

            <li> This is my second bottle. I really like it.  My hair is fine &amp; thin but it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li> this product is a great base product to help give fine hair some depth.</li>
            <li> It was as expected but rather pricey.  Wife likes it and is what she had been looking for and was unable to find until it was spotted on the website</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I was able to buy it for much cheaper on amazon than I could from my salon in town.  I have a pixie cut and this holds my style but is not crunchy and not weighted down at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day on the front of my hair (only a pea sized amount).  Keeps the hair off my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight (can&#x27;t feel it in my hair), looks natural (tousle your hair after it dries), smells nice, doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair or get nasty. Lasts for around 2-3 days if I don&#x27;t wash my hair but still washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that pump doesn&#x27;t work, I dropped the bottle or something. Now I just removed the bottom and dig it out from there. Annoying but not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you that I really don&#x27;t like messing with my hair.  That&#x27;s why I have a  &amp;#34;Jamie Lee Curtis&amp;#34; style pixie hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist used this in my hair after my first pixie hair cut.  She knows me well and told me it would really work for me....just a little dab will do you...ha!  She was right!  It keeps the front out of my eyes, the sides piecey, and the top spikey.....as lilltle or as much as I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add more later to refresh or change your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always looks natural and there is never any slick or greasy look or feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product and I have been using it every day since my first pixie cut in July of 2009.</li>
            <li> The tiniest dab is all that&#x27;s needed. I rub it between my hands, put it on wet hair, blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent right away, and it is as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is great for my fine hair. Gives it bill and body without weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> Very nice hair product!</li>
            <li> Been using defining paste for several years, love it!  Glad to see I can purchase it from you.  Didn&#x27;t think about looking but glad I did.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for control without the stiff control of hairspray, this is the perfect product.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in salons around where I live now, so I was glad to find it on line.  Nothing you can buy in the store can compare.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years-great stuff not sticky! Can&#x27;t feel it in your hair and it really holds. A little pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li> Had new packaging, so it needs an updated photo! But still the same product!!!</li>
            <li> This the best for short hair style! So easy to use...easy to take for travel too! Used this product for years!</li>
            <li> it actually comes to you in a bigger tube instead of this pump which controls the amount you use even more.&lt;br /&gt;Great for short unrly hair</li>
            <li> Got this product at the suggestion of my hairdresser.  It does a great job holding my hair all day, but does not leave my hair stiff or feeling sticky.  A little dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and although this paste may seem heavy it isn&#x27;t and it works very well.  I have used this for several years and still love it.</li>
            <li> I love this styling paste. I use it on wet hair and my curls are gorgeous.  They&#x27;re full and thick.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I really enjoy it. Allows you to style your hair while still maintaining a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; look. Would definitely recommend</li>
