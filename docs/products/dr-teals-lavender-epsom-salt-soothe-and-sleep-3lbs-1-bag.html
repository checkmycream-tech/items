            <li>Love epsom salt with the lavender scent--</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re probably better off just storing your salt in a tupperware.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, could have a more lavender.</li>

            <li>I enjoyed using it after work</li>
            <li>But I received Dr. Teal&#x27;s LavenderEpsom Salt  free for my own opinion and review from smiley360.com , and took a bath and soaked in it</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it really relaxes your muscles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stocking up for sure.</li>
            <li>Used in bath rituals for thousands of years, Lavender soothes and relaxes your mind and body for a more restful sleep experience.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this bath salt.</li>
            <li>I love the lavender bath salts.</li>
            <li>After doing my own research about the product, I became more excited to experience the benefits of Epsom salt.</li>
            <li>, I took a nice hot bath with Dr Teal&#x27;s and let me tell you that I was able to move when I got out!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very nice scent, and really relaxes me.</li>
            <li>and I really wasn&#x27;t very thrilled about putting in my bath water</li>
            <li>I find the smell nice and strong so if Lavender smell is not your thing, this may be overly strong smell.</li>
            <li>So the smell is strong but kind of strong</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than a bath after a long day at the office and having epsom salt and lavender smells added to the bath just makes it that much more incredible!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The incorporated lavender scent is a nice touch; I liked and used it a lot when I first discovered it.</li>

            <li>I received this product for free complimentary of Smiley360 to give my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li>It is a strong lavender smell, but when diluted with water, it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>The scent seems a bit strong if you smell it from the bag, but once it hits the water it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>It has a strong lavender smell :x</li>
            <li>I cannot stand soaking in too strong of perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I like the strong odor</li>
            <li>I wanted something scented but not too strong.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s dissolved in water, it doesnt smell so strong.</li>
            <li>It gave me a headache because it was so strong</li>
            <li>When I opened the bag i was amazed at the strong calming scent.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong lavender scents then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>The lavender is strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>i was like whew this scent is strong.</li>
            <li>i will add though that it is a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt when you need help in relieving stress.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong it gave me a headache</li>
            <li>This was a great  addition to my bath, since I suffer from major aches &amp; pains.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A Work get home to a nice hot bath with Dr. TEAL.</li>
            <li>I pour it in a beautiful vintage glass container to make it extra luxe.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself, but when I opened the packaging the box was full of crystals</li>
            <li>cup is all you need in a nice hot bath, then soak away your sore muscles or cares.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lavender and was extremely excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution for free to review.</li>
            <li>So soothing; a great way to relax after a long run. :)</li>
            <li>I filled the bathtub with nice hot water and in went the Dr.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth and smell nice!</li>
            <li>Super relaxing!</li>
            <li>I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li>and I love how quickly it dissolves in the water.</li>
            <li>This was able to melt quickly and provide a light aroma that was soothing.</li>
            <li>, what I have been doing is just filling a large bowl with warm water and the Epsom salt, for a foot soak.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Epsom salt especially while pregnant, now I will use it when my feet are not swollen!!</li>
            <li>Why add synthetic fragrance when it smelled great and worked fine with just the essential oils?!</li>
            <li>However, it was very relaxing in the bath, it smelled nice, and I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li>But my experience just took a huge boost when I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of soaking at the end of the day with a glass of wine (I know, cliche...)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge, HUGE fan.  </li>
            <li>HUGE fan.</li>

            <li>Fabulous and relaxing product.  </li>
            <li>I was more of a bubble bath person and rarely used Epsom Salt.</li>
            <li>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I just sat and enjoy the smell for a while,</li>
            <li>wife loves it, i enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth skin feel when used as a body scrub but  the lavender smell is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll light a candle, turn off the light, close the door, turn on some zen music (like air) or a meditation app (like Mindfulness, or anything from Andrew Johnson) and just soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes the water smell and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big believer in Epsom Salts and these work great.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to relax and spend moments in stress free peace.  </li>
            <li>When that wasn&#x27;t available I tried Dr. Teal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is a great product but not at over double the cost.</li>
            <li>so you sleep soundly.</li>

            <li>and my skin is so soft and smooth and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I felt all around better and actually got a good night sleep</li>
            <li>Even my 10yr old daughter asks me everytime she takes a bath if i could putt some of that good smelling salt stuff in her bath water.  </li>
            <li>You get a large amount for a really decent price and they smell great.  </li>
            <li>Actually plain Epsom salts works but Dr. Teals has the best Lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is just the right amount, not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of it, and it does work, it puts me in sleeping mode right away.</li>

            <li>I was worried when I opened the bag because the smell was super strong and took my breath.</li>
            <li>The salt melts so easily and quickly</li>
            <li>It eases the tension in my muscles and allows me to be stress free right before i hop in bed!</li>
            <li>and I had forgotten how wonderful it is, especially for someone with a very busy life.</li>
            <li>You simply run a very warm bath tub full of water and add them to it.  </li>
            <li>Being a quite tall guy, this is a great excuse to soak in the tub and relax.</li>

            <li>Not only was the scent wonderful and not overbearing, I came out of the bath feeling calm and it was very helpful with my aches and pains.</li>
            <li>Used to soak feet great stress reliever after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, although it can be overpowering at first.</li>
            <li>I love that there are SO many uses including facial care :)  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.</li>
            <li>Instead of trying to take a hot shower to feel better, I fill the tub with this soothing salt and soak for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Im always excited to get my water read and add in the salts.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a detox soak my sister-in-law</li>
            <li>A great way to relax after a long day.</li>
            <li>Excellent for foot bath, and very gentle but healing and will purchase more eventually in the near future or when this runs-dry...</li>
            <li>I have so much stress even on my easy days!</li>
            <li>I LOVED the lavender scent, it filled the entire bathroom of the peaceful smell which made relaxing before getting into the tub every more</li>
            <li>A great way to unwind after a long day!</li>
            <li>I got this for free for the purpose of reviewing it from Smiley360 and was pleasantly surprised, and all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>The essential oil is lavender, my favorite, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to smiley360 I was able to this the product for free</li>
            <li>I have to work out in the field a lot for my job and visit some not so clean houses.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet super smooth and relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love lavender, and this smells very fresh just like real lavender.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying epsom salt ever, and i love how it makes me soo relaxed and makes my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft, and I enjoy the fact that Epsom salt has detoxifying properties in it as well!!</li>
            <li>First off it soothes all my aches &amp; pains after a long night at work, &amp; it has a awesome lavender scent which makes it easier to fall fast asleep!</li>
            <li>The soothing epsom salt was so nice after a long day of work and the lavender smell really helped to relax me for a good night sleep.</li>
            <li>Aside from other salts I&#x27;ve tried, Dr Teal&#x27;s has a great smell that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I am not completely sold on the smell yet since it is a bit strong, but it is great to pour into a hot shower in the morning and rub on your skin.</li>
            <li>oh so special.</li>
            <li>and I will most certainly purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to unwind at the end of the day :)  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>The Epsom salts make my body feel so soft &amp; my sore feet feel amazing after climbing out of the tub.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it soothes any aches and pains I may have had and pretty much eliminates them because by the time I get out</li>
            <li>When I get out of the tub, my muscles are more relaxed, I am more calm and refreshed, and my skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li>my whole family is happier for it since I get a better nights sleep after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s turned me from a shower only girl to one who loves a good bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep it in a cool cabinet in the bathroom to avoid the headache</li>
            <li>From a price stand point, you really get so much more bang for your buck with the Epsom Salt.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the relaxing scent and it did feel very soothing.</li>
            <li>so I love the Lavender scent because it is really calming.</li>
            <li>I loved the insert that came with My SmileyKit that showed all of the different uses for Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is lovely and very soothing/relaxing.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with oz naturals sweet almond and macadamia nut body butter.  </li>
            <li>i just wish amazon had better stock, because i really like them and want to have them on hand.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed so much while soaking my body.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried this it relaxed my whole body and let me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I headed straight to the drug store and bought more</li>
            <li>Smells good, but found at my local grocery store for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that there are so many uses for Epsom salt that I never would have guessed.</li>
            <li>Then again I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks Bath and Body Works is nightmare come true</li>
            <li>This stuff has many uses and its reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>It is true that the bag doesn&#x27;t seal correctly after opening, but I store it upright, so this is a non-issue to me.</li>
            <li>Love it, its very relaxing, I sleep well after soaking my feet.</li>
            <li>Family loved it so this was a re-order in a larger size to save $$</li>
            <li>and a full time college schedule</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who said the scent is unbelievably strong and not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite brands of epsom salt; if the strong \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; smell is not what you&#x27;re going for however, this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Personally, the smell was perfect once combined with the hot bath water but of coarse on its own can be very over powering.</li>
            <li>I really love soaking in a warm tub worth epsom salts after a long day.</li>
            <li>love taking a relaxing bath here and there, and this is a new staple for me!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, and I was using this product within a day of ordering it.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I run out quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it a lot when I was pregnant, to soak my feet in.  </li>
            <li>I started using this when I was pregnant with my son and having contractions around 29 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I have become a loyal customer</li>
            <li>Not only do I love this product but my kiddos keep asking for me to add it to their bath:)</li>
            <li>Tremendous product.</li>
            <li>The salts dissolved quickly, and I let the soothing scent engulf me as I relaxed into that bath.</li>
            <li>dissolved in warm water, magnesium sulfate is absorbed through the skin, naturally restoring the level of magnesium in the body</li>
            <li>this Amazon is quite high, they can be purchased for about $5 at many retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is a bit pricey, but you know how the saying goes - you get what you pay for and sometimes you deserve to pay a little more for a great treat like this!</li>
            <li>I enjoy a hot bath with the lavender salt in the evening time</li>
            <li>I have used other Epsom salt baths, and this Lavender Soaking solution from Dr. Teal&#x27;s is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Although I normally would buy the Espom salt cheaper at a grocery store, I love the lavender scent and the convenience of having it delivered to my door step.</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try the Lavender Epsom salt for free thanks to smiley 360!</li>
            <li>The scent is very potent and hits you the moment you open the bag</li>
            <li>I loved using it after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>For me, a hot bath at the end of a hard day is the best way to relax.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it in a bath after a long day and it&#x27;s very relaxing and smells great.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the scent is a nice, natural &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The salts dissolve easily and it is very soothing on sore muscles.</li>
            <li>I recently tried for the first time and I was amazed on how good I felt after using.</li>
            <li>I use more than is recommended in the instructions, pouring straight from the bag into the hot water as it fills my tub.</li>
            <li>It is really strong smelling, but I really like lavender.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite ways to unwind after a long day, a hot bath with Dr. Teal&#x27;s lavender epsom salt; perfect for sore muscles and insomniac nights and every other stressful thing life can throw at you.</li>
            <li>This product delivers exactly what is promises!  </li>
            <li>After using them, I felt so relaxed and serene, I was ready for bed!!  </li>
            <li>the salt not only helps you destress it also helps with sore muscles and helps you sleep better at night!</li>
            <li>Teal&#x27;s soaking solutions and they all work equally as well, however lavender is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It really does help to sooth over exerted muscles and helps soreness tremendously!</li>
            <li>Dr. Teal is a great brand and their product is of a high standard, both to sooth aching feet and to help you sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li>It helps calm my aching muscles</li>
            <li>It also gives me a sense of calm just by smelling them.</li>
            <li>I received this free from Smiley360 to sample , it left me smelling so good and feeling my skin soo soft.</li>
            <li>After soaking in the Epson salts I am so relaxed and calm.</li>
            <li>The bag suggests that you use 2-cups per soak, but I&#x27;ve found that a few tablespoons works great.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and the scent is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It smells so lovely and my skin is soft after the bath.</li>
            <li>If my feet could smile they would.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I dont think it helped with my back pain though, but it was relaxing and nice to get away</li>
            <li>THe next morning, fully expecting sore muscles, I was surprised that I felt great.</li>
            <li>I always try to do something natural like this before resorting to taking analgesics and this does the trick most of the time on my aches and pains.</li>
            <li>I happened to get my most recent bag for free from Smiley360 to review.</li>
            <li>The smell is so powerful.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and wait.</li>
            <li>No big thing, but nice to toss a handful into my bath for aromatherapy benefits.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Anyone with a sensitive nose wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it.</li>
            <li>but it honestly relaxed me instantly once getting in the water.</li>
            <li>We had a busy weekend sports wedding and nature walI love the calming effect the scent had on me.</li>
            <li>It made not only my bathroom, but the area near my bathroom, the living room smell great.</li>
            <li>I rarely have time to take a bath</li>
            <li>The combination is such a nice soothing and calming experience.</li>
            <li>The so called zipper that is on product to keep fresh didn&#x27;t work, as the granules stay in the track and prevent it from sealing.</li>
            <li>I was eager to use this salt because I love Lavender and find it very relaxing as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps the body regulate over 325 enzymes and plays an important role in many bodily functions, like muscle control, energy production and the elimination of harmful toxins.</li>
            <li>While both magnesium and sulfate can be absorbed through the stomach, studies show soaking in a bath enriched with Epsom salt increases magnesium levels.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great right before bed if you have trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li>Smells good and seems to be comparable to other brands on the market.</li>
            <li>Our mothers and grandmothers did it right.</li>
            <li>I feel right to sleep</li>
            <li>I feel so relaxed I can fall right asleep.  </li>
            <li>But I did not go right to sleep like my friend, but I have sleep issues anyway.</li>
            <li>bUT they were right on about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was so right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, if you are going to use this for sore muscles, you have found the right product.</li>
            <li>After a ten mile run on Banks-Vernonia Trail, five miles of which was all uphill, I started a nice hot bath, dissolved a cup of salts, and settled myself in for a  relaxing</li>
            <li>So highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>long days on my feet it smells amazing and relaxes my feet.</li>
            <li>I suffer extreme muscle and nerve pain on occasion and a good hot soak and Dr.</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that I used the salts the first time after an 8 hour trip to Longwood Gardens, walking around on my feet all day, and the salt soak took the soreness right out of</li>
            <li>These salts smell amazing and helped me relax in a hot bath after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>More economical when purchased at a big box store.</li>
            <li>However, I think the scent could be more potent as it went away within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Great to bathe in before bedtime too, as the scent and overall soothing experience is enough to make you want to pass out.</li>
            <li>As far as Epsom salt goes, I would say this does its job very well, however the lavender scent was extremely overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>It is a nice big bag, and you don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the lavender to soothe my aching muscles and get soft skin at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to dr teals Epsom salt all I need for a fixer upper is a nice hot bath with a few scoops of the amazing salt!</li>
            <li>A nice hot soak with these helps soothe my muscles and get me ready for the next workout!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I mixed about 2 cups of Epsom salt with a half tub of hot water, I could smell the great lavender scent as soon as I opened the package and it dissolved immediately into the water releasing a fine fragrant.</li>
            <li>The quality is still very much up to par and it is something I&#x27;m going to continue to use.</li>
            <li>, I switched to using only a single cup of the product, and I liked it much better.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, relaxing, though it could be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li>It relieved all of my aches and pains without me having to take multiple advil pms or extra strength tylenols, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I really like this Epsom salt!</li>
            <li>I had s very stressful week and decided to give this a try and it helped me relax!</li>
            <li>Stressed mind from work and achy muscles from intense workouts are all relieved with Dr. Teals Epsom Salt!</li>
            <li>The aroma is very calming before i even get into the tub!</li>
            <li>It really does the job!</li>
            <li>The scent is relaxing and it does help for a peaceful night.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a fantastic, relaxing bath experience without bubbles!</li>
            <li>I love the soothing relaxation feeling that Teal&#x27;s bath salts give, I definitely will buy and use.</li>
            <li>I did notice a lot of improvement after my first bath with epsom salts just relaxing my muscles.</li>
            <li>decided to try Dr. Teal epsom salt and lots of hot water.</li>
            <li>At this point, this is the only thing that can upgrade our crappy, american-style-apartment bathtub into a marginally respectable spa night alone.</li>
            <li>I understand price increases but cant accept an increase that is more than double.</li>
            <li>After hearing many suggestions to use epsom ssalt for my back problems, I decided to order Dr. Teals products and give it a try.</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time using it</li>
            <li>The smell can be overpowering at first</li>
            <li>Just grab a handful and throw it under the hot running water while your bath fills up.</li>
            <li>i love that they come in multiple scent options.</li>
            <li>I work five days a week.so on a friday i put this in my hot tub and relax.will</li>
            <li>definitely buy more cause</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about Epsom Salt baths, but the added touch of Lavender makes this even more soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>used to be able to get this product at my local grocery store for $5.99 for a three pound bag.</li>
            <li>After using this product i can honestly say it has helped a lot, maybe its because i usually dont use anything for my sore muscles, but it helps me feel more normal</li>
            <li>Not only am I a fan of because its has lavender in it, which is my favorite, but it also relieves me of all my aches and pain.</li>
            <li>I really Like Dr. Teals Epsom salts!</li>
            <li>I have used it several more times both in my bath, and just as a foot soak.</li>
            <li>so many different varietiesI remember when it was just unsented</li>
            <li>Very soothing in itself!</li>
            <li>and yes, it is very relaxing!</li>
            <li>I’m planning to use it as a hair volumizer next Time :)</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li>I felt after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I read the label and the first thing on the label was perfume.</li>
            <li>I will be using Dr Teals very often!</li>
            <li>Taking one point off because she wasn&#x27;t able to seal it back up because salt got in the ziplock.</li>
            <li>Makes taking  bath so much soothing!</li>
            <li>But I tried it out and poured a bit into my hot bath water....</li>
            <li>I will difinitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>All i have to do is add 2 cups of the salt to my hot bath water and soak for 20 min.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, I was stressed that day.</li>
            <li>My skin became soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will be recommending this to friends and buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I really felt the soreness without it..and the smell is sooo relaxing!</li>
            <li>Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt in my bath revitalized my achy muscles and provided much needed relief!</li>
            <li>During my first use of the salts, I followed the directions exactly, and I found that after soaking for 10 or so minutes in the tub, I began getting freakishly thirsty.</li>
            <li>I have used Dr Teals Epsom SALT SOAKING SOLUTION &amp; the FOARMING BATH but have not been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li>Though well-written, there was nothing in the characters nor the plot that kept me interested.</li>
            <li>This product smells more like CK1 than actual lavender oil!  </li>
            <li>I ran a hot bath and put some in.</li>
            <li>Epsom salt, hot water, baking soda, ginger, and lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Scent is a very personal preference, so if you LOVE lavender, I would say, give it a try.</li>
            <li>The following week I tried again but with just a 2/3 cup and was able to have a relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li>would definitely recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The directions say to use two cups of the Epsom salts to a foot pan and fill with hot water.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better the next day.</li>
            <li>It was only my love of the lavender scent that made me buy this product and think, \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very relaxed after using this in baths!</li>
            <li>The smell is soothing and refreshing, and my entire body feels relaxed after soaking.</li>
            <li>My back pain always feels better after using this and soaking for 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of lavender combined with the soothing Epsom salts just can&#x27;t be beat for a relaxing hot bath.</li>
            <li>I use Epsom Salts on a regular basis, I love them.  </li>
            <li>Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The smell was good and really calmed down once it was out of the bag and dissolved.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be coming back to order more once my supply is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: The bags are bigger than they thought I would be, and are actually a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a really great product and I love how fragrant it is and how it helped me relax after a long hard day.</li>
            <li>So I cant exactly attest to the \\&quot;Sooth and Sleep\\&quot; title on the bag (why only 4 stars and not 5), but it is very relaxing and had my bathroom smelling lovely for a day or two.</li>
            <li>In short, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The chamomile smells very perfumy whereas this one smells more like essential oil.</li>
            <li>The epsom salt really relaxes the sore muscles and the next day I feel much better.</li>
            <li>This really helped my back pain feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and have some arthritis from dancing and this is amazing after a long rehearsal it allows to to relax and to be able to get up the next day.  </li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent of this product but only secondary to the relief I experience when soaking in a nice tub full of it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution because it&#x27;s available in 3 different varieties {the hubby&#x27;s fave-Eucalyptus Spearmint for Relax &amp; Relief, the one I reach for is Chamomile enriched to help calm the body, and there&#x27;s also a version infused with Lavender to help promote a restful night&#x27;s sleep}AND  </li>
            <li>I am an avid gym goer, as much as my schedule allows.</li>
            <li>the end, this made for a very relaxing and peaceful soak in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Soaking and applying this stuff with a hot towel didn&#x27;t quite alleviate all of the pain, but it came very close.  </li>
            <li>did not read my Kindle, was not bored, but was in a VERY peaceful-meditative state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this for relaxing after a long day.</li>
            <li>Everyone can benefit from locking the world and taking long soak in this refreshing scented Epsom Salt and Water.</li>
            <li>and I have had good results taking baths soaking in epsom salts in the past, and this combined the two,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is wonderful...very true to a natural lavender.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my steaming hot, lavender scented epsom salt baths!</li>
            <li>I do wish the packaging was a little easier to pour the product into the tub, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>I think the lavender scent coming from the bathroom puts them right to sleep when normally they would stay awake reading.</li>
            <li>not only smelled wonderful but soaking in the for 2 minutes after work really helped some of my tense muscles in  </li>
            <li>I love using Epsom Salt in the past but never tried the scented ones.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review from Smiley360.Com.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a bit too strong, just buy one bag unscented, one bag scented, and mix them in equal amounts in your bath.</li>
            <li>strong enough but not over powering.</li>
            <li>And this size is large.</li>
            <li>Teal&#x27;s uses pure Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Epsom salt is a pure mineral compound of magnesium sulfate in crystal form.</li>
            <li>I was worried with other reviews saying that the smell was super strong</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, but buy it elsewhere, Ulta sells it for less than half this price!</li>
            <li>Very highly scents with lavender.</li>
            <li>At any rate, these bath salts certainly set a relaxing mood, and that was much</li>
            <li>all day!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, a little overpowering but</li>
            <li>I bought a huge bag of this on a whim recently.  </li>
            <li>Very calming and leaves skin feeling</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>IT really relaxed me.</li>
            <li>could smell the lavender the whole time.  </li>
            <li>I do think I slept well afterwards, though I don&#x27;t know how much of that to attribute to this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very sore.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really do think this adds to my relaxation when I add it to my baths.</li>
            <li>and it helps when my body hurts from walking or lifting too much.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this again and would purchase repeatedly!I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>It relieves my achy muscles and the lavender scent is very relaxing. &#x27;</li>
            <li>Recently, I received  this product for free in exchange of my opinion.</li>
            <li>So much in fact that it made my skin itch.  </li>
            <li>Helps swelling and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, and will be telling everyone I know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>My father found them very relaxing when I did his feet in a spa tub.</li>
            <li>Soothing,relaxing I highly recommend for anyone looking a relaxed soak in their bathtub!</li>

            <li>, I have MS and it really relaxed me.</li>
            <li>Recently Smiley360.com gave me the chance to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>This my personal opinion and was not influenced by anyone else or the fact that it was a free product test.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a soothe and sleep Epsom salt which is very needed in my household.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The fragrance was soothing and calming as well, really helped him relax after work.  </li>
            <li>The lavender I have found to be calming and the product itself is very soothing.</li>
            <li>The product created a very relaxing, soothing bath.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so much she fell asleep after getting out of the bath.</li>
            <li>I researched Epsom Salt and the benefits on sore muscles, so I suggested it, not thinking it would really help his swollen and bruised ankle.</li>
            <li>I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li>It really soothes muscle cramps too..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and it really has helped my relax.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>but I did enjoy the Epsom salts and will try a different scent instead.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering, but it stays on your skin the whole day.</li>
            <li>The bag doesn&#x27;t re-seal very well--</li>
            <li>Not just bearable, but really, truly relaxed and content.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I found myself very relaxed in my alone time at the bath for almost an hour.  </li>
            <li>The scent was very relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soothing for the skin with its organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I can say it works very well.</li>
            <li>I add them to my bath and its really relaxing.  </li>
            <li>but my son was telling me how much it helps his athletes for</li>
            <li>Was hoping the salt would more completely dissolve in the bath water, but it left quite a bit of residue in the tub.  </li>
            <li>I had to back to buying unscented Epsom salts and manually add my own lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a lot of different soaking products and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since then, however, I prefer to buy unscented Epsom salt and add my own essential oils - this way I can experiment with several fragrances.</li>
            <li>He had a sound sensitivity, he was shaking his head non-stop when he heard a microwave or vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li>First, the scent is heavenly and very soothing, the granules are much smaller than others I have tried and dissolve quickly in the tub</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am in complete disbelief at how I am feeling right now.</li>
            <li>Not to mention Dr Teals has many other fragrances, and his product really works.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but it is regularly too much money (the item + shipping) that I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy it this way, I would purchase at local store where I don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfect, the same stuff I bought at target but was too lazy to go back.</li>
            <li>other than that i love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the lavender smell too, which is extremely relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have had better experiences with other brands.</li>
            <li>Much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>two cups is one third to one half of the 3 lb bag, so you will go through this pretty quickly if you take more than one bath in it a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly love this for relaxing after a busy long day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference afterwards but that&#x27;s probably because I didn&#x27;t stay in the tub as long as directed.</li>
            <li>I use this to ease sore muscles after a long day, to relax and enjoy the heavenly scent of lavender.</li>
            <li>Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I soaked in the water and salt solution until the water started to cool off, and I noticed that my aches were starting to subside</li>
            <li>Soaking in a hot tub with these natural salts is soothing and also draws out toxins.  </li>
            <li>I feel pretty ripped off as far as ordering it thru amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it with your normal beauty products really kicks them up a notch.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is frequently out of stock in our local market - as always I can depend on Amazon to have what I need and ship it quickly!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know there is so many other ways to use it!</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I liked the overpowering lavender scent, especially being pregnant.  </li>
            <li>love that the salt grains are finer than typical Epsom salts</li>
            <li>I did feel more relaxed after my bath and less stressed.</li>
            <li>Lavender is one of my favorite flowers and although the scent is diluted in large bodies of water (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), it&#x27;s definitely relaxing to use this after a long day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for new mamas!</li>
            <li>I really like the lavender smell and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Every single part of my body ached and I didn&#x27;t think I would ever stop hurting, then I remembered the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution that I was sent to review for free by Smiley 360.  </li>
            <li>So yes after the first week , I was so sore, achy, and tensed from the major change!</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>It is so relaxing and makes my skin feel so soft!!</li>
            <li>Lavender is such a soothing cent and added to a hot bath it is heavenly!</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; Epsom salt baths, but it was hard to find ones that were already scented that I liked.</li>
            <li>As  a mom who doesnt get much alone time I used this product to give me my own personal little getaway/spa feeling.</li>
            <li>The salts makes the water soft and the lavender scent is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my bath water so soft and the Lavender scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>This definitely seems more of a natural aromatic oil used and soaking with it in the bath tub definitely helps me relax.</li>
            <li>This is such a rare treat for me as I dont find any time to soak up.</li>
            <li>Just pour a cup in your bath and light a few candles and you will be having a peaceful soak in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty energetic person, and this was a slow run for me.</li>
            <li>I usually suffer from mild back pain, having a desk job and sitting most of the day will do that.</li>
            <li>Such a good alternative to plain Epsom salt!</li>
            <li>With the addition of lavender, this bath salt helps you to relax enough to fall asleep right after you get out.</li>
            <li>Pictured below, left to right:</li>
            <li>After a long week of moving I enjoyed a nice long soak to relieve my achy muscles and to wash away the hard work and stress.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loved the smell and how the Epsom salt worked magic on her sore muscles after a long day of being on her feet cutting hair.</li>
            <li>There is just something naturally soothing about a hot bath, and adding the aromatherapy just made it almost heavenly, however the aches and pains of my first long run in a while, kept me grounded on earth.</li>
            <li>I use this anytime I feel beat from work or exercise and feel brand new afterwards.</li>
            <li>We live in a desert.</li>
            <li>Very calming, used in a bath, it helped me sleep, relieved my aches, and the smell of the essential oil takes bathing to a whole new level of relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it makes my silver necklace slightly tarnish if I wear it in the tub with this in it, but solution to that is easy.</li>
            <li>I also love soaking in it after a long day of work and a long day of teaching dance.</li>
            <li>It has really been a big help in getting me relaxed and ready for bed in the evening.</li>
            <li>The product works decently, but you can get it elsewhere for far cheaper.</li>
            <li>The salt has numerous uses, but I like to use it as a bath soak and mixed with some body wash as an exfoliater.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>Still a great product, just irritating that I had to vacuum after opening the package.</li>
            <li>I will use plain Epsom and add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li>using this in my bath helped heal my skin and keep my skin soft for days afterwards!</li>
            <li>(I usually get calgon, but kmart didn&#x27;t have my favorite scent; but I saw on the shelf</li>
            <li>I think it actually work the first time.</li>
            <li>Once I got it mixed in with the hot bathwater</li>
            <li>Initially, I was not sure what to expect from this product, but I have since discovered that I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to use this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>But the next day after the first Epsom salt bath he stopped paying attention to those sounds.</li>
            <li>I am a nursing student with a two year old!</li>
            <li>I struggled to relax for the first ten minutes (again, my inability to sit still was kicking in)</li>
            <li>However, I have found the amazon price is a bit higher than the $5 cost at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li>Thank God I had the solution to soak my aching body in that evening; not only does the smell soothe you, but the Epsom salt really helps with relaxing your muscles and making you feel like you could face another session!</li>
            <li>After doing a few 5k runs my legs and feet get sore and after soaking in a warm bath with this salt my tired aching muscles felt so much better.  </li>
            <li>For me, the lavender scent in this product is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>I used them after a 7-mile long hike, and my husband used them after a 100-mile bike ride, and both were fine the next day, no sore muscles, no pains whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently, I started a new workout at a boxing facility that literally works EVERY part of your body, leaving you completely sore and feeling out of commission after the first session.</li>
            <li>After being in the lake and covered in sun screen half the summer, my skin has become rough, sticky and just an overwhelming feeling of being not scrub a dub clean - even though I shower daily.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and your body feeling less tense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few friends have used this brand in the past and have great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my tired feet feel, I also really like the ways iit smells!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I still have half the bag left.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and you only need to use half of the recommended measurement.</li>
            <li>These bath salts quickly soothed my tired, aching feet and made my skin feel silky smooth after.</li>
            <li>Excited to try some of the other scents!</li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Teals Epsom Salts and have used it several times to relax and clear the stress!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and to me seems just as good as the expensive stuff!!</li>
            <li>I expected, given the price, for the smell to be faint, but it is a very good quality salt.  </li>
            <li>so I could put it in a clear decanter in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t make me break out in the bath.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>By far the deepest level of relaxation I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li>It could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I would not waste the money buying it here.</li>
            <li>Did not smell natural but chemical.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this again, thanks for introducing me to it.</li>
            <li>Dr. Teal&#x27;s really helps to loosen them back up.</li>
            <li>I love using this late at night when the kids are asleep</li>
            <li>I guess I am getting old</li>
            <li>I can tell a marked difference in my skin after using it in my bath as well.</li>
            <li>With the addition of the lavender, this bath salt helps you to completely relax.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a long hot bath.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and as far as I can tell helps.</li>
            <li>He elevated it and the next morning he said, \\&quot;I really think that stuff</li>
            <li>What I noticed immediately was my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li>so I let her try this out in a long hot bath.  </li>
            <li>I had a chance to use this product a couple of weeks back and was really amazed at its soothing power.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel so soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>but when i read up on it i was surprised at all the things epsom salt does.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li>Barring any pesky kids knocking on my bathroom door, I feel completely relaxed....for about 5 minutes until said pesky kids bother me again</li>
            <li>The skin on my feet is now softer and feels soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I got out now only did I feel very relaxed</li>
            <li>The fragrance is natural and soothing.</li>
            <li>and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well.</li>
            <li>Works better than Advil, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep with Lavender completely changed that impression for</li>
            <li>These also make your skin really soft if you use them to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>As a runner, I always find a hot bath after a long run soothes those aching muscles, and Epsom salts are a staple in my household.</li>
            <li>Eep!)&lt;br /&gt;Can be overpowering for those with sensitive noses</li>
            <li>Not to mention they make my skin feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>When I say deep sleep, very deep.but the zipper works.</li>
            <li>Not a little but a lot.</li>
            <li>and I was able to cut the toe nail out and no more pain!</li>
            <li>There are many other ways it can be used for beauty, including a facial exfoliator and a lip treatment, without having to get extra products.</li>
            <li>All of it dissolved by the time the tub was about half full (I did swirl the water around some to get the product to evenly distribute).  </li>
            <li>Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li>Bath salts (the actual kind you use in a tub) are often pretty expensive</li>
            <li>I am not particularly fond of lavender scent but was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The exact same product in the same size is $4.99 at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dr. Teal&#x27;s in the past but only the foot soaks which I love to use before my at home pedicures.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll need that long warm bath at least one night a week.</li>
            <li>he afternoon, and while relaxing, I had too much to do, too much on my mind, to settle down for a nap.</li>
            <li>He works hard and a good soak with epsom salts really helps the swelling go down after a long day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li>If you love lavender you will love this, although I&#x27;m curious if it was natural or artificially scented.  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt came highly recommend to me from a physical therapist while I was dealing with a hip injury.</li>
            <li>Teal&#x27;s is so high at our local stores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to use especially at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I love the soothe and sleep Dr. Teals bath salts they are perfect with baking soda and a little bit of ground ginger to sweat out all the nasty toxins in my body .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had been so long since I had used epsom salt -- I am very upset with myself</li>
            <li>I used a small amount to exfoliate my skin as well &amp; it made my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>And unlike true Essential  oils the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long once it gets in the water.  </li>
            <li>I think on average I get 4 baths per bag, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m always searching for ways to calm the hell down</li>
            <li>Very relaxing after a long day!</li>
            <li>Not only did I feel relaxed afterwards, but my skin also felt so new and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I open this bag when I arrive to new hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>I have been in physical therapy for a back and neck injury from a car accident and it really relieves my sore muscles.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and a single bag lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>It can be pretty hard to find in stores and also very pricy.</li>
            <li>I love using after a long hard day.</li>
            <li>Baths are soothing in general.</li>
            <li>When I first received this for free to review I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>I am left soft, silky and relaxed....</li>
            <li>They claim to use natural Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>When will companies realize that they need to get rid of synthetics and stick with natural ingredients, like actual Lavendar oils - the ingredient AFTER &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in these salts.</li>
            <li>and it also seems to intensify the massage effect when usedin a foot spa, combined very relaxing and mentally therapuetic.</li>
            <li>(This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far).</li>
            <li>Be careful not too put too much into the water.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize before that Dr. Teal&#x27;s offers a variety of scents and would like to try a different one</li>
            <li>I will purchase this item again and recommend it to others in the near future.</li>
            <li>I will only be buying this from the store directly now.</li>
            <li>product review is good, PRICE stinks.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong (as expected for lavender)</li>
            <li>A salt bath for an hour makes a big difference and helps calm me down.  </li>
            <li>every bag I have bought in the past few months has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have used other types of &amp;#34;bath salts&amp;#34; but really like Dr. Teals.</li>
            <li>It also really helps with any aches and pains I might be having from a rough work day!</li>
            <li>so I can keep being productive in my social and work life.</li>
            <li>Receiving it 3 days earlier than expected was a real treat.</li>
            <li>According to the national academy of sciences, most American’s are magnesium deficient.</li>
            <li>I ordered the lavender Epsom salt but received the rosemary and mint with no excuse as to why</li>
            <li>My muscles were no longer tired feeling and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After my bath I was also pleasantly surprised at how smooth my skin was and how tired I actually was.  </li>
            <li>The only discrepancy that I have is the usage instructions, as I found using a full 2 cups was not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>really like this product it helps me relax and wine down before bed plus the lavender sent</li>
            <li>The really do help to wind down my stress level.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get plain epsom salt and, if you like, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>love this product it definitely soothes sore muscles and relaxes my body after a long hard day at work!</li>
            <li>Fast forward half an hour, and I was still soaking, despite the cooling water and dropping water level...</li>
            <li>I was very lightheaded (likely from the heat) and needed to sit down immediately.</li>
            <li>and I feel like a straight up pampered little princess.</li>
            <li>I used a little over a cup of epsom salt in my bath water for 3 days straight</li>
            <li>First off they are last on the list so very little is used.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I really wasn&#x27;t very thrilled about putting in my bath water</li>
            <li> I find the smell nice and strong so if Lavender smell is not your thing, this may be overly strong smell.</li>
            <li> So the smell is strong but kind of strong</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than a bath after a long day at the office and having epsom salt and lavender smells added to the bath just makes it that much more incredible!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The incorporated lavender scent is a nice touch; I liked and used it a lot when I first discovered it.</li>
            <li> I usually enjoy Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt from costco, but enjoy this one for more relaxing time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is this was the best epsom salt i&#x27;ve used in a long time, did as the package stated it would, and I would recommend to friends, family, and anyone I could.</li>
            <li> Perfect For A Long Day</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect thing after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this has been one of the best Epsom Salts that I have used in a long time.</li>

            <li> It is a strong lavender smell, but when diluted with water, it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> The scent seems a bit strong if you smell it from the bag, but once it hits the water it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> It has a strong lavender smell :x</li>
            <li> I cannot stand soaking in too strong of perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I like the strong odor</li>
            <li> I wanted something scented but not too strong.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dissolved in water, it doesnt smell so strong.</li>
            <li> It gave me a headache because it was so strong</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag i was amazed at the strong calming scent.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong lavender scents then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The lavender is strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> i was like whew this scent is strong.</li>
            <li> i will add though that it is a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt when you need help in relieving stress.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong it gave me a headache</li>
            <li> This was a great  addition to my bath, since I suffer from major aches &amp; pains.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A Work get home to a nice hot bath with Dr. TEAL.</li>
            <li> I pour it in a beautiful vintage glass container to make it extra luxe.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but when I opened the packaging the box was full of crystals</li>
            <li> cup is all you need in a nice hot bath, then soak away your sore muscles or cares.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender and was extremely excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution for free to review.</li>
            <li> So soothing; a great way to relax after a long run. :)</li>
            <li> I filled the bathtub with nice hot water and in went the Dr.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth and smell nice!</li>
            <li> Super relaxing!</li>
            <li> I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li> and I love how quickly it dissolves in the water.</li>
            <li> This was able to melt quickly and provide a light aroma that was soothing.</li>
            <li> , what I have been doing is just filling a large bowl with warm water and the Epsom salt, for a foot soak.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved Epsom salt especially while pregnant, now I will use it when my feet are not swollen!!</li>
            <li> Why add synthetic fragrance when it smelled great and worked fine with just the essential oils?!</li>
            <li> However, it was very relaxing in the bath, it smelled nice, and I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li> But my experience just took a huge boost when I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of soaking at the end of the day with a glass of wine (I know, cliche...)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge, HUGE fan.  </li>

            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I just sat and enjoy the smell for a while,</li>
            <li> wife loves it, i enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth skin feel when used as a body scrub but  the lavender smell is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll light a candle, turn off the light, close the door, turn on some zen music (like air) or a meditation app (like Mindfulness, or anything from Andrew Johnson) and just soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes the water smell and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in Epsom Salts and these work great.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to relax and spend moments in stress free peace.  </li>
            <li> When that wasn&#x27;t available I tried Dr. Teal&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> I dont know enough to tell you how good it is, but my wife seems to love it</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and smooth and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I felt all around better and actually got a good night sleep</li>
            <li> Even my 10yr old daughter asks me everytime she takes a bath if i could putt some of that good smelling salt stuff in her bath water.  </li>
            <li> You get a large amount for a really decent price and they smell great.  </li>
            <li> Actually plain Epsom salts works but Dr. Teals has the best Lavender scent.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is just the right amount, not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of it, and it does work, it puts me in sleeping mode right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lavender is one of my favorite scents and this Epson salt delivers just the right amount of scent for me.</li>
            <li> this has a very calm and soothing, relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy lavender, it is my preferred scent, and this does have a very strong lavender smell (which is what I was seeking, but may be too much for others).</li>
            <li> And for the cheap price..it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got a free sample from smiley360.com</li>

            <li> I was worried when I opened the bag because the smell was super strong and took my breath.</li>
            <li> The salt melts so easily and quickly</li>
            <li> It eases the tension in my muscles and allows me to be stress free right before i hop in bed!</li>
            <li> and I had forgotten how wonderful it is, especially for someone with a very busy life.</li>
            <li> You simply run a very warm bath tub full of water and add them to it.  </li>
            <li> Being a quite tall guy, this is a great excuse to soak in the tub and relax.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite bath products and my favorite epsom salt by far!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands, its the best and very competitive in price!</li>
            <li> Not only was the scent wonderful and not overbearing, I came out of the bath feeling calm and it was very helpful with my aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Used to soak feet great stress reliever after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, although it can be overpowering at first.</li>
            <li> I love that there are SO many uses including facial care :)  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to take a hot shower to feel better, I fill the tub with this soothing salt and soak for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Im always excited to get my water read and add in the salts.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a detox soak my sister-in-law</li>
            <li> A great way to relax after a long day.</li>
            <li> Excellent for foot bath, and very gentle but healing and will purchase more eventually in the near future or when this runs-dry...</li>
            <li> I have so much stress even on my easy days!</li>
            <li> I LOVED the lavender scent, it filled the entire bathroom of the peaceful smell which made relaxing before getting into the tub every more</li>
            <li> A great way to unwind after a long day!</li>
            <li> I got this for free for the purpose of reviewing it from Smiley360 and was pleasantly surprised, and all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The essential oil is lavender, my favorite, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to smiley360 I was able to this the product for free</li>
            <li> I have to work out in the field a lot for my job and visit some not so clean houses.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet super smooth and relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love lavender, and this smells very fresh just like real lavender.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying epsom salt ever, and i love how it makes me soo relaxed and makes my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft, and I enjoy the fact that Epsom salt has detoxifying properties in it as well!!</li>
            <li> First off it soothes all my aches &amp; pains after a long night at work, &amp; it has a awesome lavender scent which makes it easier to fall fast asleep!</li>
            <li> The soothing epsom salt was so nice after a long day of work and the lavender smell really helped to relax me for a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> Aside from other salts I&#x27;ve tried, Dr Teal&#x27;s has a great smell that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I am not completely sold on the smell yet since it is a bit strong, but it is great to pour into a hot shower in the morning and rub on your skin.</li>
            <li> oh so special.</li>
            <li> and I will most certainly purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to unwind at the end of the day :)  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> The Epsom salts make my body feel so soft &amp; my sore feet feel amazing after climbing out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it soothes any aches and pains I may have had and pretty much eliminates them because by the time I get out</li>
            <li> When I get out of the tub, my muscles are more relaxed, I am more calm and refreshed, and my skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li> my whole family is happier for it since I get a better nights sleep after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s turned me from a shower only girl to one who loves a good bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep it in a cool cabinet in the bathroom to avoid the headache</li>
            <li> From a price stand point, you really get so much more bang for your buck with the Epsom Salt.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the relaxing scent and it did feel very soothing.</li>
            <li> so I love the Lavender scent because it is really calming.</li>
            <li> I loved the insert that came with My SmileyKit that showed all of the different uses for Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is lovely and very soothing/relaxing.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with oz naturals sweet almond and macadamia nut body butter.  </li>
            <li> i just wish amazon had better stock, because i really like them and want to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed so much while soaking my body.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried this it relaxed my whole body and let me sleep better.</li>
            <li> I headed straight to the drug store and bought more</li>
            <li> Smells good, but found at my local grocery store for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that there are so many uses for Epsom salt that I never would have guessed.</li>
            <li> Then again I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks Bath and Body Works is nightmare come true</li>
            <li> This stuff has many uses and its reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> It is true that the bag doesn&#x27;t seal correctly after opening, but I store it upright, so this is a non-issue to me.</li>
            <li> Love it, its very relaxing, I sleep well after soaking my feet.</li>
            <li> Family loved it so this was a re-order in a larger size to save $$</li>
            <li> and a full time college schedule</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who said the scent is unbelievably strong and not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite brands of epsom salt; if the strong \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; smell is not what you&#x27;re going for however, this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Personally, the smell was perfect once combined with the hot bath water but of coarse on its own can be very over powering.</li>
            <li> I really love soaking in a warm tub worth epsom salts after a long day.</li>
            <li> love taking a relaxing bath here and there, and this is a new staple for me!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and I was using this product within a day of ordering it.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I run out quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it a lot when I was pregnant, to soak my feet in.  </li>
            <li> I started using this when I was pregnant with my son and having contractions around 29 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I have become a loyal customer</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this product but my kiddos keep asking for me to add it to their bath:)</li>
            <li> Tremendous product.</li>
            <li> The salts dissolved quickly, and I let the soothing scent engulf me as I relaxed into that bath.</li>
            <li> dissolved in warm water, magnesium sulfate is absorbed through the skin, naturally restoring the level of magnesium in the body</li>
            <li> this Amazon is quite high, they can be purchased for about $5 at many retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is a bit pricey, but you know how the saying goes - you get what you pay for and sometimes you deserve to pay a little more for a great treat like this!</li>
            <li> I enjoy a hot bath with the lavender salt in the evening time</li>
            <li> I have used other Epsom salt baths, and this Lavender Soaking solution from Dr. Teal&#x27;s is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Although I normally would buy the Espom salt cheaper at a grocery store, I love the lavender scent and the convenience of having it delivered to my door step.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try the Lavender Epsom salt for free thanks to smiley 360!</li>
            <li> The scent is very potent and hits you the moment you open the bag</li>
            <li> I loved using it after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> For me, a hot bath at the end of a hard day is the best way to relax.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it in a bath after a long day and it&#x27;s very relaxing and smells great.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the scent is a nice, natural &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The salts dissolve easily and it is very soothing on sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I recently tried for the first time and I was amazed on how good I felt after using.</li>
            <li> I use more than is recommended in the instructions, pouring straight from the bag into the hot water as it fills my tub.</li>
            <li> It is really strong smelling, but I really like lavender.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite ways to unwind after a long day, a hot bath with Dr. Teal&#x27;s lavender epsom salt; perfect for sore muscles and insomniac nights and every other stressful thing life can throw at you.</li>
            <li> This product delivers exactly what is promises!  </li>
            <li> After using them, I felt so relaxed and serene, I was ready for bed!!  </li>
            <li> the salt not only helps you destress it also helps with sore muscles and helps you sleep better at night!</li>
            <li> Teal&#x27;s soaking solutions and they all work equally as well, however lavender is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It really does help to sooth over exerted muscles and helps soreness tremendously!</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal is a great brand and their product is of a high standard, both to sooth aching feet and to help you sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li> It helps calm my aching muscles</li>
            <li> It also gives me a sense of calm just by smelling them.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Smiley360 to sample , it left me smelling so good and feeling my skin soo soft.</li>
            <li> After soaking in the Epson salts I am so relaxed and calm.</li>
            <li> The bag suggests that you use 2-cups per soak, but I&#x27;ve found that a few tablespoons works great.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and the scent is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It smells so lovely and my skin is soft after the bath.</li>
            <li> If my feet could smile they would.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I dont think it helped with my back pain though, but it was relaxing and nice to get away</li>
            <li> THe next morning, fully expecting sore muscles, I was surprised that I felt great.</li>
            <li> I always try to do something natural like this before resorting to taking analgesics and this does the trick most of the time on my aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I happened to get my most recent bag for free from Smiley360 to review.</li>
            <li> The smell is so powerful.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and wait.</li>
            <li> No big thing, but nice to toss a handful into my bath for aromatherapy benefits.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Anyone with a sensitive nose wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it.</li>
            <li> but it honestly relaxed me instantly once getting in the water.</li>
            <li> We had a busy weekend sports wedding and nature walI love the calming effect the scent had on me.</li>
            <li> It made not only my bathroom, but the area near my bathroom, the living room smell great.</li>
            <li> I rarely have time to take a bath</li>
            <li> The combination is such a nice soothing and calming experience.</li>
            <li> The so called zipper that is on product to keep fresh didn&#x27;t work, as the granules stay in the track and prevent it from sealing.</li>
            <li> I was eager to use this salt because I love Lavender and find it very relaxing as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps the body regulate over 325 enzymes and plays an important role in many bodily functions, like muscle control, energy production and the elimination of harmful toxins.</li>
            <li> While both magnesium and sulfate can be absorbed through the stomach, studies show soaking in a bath enriched with Epsom salt increases magnesium levels.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great right before bed if you have trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> Smells good and seems to be comparable to other brands on the market.</li>
            <li> Our mothers and grandmothers did it right.</li>
            <li> I feel right to sleep</li>
            <li> I feel so relaxed I can fall right asleep.  </li>
            <li> But I did not go right to sleep like my friend, but I have sleep issues anyway.</li>
            <li> bUT they were right on about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was so right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, if you are going to use this for sore muscles, you have found the right product.</li>
            <li> After a ten mile run on Banks-Vernonia Trail, five miles of which was all uphill, I started a nice hot bath, dissolved a cup of salts, and settled myself in for a  relaxing</li>
            <li> So highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> long days on my feet it smells amazing and relaxes my feet.</li>
            <li> I suffer extreme muscle and nerve pain on occasion and a good hot soak and Dr.</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that I used the salts the first time after an 8 hour trip to Longwood Gardens, walking around on my feet all day, and the salt soak took the soreness right out of</li>
            <li> These salts smell amazing and helped me relax in a hot bath after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> More economical when purchased at a big box store.</li>
            <li> However, I think the scent could be more potent as it went away within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Great to bathe in before bedtime too, as the scent and overall soothing experience is enough to make you want to pass out.</li>
            <li> As far as Epsom salt goes, I would say this does its job very well, however the lavender scent was extremely overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> It is a nice big bag, and you don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the lavender to soothe my aching muscles and get soft skin at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to dr teals Epsom salt all I need for a fixer upper is a nice hot bath with a few scoops of the amazing salt!</li>
            <li> A nice hot soak with these helps soothe my muscles and get me ready for the next workout!</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I mixed about 2 cups of Epsom salt with a half tub of hot water, I could smell the great lavender scent as soon as I opened the package and it dissolved immediately into the water releasing a fine fragrant.</li>
            <li> The quality is still very much up to par and it is something I&#x27;m going to continue to use.</li>
            <li> , I switched to using only a single cup of the product, and I liked it much better.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, relaxing, though it could be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li> It relieved all of my aches and pains without me having to take multiple advil pms or extra strength tylenols, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this Epsom salt!</li>
            <li> I had s very stressful week and decided to give this a try and it helped me relax!</li>
            <li> Stressed mind from work and achy muscles from intense workouts are all relieved with Dr. Teals Epsom Salt!</li>
            <li> The aroma is very calming before i even get into the tub!</li>
            <li> It really does the job!</li>
            <li> The scent is relaxing and it does help for a peaceful night.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a fantastic, relaxing bath experience without bubbles!</li>
            <li> I love the soothing relaxation feeling that Teal&#x27;s bath salts give, I definitely will buy and use.</li>
            <li> I did notice a lot of improvement after my first bath with epsom salts just relaxing my muscles.</li>
            <li> decided to try Dr. Teal epsom salt and lots of hot water.</li>
            <li> At this point, this is the only thing that can upgrade our crappy, american-style-apartment bathtub into a marginally respectable spa night alone.</li>
            <li> I understand price increases but cant accept an increase that is more than double.</li>
            <li> After hearing many suggestions to use epsom ssalt for my back problems, I decided to order Dr. Teals products and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time using it</li>
            <li> The smell can be overpowering at first</li>
            <li> Just grab a handful and throw it under the hot running water while your bath fills up.</li>
            <li> i love that they come in multiple scent options.</li>
            <li> I work five days a week.so on a friday i put this in my hot tub and relax.will</li>
            <li> definitely buy more cause</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Epsom Salt baths, but the added touch of Lavender makes this even more soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> used to be able to get this product at my local grocery store for $5.99 for a three pound bag.</li>
            <li> After using this product i can honestly say it has helped a lot, maybe its because i usually dont use anything for my sore muscles, but it helps me feel more normal</li>
            <li> Not only am I a fan of because its has lavender in it, which is my favorite, but it also relieves me of all my aches and pain.</li>
            <li> I really Like Dr. Teals Epsom salts!</li>
            <li> I have used it several more times both in my bath, and just as a foot soak.</li>
            <li> so many different varietiesI remember when it was just unsented</li>
            <li> Very soothing in itself!</li>
            <li> and yes, it is very relaxing!</li>
            <li> I’m planning to use it as a hair volumizer next Time :)</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li> I felt after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I read the label and the first thing on the label was perfume.</li>
            <li> I will be using Dr Teals very often!</li>
            <li> Taking one point off because she wasn&#x27;t able to seal it back up because salt got in the ziplock.</li>
            <li> Makes taking  bath so much soothing!</li>
            <li> But I tried it out and poured a bit into my hot bath water....</li>
            <li> I will difinitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> All i have to do is add 2 cups of the salt to my hot bath water and soak for 20 min.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, I was stressed that day.</li>
            <li> My skin became soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will be recommending this to friends and buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I really felt the soreness without it..and the smell is sooo relaxing!</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt in my bath revitalized my achy muscles and provided much needed relief!</li>
            <li> During my first use of the salts, I followed the directions exactly, and I found that after soaking for 10 or so minutes in the tub, I began getting freakishly thirsty.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Teals Epsom SALT SOAKING SOLUTION &amp; the FOARMING BATH but have not been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li> Though well-written, there was nothing in the characters nor the plot that kept me interested.</li>
            <li> This product smells more like CK1 than actual lavender oil!  </li>
            <li> I ran a hot bath and put some in.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt, hot water, baking soda, ginger, and lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Scent is a very personal preference, so if you LOVE lavender, I would say, give it a try.</li>
            <li> The following week I tried again but with just a 2/3 cup and was able to have a relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The directions say to use two cups of the Epsom salts to a foot pan and fill with hot water.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much better the next day.</li>
            <li> It was only my love of the lavender scent that made me buy this product and think, \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very relaxed after using this in baths!</li>
            <li> The smell is soothing and refreshing, and my entire body feels relaxed after soaking.</li>
            <li> My back pain always feels better after using this and soaking for 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of lavender combined with the soothing Epsom salts just can&#x27;t be beat for a relaxing hot bath.</li>
            <li> I use Epsom Salts on a regular basis, I love them.  </li>
            <li> Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The smell was good and really calmed down once it was out of the bag and dissolved.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be coming back to order more once my supply is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: The bags are bigger than they thought I would be, and are actually a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a really great product and I love how fragrant it is and how it helped me relax after a long hard day.</li>
            <li> So I cant exactly attest to the \\&quot;Sooth and Sleep\\&quot; title on the bag (why only 4 stars and not 5), but it is very relaxing and had my bathroom smelling lovely for a day or two.</li>
            <li> In short, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> The chamomile smells very perfumy whereas this one smells more like essential oil.</li>
            <li> The epsom salt really relaxes the sore muscles and the next day I feel much better.</li>
            <li> This really helped my back pain feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have some arthritis from dancing and this is amazing after a long rehearsal it allows to to relax and to be able to get up the next day.  </li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent of this product but only secondary to the relief I experience when soaking in a nice tub full of it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution because it&#x27;s available in 3 different varieties {the hubby&#x27;s fave-Eucalyptus Spearmint for Relax &amp; Relief, the one I reach for is Chamomile enriched to help calm the body, and there&#x27;s also a version infused with Lavender to help promote a restful night&#x27;s sleep}AND  </li>
            <li> I am an avid gym goer, as much as my schedule allows.</li>
            <li> the end, this made for a very relaxing and peaceful soak in the tub.  </li>
            <li> Soaking and applying this stuff with a hot towel didn&#x27;t quite alleviate all of the pain, but it came very close.  </li>
            <li> did not read my Kindle, was not bored, but was in a VERY peaceful-meditative state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for relaxing after a long day.</li>
            <li> Everyone can benefit from locking the world and taking long soak in this refreshing scented Epsom Salt and Water.</li>
            <li> and I have had good results taking baths soaking in epsom salts in the past, and this combined the two,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is wonderful...very true to a natural lavender.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my steaming hot, lavender scented epsom salt baths!</li>
            <li> I do wish the packaging was a little easier to pour the product into the tub, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> I think the lavender scent coming from the bathroom puts them right to sleep when normally they would stay awake reading.</li>
            <li> not only smelled wonderful but soaking in the for 2 minutes after work really helped some of my tense muscles in  </li>
            <li> I love using Epsom Salt in the past but never tried the scented ones.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review from Smiley360.Com.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a bit too strong, just buy one bag unscented, one bag scented, and mix them in equal amounts in your bath.</li>
            <li> strong enough but not over powering.</li>
            <li> And this size is large.</li>
            <li> Teal&#x27;s uses pure Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epsom salt is a pure mineral compound of magnesium sulfate in crystal form.</li>
            <li> I was worried with other reviews saying that the smell was super strong</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, but buy it elsewhere, Ulta sells it for less than half this price!</li>
            <li> Very highly scents with lavender.</li>
            <li> At any rate, these bath salts certainly set a relaxing mood, and that was much</li>
            <li> all day!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, a little overpowering but</li>
            <li> I bought a huge bag of this on a whim recently.  </li>
            <li> Very calming and leaves skin feeling</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> IT really relaxed me.</li>
            <li> could smell the lavender the whole time.  </li>
            <li> I do think I slept well afterwards, though I don&#x27;t know how much of that to attribute to this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very sore.</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I really do think this adds to my relaxation when I add it to my baths.</li>
            <li> and it helps when my body hurts from walking or lifting too much.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this again and would purchase repeatedly!I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> It relieves my achy muscles and the lavender scent is very relaxing. &#x27;</li>

            <li> larger containers available and where?&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> Stinky and perfumey, not at all like a real lavender smell.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use that much of them</li>
            <li> much prefer the lavender over the chamomile.</li>
            <li> This baby really helped with my muscles.</li>
            <li> I shared with some family members and they absolutely agreed.</li>

            <li> I was honestly surprised with how relaxed and calm</li>
            <li> I thought the lavender scent was very soothing and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> The smell is very soothing.</li>

            <li> It makes it much smoother and silkier.</li>

            <li> Amount paid was too much for the quantity received.</li>
            <li> I used this to soak post-run and it really helps with muscle soreness.</li>
            <li> , I have MS and it really relaxed me.</li>
            <li> Recently Smiley360.com gave me the chance to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> This my personal opinion and was not influenced by anyone else or the fact that it was a free product test.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a soothe and sleep Epsom salt which is very needed in my household.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The fragrance was soothing and calming as well, really helped him relax after work.  </li>
            <li> The lavender I have found to be calming and the product itself is very soothing.</li>
            <li> The product created a very relaxing, soothing bath.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so much she fell asleep after getting out of the bath.</li>
            <li> I researched Epsom Salt and the benefits on sore muscles, so I suggested it, not thinking it would really help his swollen and bruised ankle.</li>
            <li> I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li> It really soothes muscle cramps too..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and it really has helped my relax.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> but I did enjoy the Epsom salts and will try a different scent instead.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering, but it stays on your skin the whole day.</li>
            <li> The bag doesn&#x27;t re-seal very well--</li>
            <li> Not just bearable, but really, truly relaxed and content.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I found myself very relaxed in my alone time at the bath for almost an hour.  </li>
            <li> The scent was very relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soothing for the skin with its organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I can say it works very well.</li>
            <li> I add them to my bath and its really relaxing.  </li>
            <li> but my son was telling me how much it helps his athletes for</li>
            <li> Was hoping the salt would more completely dissolve in the bath water, but it left quite a bit of residue in the tub.  </li>
            <li> I had to back to buying unscented Epsom salts and manually add my own lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a lot of different soaking products and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Since then, however, I prefer to buy unscented Epsom salt and add my own essential oils - this way I can experiment with several fragrances.</li>
            <li> He had a sound sensitivity, he was shaking his head non-stop when he heard a microwave or vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> First, the scent is heavenly and very soothing, the granules are much smaller than others I have tried and dissolve quickly in the tub</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am in complete disbelief at how I am feeling right now.</li>
            <li> Not to mention Dr Teals has many other fragrances, and his product really works.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but it is regularly too much money (the item + shipping) that I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy it this way, I would purchase at local store where I don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect, the same stuff I bought at target but was too lazy to go back.</li>
            <li> other than that i love the product.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender smell too, which is extremely relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have had better experiences with other brands.</li>
            <li> Much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> two cups is one third to one half of the 3 lb bag, so you will go through this pretty quickly if you take more than one bath in it a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I truly love this for relaxing after a busy long day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference afterwards but that&#x27;s probably because I didn&#x27;t stay in the tub as long as directed.</li>
            <li> I use this to ease sore muscles after a long day, to relax and enjoy the heavenly scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I soaked in the water and salt solution until the water started to cool off, and I noticed that my aches were starting to subside</li>
            <li> Soaking in a hot tub with these natural salts is soothing and also draws out toxins.  </li>
            <li> I feel pretty ripped off as far as ordering it thru amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it with your normal beauty products really kicks them up a notch.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is frequently out of stock in our local market - as always I can depend on Amazon to have what I need and ship it quickly!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there is so many other ways to use it!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I liked the overpowering lavender scent, especially being pregnant.  </li>
            <li> love that the salt grains are finer than typical Epsom salts</li>
            <li> I did feel more relaxed after my bath and less stressed.</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite flowers and although the scent is diluted in large bodies of water (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), it&#x27;s definitely relaxing to use this after a long day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for new mamas!</li>
            <li> I really like the lavender smell and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Every single part of my body ached and I didn&#x27;t think I would ever stop hurting, then I remembered the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution that I was sent to review for free by Smiley 360.  </li>
            <li> So yes after the first week , I was so sore, achy, and tensed from the major change!</li>

            <li> highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using it at night because it is so relaxing that afterwards I just want to crawl into bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> It is so relaxing and makes my skin feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> Lavender is such a soothing cent and added to a hot bath it is heavenly!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; Epsom salt baths, but it was hard to find ones that were already scented that I liked.</li>
            <li> As  a mom who doesnt get much alone time I used this product to give me my own personal little getaway/spa feeling.</li>
            <li> The salts makes the water soft and the lavender scent is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my bath water so soft and the Lavender scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This definitely seems more of a natural aromatic oil used and soaking with it in the bath tub definitely helps me relax.</li>
            <li> This is such a rare treat for me as I dont find any time to soak up.</li>
            <li> Just pour a cup in your bath and light a few candles and you will be having a peaceful soak in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty energetic person, and this was a slow run for me.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from mild back pain, having a desk job and sitting most of the day will do that.</li>
            <li> Such a good alternative to plain Epsom salt!</li>
            <li> With the addition of lavender, this bath salt helps you to relax enough to fall asleep right after you get out.</li>
            <li> Pictured below, left to right:</li>
            <li> After a long week of moving I enjoyed a nice long soak to relieve my achy muscles and to wash away the hard work and stress.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loved the smell and how the Epsom salt worked magic on her sore muscles after a long day of being on her feet cutting hair.</li>
            <li> There is just something naturally soothing about a hot bath, and adding the aromatherapy just made it almost heavenly, however the aches and pains of my first long run in a while, kept me grounded on earth.</li>
            <li> I use this anytime I feel beat from work or exercise and feel brand new afterwards.</li>
            <li> We live in a desert.</li>
            <li> Very calming, used in a bath, it helped me sleep, relieved my aches, and the smell of the essential oil takes bathing to a whole new level of relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it makes my silver necklace slightly tarnish if I wear it in the tub with this in it, but solution to that is easy.</li>
            <li> I also love soaking in it after a long day of work and a long day of teaching dance.</li>
            <li> It has really been a big help in getting me relaxed and ready for bed in the evening.</li>
            <li> The product works decently, but you can get it elsewhere for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> The salt has numerous uses, but I like to use it as a bath soak and mixed with some body wash as an exfoliater.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Still a great product, just irritating that I had to vacuum after opening the package.</li>
            <li> I will use plain Epsom and add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li> using this in my bath helped heal my skin and keep my skin soft for days afterwards!</li>
            <li> (I usually get calgon, but kmart didn&#x27;t have my favorite scent; but I saw on the shelf</li>
            <li> I think it actually work the first time.</li>
            <li> Once I got it mixed in with the hot bathwater</li>
            <li> Initially, I was not sure what to expect from this product, but I have since discovered that I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to use this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> But the next day after the first Epsom salt bath he stopped paying attention to those sounds.</li>
            <li> I am a nursing student with a two year old!</li>
            <li> I struggled to relax for the first ten minutes (again, my inability to sit still was kicking in)</li>
            <li> However, I have found the amazon price is a bit higher than the $5 cost at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Thank God I had the solution to soak my aching body in that evening; not only does the smell soothe you, but the Epsom salt really helps with relaxing your muscles and making you feel like you could face another session!</li>
            <li> After doing a few 5k runs my legs and feet get sore and after soaking in a warm bath with this salt my tired aching muscles felt so much better.  </li>
            <li> For me, the lavender scent in this product is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I used them after a 7-mile long hike, and my husband used them after a 100-mile bike ride, and both were fine the next day, no sore muscles, no pains whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, I started a new workout at a boxing facility that literally works EVERY part of your body, leaving you completely sore and feeling out of commission after the first session.</li>
            <li> After being in the lake and covered in sun screen half the summer, my skin has become rough, sticky and just an overwhelming feeling of being not scrub a dub clean - even though I shower daily.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and your body feeling less tense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few friends have used this brand in the past and have great things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my tired feet feel, I also really like the ways iit smells!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I still have half the bag left.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely and you only need to use half of the recommended measurement.</li>
            <li> These bath salts quickly soothed my tired, aching feet and made my skin feel silky smooth after.</li>
            <li> Excited to try some of the other scents!</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Teals Epsom Salts and have used it several times to relax and clear the stress!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and to me seems just as good as the expensive stuff!!</li>
            <li> I expected, given the price, for the smell to be faint, but it is a very good quality salt.  </li>
            <li> so I could put it in a clear decanter in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t make me break out in the bath.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> By far the deepest level of relaxation I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li> It could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I would not waste the money buying it here.</li>
            <li> Did not smell natural but chemical.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this again, thanks for introducing me to it.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s really helps to loosen them back up.</li>
            <li> I love using this late at night when the kids are asleep</li>
            <li> I guess I am getting old</li>
            <li> I can tell a marked difference in my skin after using it in my bath as well.</li>
            <li> With the addition of the lavender, this bath salt helps you to completely relax.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a long hot bath.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and as far as I can tell helps.</li>
            <li> He elevated it and the next morning he said, \\&quot;I really think that stuff</li>
            <li> What I noticed immediately was my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> so I let her try this out in a long hot bath.  </li>
            <li> I had a chance to use this product a couple of weeks back and was really amazed at its soothing power.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel so soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> but when i read up on it i was surprised at all the things epsom salt does.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li> Barring any pesky kids knocking on my bathroom door, I feel completely relaxed....for about 5 minutes until said pesky kids bother me again</li>
            <li> The skin on my feet is now softer and feels soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got out now only did I feel very relaxed</li>
            <li> The fragrance is natural and soothing.</li>
            <li> and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well.</li>
            <li> Works better than Advil, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep with Lavender completely changed that impression for</li>
            <li> These also make your skin really soft if you use them to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> As a runner, I always find a hot bath after a long run soothes those aching muscles, and Epsom salts are a staple in my household.</li>
            <li> Eep!)&lt;br /&gt;Can be overpowering for those with sensitive noses</li>
            <li> Not to mention they make my skin feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> When I say deep sleep, very deep.but the zipper works.</li>
            <li> Not a little but a lot.</li>
            <li> and I was able to cut the toe nail out and no more pain!</li>
            <li> There are many other ways it can be used for beauty, including a facial exfoliator and a lip treatment, without having to get extra products.</li>
            <li> All of it dissolved by the time the tub was about half full (I did swirl the water around some to get the product to evenly distribute).  </li>
            <li> Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> Bath salts (the actual kind you use in a tub) are often pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I am not particularly fond of lavender scent but was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The exact same product in the same size is $4.99 at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Teal&#x27;s in the past but only the foot soaks which I love to use before my at home pedicures.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll need that long warm bath at least one night a week.</li>
            <li> he afternoon, and while relaxing, I had too much to do, too much on my mind, to settle down for a nap.</li>
            <li> He works hard and a good soak with epsom salts really helps the swelling go down after a long day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li> If you love lavender you will love this, although I&#x27;m curious if it was natural or artificially scented.  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt came highly recommend to me from a physical therapist while I was dealing with a hip injury.</li>
            <li> Teal&#x27;s is so high at our local stores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to use especially at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I love the soothe and sleep Dr. Teals bath salts they are perfect with baking soda and a little bit of ground ginger to sweat out all the nasty toxins in my body .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It had been so long since I had used epsom salt -- I am very upset with myself</li>
            <li> I used a small amount to exfoliate my skin as well &amp; it made my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> And unlike true Essential  oils the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long once it gets in the water.  </li>
            <li> I think on average I get 4 baths per bag, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m always searching for ways to calm the hell down</li>
            <li> Very relaxing after a long day!</li>
            <li> Not only did I feel relaxed afterwards, but my skin also felt so new and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I open this bag when I arrive to new hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> I have been in physical therapy for a back and neck injury from a car accident and it really relieves my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and a single bag lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It can be pretty hard to find in stores and also very pricy.</li>
            <li> I love using after a long hard day.</li>
            <li> Baths are soothing in general.</li>
            <li> When I first received this for free to review I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am left soft, silky and relaxed....</li>
            <li> They claim to use natural Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> When will companies realize that they need to get rid of synthetics and stick with natural ingredients, like actual Lavendar oils - the ingredient AFTER &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in these salts.</li>
            <li> and it also seems to intensify the massage effect when usedin a foot spa, combined very relaxing and mentally therapuetic.</li>
            <li> (This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far).</li>
            <li> Be careful not too put too much into the water.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize before that Dr. Teal&#x27;s offers a variety of scents and would like to try a different one</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item again and recommend it to others in the near future.</li>
            <li> I will only be buying this from the store directly now.</li>
            <li> product review is good, PRICE stinks.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong (as expected for lavender)</li>
            <li> A salt bath for an hour makes a big difference and helps calm me down.  </li>
            <li> every bag I have bought in the past few months has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have used other types of &amp;#34;bath salts&amp;#34; but really like Dr. Teals.</li>
            <li> It also really helps with any aches and pains I might be having from a rough work day!</li>
            <li> so I can keep being productive in my social and work life.</li>
            <li> Receiving it 3 days earlier than expected was a real treat.</li>
            <li> According to the national academy of sciences, most American’s are magnesium deficient.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lavender Epsom salt but received the rosemary and mint with no excuse as to why</li>
            <li> My muscles were no longer tired feeling and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After my bath I was also pleasantly surprised at how smooth my skin was and how tired I actually was.  </li>
            <li> The only discrepancy that I have is the usage instructions, as I found using a full 2 cups was not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> really like this product it helps me relax and wine down before bed plus the lavender sent</li>
            <li> The really do help to wind down my stress level.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get plain epsom salt and, if you like, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> love this product it definitely soothes sore muscles and relaxes my body after a long hard day at work!</li>
            <li> Fast forward half an hour, and I was still soaking, despite the cooling water and dropping water level...</li>
            <li> I was very lightheaded (likely from the heat) and needed to sit down immediately.</li>
            <li> and I feel like a straight up pampered little princess.</li>
            <li> I used a little over a cup of epsom salt in my bath water for 3 days straight</li>
            <li> First off they are last on the list so very little is used.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it is much cheaper to simply purchase a bottle of lavender aromatherapy oil and plain sea salt.</li>
            <li> You can get plain epsom salts much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that they would work, but the next day I was feeling considerably less sore and more relaxed!</li>
            <li> It really helps mme to relax and to relieve a little stress!</li>
            <li> I usually use this product after my work outs because it really does help soothe the muscles.</li>
            <li> It is especially relaxing and soothing to use in the evening after a long stressful day.</li>
            <li> The Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt - Soothe and Sleep is such a great relaxing product, the other night I was so tired and sore after doing all day house chores plus taking care of a toddler that I have to chase around the house, and at night I was exhausted that my husband offer to make me a bath</li>
            <li> I regularly utilize salts to help ease the aches after a race of long run.</li>
            <li> After a long weekend of walking around a major US city, the miles of pounding the pavement left me feeling extremely sore.</li>
            <li> I just mixed a little bit with Vaseline and my lips were really soft.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped me relax and soothed my aching muscles after a long day!</li>
            <li> Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling softer than it has in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried this Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution last week after a long day at the Texas State Fair, my whole body was in pain and exhausted from all the walking and my both legs were hurting so bad.</li>
            <li> general, I do like to use Espom Salt when taking a bath due to a variety of reasons.</li>
            <li> i think of little old ladies.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to have think really hard about spending that much for bath salt.</li>
            <li> It is just hard for me to find time sometimes, and a shower is much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat artificial smell, but ok.</li>
            <li> after a long week of cleaning the basement and moving books and shelves</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and is priced well.</li>
            <li> I pour it in my bath after a long day.  </li>
            <li> than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li> I sit for long hours during work so a bath soak with Epsom salt</li>
            <li> Using the computer a lot of work and editing pictures, i often my neck, shoulders, and hip ache from sitting in front of the computer for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> When I received a bag of Dr Teal’s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep Lavender from Smiley 360, i begin to use it after a long hours of work.</li>
            <li> I had been on my feet all day long in heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been soaking in it after long hikes and</li>
            <li> Will be buying for a long time.</li>
            <li> It also helped to relieve my aching muscles from a long day of stress.  </li>
            <li> This was so soothing and comforting after a long day of class.</li>
            <li> I would add them to my bath after a long day of moving</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why every night I take a long, soothing bath with these here Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> I can sit in the tub for so long while using.  </li>
            <li> It left me feeling pretty tired and my skin was somewhat softer rhan</li>
            <li> But if you are sensitive to smell like me, pass on the scent, and buy plain salts.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the smell could last a little longer when added to the tub.</li>
            <li> There are other uses for Dr. Teal&#x27;s that I never would have such as body scrubs, lip exfoliants, and foot soaks.</li>
            <li> I will be a long time customer of Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution!</li>
            <li> Possibly not good for people on a low salt or with high blood pressure.</li>
            <li> My throat felt dry, and I just felt...</li>
            <li> scrub/relieves dry lips</li>
            <li> Mixing some into my usual hair conditioner look off old buildup and made my scalp feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel all loose and relaxed.  </li>
            <li> Those people down in that part of the world don&#x27;t bathe properly and that&#x27;s not just a stereotype!</li>
            <li> The lavender scent of Dr. Teal&#x27;s Soothe &amp; Sleep is overpowering when you open the bag, but tones down when added to your bath.</li>
            <li> The instructions say 2 cups per bath, but I usually only use a cup or a half cup to make it go longer.</li>
            <li> the tightness was leaving, and my muscles were less achy over the next couple of days as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an athlete for years and epsom salt has always been a goto remedy for me, but the lavender just puts this one above the regular epsom salts I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the scent would be too strong as well</li>
            <li> but I was quickly proven wrong.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the packaging is not very secure, the zip closure won&#x27;t close completely.</li>
            <li> After a long day of chasing my 2 year old daughter around all day at a birthday party at the skating rink, I was exhausted both mentally and physically.  </li>
            <li> Often times I combine it with my muscle tension/mentholated Dr. Teal&#x27;s for little something extra for my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know who needs a little pamper in their lives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got multiple uses, just throw in a little with your body wash</li>
            <li> I run around all day picking stuff up after my daughter and trying to keep the house clean and after a long day of crazy running around i am sore everywhere .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my body out like other brands.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to wake him at 8 too pick his son up, then my son picked me up from work because his dad fell back into a deep sleep.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase  Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender and other Dr. Teal Products too!!</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Teals at least once a week so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d long heard about the benefits of Epsom salt baths, but I was pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a bath person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for my boys when they&#x27;re having a rough night and can&#x27;t fall asleep</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the bag closed.</li>
            <li> From my view, you can get 10 baths out of one bag if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t overdo it with the salt.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as expected.</li>
            <li> I have recently started going back to the gym which has left my body feeling tired and sore.  </li>
            <li> I used it after a particularly rough day of working out, cleaning, and dancing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t zip closed... not at all.</li>
            <li> I have been missing out on the just using the regular scent.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the wide range of products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i never really knew about this stuff</li>
            <li> my back and knee, which give me a lot of trouble, had also stopped hurting.</li>
            <li> It was a rough day</li>
            <li> The lavender was not quite the scent that I had expected.  </li>
            <li> When I received a bag of Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep Lavender from Smiley 360, I found out just what I was missing getting regular salts.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four starts is because the smell is kind of sickening.</li>
            <li> After a long day of home schooling the kids, working part time, and being new to obstacle courses and 5Ks, I am often worn out, sore, and exhausted.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the bath for several occasions: after running races, during pregnancy, stiff muscles.</li>
            <li> I got for a birthday present and half the salt wasted.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount added to a bath.</li>
            <li> I was advised to buy this due to muscular aches and pains and it was wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are cheaper at other stores compared to Amazon</li>
            <li> It is small crystals as opposed to the larger ones that you can feel grated at the bottom of your tub when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to state exactly what they do, but they make my skin softer and help a bit with the muscle pain in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but can be found cheaper on other sites or in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands</li>
            <li> After an 1/2 hour soak I felt like I had spent the day at a spa!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about it</li>
            <li> I will not buy an other brand.  </li>
            <li> Just used this in a bath the other day</li>
            <li> I do get to sleep easier when my mind isn&#x27;t racing about other things.</li>
            <li> Recommend the Lavender over the Amber Vanilla, but have not tried the other scents</li>
            <li> We also have tried the other Dr.</li>
            <li> I get due to my active job.</li>
            <li> And the lavender scent helps relax my always active mind</li>
            <li> At least is better than the chamomile one, which is terribly artificial and unbearable.</li>
            <li> I am a really active person though i am a stay at home mom.</li>
            <li> After a long day and a tough workout, such as a bootcamp class or spinning this has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I had a long day and decided to take a bath to relax, which I don&#x27;t usually like doing.</li>
            <li> Because of that I have a difficult time falling asleep at night (or in the daytime after my shifts) and a dash of this in a bath before bed really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It helped me relax, and soothed my tired muscles after a busy week.</li>
            <li> It was not at all irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing, both for tense muscles, and a tense mind.</li>
            <li> but it is so much easier and less expensive to just buy Dr Teals Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> The soothing lavender scent helps me wind down after a 16 hour day and</li>
            <li> calmed me down.</li>
            <li> I chose this for the price and scent, and it didn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> I am contemplating buying some other scents to try!</li>
            <li> I do this Epsom salt bath for my 2yo autistic son every other day.</li>
            <li> and it really helped my muscles relax, with have a bad back and knee</li>
            <li> but I did not find this to be the case I did however use less than the package states per bath so that may also help if the smell gets to you.</li>
            <li> A bag typically lasts me and the hubby 6-8 months;</li>
            <li> I usually buy this locally but was lazy so got it on line.</li>
            <li> I am going to take less showers.  </li>
            <li> But, I am giving it a one star because you can buy this at walmart for less than $5 per bag.</li>
            <li> It is about half the price if you buy it at walmart or target.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing about this product is I wish I could buy it in the size of those large dog food bags, instead of these little dinky ones.</li>
            <li> The package came with a huge hole in it and all the product was out of it and ruined a Barbie doll that was also in the box.  :(</li>
            <li> After a long day or muscle tiredness from a workout or the trauma of an accident, this will help relieve the tension and help you sleep, at least it does for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have terrible muscle aches when I got in, but I did feel relaxed and pretty much</li>
            <li> Given this, a bag will not last long, and it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt buy it from amazon because it is a little bit to pricey for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little time to relax this product</li>
            <li> I have two little ones at home and am always on the go.  </li>
            <li> Reduce the price a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding this to my list of little escapes that all moms need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In an attempt to lose weight, I have been exercising really hard, doing a lot of Zumba, Hard Core, Total body sculpt, weight lifting, etc.</li>
            <li> It sounds crazy but it really feels like a miracle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps my feet after working 2 jobs everyday I come and soak.</li>
            <li> I have told my friends and a few on facebook.</li>
            <li> i would say order quite a few bags since its suggested you use 2 cups per bath.</li>
            <li> It was not relaxing at all because your over there trying to breathe trapped in your bathtub, when your supposed to be relaxing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this Epsom salt to all parents of autistic children.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that after you use it, it is difficult to close the zip seal because tiny crystals get into it.</li>
            <li> I used this in my baths, to soak my feet, my hair and even my face a few times.</li>
            <li> that revitalizes tired, achy muscles and refreshes skin&#x27;s appearance while luxurious essential oils soothe the senses and provide relief from stress.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from one behind my knee for a week or two when I finally had some time to soak in a bath with this product.</li>
            <li> It also smells like natural lavender oil and not some fake chemical scent.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money, time, and stomach.</li>
            <li> Just soaking my feet in a solution of salts and water took layers of dead skin off my feet, without the need for scraping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping</li>
            <li> Magnesium Sulfate revitalizes tired, achy muscles and refreshes skin’s appearance while luxurious essential oils soothe the senses and provide relief from stress.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the lavender scent, but the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a hard time relaxing and sleeping due to I stress about the little thngs.&lt;br /&gt;After using Dr.</li>
            <li> I cut the \\&quot;dose\\&quot; in half and add some plain (and much less expensive) generic epson salts.  </li>
            <li> Not a strong lavender scent.</li>
            <li> This product helps me relax after a long day and soothes my tired and achy body.</li>
            <li> I usually add scents to the plain Epsom Salt</li>
            <li> I believein life little luxeries and this is one of them!</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with a little baking soda and just soak and relax after a hard day for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I did have small scratches and cuts on my feet</li>
            <li> there is nothing like lighting a few candles and soaking in a Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender bath!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this entire life of projects esp the foaming bath ones that are liquid 😍</li>
            <li> My feet are usually hurting after standing for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been doing the p90x routine for the past couple weeks which takes it&#x27;s toll on the body.</li>
            <li> I usually come home and jump in the bath not to mention the aching feet from standing all day.</li>
            <li> not sure why.</li>
            <li> I also added a small amount of lavender oil to the bath.</li>
            <li> expensive than regular Epson Salts.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Not only is epsom salt soothing for tired muscles after a day in the garden, the added lavender is relaxing for my senses!</li>
            <li> If you have ever smelled real lavender or eucalyptus oil you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from severe anxiety, and even with yoga and relaxation exercises, it is very difficult for me to truly and completely relax.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with the ziploc of the bag.</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard work out.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I take the time to soak at least once/week for body and soul</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been helping my boyfriend lately on his construction job and all my muscles ache when I get home.</li>
            <li> That was remedied by a couple of thick applications of lotion, though.</li>
            <li> and I knew from past trips my feet would be hurting!</li>
            <li> The only downside I noted other than the price is that the salts dried out the bottoms of my feet horribly.</li>
            <li> With the cold weather we have had and the heat running non stop my skin has been horribly dry.</li>
            <li> &amp; well, I must declare that Dr Teals Epsom&#x27;s Salt is seriously miraculous!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant with horrible leg pain and insomnia.</li>
            <li> brand is a little on the expensive side for \\&quot;flavored\\&quot; epson salts, but the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; makes it number 1 for my use.........to stretch it out a bit</li>
            <li> I hurt my back in a bad fall at work 2 years ago..</li>
            <li> I discovered this product back when I had a really bad ankle sprain.  </li>
            <li> My muscles were so sore that I had to take Ibuprofen, but as you know it&#x27;s not good for body, so I decided to try non-swallowing methods.</li>
            <li> I have been doing Insanity lately and my muscles have been on fire!</li>
            <li> then I expected but its not to bad after a couple minuets I use it for my nightly bath before bed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone though who has achy and tired muscles.</li>
            <li> Alas it is not.  </li>
            <li> No stars for the irritating smell.</li>
            <li> As we know, epsom salt is reknown for soothing sore and tired muscles.</li>
            <li> My feet were so tired, sore and aching all over.</li>
            <li> I like it in the bath or for soaking tired and achy feet.  </li>
            <li> The warms of the tub and the Epsom salt soothed my tired body and the fragrance and warmth</li>
            <li> I was in a lot of pain from the delivery and, although very tired, had a hard time falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I used these salts to soak my feet after a long, brutal day of standing on them for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> the salt on the inside of the bad does make it hard to reclose through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with body aches that make sleeping difficult.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to identify with any of the characters.</li>
            <li> I got an instant headache from the nasty synthetic perfume smell!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchase this.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel anymore relaxed sadly</li>
            <li> &quot; I had failed to notice this before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The way that it helped with the  aches, pains caused by everyday stress and hard work or play I am amazed!!!!!</li>
            <li> search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing.</li>
            <li> In addition to using this to sooth my aching muscles, I also let me daughter who suffers from eczema in this when having a flare up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and suffers from a lot of pain in the legs and joints</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong buying this!</li>
            <li> My kids, who were downstairs at the time, even complained of the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Impossible to reseal the bag</li>
            <li> Smells so bad it will make your lungs hurt.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, triggered by heat or friction or stress, I get a painful outbreak.</li>
            <li> Omg, this stuff smells so bad it literally made me sick.</li>
            <li> Awful smell and useless package.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> I hated the scent.</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it helped my rear at all, but after my bath the scent was so awful to me, that I had to shower twice to get it off.</li>

            <li> Very calming, used in a bath, it helped me sleep, relieved my aches, and the smell of the essential oil takes bathing to a whole new level of relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free complimentary of Smiley360 to give my honest opinion and review. I was taken back with how big of a bag I astually received. I was worried when I opened the bag because the smell was super strong and took my breath. I had seen on Pinterest about a detox bath so I decided that&#x27;s how I would use this product. I ran the bath water and let the salts dissolve into the water and I got into it. The smell was good and really calmed down once it was out of the bag and dissolved. I&#x27;m not much of a bath person so I couldn&#x27;t sit in it for 20 mins like what was recommended. It left me feeling pretty tired and my skin was somewhat softer rhan it was before. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference afterwards but that&#x27;s probably because I didn&#x27;t stay in the tub as long as directed. I would recommend this product to anyone though who has achy and tired muscles.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. makes a great foot soak or total body soak. Very highly scents with lavender. Very calming and leaves skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am an avid gym goer, as much as my schedule allows. After a long day and a tough workout, such as a bootcamp class or spinning this has been a lifesaver. Being a quite tall guy, this is a great excuse to soak in the tub and relax. The soothing lavender scent helps me wind down after a 16 hour day and the salt truly helps to soothe my muscles. I thought this was totally a gimmick, but not the case. I would recommend this to anyone with arthritis especially, but its perfect for post gym sore muscles! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love to take baths. What better way to relax with Dr Teals Lavender Epsom salt. I enjoy a hot bath with the lavender salt in the evening time helps me to relax and have a good nights sleep. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good product. Very relaxing. I would definitely recommend it. Please check price at local grocery store, I got it around $5</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for review from Smiley 360 and I am glad that I did. I love taking baths and this product makes it so much more enjoyable.  I am left soft, silky and relaxed....my whole family is happier for it since I get a better nights sleep after use.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teals epsom salt works wonders for me. It leaves me feeling relaxed, refreshed and smelling great. I got this product for free and thankful i did.</li>
            <li> I received Dr. Teals Soothe &amp; Sleep Epsom Salt Soaking Solution from Smiley360 for free, for my review, while I received free product- This review is my opinion 100% and not that of Smiley 360:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Epsom salt user, i&#x27;ve been through several different brands, scents and so on. I LOVED the lavender scent, it filled the entire bathroom of the peaceful smell which made relaxing before getting into the tub every more better.&lt;br /&gt;It did it&#x27;s job of soothing my aching muscles, and I got a better nights sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this was the best epsom salt i&#x27;ve used in a long time, did as the package stated it would, and I would recommend to friends, family, and anyone I could.</li>
            <li> Love the salts.....like the smell...</li>
            <li> Oh this wonderful product is perfect for tired parents, overworked grownups, and sore athletes. After a long day of home schooling the kids, working part time, and being new to obstacle courses and 5Ks, I am often worn out, sore, and exhausted. Even with all of that some times I struggle to turn off my brain and go to sleep. I&#x27;ve found soaking in a warm bath with Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Salts helps me to relax and eases any sore muscles. It smells so lovely and my skin is soft after the bath. The lavender works so well my children are usually sound asleep when I emerge from my bath. I think the lavender scent coming from the bathroom puts them right to sleep when normally they would stay awake reading. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many friends and I recommend it to you as well! It&#x27;s turned me from a shower only girl to one who loves a good bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free from Smiley360. All opinions are my own in this honest review.</li>
            <li> If there was only one word that I could use to describe Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt it would be exhilarating! I received a bag of Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt for free from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review and I was so happy!  I have rheumatoid arthritis and have a lot of flare-ups in my joints and was praying for a relaxing, soothing bath and I was not disappointed!  I soaked for 45 minutes and did not want to get out of the bath.  The Lavender smell is so refreshing and my body felt so smooth and my joints felt relaxed.  When I don&#x27;t have time for a bath, I soak my feet and still have a wonderful experience.  Any opinions I offer are 100% my own and I say Thank you, Dr. Teal - this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this Epsom salt! You can buy it at Wal-Mart for a really good price. It has many more uses then just using it in the bathtub to relax in. This is one of my favorite bath products and my favorite epsom salt by far! I received this free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I loved Dr.Teals Lavender Epsom.Salts.It was sooooooo soothing and relaxing.IT really relaxed me.Great feel,Great smell.I got 100% Free as a Smiley360 member.</li>
            <li> I bought a huge bag of this on a whim recently.  I like the scent of lavender and I have had good results taking baths soaking in epsom salts in the past, and this combined the two, so I figured I was guaranteed to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and put two cups under warm running water.  All of it dissolved by the time the tub was about half full (I did swirl the water around some to get the product to evenly distribute).  It smelled absolutely wonderful.  I put a hair treatment in my hair, wrapped my hair up under a processing cap, and got into the tub to soak (and read) for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could smell the lavender the whole time.  I didn&#x27;t have terrible muscle aches when I got in, but I did feel relaxed and pretty much pain free when I got out.  This did not irritate my skin and it did not leave any sort of residue on my skin or in the tub.  I do think I slept well afterwards, though I don&#x27;t know how much of that to attribute to this product.  At any rate, these bath salts certainly set a relaxing mood, and that was much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: two cups is one third to one half of the 3 lb bag, so you will go through this pretty quickly if you take more than one bath in it a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this made for a very relaxing and peaceful soak in the tub.  I&#x27;m glad I still have half the bag left.  I&#x27;m going to try to save it until next weekend!</li>
            <li> I received Dr. Teals Soothe &amp; Sleep Epsom Salt Soaking Solution from Smiley360 for free, for my review, while I received free product- This review is my opinion 100% and not that of Smiley 360:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved this product!

            <li> I would advise everyone to rush out and get this amazing product!!:-)</li>
            <li> I am not completely sold on the smell yet since it is a bit strong, but it is great to pour into a hot shower in the morning and rub on your skin. Taking a bath with it relaxed every muscle in my body. I will continue to use it. FYI I received this free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for relaxing after a long work out! I love the lavender scent and it made my skin feel really smooth! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I hurt my back in a bad fall at work 2 years ago.. Physical Therapy has since ended.. This product now helps give me the relief I need to make it through the toughest of days.. And the lavender scent helps relax my always active mind so I can sleep much better at nights.. My family is thankful for the free sample from Smiley360 #FreeSample #Smiley360</li>
            <li> I recently just had a baby and used Dr. Tills lavender Epsom salts soaking solution and it felt wonderful! I&#x27;ve also used it for my boys when they&#x27;re having a rough night and can&#x27;t fall asleep it&#x27;s wonderful for stress relieving and everything else!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product from smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got to try Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salts free through Smiley360. The first thing I noticed was that the scent is a nice, natural &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; lavender. I prepared a bath, it says to use 2 cups. Given this, a bag will not last long, and it is rather expensive. You can get plain epsom salts much cheaper. However, it was very relaxing in the bath, it smelled nice, and I did enjoy it. The only downside I noted other than the price is that the salts dried out the bottoms of my feet horribly. That was remedied by a couple of thick applications of lotion, though.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It only takes a small amount added to a bath. While you soak, it eases tension. I would recommend this product to anyone. The lavender smell is an added bonus. The smell lingered in my bathroom for quite some time after my bath. If you want to feel like you&#x27;ve been at a spa without the spa price, I&#x27;d pick this product up. I did receive this product for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> I had s very stressful week and decided to give this a try and it helped me relax!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to try this product for free in return to give my honest feedback. I have used other Epsom salt baths, and this Lavender Soaking solution from Dr. Teal&#x27;s is by far the best. I love the light, soothing scent. It leaves my skin so soft, and I enjoy the fact that Epsom salt has detoxifying properties in it as well!! It&#x27;s a great way to end my stressful day.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution. I workout a lot and there are many days I am very sore. A nice hot soak with these helps soothe my muscles and get me ready for the next workout! Not to mention it smells amazing. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this have a calming and beautiful scent it also work Amazingly well!! I go on hikes about twice a month (20+ miles) and when I get home my muscles are achy and sore. So I always look forward to soaking in a tub with Dr Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salts, it help me unwind and gives my body the relief it needs without having to use over the counter pain relief pills. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel really nice. Loved it</li>
            <li> The salts activated well in the water and the scent was a pleasant lavender.  I did have small scratches and cuts on my feet so they stung in the salt water.  But that is not the product&#x27;s fault, of course, just beware of that.</li>
            <li> I was worried with other reviews saying that the smell was super strong but I did not find this to be the case I did however use less than the package states per bath so that may also help if the smell gets to you. Very relaxing after a long day!</li>
            <li> I was advised to buy this due to muscular aches and pains and it was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT go over what they tell you otherwise you will itch, my husband thought&lt;br /&gt;he was doing me a favor running my bath, and tripling the dose thinking it may triple the effect.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG&lt;br /&gt;Really do suggest that you buy this, its excellent.</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite brands of epsom salt; if the strong \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; smell is not what you&#x27;re going for however, this product may not be for you. Personally, the smell was perfect once combined with the hot bath water but of coarse on its own can be very over powering. I keep it in a cool cabinet in the bathroom to avoid the headache I know I would get whiffing it every time I walk by. I might want to try some different scents to see if they&#x27;re all over powering but aside from that it would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li> cant live without epsom salt and love this one lavender scent is nice before bed to help calm and sleep</li>
            <li> I religiously used Calgon or Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Crystals... until now. From a price stand point, you really get so much more bang for your buck with the Epsom Salt. A bag typically lasts me and the hubby 6-8 months; pretty impressive considering I also use the epsom salts for crafts. In short, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I use this in my foot bath. After using this, my feet feel amazing. So soft. I also really like the scent. It is a strong lavender smell, but when diluted with water, it isn&#x27;t as strong. Great price, better than anything local I have found. Quick shipping, and I was using this product within a day of ordering it. I haven&#x27;t used it in the bath yet, but my feet love it.</li>
            <li> Stressed mind from work and achy muscles from intense workouts are all relieved with Dr. Teals Epsom Salt! The lavender smells wonderful, very relaxing! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has so many uses, smells great, and works great. I love the relaxing lavender. This should be in every house. Great quality. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal is so soothing and smells great.  The price is so reasonable.  My free sample made it even better.  Thank You Smiley360 and Dr. Teal.  If my feet could smile they would.</li>
            <li> I like this. It helps my feet after working 2 jobs everyday I come and soak.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the packaging will not reseal.  Had to get a Ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love this product; it relaxed my muscles within 2 minutes!  After I had a very good sleep too!  In general, epsom salts are a wonderful way to sooth my sore muscles. I use them regularly in the evenings, after workouts, and as a follow-up to massage or my chiropractor appointments. USing the Lavender Soak made me feel oh so special.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Teals. I especially love this Lavender soaking solution! The aroma is very calming before i even get into the tub! It eases the tension in my muscles and allows me to be stress free right before i hop in bed! It leaves your skin feeling nice &amp; smooth. I like to exfoliate after i&#x27;ve soaked for a while. It really does the job! I am very happy with this product and i would recommend it to everyone! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got to try Dr. Teals Epsom Salt Soaking Solution through Smiley 360 where I got to try the product for free in turn for authentic feedback. I absolutely LOVE this product. It is great for aches, pains, and detoxing. The scent is very relaxing and pleasant. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t make me break out in the bath.  If it&#x27;s a bit too strong, just buy one bag unscented, one bag scented, and mix them in equal amounts in your bath. Still get the amazing lavender, but not quite so overwhelming for the scentedly-challenged among us. I got this for free for the purpose of reviewing it from Smiley360 and was pleasantly surprised, and all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried epsom salt before, but not this lavender one. It was so soothing and so calming. I have a lot of stress in my life and this definitely helped. It helped my feet and also helped the appearance all the while my mind was a lot calmer.</li>
            <li> I just like the fragrance of this Lavender Epsom Salt and find a good bath soak refreshing with this product. I find the smell nice and strong so if Lavender smell is not your thing, this may be overly strong smell. I usually add scents to the plain Epsom Salt so this allows me to have the best of both world. I usually buy this locally but was lazy so got it on line. I especially like to use after a day of laboring in the garden.</li>
            <li> I just recently had tried this stuff and I have to say I was quite impressed. This stuff is great. I took a nice warm bath after adding this to the water. I loved it. It felt great. I enjoyed the relaxing scent and it did feel very soothing. I Loved the scent and the feel of my skin after using in a bath. I really do think this adds to my relaxation when I add it to my baths. I&#x27;m really enjoying this now. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free bag from Smiley360 to try and I am so happy I did. I love the soothe and sleep Dr. Teals bath salts they are perfect with baking soda and a little bit of ground ginger to sweat out all the nasty toxins in my body . I also love soaking in it after a long day of work and a long day of teaching dance. You can also use the salts to make a nice body scrub.  The scent is relaxing and it does help for a peaceful night. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends and family. I love their bath soaks and body washes and as a dancer I love the Dr. Teal&#x27;s foot soak!</li>
            <li> I received this product courtesy of Smiley 360. I take baths all the time and prefer them over showers. I was so excited to try out Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender. It smells so good! I am already on my third bag! I have been using it every time I take a bath and it helps when my body hurts from walking or lifting too much. It also makes my skin feel really soft. I always take my baths at night so I love the Lavender scent because it is really calming. I try to take time for myself but it does not always happen but occasionally it does and there is nothing like lighting a few candles and soaking in a Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender bath! I even purchased the body wash at Walmart! Before this Mission I had never heard of Dr. Teal&#x27;s or any of there products and now it is a staple in my house. I will definitely continue to purchase  Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender and other Dr. Teal Products too!! I loved the insert that came with My SmileyKit that showed all of the different uses for Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts Soaking Solution in Soothe &amp; Sleep with Lavender. I knew that it was for soaking sore muscles but I had no idea you could use it as a body scrub. I mixed some Dr. Teal&#x27;s with some body wash and used it as a scrub and it worked really well and made my skin feel great! I also used it on my lips too. I just mixed a little bit with Vaseline and my lips were really soft. When Summer comes back around I plan on using this as a sunburn and splinter remedy. My favorite way to use this though is as a bath soak. It is so relaxing and makes my skin feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> I have never had such a fantastic, relaxing bath experience without bubbles! The scent is so soothing and smells really good. The scent seems a bit strong if you smell it from the bag, but once it hits the water it isn&#x27;t as strong. You still get the wonderful scent, but its not overpowering. Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is great to use for a 20 minute tub soak to help de-stress your body. I like to mix it with a little baking soda and just soak and relax after a hard day for about 20 minutes. It dissolves smoothly and smells great. \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  These salts smell amazing and helped me relax in a hot bath after a long day at work. They are cheaper at other stores compared to Amazon but they are worth a try :)</li>
            <li> I love the soothing relaxation feeling that Teal&#x27;s bath salts give, I definitely will buy and use.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and relaxing product.  Fast Delivery.  Great transaction.</li>
            <li> The best product out there. I love the lavender snell is so refreshing and calming.  Perfect For A Long Day A Work get home to a nice hot bath with Dr. TEAL. LOL. just perfect can&#x27;t express how happy I am after using this. I received the product as a courtesy of smiley360 to try it and give a review.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wanted a relaxing bath this is the product for you. When I first received this for free to review I was a bit skeptical. I was more of a bubble bath person and rarely used Epsom Salt. I was afraid the scent would be too strong as well but I was quickly proven wrong. This epsom salt was amazing and relaxing. It is small crystals as opposed to the larger ones that you can feel grated at the bottom of your tub when you&#x27;re finished. This was able to melt quickly and provide a light aroma that was soothing. I usually suffer from mild back pain, having a desk job and sitting most of the day will do that. I did notice a lot of improvement after my first bath with epsom salts just relaxing my muscles. I am super happy that I was able to review this epsom salt and it gives me a great feeling to go out and try the rest of this line! All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this epsom salt! the scent was amazing and so relaxing! With the cold weather we have had and the heat running non stop my skin has been horribly dry. using this in my bath helped heal my skin and keep my skin soft for days afterwards! I will definitely be using this again and would purchase repeatedly!I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I love the Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt!! It relieves my achy muscles and the lavender scent is very relaxing. &#x27;&#x27;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Recently, I received  this product for free in exchange of my opinion. &amp; well, I must declare that Dr Teals Epsom&#x27;s Salt is seriously miraculous!&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling so stressed with all of my school work until i decided to take a bath with the Epsom Salt. Not only did I feel relaxed afterwards, but my skin also felt so new and refreshed.  It was a great stress-suppressor!</li>
            <li> Awful smell and useless package. Try another one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great</li>
            <li> Relieves my body aches.</li>
            <li> They claim to use natural Essential Oils.  First off they are last on the list so very little is used.  Secondly they use a lot of &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34;  So much in fact that it made my skin itch.  Not a little but a lot. If you have any reaction to &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; at all avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I add this to all my baths for muscle aches. Pair it with the foaming bath for a replacing experience.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I liked the overpowering lavender scent, especially being pregnant.  If you love lavender you will love this, although I&#x27;m curious if it was natural or artificially scented.  I&#x27;ll buy unscented next time.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad it will make your lungs hurt. &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; is often synthetic and this can be found in the ingredients. When will companies realize that they need to get rid of synthetics and stick with natural ingredients, like actual Lavendar oils - the ingredient AFTER &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in these salts.</li>
            <li> Perfect, the same stuff I bought at target but was too lazy to go back. Does what it says. Helps swelling and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have never taken an Epsom salt bath in my life, so this review is based solely on THIS product, not in comparison to any others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in complete disbelief at how I am feeling right now. I just got done soaking in this product and have never felt this level of relaxation in my life. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, and will be telling everyone I know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will warn about however, is how I felt getting out of the tub. I was very lightheaded (likely from the heat) and needed to sit down immediately. My body was SO relaxed that I felt like I could not even lift my feet to walk. Initially I almost felt as though I had taken a muscle relaxer. By far the deepest level of relaxation I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so awesome, and very cheap. I bought mine at Walmart in the bath section for around $5 and I will get 2-3 baths out of it. Worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li> after a long week of cleaning the basement and moving books and shelves my body would be aching in places I soon learned how out of shape I truly am.  I just want to go to bed but covered in dust in who knows what else (I usually get calgon, but kmart didn&#x27;t have my favorite scent; but I saw on the shelf Dr. Teal epsom salt in Lavender flavor the price was very cheap so I got it and placed it on my bathroom shelf)I decided to try Dr. Teal epsom salt and lots of hot water. the smell was very pleasant and soft to my nose I just sat and enjoy the smell for a while, but when I got out I felt wonderful and the soft scent was relaxing, which meant no problem falling asleep. I have told my friends and a few on facebook.</li>
            <li> wife loves it, i enjoy it. I dont know enough to tell you how good it is, but my wife seems to love it and i am &amp;#34;feeling it&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I buy it every time I run out.  Nothing is better than a bath after a long day at the office and having epsom salt and lavender smells added to the bath just makes it that much more incredible! I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s cheap and to me seems just as good as the expensive stuff!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the lavender Epsom salt but received the rosemary and mint with no excuse as to why</li>
            <li> Package was cut with a box cutter, contents all splilled inside  box and all over the infinity figure sets in same box.  So I have eps on salts inside gifts I got for a birthday present and half the salt wasted. I wrote to amazon and heard nothing.</li>
            <li> Somewhat artificial smell, but ok. At least is better than the chamomile one, which is terribly artificial and unbearable.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I expected, given the price, for the smell to be faint, but it is a very good quality salt.  Compared to other brands, its the best and very competitive in price! I am very pleased and have just ordered another bag!</li>
            <li> Made in the USA. Pleasant scent, leaves you feeling refreshed and rested. Healing to the soul!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t sleep, this is great an relaxing also. I have all ways had a problem getting to sleep.  Now I put this in my bath. I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth skin feel when used as a body scrub but  the lavender smell is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> This smells so wonderful!  It is a pleasure to soak in the bathtub with this lavender Epsom salt!  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> There is nothing more relaxing than a soak in bath with Dr Teals lavender Epsom salt!  The lavender scent is frequently out of stock in our local market - as always I can depend on Amazon to have what I need and ship it quickly! If you enjoy a warm soak then give this product a try! The lavender scent is lovely and very soothing/relaxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be upfront: I have anxiety and so I&#x27;m always searching for ways to calm the hell down so I can keep being productive in my social and work life. Along with some great, free meditation apps on the iphone, Dr. Teals lavender bath relaxes me like nothing else. I&#x27;ll light a candle, turn off the light, close the door, turn on some zen music (like air) or a meditation app (like Mindfulness, or anything from Andrew Johnson) and just soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt really makes my skin look gorgeous, and probably the relaxation helps against break-outs too. I spend some time rubbing the salt water on my face, it permeates the smell, and also (I think) cleanses my facial area. After the bath I slather on some Chanel moisturizer and I feel like a straight up pampered little princess. TREAT YO SELF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously the only bad thing about this product is I wish I could buy it in the size of those large dog food bags, instead of these little dinky ones. The instructions say 2 cups per bath, but I usually only use a cup or a half cup to make it go longer. At this point, this is the only thing that can upgrade our crappy, american-style-apartment bathtub into a marginally respectable spa night alone.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the feel,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give my feet the attention they deserve. As a working woman I just don&#x27;t have the time to. I found this and decided to try it out. The essential oil is lavender, my favorite, and it smells amazing. Soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the bag closed.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this entire life of projects esp the foaming bath ones that are liquid 😍 these are soooo good and 1/4th the cost of bath and body works but just as good! I really like these If I&#x27;m sore from a workout, massage, or can&#x27;t sleep. So relaxing and helps my muscles</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, whether it works or not!  It makes me feel better and it smells nice. I even use it to soak dogs paws when she has pimples between her toes.  This stuff opens them up and cleans them out.  It was recommended by my Vet</li>
            <li> I periodically purchase this for use in my bath.  Smells good and seems to be comparable to other brands on the market.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So the smell is strong but kind of strong but it makes ur storing area pretty nice:) all in all it works as stated... the salt on the inside of the bad does make it hard to reclose through.</li>
            <li> The delivery took a bit of time...After just one soak with the salt, it seemed to work. I think it actually work the first time. It has a strong lavender smell :x</li>
            <li> There is no scientific evidence to support Epsom Salt relieving muscle pain or speeding healing. Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RunnersConnect Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Epsom Salt Baths an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries? by John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Conclusion...Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury. Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways hold up to any scrutiny either.&amp;#34; -- John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PainScience Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Epsom Salts Work? by Paul Ingraham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing. I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain. Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it twice, each time it was $4.98.  Now I come to buy it and it&#x27;s twice that price -- what you guys are paying for is THE STARS this item has received.  This item rated so high that they doubled the price.  I won&#x27;t be buying it so this is a sale lost.</li>
            <li> I love salt bath and I love lavender. I usually enjoy Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt from costco, but enjoy this one for more relaxing time!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. My father found them very relaxing when I did his feet in a spa tub.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is my second order!</li>
            <li> Love this! It helps with my psoriasis. I buy it at target for about $3 though.</li>
            <li> Soothing,relaxing I highly recommend for anyone looking a relaxed soak in their bathtub! Great scent also A+++++</li>
            <li> I got this for soaking in the tub, which I love to do in the winter. I&#x27;ve already used up this package and plan on ordering more, it&#x27;s a very nice scent, and really relaxes me. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand soaking in too strong of perfumes.  This definitely seems more of a natural aromatic oil used and soaking with it in the bath tub definitely helps me relax.</li>
            <li> but this is a nice scent. I love lavender and the smell is really nice and relaxing. I wish amazon would make this a regular product. The add on program is BS</li>
            <li> I like the strong odor and it also seems to intensify the massage effect when usedin a foot spa, combined very relaxing and mentally therapuetic.</li>
            <li> Purchased many times. Smells fantastic and feels great. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> they smell beautiful and are a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> The package came with a huge hole in it and all the product was out of it and ruined a Barbie doll that was also in the box.  :(</li>
            <li> I love lavender, and this smells very fresh just like real lavender. I put about 1/2 cup in my bath while it&#x27;s running and it makes the water smell and feel fantastic. The salts dissolve easily and it is very soothing on sore muscles. I often take baths with this when I have migraines and it makes them go away. Lavender has healing properties and Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender salt solution definitely makes me feel healed and relaxed. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves salts and baths.</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is another that smells great and is so relaxing.  She thinks it is a good product and recommends it</li>
            <li> Just got this today. My trainer recommended it!!  I love it!!!!  Used it twice today!!  My skin feels so soft and kind of invigorated!!  I bought this along with oz naturals sweet almond and macadamia nut body butter.  Seriously. I feel like I figured out a priceless answer!!!</li>
            <li> It works!  I add it to my foottub, and get to relaxing.  The lavender scent is great.  It is a good size bag so the bag is a great size.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Teals and was using it nightly!  Felt great, smelled good and was very, very relaxing. BUT THE PRICE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED!  Its gone up from just under $5 a bag to over $10 per bag. I understand price increases but cant accept an increase that is more than double. Bye, Dr Teal, its been nice knowing you.</li>
            <li> Was hoping the salt would more completely dissolve in the bath water, but it left quite a bit of residue in the tub.  More economical when purchased at a big box store.</li>
            <li> After hearing many suggestions to use epsom ssalt for my back problems, I decided to order Dr. Teals products and give it a try. Since it was my first time using it I wanted something scented but not too strong. I ordered the lavender scent, amber vanilla, and  the chamomile (This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far). It&#x27;s safe to say I was blown away by how well this worked! Not only was the scent wonderful and not overbearing, I came out of the bath feeling calm and it was very helpful with my aches and pains. I&#x27;ve started recommending these salts to anyone who will listen. Definitely going to be coming back to order more once my supply is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: The bags are bigger than they thought I would be, and are actually a good value for the price. From my view, you can get 10 baths out of one bag if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t overdo it with the salt. Hope everyone is as impressed as I was.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and kept swelling away during my pregnancy! i would say order quite a few bags since its suggested you use 2 cups per bath. i ordered 10 bags and lasted me quite a while - and i take a bath every night.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the smell could last a little longer when added to the tub.</li>
            <li> Great product and really helps to relax my stress filled muscles. Wish the product was still on add on status</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this bath salt. the lavender is just perfect and fills up the room. Its great for muscle soreness and when you just need some time to yourself. My only concern is the price/quantity value. I have found that it is much cheaper to simply purchase a bottle of lavender aromatherapy oil and plain sea salt.</li>
            <li> The smell can be overpowering at first but once it&#x27;s dissolved in water, it doesnt smell so strong. I love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful relaxation product for bath.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.  Seller sent a reply to my email promptly. The expiration date was rubbed off but I decided to try it.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin but I got itchy spots and had to get a shower to rinse it all out.  Please don&#x27;t go by my response.  It could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and will again.  It is a lovely lightly scented Epsom salts for the bath, and helps soak away aches and pains in sore joints.  I have noticed that it makes my silver necklace slightly tarnish if I wear it in the tub with this in it, but solution to that is easy.</li>
            <li> Just grab a handful and throw it under the hot running water while your bath fills up. Pour your glass of wine, get your Netflix up and ready. Then enjoy soaking in this wonderfully smelling salt for an hour or so. When you get out, your skin will be so silky and hydrated feeling you won&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I love taking a relaxing bath here and there, and this is a new staple for me!</li>
            <li> Smells so good, relaxing, though it could be a little overpowering. Be careful not too put too much into the water.</li>
            <li> The touch of lavender makes an Epsom salt bath that much better! So soothing; a great way to relax after a long run. :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite ways to unwind after a long day, a hot bath with Dr. Teal&#x27;s lavender epsom salt; perfect for sore muscles and insomniac nights and every other stressful thing life can throw at you.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> Why people spend a fortune on bubble bath products when they can use Epsom salt is beyond me. Our mothers and grandmothers did it right. Espom salt is a tested, wonderful, way to detoxify your body and skin. Although I normally would buy the Espom salt cheaper at a grocery store, I love the lavender scent and the convenience of having it delivered to my door step. I pour it in a beautiful vintage glass container to make it extra luxe.</li>
            <li> very relaxing&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;are larger containers available and where?&lt;br /&gt;will buy again and again, keep it in stock</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in Epsom Salts and these work great. The scent is really nice and helps induce a nice sleep after bath time.</li>
            <li> I only wanted epsom salts with essential oils.  This one has added fragrance, or perfume, which can give me headaches.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to relax and spend moments in stress free peace.  The fragrance is lovely and you only need to use half of the recommended measurement.</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff. A couple of years ago I bought Walgreen&#x27;s lavender epsom salt and loved it. When that wasn&#x27;t available I tried Dr. Teal&#x27;s. Stinky and perfumey, not at all like a real lavender smell. Do yourself a favor and get plain epsom salt and, if you like, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> i love this product but save your money. The exact same product in the same size is $4.99 at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s is the truth! The smell of lavender takes over my bathroom. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa.</li>
            <li> This product is without expiration date. It&#x27;s look like somebody cover the date with a UPC CODE.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon for lack of finding it locally.  I am very happy with the product.  It does wonders for my senior achy body. It is mainly simple Epsom Salts. I had hoped it would be lavender in color so I could put it in a clear decanter in my bathroom.  Alas it is not.  Just looks like Epsom Salts with crusty bits.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Smells great and feels great! I use a bag a week😍 Price is great also!! 5 stars for me</li>
            <li> these are inexpensive and they smell terrific. i love that they come in multiple scent options. i just wish amazon had better stock, because i really like them and want to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> I work five days a week.so on a friday i put this in my hot tub and relax.will definitely buy more cause this gets rid of aches and pain and relaxes you.</li>
            <li> I think I bought this as an add-on.  The scent is nice, but it is regularly too much money (the item + shipping) that I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy it this way, I would purchase at local store where I don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> A very enjoyable scent and love it.  Would buy it again.  Enjoyed so much while soaking my body.  I feel it&#x27;s a must have for bathing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr Teals Epsom salts for years and loved it but every bag I have bought in the past few months has a VERY strong smell. It is not tolerable and I struggle to breath after pouring not even a lot in the running water. I looked at the back of the bag to notice that it now contains added fragrance. Why add synthetic fragrance when it smelled great and worked fine with just the essential oils?! I had to back to buying unscented Epsom salts and manually add my own lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I yes this for chronic inflammation. Seems to soothe my muscles. For sure use thus product after a massage. Great product.</li>
            <li> Now I know why my parents swore by epsom salt.  A good soak helps you feel better if you&#x27;ve overworked your body and this has lavender - yumm.</li>
            <li> Lovely, relaxing, soothing product.  Perfect for a cooling bath on a hot night or for just easing aches, strains and stress.  Lasts a long time and is priced well.</li>
            <li> Used to soak feet great stress reliever after a long day of work. Leaves body feeling energectic and it smells great</li>
            <li> I love it. They are great. I love bath salt and this product is perfect. It smells really good and you don&#x27;t need to use that much of them</li>
            <li> But not the B.O. part. Those people down in that part of the world don&#x27;t bathe properly and that&#x27;s not just a stereotype! But you can bathe properly! With this stuff! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Excellent for foot bath, and very gentle but healing and will purchase more eventually in the near future or when this runs-dry...</li>
            <li> Considering this is $6:49 at my local CVS, I would not waste the money buying it here. It is a great product but not at over double the cost.</li>
            <li> Early delivery and wonderful product</li>
            <li> Epsom salt came highly recommend to me from a physical therapist while I was dealing with a hip injury. It can be pretty hard to find in stores and also very pricy. Dr. Teals is a great buy giving you good amount of epsom in a resealable bag for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, you could eat it. That&#x27;s always a good sign when you put something like this in your tub that gets absorbed into your skin. Price is great too. And this size is large. Lavender is nice for helping you sleep and relax. I have bought several of these and give some away as gifts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Epsom Salt baths, but the added touch of Lavender makes this even more soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s take me away!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff! The scent is so strong and lovely! A must have for a relaxing bath to ease your aching body and soul!&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the lavender over the chamomile. The chamomile smells very perfumy whereas this one smells more like essential oil.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it really helps with sore muscles. In an attempt to lose weight, I have been exercising really hard, doing a lot of Zumba, Hard Core, Total body sculpt, weight lifting, etc. My muscles were so sore that I had to take Ibuprofen, but as you know it&#x27;s not good for body, so I decided to try non-swallowing methods. This baby really helped with my muscles. It also helps relax you so you sleep soundly.</li>
            <li> I open this bag when I arrive to new hotel rooms.  It makes the room more inviting.  Feels good in a soothing bag before bed.</li>
            <li> Soothes achy muscles with a calming lavender scent. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I hated the scent. It gave me a headache because it was so strong but I used this as a foot soak and it worked great. My feet are usually hurting after standing for 8 hours. Dr. Teals made my feet feel so much better! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this free from Smiley 360 to try out and review...I loved it. It was so relaxing to sit in a bath and feel how good and smooth and relaxed my body felt from it...I also loved the scent. I shared with some family members and they absolutely agreed. And for the cheap price..it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution. I pulled a muscle in my lower back and I was very sore. A nice hot soak with the Dr. Teals Lavender Epson Salt helped soothe my muscles and relax me for a good night&#x27;s sleep.  It also smells amazing.  I would highly recommend it for everyone to try.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it works wonders after a nice long run.</li>
            <li> I truly love this for relaxing after a busy long day.There are other uses for Dr. Teal&#x27;s that I never would have such as body scrubs, lip exfoliants, and foot soaks. The smell is awesome, it&#x27;s very relaxing. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag i was amazed at the strong calming scent. I used a little over a cup of epsom salt in my bath water for 3 days straight and my skin is so soft and smooth and smells so good. i love it!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free bag of Dr Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I love to use Dr Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom salt in my foot spa! I love how it makes my tired feet feel, I also really like the ways iit smells! It really helps mme to relax and to relieve a little stress!</li>
            <li> I take a bath 3-4 times a week to help me unwind at nights. It is something I always look forward to. But my experience just took a huge boost when I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution. It helps calm my aching muscles and I love how relaxed it makes me feel. The aroma of the lavender is the perfect amount- strong enough but not over powering. Great product that will become a regular for me!</li>
            <li> Loved the smell.  So relaxing...arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I suffer extreme muscle and nerve pain on occasion and a good hot soak and Dr.Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts does the trick. The fragrance is a plus. Actually plain Epsom salts works but Dr. Teals has the best Lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt. The smell is indeed soothing. Not perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to get this product at my local grocery store for $5.99 for a three pound bag. This is almost twice that. I like the product but I&#x27;m going to have think really hard about spending that much for bath salt.</li>
            <li> Best to be used just before bed.</li>
            <li> OH MY! Just do it and give yourself a nice treat!</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful in relaxing and soothing sore muscles and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s lavender scent is nice too.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product &amp; delivery</li>
            <li> Two stars because it works as epsom salt should for soaking a sprained ankle. No stars for the irritating smell. Take the scent away and I would give five stars.</li>
            <li> Great scent and product but pricier than others. I run out quickly.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant with horrible leg pain and insomnia. The nights I use this product, the leg pain decreases and I can fall asleep easier.</li>
            <li> Perfect for relaxing.. Smells great</li>
            <li> The lavendar oil is potent and relaxing. One bag is good for 3 baths. I use this anytime I feel beat from work or exercise and feel brand new afterwards.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as expected. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> Peace &amp; relaxation! Use it for my kids too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent! Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt. It is especially relaxing and soothing to use in the evening after a long stressful day. My husband also uses this religiously when he trains for bike rides and competitions. It helps with relaxing the muscles and preparing him for his next ride.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the bath for several occasions: after running races, during pregnancy, stiff muscles. Works wonders in these situations!</li>
            <li> I really like the lavender smell and it leaves my skin very soft. The smell is a little strong (as expected for lavender) so I just mix it 1:1 with regular epsom salt. Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I really like this soak.  It smells great and works well.  I used it a lot when I was pregnant, to soak my feet in.  It has a great resealable top bag.</li>
            <li> The aroma is very mild and not overpowering.  I use these \\&quot;salts\\&quot; about 3 times a week to soak my feet and legs (circulation problems).  It&#x27;s difficult to state exactly what they do, but they make my skin softer and help a bit with the muscle pain in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is a little on the expensive side for \\&quot;flavored\\&quot; epson salts, but the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; makes it number 1 for my use.........to stretch it out a bit I cut the \\&quot;dose\\&quot; in half and add some plain (and much less expensive) generic epson salts.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> This product delivers exactly what is promises!  It smells wonderful and I&#x27;ve used it in my bath and sometimes just for the scent!</li>
            <li> The overpowering, perfume-like smell permeated our entire apartment. Did not smell natural but chemical. We won&#x27;t be using the rest of the bag. Too bad!</li>
            <li> Helps with aching muscles and it is great for your skin too. It smells wonderful and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and soothing for all achest and pains. And the lavender scent in calming. Amazing product but can be found cheaper on other sites or in stores.</li>
            <li> I had never tried epsom salt before but when I tried this it relaxed my whole body and let me sleep better. I would recommend this to all my friends. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag I immediately didn&#x27;t care for the smell. It was very overpowering. Once I got it mixed in with the hot bathwater it smelled A LOT better. Was definately relaxing and perfect for sore muscles! I also used it to exfoliate as per the instructions on the bag and it worked great! Skin was so smooth after. Excited to try some of the other scents! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received Dr. Teal&#x27;s Sleep Epsom Salt and Lavender soaking solution, for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own! I have always loved epsom salt baths but one like this, I could never have imagined!. With the addition of lavender, this bath salt helps you to relax enough to fall asleep right after you get out. I love the smell, although it can be overpowering at first. I will definitely be purchasing this after I run out of my sample bag!</li>
            <li> Thanks to  smiley 360 i recieved this product free. i love the smell and how relaxing it is and the fact that it puts you to sleep. i wouldnt buy it from amazon because it is a little bit to pricey for me. other than that i love the product.</li>
            <li> I am a really active person though i am a stay at home mom. I run around all day picking stuff up after my daughter and trying to keep the house clean and after a long day of crazy running around i am sore everywhere . After using this product i can honestly say it has helped a lot, maybe its because i usually dont use anything for my sore muscles, but it helps me feel more normal and i can sleep way better. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great price good quality</li>
            <li> hey guy I received a full size sample of doctor teals Epsom salt from smiley 360 for free, and I can say it was awesome I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;it a great body exfoliator</li>
            <li> I recently tried for the first time and I was amazed on how good I felt after using. I have a hard time relaxing and sleeping due to I stress about the little thngs.&lt;br /&gt;After using Dr.Teals Lavender Epsom Salt I felt all around better and actually got a good night sleep and the scent was wonderful and very relaxing would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.  I pour it in my bath after a long day.  Nothing is more relaxing than smelling the fresh lavender.  The Epsom salts make my body feel so soft &amp; my sore feet feel amazing after climbing out of the tub.  This is such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt. I received it as a free sample, and I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with this product. Not only am I a fan of because its has lavender in it, which is my favorite, but it also relieves me of all my aches and pain. I highly recommend this product to anyone in need of a soaking solution, which happens to work wonders!</li>
            <li> I really Like Dr. Teals Epsom salts! They smell really good, and when I get out of the bath, it makes me feel really relaxed and smelling good. I would buy this again when I go searching for bath salts again :) It also gives me a sense of calm just by smelling them. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> For me, a hot bath at the end of a hard day is the best way to relax. If you want to really treat yourself, I really believe Dr. Teals is the best way. I have used other types of &amp;#34;bath salts&amp;#34; but really like Dr. Teals. The lavender scent just adds an extra calming effect that is not present in some store brands. I would highly recommend trying if you are looking to relax and unwind. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is a bit pricey, but you know how the saying goes - you get what you pay for and sometimes you deserve to pay a little more for a great treat like this! Please note: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was not sure what to expect from this product, but I have since discovered that I absolutely love it!  I am the type of person that only occassionaly takes baths.  It is just hard for me to find time sometimes, and a shower is much quicker.  I have recently started going back to the gym which has left my body feeling tired and sore.  I work 12 hour shifts and am on my feet all day, so between work and starting back at the gym, my body was definitely feeling it!  I used this in the bathtub and it did help my body feel better.  I felt like all over my body the tightness was leaving, and my muscles were less achy over the next couple of days as well.  If I don&#x27;t have time for a bath, but my feet are sore, what I have been doing is just filling a large bowl with warm water and the Epsom salt, for a foot soak.  This is amazing!  Even better than the bath I would say!  My feet feel softer and they are not as sore after I soak them.  Lavender hasn&#x27;t always been my favorite scent, but this scent I actually liked.  It wasn&#x27;t to over powering, yet it seemed to be enough to give you a sense of calmness.  Overall this was a great product, and was in fact better than I was expecting.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> After a long day of chasing my 2 year old daughter around all day at a birthday party at the skating rink, I was exhausted both mentally and physically.  Every single part of my body ached and I didn&#x27;t think I would ever stop hurting, then I remembered the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution that I was sent to review for free by Smiley 360.  After putting my daughter to bed, I started filling the tub with the hottest water that I could stand, and added the Lavender Epsom Salt.  I soaked in the water and salt solution until the water started to cool off, and I noticed that my aches were starting to subside and I was considerably more relaxed.  I have used it several more times both in my bath, and just as a foot soak.</li>
            <li> SO SOOTHING when you&#x27;re stressed. Baths are soothing in general. Add this and you&#x27;re in heaven with lavenders all around you. Relaxes your muscles and just makes you feel great all around. Helps you sleep better because you&#x27;re so relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. (I really do love this)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff after i tried what smiley360 sent me I headed straight to the drug store and bought more Even my 10yr old daughter asks me everytime she takes a bath if i could putt some of that good smelling salt stuff in her bath water.  I had no idea that Epsom salt came in so many different varietiesI remember when it was just unsented and I really wasn&#x27;t very thrilled about putting in my bath water but now im hip to Dr Teals line of Awesome Epsom Salt. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to use this product for the first time. I received a sample pack from smiley360 and loved the way this made my fewt feel after soaking in the tub for 30 minutes. It also helped me sleep more soundly than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Smiley360 to try. I like it. I like the smell of it. It worked very well for me. I felt very relaxed after soaking with it in a bath. I will definitely start buying it.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath soak on the market! I received this free from Smiley360 to sample , it left me smelling so good and feeling my skin soo soft. The lavender helps me relax and unwind,</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get a free bag of this from Smily360 to try out. I LOVED the way it smelled! Like being in a lavender field. Was wonderful as a scrub and in a bath. I dont think it helped with my back pain though, but it was relaxing and nice to get away</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is very relaxing. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product was a wonderful addition to my new bathroom and it was even better that I received it free to try for review purposes. After a long week of moving I enjoyed a nice long soak to relieve my achy muscles and to wash away the hard work and stress. It worked wonderfully and it helped me fall asleep easier with its wonderful relaxing lavender scent!</li>
            <li> Smells Great!! I have not have a chance to use it, but it feels and looks like regular bath salts.  I look forward to using this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loved the smell and how the Epsom salt worked magic on her sore muscles after a long day of being on her feet cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased it from a variety of retailers, and was so glad to find it on Amazon.com.  What&#x27;s better than having an amazing tried-and-true product delivered straight to your home?  I discovered this product back when I had a really bad ankle sprain.  Soaking and applying this stuff with a hot towel didn&#x27;t quite alleviate all of the pain, but it came very close.  I now use this any time I&#x27;ve worked out extensively--epsom salts are known to combate muscle soreness--or when I just need to relax.  The lavender scent is just the right amount, not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I received the product free in order to sample it through BzzAgent.com. I used it after a particularly rough day of working out, cleaning, and dancing. As we know, epsom salt is reknown for soothing sore and tired muscles. I ran the bath, and added the lavender scented Epsom salt, and the first thing that hit me was the really awesome scent! Very soothing in itself! I soaked until the water got tepid, and had a good night&#x27;s sleep. THe next morning, fully expecting sore muscles, I was surprised that I felt great. No stiffness, soreness. I am a convert~</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I love the scent of lavender and also love bath salts...so this is a great product for me. I love the scent and also the relaxing feeling of a good soak with epsom salt . I also like the way my skin feels after bathing with this product and will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I received the sample in the mail and took a bath last night.  It was so relaxing and wonderful.  Plus, the smell was so calming.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received dr teals lavender Epson salts for free from smilely360 and I have to say I loved it. I have been in physical therapy for a back and neck injury from a car accident and it really relieves my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teals lavender epsom salt is a relaxing way to take off the edge of the day. I&#x27;m a huge fan of soaking at the end of the day with a glass of wine (I know, cliche...) and I&#x27;ve discovered Dr. Teals Epsom Salts are the way to go. I started using this when I was pregnant with my son and having contractions around 29 weeks. My midwife suggested warm baths with salts and I picked these up from Target. Since then, I&#x27;ve become a regular user (9 months postpartum) and I&#x27;m a huge, HUGE fan.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review but these are absolutely my own opinions.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell is so relaxing and you feel wonderful when you come out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my &amp;#34;Mommy&amp;#34; night.  After the kids went to bed, I popped this in the bath, and it was defintely a stress remover.  I soaked in the tub and then climbed in bed for an amazing night of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After doing my own research about the product, I became more excited to experience the benefits of Epsom salt. There are different types of Dr. Teal’s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution and the one I received is Soothe and Sleep with Lavender. I tried it as a bath soak. As instructed, I added 2 cups of Epsom salt to a bathtub of warm water. I soaked for about 15-20 minutes and yes, it is very relaxing! I immediately felt the effect on my legs. I sit for long hours during work so a bath soak with Epsom salt really relaxed my muscles and I felt better afterwards.  I’m planning to use it as a hair volumizer next Time :) I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Teal&#x27;s bath salts. The lavender one smells amazing! The scent is so relaxing. I used these salts to soak my feet after a long, brutal day of standing on them for 8 hours. These bath salts quickly soothed my tired, aching feet and made my skin feel silky smooth after. I will definitely be getting more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am 20 years old and have some arthritis from dancing and this is amazing after a long rehearsal it allows to to relax and to be able to get up the next day.  I was a skeptic at first and then I received a free sample from smiley360 and I fell in love. I will definitely be buying this product over and over.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little time to relax this product is great.</li>
            <li> impressed with the quality, the scent is really appealing (who doesn&#x27;t enjoy the relaxing smell of lavender?) Not to mention Dr Teals has many other fragrances, and his product really works. My sore feet feel so much better after using this product!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Works well! Looks cool! No reason not to get it!</li>
            <li> Great smell, great feel. The wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> This was so wonderful, the lavender is really relaxing.  I feel right to sleep and my muscles were nice and relaxed.  Will purchase. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love how the smell overwhelms me as I put myself in the tub I sit back and close my eyes for a minute. Lavender is one of my favorite scent and the smell relaxes me. Disclaimer: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This Soaking solution is very soothing and relaxing, it is now part of my Friday night unwinding ritual. It helped me relax, and soothed my tired muscles after a busy week. I will definitely purchase this again, thanks for introducing me to it. I received the product for free for the purpose of my review, however the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; Epsom salt baths, but it was hard to find ones that were already scented that I liked. My search is over with this! The smell is amazing, but not overpowering. Lavender is such a soothing cent and added to a hot bath it is heavenly! It really does help to sooth over exerted muscles and helps soreness tremendously! I always try to do something natural like this before resorting to taking analgesics and this does the trick most of the time on my aches and pains. I received this product to test out for free, but this opinion is 100% my own!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It had been so long since I had used epsom salt -- I am very upset with myself now I must say! I love that there are SO many uses including facial care :)  The scent is very pleasant and as a soak it helps melt the stress away after a long day. Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product! I received a free product for the purpose of reviewing, but these thoughts are completely my own! I love the scent and it has so many benefits and uses that I never knew about until I got to try it out! Did you know it can be used in your conditioner to help thicken your hair??? :-)</li>
            <li> It was an amazing way to relieve stress!! I used the bath salts to soak and as a body scrub!! I didn&#x27;t know there is so many other ways to use it!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love to take nightly relaxation baths because my job can be quite stressful.... as I&#x27;m sure many of yours are as well. If you don&#x27;t like strong lavender scents then this is not the product for you. It&#x27;s quite strong but I like that about it! Often times I combine it with my muscle tension/mentholated Dr. Teal&#x27;s for little something extra for my shoulders. I have been doing Insanity lately and my muscles have been on fire! Dr. Teal&#x27;s really helps to loosen them back up. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Teal&#x27;s for about 6 years now and I highly recommend it. Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a lot of different soaking products and this one is by far my favorite. I happened to get my most recent bag for free from Smiley360 to review.</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt. It has really been a big help in getting me relaxed and ready for bed in the evening. I recommend it everyone looking for that extra something after work. I received a free sample from smiley 360. All thoughts are my own!</li>
            <li> Impossible to reseal the bag</li>
            <li> I have loved this product since receiving it. I was honestly surprised with how relaxed and calm I felt after the first time I used it. I love the scent of lavender. Great way to end a day. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this, people don&#x27;t tell you that running around after kids all day will make you sore and achy, this was the perfect way to relax and also the soothing Lavender Scent made it easier to fall asleep!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt. I found it helped relieve my sore muscle pain. I thought the lavender scent was very soothing and not over-powering. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love using this late at night when the kids are asleep and my boyfriend is off at work for his night shift. It is so relaxing to sit with my laptop with Netflix playing. The scent is so nice and the salt crystals dissolve nicely. I can&#x27;t wait to try out more scents in the Dr Teal&#x27;s line. I was sent this item for free but opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with this product! It helped relax me and I felt wonderful after my bath. My muscles were no longer tired feeling and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. It may have just been the most relaxing and beneficial bath that I have ever took. I will be a long time customer of Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution!</li>
            <li> The lavendar is an added delight of aroma therapy during a foot soak or bath, relaxed is the next thing that you&#x27;ll know!</li>
            <li> The product works decently, but you can get it elsewhere for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> Possibly not good for people on a low salt or with high blood pressure.</li>
            <li> I received a free bag from Smiley360 and I have t say it&#x27;s awesome! The smell is very soothing. A great way to unwind after a long day!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! AND IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Using the computer a lot of work and editing pictures, i often my neck, shoulders, and hip ache from sitting in front of the computer for a long period of time.When I received a bag of Dr Teal’s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep Lavender from Smiley 360, i begin to use it after a long hours of work. The epsom salt does help to relieve the ache and pain, i find that the longer i soak the better the results. While lavender is not my favorite scent, i do find myself doze off for couple minutes here and there while taking a bath. My only complaint is that the packaging is not very secure, the zip closure won&#x27;t close completely.</li>
            <li> Got to try this product for free and I loved the scent of  Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution and it really helped my muscles relax, with have a bad back and knee, I am always looking for something to help relieve the aching muscles, this product help me relax and sleep better because of that. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> LoBelt lavender scent. Soothes my feet wonderfully. Good value.</li>
            <li> As an asthmatic, I would NOT recommend it to anyone with asthma, or anyone that doesnt like the product to overpower your lungs with the smell of perfume. The smell is so powerful. I read the label and the first thing on the label was perfume. It was not relaxing at all because your over there trying to breathe trapped in your bathtub, when your supposed to be relaxing. I think it&#x27;s just better to buy lavender drops and Epson salt alone, w</li>
            <li> I guess I am getting old but these are the best bath salts ever. They do not leave a film on the tub and they make the whole bathrrom smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Having worked in a factory for years, I have lots of aches and pains. I must say, a Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt bath eases those somewhat. But the best part about this product is the scent and how it totally relaxes me! I sleep like a baby afterwards. I can tell a marked difference in my skin after using it in my bath as well. It makes it much smoother and silkier. I will be using Dr Teals very often! Great product!! I received a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I do this Epsom salt bath for my 2yo autistic son every other day. I didn&#x27;t expect the salt can help him so much. We tried a lot of different things for him but this one is the best. He had a sound sensitivity, he was shaking his head non-stop when he heard a microwave or vacuum cleaner. But the next day after the first Epsom salt bath he stopped paying attention to those sounds. It&#x27;s a month since we do this bath and he doesn&#x27;t have sound sensitivity anymore! This is great! Thanks for this product.I would recommend this Epsom salt to all parents of autistic children.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I loved this product. I used it for a foot bath before giving myself a pedicure. I had been on my feet all day long in heels. My feet were so tired, sore and aching all over. After a nice hot soak with this product my feet did feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Dr Teals helped soothe my achy legs &amp; I felt it was helpful in easing me into a deep sleep. I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with body aches that make sleeping difficult.  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but when I opened the packaging the box was full of crystals so i think there was a leak in the bag?? Still a great product, just irritating that I had to vacuum after opening the package.</li>
            <li> The wife got it and threw a handful in the tub and said it felt awesome. Taking one point off because she wasn&#x27;t able to seal it back up because salt got in the ziplock.</li>
            <li> This was a great  addition to my bath, since I suffer from major aches &amp; pains.&lt;br /&gt;It is a relaxing &amp; great smelling addition to a soaking bath.</li>
            <li> This feels good on my body.</li>
            <li> its all good i love it thank you good job</li>
            <li> Better prices elsewhere</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented epsom salt is amazing.  It smells so good and it&#x27;s the perfect thing after a long day.</li>
            <li> This is very calming. I fall asleep easily after a bath with this Lavender.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and cost. Nothing can compare with it&#x27;s gentle scent while soaking in the tub. Receiving it 3 days earlier than expected was a real treat.</li>
            <li> Yah I&#x27;m a guy and use bath salts- what of it!?  I get sore after working out and golfing from time to time.  A salt bath for an hour makes a big difference and helps calm me down.  Makes you feel all loose and relaxed.  Good to do at the end of the day before bed from time to time.  Salt baths are great for your skin, too.  I think.  Like I said, I&#x27;m a guy!!!</li>
            <li> Great size, smell and purpose. I love bath salts and these are great ! Totally worth the money and wait.</li>
            <li> My spouse call this &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;.  Says it makes em&#x27; tingle, really relaxing and a great great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!! Super relaxing! Makes taking  bath so much soothing! Would def recomend</li>
            <li> I normally enjoy lavender and really liked the lavender epsom salts from Walgreens. This product has an overwhelming chemical smell that makes it too strong to use. Buy the chamomile epsom salts instead.</li>
            <li> I have made epsoms salts part of my routine care in dealing with my chronic issues.  I add the scents the my plains salts and it really helps for relaxation.</li>
            <li> The product gets five star, the (supposedly) zip-lock bag gets one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt smells great and makes the water even more refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t zip closed... not at all.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm, just love this product, it soothes my pains and softens my skin and I turn on the jets and just lean back and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Um, I think I am in love!&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have always loved epsom salt baths - it is a perfect way to relax after a long day of keeping up with my three young children.  With the addition of the lavender, this bath salt helps you to completely relax. It is lovely.  I really enjoyed the smell; it is so calming.  I highly recommend this product to anyone. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution. It smells wonderful and very natural. The lavender is strong, but not overpowering. It smells just like lavender essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the salt grains are finer than typical Epsom salts, so it dissolves faster in the bath, and is smoother on the skin. The salt has numerous uses, but I like to use it as a bath soak and mixed with some body wash as an exfoliater.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was SO  excited when I got to try Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salts!! I was very impressed at how great it smelled and how wonderful I felt after taking a bath using them! It soothed all of my aches and the pain I get in my feet from my neuropathy, and I LOVED that!!  After using them, I felt so relaxed and serene, I was ready for bed!!  They should put a warning on this stuff about how quickly it relaxes you and makes you ready for bedtime! :D  I would recommend this to ALL of my friends, for sure!  I did receive a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own!</li>

            <li> i  really like this product it helps me relax and wine down before bed plus the lavender sent also helps with helping me sleep since ill use this at night in the bath before i go to bed :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salts.  First, the scent is heavenly and very soothing, the granules are much smaller than others I have tried and dissolve quickly in the tub and it left my skin feeling softer than it has in a very long time.  I&#x27;ve been soaking in it after long hikes and I can honestly say that it soothes any aches and pains I may have had and pretty much eliminates them because by the time I get out I feel so relaxed I can fall right asleep.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this one truly lives up to its promises so this will be the only one in our linen closet from here on out.  \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I must say at 1st when i opened up the bag i was like whew this scent is strong. But I tried it out and poured a bit into my hot bath water.... I must say it was the most relaxing bath I have ever had. the scent of the lavender the softness of my skin and it was just a wonderful experience. I would recommend this product to anyone!  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  The scent is amazing not to mention relaxing!  I had some very sore muscles, from working out, I took a nice hot bath with Dr Teal&#x27;s and let me tell you that I was able to move when I got out!  It helped so much.  I also, had to soak my foot in Dr Teal&#x27;s, I felt an ingrown toenail starting  it stopped it and I was able to cut the toe nail out and no more pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt for YEARS!! Since it&#x27;s been on the market I&#x27;ve used the Lavender salt. This stuff is AWESOME! I love how great it smells and how relaxed I feel after I take a bath. It also really helps with any aches and pains I might be having from a rough work day!

            <li> Love this stuff! I got to try it free through smiley360. Glad I did. Such a great scent! Very soothing. I love putting it into my foot bath after work and letting my feet soak. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> I tried out Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution this morning. After the stressful night I had last night I needed it. After using the Solution I felt so much better and so relaxed, I was able to start my day off with a smile and feeling great. :) btw you can buy these for 5 dollars at walmart. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> No big thing, but nice to toss a handful into my bath for aromatherapy benefits.  Husband likes it in his weekly foot bath routine that accompanies the head shave I give him every Saturday morning.  (Yes, he&#x27;s spoiled, but he spoils me even better.)</li>
            <li> I recently had severe leg pain and used this in my bath, I had instant relief with this product! Thank you smiley360 for for allowing me to try this product!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to Las Vegas and I knew from past trips my feet would be hurting! We walked for hours! I filled the bathtub with nice hot water and in went the Dr.Teals Lavender Epsom salt. It dissolves fast I even put some on my legs and rubbed it in to get into my soar leg muscles faster . Boy did that work! The lavender made the room smell so nice it helped me relax and the Epsom salt did it magic. I will be buying this and I can&#x27;t wait to try different kinds of Dr.Teal&#x27;s Epson salt.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! !t smell great and relaxes my muscles.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt and became hooked. This epsom salt helps to relieve pain and tension in the body as well as providing a calming effect. I soak in the Lavender Solution after a stressful day at work. It helps to energize and revive me. I then get a sense of ease and it helps to soothe me until I fall asleep. I would recommend this product to anyone it is well worth the cost. I will difinitely purchase more in the future. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I love this brand!</li>
            <li> I have loved using these bath salts! The smell of the lavender is so relaxing. I&#x27;ve been throwing a handful of these into my baths and they have been wonderful. After soaking, I feel so refreshed and relaxed. The really do help to wind down my stress level.&lt;br /&gt;While this Amazon is quite high, they can be purchased for about $5 at many retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I take a detox Epsom salt bath probably twice a week. I use to add lavender essential oils but it is so much easier and less expensive to just buy Dr Teals Epsom salt. It is amazing. I got the chance to try the Lavender Epsom salt for free thanks to smiley 360! Will be buying for a long time. It is so relaxing to just soak in lavender before you go to bed for the best night sleep.</li>
            <li> I recently read a posting on Pinterest about taking a \\&quot;detox\\&quot; bath.  The ingredients for the bath were Epson Salts, baking soda, and an essential oil.  I was shopping last week and saw the Dr Teal&#x27;s product on the shelf and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that lavender is my favorite scent/essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product yesterday and it was heavenly! I had intended to soak in the tub for 30 minutes, reading my Kindle.  BUT,  the scent of lavender was so relaxing that I soaked in the tub for 45 minutes, did not read my Kindle, was not bored, but was in a VERY peaceful-meditative state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Amount paid was too much for the quantity received. I use these to make homemade scented bath salts in a jar. I thought it would be a bigger bag.</li>
            <li> It is important to note that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own, however. I used this to soak post-run and it really helps with muscle soreness. It smells fantastic and softened my skin as well. The only negative is that after you use it, it is difficult to close the zip seal because tiny crystals get into it. All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> I like how relaxing the salt made me feel. I am going to take less showers.  I like the fragrance, I wish it smelled on my skin as in the water. I do think it made me sleep better, I have MS and it really relaxed me. I got this product free from smile360. I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I had used epsom salt before, but wanted to try scented for a more spa-like bath experience. The lavender scent of Dr. Teal&#x27;s Soothe &amp; Sleep is overpowering when you open the bag, but tones down when added to your bath. It is very relaxing, both for tense muscles, and a tense mind. Also good for aches and pains I get due to my active job.</li>
            <li> Recently Smiley360.com gave me the chance to try this product for free. This my personal opinion and was not influenced by anyone else or the fact that it was a free product test.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I do like to use Espom Salt when taking a bath due to a variety of reasons.For me, the lavender scent in this product is a little too strong.This being said, its a matter of opinion. I prefer a lighter amount of scent. The next time I will be using this product, I will do a combination with a unscented Epson Salt and give that a try. I didn&#x27;t realize before that Dr. Teal&#x27;s offers a variety of scents and would like to try a different one but the cost here is extremely high for it. I will have to shop around to see if the cost of Dr.Teal&#x27;s is so high at our local stores. That would be the one reason I would NOT be purchasing Dr. Teal&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> Thanks to smiley360 I was able to this the product for free all my opinions are my own. I love this salt! it is the best way for me to relax at the end of the day! All i have to do is add 2 cups of the salt to my hot bath water and soak for 20 min. when i get out of the bath i feel destressed and relaxed. the salt not only helps you destress it also helps with sore muscles and helps you sleep better at night! you can not go wrong buying this!</li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to try Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt. It was a soothe and sleep Epsom salt which is very needed in my household.  I actually loved the product. I loved the smell, it was a little overwhelming when I first opened the bag but was perfect once I used it. The salt melts so easily and quickly which is great. I used this in my baths, to soak my feet, my hair and even my face a few times. It helped relax me, and my body joints &amp; aching.  I also used it in my sons baths, he has insomnia so I am always looking for more ideas to help us both. The bath with the salts and then some lavender lotion after was great! The only problem I had with MY bag (maybe not everyone elses) was just it closing. I had a hard time with the ziploc of the bag.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution is absolutely wonderful!  It smelled so nice and it made my skin silky smooth after a fifteen minute soak in the tub.  It also helped to relieve my aching muscles from a long day of stress.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to unwind at the end of the day :)  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have two little ones at home and am always on the go.  So, by the time they are in bed, my body feels all the strain I put it through during the day.  Instead of trying to take a hot shower to feel better, I fill the tub with this soothing salt and soak for about 20 minutes.  When I get out of the tub, my muscles are more relaxed, I am more calm and refreshed, and my skin feels baby soft.  In addition to using this to sooth my aching muscles, I also let me daughter who suffers from eczema in this when having a flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution has made taking baths a priority of mine. Im always excited to get my water read and add in the salts. The lavender essence makes it easier to relax i will add though that it is a strong smell. Anyone with a sensitive nose wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it. I usually use this product after my work outs because it really does help soothe the muscles. Please note that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product is great for soothing away your aches and pains. I use it before going to sleep to ensure a good nights rest.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution because it&#x27;s available in 3 different varieties {the hubby&#x27;s fave-Eucalyptus Spearmint for Relax &amp; Relief, the one I reach for is Chamomile enriched to help calm the body, and there&#x27;s also a version infused with Lavender to help promote a restful night&#x27;s sleep}AND  you can get a 3 lb. bag {that&#x27;s A LOT of baths} for around $5. It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to add some health, relaxation, and relief to your routine.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but found at my local grocery store for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks just what I ordered everything went great my wife loves it this one if the many thing she loves.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Soaking in a hot tub with these natural salts is soothing and also draws out toxins.  I take the time to soak at least once/week for body and soul goodness.  I love the lavender smell too, which is extremely relaxing.</li>
            <li> I do believe I sleep better after a soak in the lavender epsom salts. After a long day or muscle tiredness from a workout or the trauma of an accident, this will help relieve the tension and help you sleep, at least it does for me.</li>
            <li> This product does everything that Epsom Salt is supposed to.  The only reason I gave it four starts is because the smell is kind of sickening. Be cautious smell the package when you open it.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts are such a relief for sore muscles! I used them after a 7-mile long hike, and my husband used them after a 100-mile bike ride, and both were fine the next day, no sore muscles, no pains whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The incorporated lavender scent is a nice touch; I liked and used it a lot when I first discovered it. Since then, however, I prefer to buy unscented Epsom salt and add my own essential oils - this way I can experiment with several fragrances.</li>
            <li> I LUV THIS STUFF BUT I&#x27;D LUV IT MORE IF IT WUZ ORGANIC..</li>
            <li> This item smells wonderful and feels great.  I will purchase this item again and recommend it to others in the near future.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s 3 lbs of the stuff it doesn&#x27;t cheapen out the salts&lt;br /&gt;Really good for mellowing out after a stressful day, can be used as an exfoliating too.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again *if* we ever run out.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed using Dr. Teals Epsom Salt for my husbands achy feet.  He works hard and a good soak with epsom salts really helps the swelling go down after a long day.  The fragrance was soothing and calming as well, really helped him relax after work.  I will definitely buy another bag when mine runs out!  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I loved Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt! It made me sleep like a baby after soaking in the awesome sent of Lavender before bedtime. It relieved some aches I had been having in my back all day. I received this as a sample for being a Smiley360 member and I am so glad I did. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution has  a very mild and enticing fragrance. When I used it for the first time, I was stressed that day.I noticed a big difference in my mood .It calmed me down. I like that Dr.Teal&#x27;s uses pure Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) that revitalizes tired, achy muscles and refreshes skin&#x27;s appearance while luxurious essential oils soothe the senses and provide relief from stress. My skin became soft and smooth. It is a high quality product at an affordable price. It has been a great experience using it and I have become a loyal customer&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. As  a mom who doesnt get much alone time I used this product to give me my own personal little getaway/spa feeling. The lavender I have found to be calming and the product itself is very soothing. I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this product but my kiddos keep asking for me to add it to their bath:) They sleep so well after I add a bit to their bath. I&#x27;ve used it to relax in a bath, I&#x27;ve used it in a paste and put it on my back to relive back pain. I am so suprised by all of the uses that it has. I will be recommending this to friends and buying more in the future. Its smell is very authentic and not fake smelling at all. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have a hereditary skin disease called Hailey Hailey. Every once in a while, triggered by heat or friction or stress, I get a painful outbreak. I was suffering from one behind my knee for a week or two when I finally had some time to soak in a bath with this product. I was thrilled when I saw almost immediate improvement on my skin, and the pain from it went away almost immediately! I couldn&#x27;t even believe it worked so well. It sounds crazy but it really feels like a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it made my bathroom smell amazing! So highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own! Try it out!</li>
            <li> Dr teals lavender helps relax your muscles and helps you sleep well. The Epsom salt smelled so good in the bath water and just just want to stay in the tub! Helps with Achy and sore! It was awesome! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> After getting this product free from Smiley 360 I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a long hot bath. I&#x27;ve used Dr. Teal&#x27;s in the past but only the foot soaks which I love to use before my at home pedicures. However now that I&#x27;ve tried the Soothe &amp; Sleep I think I&#x27;ll need that long warm bath at least one night a week. This product not only smells great but it honestly relaxed me instantly once getting in the water. After my bath I was also pleasantly surprised at how smooth my skin was and how tired I actually was.  Great product to try if you experience any kind of insomnia as well.</li>
            <li> I was not the biggest lavender fan in the world, but this soaking solution changed my mind. Lavender isn&#x27;t a scent that I like to wear, but it is definitely one that I like to use to relax! This was so soothing and comforting after a long day of class. It was not at all irritating to my sensitive skin. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent of this product but only secondary to the relief I experience when soaking in a nice tub full of it!!!&lt;br /&gt;A cup is all you need in a nice hot bath, then soak away your sore muscles or cares. I tried it after I went bouldering, talk about excruciating soreness. Dr. Teals worked very effectively and pretty quick, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> We had a busy weekend sports wedding and nature walI love the calming effect the scent had on me. After an 1/2 hour soak I felt like I had spent the day at a spa!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> Loving the soothing smell of lavender, not overpowering. The epsom salt really relaxes the sore muscles and the next day I feel much better. I use this after a hard work out.</li>
            <li> Love this! My sister was the one who introduced me to it, and I am so glad she did. The smell is wonderful, I use it mainly to soak in the tub with to relax muscles and de-stress, and boy does this do that. I highly recommend to use especially at night before bed. Very wonderful</li>
            <li> I love lavender as it&#x27;s so calming and relaxing.  The salts makes the water soft and the lavender scent is very soothing.  I like it in the bath or for soaking tired and achy feet.  Dissolves easily and very pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The scent of lavender is very strong, which didn&#x27;t bother me at all since I love lavender. It also smells like natural lavender oil and not some fake chemical scent. The epsom salt is always great for relaxing muscles and easing tushy problems as well as bowel issues. I take a bath at night before bed and it helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t take the time, or afford, a massage, this will get you through the night.  It&#x27;s extremely soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product is so much more expensive on this website.  I prefer to order online but not at this price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..dont take a bath with out it..and it actually does help muscle soreness..I took bath with it and soaked 20 min then the next time skipped it..I really felt the soreness without it..and the smell is sooo relaxing! I am picky about my bath products..I believein life little luxeries and this is one of them!</li>
            <li> We live in a desert. We have to make salt water ourselves. This is how we do it; Buy Dr Teals Epsom Salt. Then just add water.</li>
            <li> I received Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salts for free and I fell in love! I would add them to my bath after a long day of moving and I would feel so much better and so relaxed afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the relaxation properties of this soaking solution as well as the scent. However, I think the scent could be more potent as it went away within a few minutes. For a pregnant lady like me, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Epsom salt before so I was quite excited to get it for free. I finally tried this Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution last week after a long day at the Texas State Fair, my whole body was in pain and exhausted from all the walking and my both legs were hurting so bad. I thought it would be the best chance to try this product and it was the best thing to do. I mixed about 2 cups of Epsom salt with a half tub of hot water, I could smell the great lavender scent as soon as I opened the package and it dissolved immediately into the water releasing a fine fragrant. After soaking for about 20 minutes, most of my pain was gone, I was so relaxed and didn&#x27;t even want to leave the bathtub because it was simply amazing, it was so soothing and relaxing with the pleasant lavender scent. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know who needs a little pamper in their lives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but you can buy this for $8 at CVS!  Same size.  And I bought this in NYC where everything is uncharged!</li>
            <li> wonderful product! I received it threw Smiley360 to try and review!  And it is awesome and relaxing doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell! It made not only my bathroom, but the area near my bathroom, the living room smell great. The scent lingers for quite some time after the tub has been drained. The product created a very relaxing, soothing bath. I will continue to buy this product!! Best bath salts I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for relaxing after a long day. I also really like the fact that there are so many uses for Epsom salt that I never would have guessed. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest at first, but once it dissolves a bit, it smells much better. I would highly recommend this product! While I received the product for free, all opinions are based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender and was extremely excited to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution for free to review. After a long weekend of walking around a major US city, the miles of pounding the pavement left me feeling extremely sore. Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt in my bath revitalized my achy muscles and provided much needed relief! I used a small amount to exfoliate my skin as well &amp; it made my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epson Salt!! First off it soothes all my aches &amp; pains after a long night at work, &amp; it has a awesome lavender scent which makes it easier to fall fast asleep! It also leaves my skin healthy looking after my bath. It doesn&#x27;t dry my body out like other brands. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and as far as I can tell helps. Not quite sure if it is the salt or just the warm water.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend of mine suffering from anxiety and sleepless nights with a newborn needed some personal time. She stopped by her local store and picked a bag of Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender salts up. The next day she called and told me it relaxed her so much she fell asleep after getting out of the bath. She was amazed. I picked up a bag myself for relaxation purposes. I thought \\&quot;hey for $5, if it doesn&#x27;t work, whatever\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A few days later my husband really hurt his ankle wake boarding. I researched Epsom Salt and the benefits on sore muscles, so I suggested it, not thinking it would really help his swollen and bruised ankle. I got some warm water in a basin and filled with some salt. He elevated it and the next morning he said, \\&quot;I really think that stuff worked.\\&quot; I used the product myself in the bath after being sore from wake surfing and paddle boarding. What I noticed immediately was my skin felt so soft. After being in the lake and covered in sun screen half the summer, my skin has become rough, sticky and just an overwhelming feeling of being not scrub a dub clean - even though I shower daily.  I did feel more relaxed after my bath and less stressed. But I did not go right to sleep like my friend, but I have sleep issues anyway. So I cant exactly attest to the \\&quot;Sooth and Sleep\\&quot; title on the bag (why only 4 stars and not 5), but it is very relaxing and had my bathroom smelling lovely for a day or two.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great.  I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li> Soothes aching muscles and relaxes me for sleep. I love the mild scent. This is now part of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> Great smell and really relaxing.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received a bag of the Dr.Teals Lavender Epsom Salt - Soothe and Sleep solution for free as part of a Smiley 360 campaign, and I do have to say that I liked the product. The only discrepancy that I have is the usage instructions, as I found using a full 2 cups was not very pleasant. During my first use of the salts, I followed the directions exactly, and I found that after soaking for 10 or so minutes in the tub, I began getting freakishly thirsty. My throat felt dry, and I just felt...salty, I guess. I will say, however, that I used the salts the first time after an 8 hour trip to Longwood Gardens, walking around on my feet all day, and the salt soak took the soreness right out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For subsequent uses, I switched to using only a single cup of the product, and I liked it much better. Before bedtime, the lavender scent was perfect and it wasn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and suffers from a lot of pain in the legs and joints so I let her try this out in a long hot bath.  She said that it really helped with the pain and relaxed her enough that she went right to sleep. I have also tried it in a bath after a long day and it&#x27;s very relaxing and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product. I really love to soak up in the bath tub with salts &amp; bubble bath. This is such a rare treat for me as I dont find any time to soak up. I had a chance to use this product a couple of weeks back and was really amazed at its soothing power. It really soothes muscle cramps too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great for sore muscles and feet. I use it on weekends when I want to relax and unwind. Also helps with cramps. I was provided this as a sample for smiley 360.</li>
            <li> I rarely have time to take a bath but I&#x27;ve been doing the p90x routine for the past couple weeks which takes it&#x27;s toll on the body. Since I started taking the time out for relaxing baths with Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salts I&#x27;ve seen/felt a world of difference. I would highly recommend using it at night because it is so relaxing that afterwards I just want to crawl into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have to work out in the field a lot for my job and visit some not so clean houses. I usually come home and jump in the bath not to mention the aching feet from standing all day. I used this product and not only is the smell relaxing and soothing it also helps with the aching feet! I have always loved Epsom salt especially while pregnant, now I will use it when my feet are not swollen!! I highly recommend this product! I have purchased more since I received the product sample!</li>
            <li> Great for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Teals Epsom Salts and have used it several times to relax and clear the stress!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% mine!  After a stressful day of work I filled my tub up and added some Dr. Teals Lavender.  The fragrance was really nice, not overpowering but enough where you can smell it and it lightly lingers on the skin and the bathroom for awhile after.  The warms of the tub and the Epsom salt soothed my tired body and the fragrance and warmth soothed my stressed mind!  It was nice to relax and soak and just spend some time taking care of myself. I have used Dr. Teals at least once a week so far and it really has helped my relax. I recommend this product highly, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this product. Saw it on a morning show and thought I would try it and am glad I did. The smell is so awesome and will make you sleepy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon, but at a local Walmart, only because I couldn&#x27;t find any unscented Epsom salts.  I agree with the other reviewers who said the scent is unbelievably strong and not at all pleasant.  I drew a bath using this, and I couldn&#x27;t even bring myself to get in because the stench was so overwhelming.  My kids, who were downstairs at the time, even complained of the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Teals Epsom SALT SOAKING SOLUTION &amp; the FOARMING BATH but have not been able to find it locally. I appreciate the wide range of products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to identify with any of the characters. Though well-written, there was nothing in the characters nor the plot that kept me interested.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes the bath feel so nice and the whole room fills up with the scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> love this! i love the smell, and how it relaxes me each time i use it. it&#x27;s sold cheaper on amazon so this is where id purchase it each time i run out. saves me gas, from having to go to the store and i get to save money too. what&#x27;s not to love about that :D</li>
            <li> My skin is healing beautifully, the lavender smell is authentic and wonderful, and it definitely soothes muscles before bedtime. HUGE fan.</li>
            <li> I use these with my foot bath and they&#x27;re wonderful. They give the water a wonderful, soft feeling and a lovely scent. Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This product smells more like CK1 than actual lavender oil!  I got an instant headache from the nasty synthetic perfume smell!  Dr. Teals should be ashamed to call their product &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  If you have ever smelled real lavender or eucalyptus oil you will be disappointed.  I had to take a shower just to wash the smell off of me. Then again I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks Bath and Body Works is nightmare come true so take that for what it is.</li>
            <li> Tremendous product. Highly recommended.  Makes bath relaxing and soothing. Great price. Wonderful but not overly strong scent. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Has an amazing scent that is so relaxing. After soaking in this for a good 20 minutes I felt less stressed and my muscles felt great. Great to bathe in before bedtime too, as the scent and overall soothing experience is enough to make you want to pass out. Also, I received this for free through Smiley360. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Teals Epsom Salt. I received a sample of this product on Smiley 360 and I had forgotten how wonderful it is, especially for someone with a very busy life. This product helps me relax after a long day and soothes my tired and achy body. The lavender scent is so soothing. After soaking in the Epson salts I am so relaxed and calm. I mix about a tablespoon in with my body wash and exfoliate my body, also. It leaves my skin silky-smooth and glowing. I will  never be without Dr. Teams Epsom Salt ever again!!!</li>
            <li> I got this Epsom salt for free from Smiley 360 and I absolutely love. The scent is very potent and hits you the moment you open the bag but it really is a nice smell and I love how quickly it dissolves in the water. I didn&#x27;t even have to swish my hand around in it. This is definitely a really great product and I love how fragrant it is and how it helped me relax after a long hard day.</li>
            <li> I am a nursing student with a two year old! I have so much stress even on my easy days! I was pretty skeptical about it but then I tried it! I ran a hot bath and put some in. I haven&#x27;t felt so relaxed EVER! I will be buying this religiously! I am in love! Please try this! I adore it! I received this from Smiley360 for free! I can&#x27;t wait to purchase this for myself!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using Dr. Teals Lavender Epsom Salt when you need help in relieving stress. I love to put this in my bath water and relax. It also makes my skin feel so soft and relaxed. I am thankful to Smiley360 for allowing me to sample this product before I buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, it smells wonderful and is so relaxing. Just pour a cup in your bath and light a few candles and you will be having a peaceful soak in no time at all. Even better it isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a ring in your tub so you don&#x27;t have to worry about clean-up. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Such a good alternative to plain Epsom salt! I love using this in my foot bath. The Lavender scent is calming, but not so overwhelming that it is headache-inducing (which many scented products are for me!) It makes my feet super smooth and relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt - Soothe and Sleep is such a great relaxing product, the other night I was so tired and sore after doing all day house chores plus taking care of a toddler that I have to chase around the house, and at night I was exhausted that my husband offer to make me a bath I remember about Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt - Soothe and Sleep so I told him about it and he pour the amount on the bath and set it I soaked on that water and the lavender scent was so relaxing and soothing so it was the foaming water, was just a great bath and I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the best produce for my whirlpool bath to decrease my muscle pain. I can get it at the&lt;br /&gt;stores though.</li>
            <li> The lavender is very very strong but it goof for soaking and tub bath. I enjoyed using these salts since purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and nice for bath</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a foot soak. I was excited to try a detox soak my sister-in-law told me about: Epsom salt, hot water, baking soda, ginger, and lavender oil. It is supposed to slough off any gross for skin with just a soak... and this stuff did!! As far as Epsom salt goes, I would say this does its job very well, however the lavender scent was extremely overwhelming for me. It borderline ruined the soak for me. Scent is a very personal preference, so if you LOVE lavender, I would say, give it a try. But if you are sensitive to smell like me, pass on the scent, and buy plain salts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so my wife could find added relief in dealing with the skin problems associated with diabetes.</li>
            <li> Enjoyable bath (or Jacuzzi ) with this delightful bath salts scented with lavender.  Also, the bath salts is good for achy muscles or leg cramps! Try it!</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s is the only bath salts I use. Until I can find a better product, I don&#x27;t see why I would need to switch. They&#x27;re good, they deliver fast, and they smell so amazing!!!! I just wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  I mix this with my \\&quot;plain\\&quot; epsom salt to last longer and soak in the tub for a relaxing 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Semi-small to medium bag exteme fragrance! Reduce the price a little and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I got this for my foot bath.. long days on my feet it smells amazing and relaxes my feet. I use it just about everynight</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product online.  I am not particularly fond of lavender scent but was willing to give it a try. The directions said to use two cups of salts in my bath so I did.  Bad idea! The scent was so strong it gave me a headache and I had to cut my bath short.  The following week I tried again but with just a 2/3 cup and was able to have a relaxing bath.  I must say that the lavender scent is not for me but I did enjoy the Epsom salts and will try a different scent instead. This is just my own opinions, though!</li>
            <li> Great product, so relaxing. Love the lavender scent. Great for sore muscles after exercise! I was given this product to sample complimentary but theses opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own-  i love these. it actually relieves my muscle pain and the smell is sooo relaxing. it felt good in my body. would definitely recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> so whenever i think of epsom salt i think of little old ladies. not sure why. i never really knew about this stuff but when i read up on it i was surprised at all the things epsom salt does. go and google it you&#x27;ll be surprised. this dr teals lavender stuff smells amazing and really helps relieve sore and achy muscles if you use some when you soak in the tub. i love using it as a body exfoliator as well.  this has a very calm and soothing, relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> A few friends have used this brand in the past and have great things to say about it. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Love the scent and now I look forward to a bottle of wine and a nice long soak. :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I purchase this.  Yes you can purchase this cheaper elsewhere. bUT they were right on about the fragrance. If you read the ingredients the second ingredient is is a &amp;#34;fragrance &amp;#34; and the essential oils are the last ingredient. People were right about the not so pleasant fragrance.  And unlike true Essential  oils the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long once it gets in the water.  I am sorry I purchase this.</li>
            <li> I like using Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution and they are easy to use.  You simply run a very warm bath tub full of water and add them to it.  Then sit back and relax!  Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution provided me with a nice warm and relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;I have received a free product for the purpose of my review. All of these opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but I didn&#x27;t feel anymore relaxed sadly</li>
            <li> Not a strong lavender scent. It should be stronger.</li>
            <li> I do. That&#x27;s why every night I take a long, soothing bath with these here Epsom salts. Barring any pesky kids knocking on my bathroom door, I feel completely relaxed....for about 5 minutes until said pesky kids bother me again (but that&#x27;s a different review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, feels great, price is great. Giddy up.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of it, and it does work, it puts me in sleeping mode right away. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s overpriced on amazon but it works wonders to relax and soothe irritated skin; it also helps relieve muscle soreness</li>
            <li> My podiatrist suggested I bathe my feet three times a week with Epsom salts. I suffer from post chemotherapy skin issues, and Epsom salts are calming and soothing. I have used Epsom salts for five years with good results. The skin on my feet is now softer and feels soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this Dr Teals Lavender Epsom Salt in a pharmacy, and thought this should be a great soothing scent for my feet. I was so right. The directions say to use two cups of the Epsom salts to a foot pan and fill with hot water. I bring a towel and put it next to the pan. Putting your feet into this pan filled with the Epsom salts is such a delightful experience. And, then the scent of lavender is always so wonderful. The combination is such a nice soothing and calming experience. I look forward to bathing my feet each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-19-15</li>
            <li> It smells great. I feel relaxed from the lavender but I don&#x27;t know if the salt is suppose to make me feel any better. My aches and pains feel the same.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Been using it for years.  The scent is so nice, and it dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> I dont take baths but at the recommendation of my trainer, it was suggested I take Epsom salt baths. The lavender soaking solution makes sitting in a bath a delightful experience while soothing my aching limbs and I feel so much better the next day. Excellent on time delivery service.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes the bath feel wonderful, and my skin as well. The smell is not overpowering, but it stays on your skin the whole day. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Love epsom salt with the lavender scent--so relaxing! The bag doesn&#x27;t re-seal very well--you&#x27;re probably better off just storing your salt in a tupperware.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe anxiety, and even with yoga and relaxation exercises, it is very difficult for me to truly and completely relax. I&#x27;d long heard about the benefits of Epsom salt baths, but I was pretty skeptical. It was only my love of the lavender scent that made me buy this product and think, \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.\\&quot; I am SO glad I did. I struggled to relax for the first ten minutes (again, my inability to sit still was kicking in) and I thought I&#x27;d never make it the recommended 20 minutes. Fast forward half an hour, and I was still soaking, despite the cooling water and dropping water level...and I realized I felt RELAXED! Not just bearable, but really, truly relaxed and content. This was the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to a miracle in my anxiety levels. my back and knee, which give me a lot of trouble, had also stopped hurting. Double benefits!!</li>
            <li> I do like this epsome salt but you can get it for a third the price at our local Fred Meyer, I discovered. I feel pretty ripped off as far as ordering it thru amazon. I will only be buying this from the store directly now.</li>
            <li> I got these after having my baby - I was in a lot of pain from the delivery and, although very tired, had a hard time falling asleep. Maybe because of all the hormones? I took 2-3 short baths/day with these salts and they did wonders for my healing as well as peace of mind. The lavender scent is very soothing.  Highly recommend for new mamas!</li>
            <li> Overwhelming strong scent like a lot of salts out there.</li>
            <li> I feel awesome after a bath with these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The so called zipper that is on product to keep fresh didn&#x27;t work, as the granules stay in the track and prevent it from sealing. The smell is okay, could have a more lavender. Have a medicinal smell on them that I can do without. I have had better experiences with other brands. I will not be ordering this product again</li>
            <li> I had a long day and decided to take a bath to relax, which I don&#x27;t usually like doing. I had plans for it to be a 15 minute bath, but I used this stuff and it ended up being 30 minutes! It&#x27;s so soothing and relaxing, I just didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product to try for the purpose of reviewing. All content is my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great Product - It not only smelled wonderful but soaking in the for 2 minutes after work really helped some of my tense muscles in  my  lower back. I will def. buy another bag!</li>
            <li> I just recently started commuting to work via 3 buses and lots of working. So not use to that when I use to drive everywhere. So yes after the first week , I was so sore, achy, and tensed from the major change! But I received Dr. Teal&#x27;s LavenderEpsom Salt  free for my own opinion and review from smiley360.com , and took a bath and soaked in it, I was in there almost 2 hrs and didn&#x27;t realize it. I was so relaxed, my muscles and body felt so good. I will be purchasing this product and using it in my daily regimen. Thank you Dr. Teal&#x27;s! Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it alot. I love the smell. I love using after a long hard day. It relaxs me and helps me sleep. It helps with my fibromyalgia and back pains. This stuff has many uses and its reasonable priced. its a must have in your bathroom. I cant get enough of it. best of all it comes in other scents. So check it out! I recieved product for trail to facilitate this review. This review is not based on payment just my opinions of the product!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I got the chance to review this from Smiley360 and LOVE it!  I would recommend this to any one with sore muscles.!  This was a free product sample.</li>
            <li> I had a chance to test this product for free from Smiley360.com. I must admit I&#x27;m so glad that I did. This really helped my back pain feel so much better. I followed the directions and I soaked in the bath for an hour. When I got out now only did I feel very relaxed, I felt that the pain was more easy to deal with. It really soothed me in a great way. I have to say that this has been one of the best Epsom Salts that I have used in a long time. My friend used some to soak her feet in and she loves it also. This is a great product and I will be using this brand from now on. I will definitely be recommending this product to all of my family and friends. This opinion  is 100% of my own.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution was heavenly and a delight.  I found myself very relaxed in my alone time at the bath for almost an hour.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love the size of the pieces of salt they dissolve very fast and the smell is wonderfully relaxing.  it filled the whole house with the wonderful smell.  we have all used it since I received it to test and to be honest I will not buy an other brand.  The way that it helped with the  aches, pains caused by everyday stress and hard work or play I am amazed!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just used this in a bath the other day and I loved it! The scent was very relaxing and not overpowering. I also added a small amount of lavender oil to the bath. My husband walked in the bathroom and said, &#x27;What is the smell in here? It smells like a spa!&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper bag does not reseal well, so I just put it a gallon ziploc bag. I am contemplating buying some other scents to try!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of these bath salts. The fragrance is natural and soothing. It is true that the bag doesn&#x27;t seal correctly after opening, but I store it upright, so this is a non-issue to me. I&#x27;ve even thought about putting this is mason jars with ribbons to give as gifts. You could make a couple of gifts out of one bag. My whole bathroom smells nice after I use this, it feels great on my skin, and it is soothing to my muscles. This has been a great soak during pregnancy and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well. It is a nice big bag, and you don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts awhile. Good value.</li>
            <li> Bath salts (the actual kind you use in a tub) are often pretty expensive so I was thrilled to find this one. You get a large amount for a really decent price and they smell great.  My kids love using them too!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It soothes aching muscles and makes for a good night&#x27;s sleep.  However, I have found the amazon price is a bit higher than the $5 cost at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has smells wonderful and relaxes you. But, I am giving it a one star because you can buy this at walmart for less than $5 per bag.</li>
            <li> These have a great, natural, high-quality smell. They don&#x27;t smell like cheap bath perfume. The bag suggests that you use 2-cups per soak, but I&#x27;ve found that a few tablespoons works great.</li>
            <li> HOLY SMOKES FOLKS--this stuff is no joke and works miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is to die for. Yes it is strong, but sooooooo good. Ultra relaxing and just a smell you want to keep on smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, if you are going to use this for sore muscles, you have found the right product. I used this for FIVE minutes before rushing off, and my neck soreness was GONE. I was in disbelief. I get really sore from exercising and yoga, so this was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women: it does help your breasts tenderness/soreness when your cycle comes around. Soak your chest in this and let the salt work its magic. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my steaming hot, lavender scented epsom salt baths! I use this to ease sore muscles after a long day, to relax and enjoy the heavenly scent of lavender. I use more than is recommended in the instructions, pouring straight from the bag into the hot water as it fills my tub. I think on average I get 4 baths per bag, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> the scent is a lot stronger then I expected but its not to bad after a couple minuets I use it for my nightly bath before bed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Great scent, but not too overpowering. I can sit in the tub for so long while using.  Very relaxed after using this in baths!</li>
            <li> I love the product! Smells amazing and its lovely in the bath. However, it is way overpriced on Amazon. It is about half the price if you buy it at walmart or target.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s also only $5 at Target.</li>
            <li> Been using Dr. Teal&#x27;s for years and will continue too!</li>
            <li> I am always buying this stuff from this site.  Love it, its very relaxing, I sleep well after soaking my feet.</li>
            <li> I use this in my bath just before I go to bed and it helps me relax. I do get to sleep easier when my mind isn&#x27;t racing about other things.</li>
            <li> After exercising or a stressful day at work, I always look forward to soaking in a bath with these lavender salts. The smell is soothing and refreshing, and my entire body feels relaxed after soaking. It&#x27;s great right before bed if you have trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely relaxing and pleasant smelling.  My back pain always feels better after using this and soaking for 15-20 minutes.  Works better than Advil, at least for me.  Recommend the Lavender over the Amber Vanilla, but have not tried the other scents</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, but buy it elsewhere, Ulta sells it for less than half this price!</li>
            <li> Omg, this stuff smells so bad it literally made me sick. It wasn&#x27;t the lavender, that light scent was pleasant, it must be something in the salt. I had just gotten back from an eight hour drive and my butt was so sore I chose to soak in it anyway. I don&#x27;t know that it helped my rear at all, but after my bath the scent was so awful to me, that I had to shower twice to get it off. I am throwing the rest out. What a waste of my money, time, and stomach.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of lavender combined with the soothing Epsom salts just can&#x27;t be beat for a relaxing hot bath. The price is right, and a single bag lasts quite a long time. We also have tried the other Dr.Teal&#x27;s soaking solutions and they all work equally as well, however lavender is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I use Epsom Salts on a regular basis, I love them.  I was eager to use this salt because I love Lavender and find it very relaxing as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bag I almost instantly got a headache.  It was a rough day so I thought maybe it was a coincident. The lavender was not quite the scent that I had expected.  There was a generic perfumey smell to it. I looked at the ingredients and noticed \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; I had failed to notice this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked, and felt good, but the headache remained.  The next morning when I opened the bathroom door I was again hit by that \\&quot;fragrance smell\\&quot; and headache.  I will not be finishing this bag...  I will use plain Epsom and add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully relaxing in the bath.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the lavender to soothe my aching muscles and get soft skin at the same time.  I like how it has a resealable zipper top to keep from spilling what has not been used.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Smells great and relaxes your muscles! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I was excited to try this out-and must say it is now a must have and a favorite.  It is very relaxing and the scent is fabulous.  Much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> love Dr. Teal’s Soothe &amp; Sleep Lavender Epsom Salt! It makes my skin soft and smooth and smell nice! it&#x27;s very soothing for the skin with its organic ingredients. Lavender is one of my favorite flowers and although the scent is diluted in large bodies of water (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), it&#x27;s definitely relaxing to use this after a long day. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great and helps soak away  my soarness while I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have to say, Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution works wonders! Recently, I started a new workout at a boxing facility that literally works EVERY part of your body, leaving you completely sore and feeling out of commission after the first session. Thank God I had the solution to soak my aching body in that evening; not only does the smell soothe you, but the Epsom salt really helps with relaxing your muscles and making you feel like you could face another session! Aside from other salts I&#x27;ve tried, Dr Teal&#x27;s has a great smell that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;ve been to the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.Thanks Dr Teal and Smiley 360 for letting me #TryItFree!!!</li>
            <li> I received my sample of Dr. Teal&#x27;s for free through Smiley360 and I was immediately hooked.  It definitely helped me relax and soothed my aching muscles after a long day! I&#x27;m a fan and my opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> Purchased smaller bags of this item to try. Family loved it so this was a re-order in a larger size to save $$ However I&#x27;m editing this review to let all know product review is good, PRICE stinks. Christmas Tree Shops $3.99 for same 3 lb bag</li>
            <li> I had always had the impression that epsom salts were either an &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; thing, or used only in hospitals. Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep with Lavender completely changed that impression for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful...very true to a natural lavender. This blend contains essential oils that add to the already soothing properties of epsom salts, and do great things for your skin. Just soaking my feet in a solution of salts and water took layers of dead skin off my feet, without the need for scraping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it with your normal beauty products really kicks them up a notch. Mixing some into my usual hair conditioner look off old buildup and made my scalp feel refreshed. There are many other ways it can be used for beauty, including a facial exfoliator and a lip treatment, without having to get extra products. Pictured below, left to right: Volumizing hair treatment, facial exfoliator, and lip treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, it works well as a soothing bath. After trying this out, I felt SO relaxed and comfortable. I&#x27;m adding this to my list of little escapes that all moms need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product from Smiley360 for testing and review purposes. My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love using Epsom Salt in the past but never tried the scented ones.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review from Smiley360.Com. I enjoyed using it after work and it just feels amazing. The quality is still very much up to par and it is something I&#x27;m going to continue to use. I loved the scent and how amazing I feel after coming out the bath. The price on Amazon is double what I paid for it at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to find this product and I can say it works very well. Dr. Teal is a great brand and their product is of a high standard, both to sooth aching feet and to help you sleep peacefully. great product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I just recently started commuting to work via 3 buses and lots of working. So not use to that when I use to drive everywhere. So yes after the first week , I was so sore, achy, and tensed from the major change! But I received Dr. Teal&#x27;s LavenderEpsom Salt  free for my own opinion and review from smiley360.com , and took a bath and soaked in it, I was in there almost 2 hrs and didn&#x27;t realize it.

            <li> I got this to try for free to try out, to for my own opinion about this product, and I LOVE IT! This was my first time trying epsom salt ever, and i love how it makes me soo relaxed and makes my skin feel nice and soft. I recommend to anyone who work&#x27;s a job that makes your body sore!</li>
            <li> This was awesome! I loved using it after a long day at work. The smell is great and it really relaxes your muscles. The lavender scent is great before you go to bed. I have trouble sleeping so it was a great and effective way to get the sleep I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s! It makes my bath water so soft and the Lavender scent is very relaxing. My aches and pains disappear and I sleep so good at night after using the bath salts. I received a bag for free from Smiley 360. I do wish the packaging was a little easier to pour the product into the tub, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> If you like lavender, you&#x27;ll love this! It is really strong smelling, but I really like lavender.  I add them to my bath and its really relaxing.  These also make your skin really soft if you use them to exfoliate.  I will purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product from Smiley360 for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> Note: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used epsom salts before I was given the opportunity to try this, and I&#x27;m never going back. I work overnights on the weekends and because of that and a full time college schedule I am constantly achey, especially in my back, legs, and feet. Because of that I have a difficult time falling asleep at night (or in the daytime after my shifts) and a dash of this in a bath before bed really does the trick. It relieved all of my aches and pains without me having to take multiple advil pms or extra strength tylenols, and it smells amazing! Best part is, we carry this at my workplace and I get an employee discount on it. I&#x27;m stocking up for sure.</li>
            <li> As a runner, I always find a hot bath after a long run soothes those aching muscles, and Epsom salts are a staple in my household. I regularly utilize salts to help ease the aches after a race of long run. When I received a bag of Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep Lavender from Smiley 360, I found out just what I was missing getting regular salts. After a ten mile run on Banks-Vernonia Trail, five miles of which was all uphill, I started a nice hot bath, dissolved a cup of salts, and settled myself in for a  relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is one of my favorite scents and this Epson salt delivers just the right amount of scent for me. The salts dissolved quickly, and I let the soothing scent engulf me as I relaxed into that bath. There is just something naturally soothing about a hot bath, and adding the aromatherapy just made it almost heavenly, however the aches and pains of my first long run in a while, kept me grounded on earth. The salts are supposed to help flush lactic acid, and I always do feel some relief after soaking in Epsom salts. In addition, I had a nice added benefit of silky skin after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a difference with my sleeping. I am a pretty energetic person, and this was a slow run for me. It ook the bath int he afternoon, and while relaxing, I had too much to do, too much on my mind, to settle down for a nap. It was all I could do to settle in for a bath to help sooth the muscles and help me finish my chores for the day. So I cannot speak for that aspect of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the site says &amp;#34; Soothe the senses with Dr. Teal&#x27;s® Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution. Magnesium Sulfate revitalizes tired, achy muscles and refreshes skin’s appearance while luxurious essential oils soothe the senses and provide relief from stress. Great for post workout relief, relaxation and daily body pains.Used in bath rituals for thousands of years, Lavender soothes and relaxes your mind and body for a more restful sleep experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt is a pure mineral compound of magnesium sulfate in crystal form. Most of us know about the importance of iron and calcium for our bodies, but what about magnesium? According to the national academy of sciences, most American’s are magnesium deficient. It helps the body regulate over 325 enzymes and plays an important role in many bodily functions, like muscle control, energy production and the elimination of harmful toxins. While both magnesium and sulfate can be absorbed through the stomach, studies show soaking in a bath enriched with Epsom salt increases magnesium levels.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than regular Epson Salts.&lt;br /&gt;Even more expensive depending on where you buy it. I believe Walmart &amp; Target have it for about $5 ($10 at Amazon or $14.68 from Zabiva! Eep!)&lt;br /&gt;Can be overpowering for those with sensitive noses&lt;br /&gt;Unsure of &#x27;sleep quality&#x27; I did not notice a difference&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells Fantastic (for lavender lovers)&lt;br /&gt;Salt dissolves quickly&lt;br /&gt;Many uses for the salts&lt;br /&gt;Soothes aches and pains by helping to flush lactic acids&lt;br /&gt;When dissolved in warm water, magnesium sulfate is absorbed through the skin, naturally restoring the level of magnesium in the body&lt;br /&gt;Smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;Other Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use for a foot soak&lt;br /&gt;Use as an exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;Lip scrub/relieves dry lips (mix 2tbsp salts 1 teaspoon Vaseline)&lt;br /&gt;Bee sting remedy (2tbsp salts and one cup water and soak)&lt;br /&gt;Splinter remedy (2tbsp salts and one cup water and soak)&lt;br /&gt;Hair volumizer ( and to conditioner and it rids hair of excess oils)&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn relief (2tbsp salts and one cup water and spray)&lt;br /&gt;If you love Lavender, and enjoy baths, I am sure you will love Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution Soothe and Sleep Lavender. It is great for therapeutic value, soothing aches and pains, and the bag stays fresh longer with a zip closure. This is a wonderful product indeed!l product indeed!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. The soothing epsom salt was so nice after a long day of work and the lavender smell really helped to relax me for a good night sleep. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I but it at Walmart for $5 though. This is way over priced.</li>
            <li> This lavender epsom salt works great!!  received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  After doing a few 5k runs my legs and feet get sore and after soaking in a warm bath with this salt my tired aching muscles felt so much better.  The lavender scent also helped me relax and fall asleep easier.  I&#x27;ve been an athlete for years and epsom salt has always been a goto remedy for me, but the lavender just puts this one above the regular epsom salts I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this soaking in this! The lavender relaxes me and my body always feels great after. My husband isn&#x27;t keen on the lavender smell but likes the perks of Epsom salt. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think this product is really great! I tried it after beginning to lift again because my muscles were so sore and was happy with these Epsom salts! I was skeptical that they would work, but the next day I was feeling considerably less sore and more relaxed! I am not a huge fan of the lavender scent, but the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I got to try Dr Teals Epsom Salt for free courtesy Smiley360. I&#x27;ve been helping my boyfriend lately on his construction job and all my muscles ache when I get home. Thanks to dr teals Epsom salt all I need for a fixer upper is a nice hot bath with a few scoops of the amazing salt! It&#x27;s so soothing and relaxing and it&#x27;s got multiple uses, just throw in a little with your body wash and you&#x27;ve got a scrub!</li>
            <li> The products is great!  I love this stuff.  I use it everytime I take a bath.  5 stars for the product but 1 star for the price.  The same 3lb bag can be bought at Walmart in-store or online for $4.87.</li>
            <li> This is a great size bag!!!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this one evening after I had a headache all day!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, a little overpowering but good!!&lt;br /&gt;Just pour in bath and soak 15 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;I felt better.&lt;br /&gt; but I have always loved Epsom Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A great way to relax after a long day. I do a lot of work outs and these salts have been a great way to relax my muscles and mind. Not to mention they make my skin feel baby soft. All in all, a great buy. Also, can&#x27;t beat the lavender scent!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The smell and price were great the bath salts did what it said it would do but, the only thing is my husband took a bath around 5:30pm and it was hard to wake him at 8 too pick his son up, then my son picked me up from work because his dad fell back into a deep sleep.My husband slept very deeply until 7am and was worried because he didnt like the way he felt. When I say deep sleep, very deep.but the zipper works.</li>
            <li> This is a feminine scent but anyone can use it.  Everyone can benefit from locking the world and taking long soak in this refreshing scented Epsom Salt and Water.</li>
            <li> I have never soaked in epsom salts before but my son was telling me how much it helps his athletes for so I decided to try this, it has a nice smell and wow I was so relaxed and my muscles felt great</li>
            <li> I chose this for the price and scent, and it didn&#x27;t let me down.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for a scented epsom salt, and the scent is very nice when added to the jetted tub.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this bath salt.</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the lavender epsom salts overpowering; however, I only used about one-half cup in a foot soaking tub.  Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and I would recommend them and I will most certainly purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li> I had one of THOSE DAYS! I decided to give Dr. Teal&#x27;s a try. It is awesome. Just a couple of tablespoons full in a warm tub provided a relaxing and soothing wash away the day therapy. The Lavender sent is just enough, not over powering and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with colognes or perfumes. I have recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender bath salts. Not only is epsom salt soothing for tired muscles after a day in the garden, the added lavender is relaxing for my senses! *Note: I really enjoy lavender, it is my preferred scent, and this does have a very strong lavender smell (which is what I was seeking, but may be too much for others).</li>
