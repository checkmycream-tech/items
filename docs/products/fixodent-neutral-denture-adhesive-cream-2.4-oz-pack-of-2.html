    <ol>
            <li>Great!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product, great price, great delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for quite some time  with great results.</li>
            <li>If you wear dentures this works great without the zinc.</li>
            <li>works good, and for the price it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d been good for the day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this adhesive for about 6 months now, and so far it is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>tried all the products on the market, this by far is the best for me. .</li>
            <li>The best there is out there as far as I am concerned..</li>
            <li>It holds them in place most of the day, I&#x27;ve found that if I eat to many times though that they start to loosen.</li>
            <li>you need more you can add it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>It does the job and is easy to clean</li>
            <li>ZINK FREE...</li>
            <li>The zinc products do seem to last longer during the day, but this is a great alternative if you are worried about zinc</li>
            <li>Comes off easy and lasts a full 24+ hours.</li>
            <li>Order was shipped very fast and product is my favorite dental sealer.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the market to find an adhesive that is better, but for now, this one does just fine, and the price is definitely a factor in that.</li>
            <li>Well worth my Amazon purchase</li>
            <li>Liked the idea of no zinc and such, but if it doesn&#x27;t work...not much point.  </li>
            <li>I like fixodent very much.</li>
            <li>very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the color of the cream, it a lite textured cream, which is very comfortable,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on trying all the products available, but I&#x27;ve tried a few and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it highly to anyone who has a need for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Normally, it would at some point set</li>
            <li>As far as the holding power it is probably a 9 out of 10.</li>
            <li>First I must say, I really like the packaging, simply because it  clearly implies the adhesive cream is white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the pink cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new with my dentures, I&#x27;ve only had them for 9 months or so</li>
            <li>No pink ooze in this product.  </li>
            <li>Some of it squirted to the back of my throat nearly choking me.</li>
            <li>This morning I opened a fresh tube from my last order, put a little on my denture, and put it into my mouth.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This morning I opened a fresh tube from my last order, put a little on my denture, and put it into my mouth.</li>
            <li> Holds well and is long lasting...</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s takes quite a long time to remove.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really any kind of taste or flavor to it, which is another reason I like it, I&#x27;ve found others that tasted horrible and you could taste it all day long.  </li>
            <li> Does not hold very long...  </li>
            <li> Being new to false teeth I was trying various products from different companies.</li>
            <li> The basic thing to remember with this is to start with just a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( I had only used a little, but it acted like water and never congealed)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a young denture wearer, so it&#x27;s been hard getting used to them and the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Holding power appears less efficient than the same product previously used in the UK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this adhesive cream lasts like other Fixodent products.  </li>
            <li> I will place another order and if the product I receive behaves in the same manner, I will be forced to rethink my brand loyalty and source my dental adhesive supplies elsewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have Zinc or other heavy metals.</li>
            <li> have to use half the tube for just one wearing.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as the previous products with zinc.  </li>
            <li> No better or worse then the generic stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do get a few small pieces of food stuck just under the edges of my dentures, but it usually isn&#x27;t too irritating and it comes out after a short while of not paying attention to it.</li>
            <li> There was definitely something wrong with it;   </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to return it, or discuss it&#x27;s merits, or deal with what may have been wrong about it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s side effects if used wrong.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> Horrible taste</li>

I&#x27;m still new with my dentures, I&#x27;ve only had them for 9 months or so and I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on trying all the products available, but I&#x27;ve tried a few and this one is my favorite so far.

            <li> It does the job and is easy to clean</li>
            <li> Used it for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind!  I&#x27;d recommend it highly to anyone who has a need for this type of product.</li>
            <li> The basic thing to remember with this is to start with just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;If you need more you can add it but you don&#x27;t need to make a bead all around,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, I had a temporary crown that came lose stay in place for a week with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have Zinc or other heavy metals.</li>
            <li> works good, and for the price it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Being new to false teeth I was trying various products from different companies. Not wanting the zinc that some of these products contains I tried Fixodent Neutral. I like that it does not have any flavor. As far as the holding power it is probably a 9 out of 10. I would buy/use Neutral again.</li>
            <li> I would like to give this the highest rating possible, but that would NOT reflect the quality of the last order I  received. There was definitely something wrong with it;   This morning I opened a fresh tube from my last order, put a little on my denture, and put it into my mouth. Normally, it would at some point set and I&#x27;d been good for the day.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for quite some time  with great results. Not THIS time.. Some of it squirted to the back of my throat nearly choking me. ( I had only used a little, but it acted like water and never congealed)  I may as well have been trying to use tooth paste as a denture adhesive. However,. I didn&#x27;t want to return it, or discuss it&#x27;s merits, or deal with what may have been wrong about it. Into the trash it went.  I will place another order and if the product I receive behaves in the same manner, I will be forced to rethink my brand loyalty and source my dental adhesive supplies elsewhere.</li>
            <li> ZINK FREE... What else can I say !</li>
            <li> First I must say, I really like the packaging, simply because it  clearly implies the adhesive cream is white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the pink cream. Aside from the color of the cream, it a lite textured cream, which is very comfortable,&lt;br /&gt;and it  adheres to the roof of my mouth, no oozing over the denture, or the back of the denture&lt;br /&gt;I tried all the products on the market, this by far is the best for me. .</li>
            <li> If you wear dentures this works great without the zinc. The zinc products do seem to last longer during the day, but this is a great alternative if you are worried about zinc and it&#x27;s side effects if used wrong.</li>
            <li> I like fixodent very much. Order was shipped very fast and product is my favorite dental sealer. I will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> Horrible taste plus it&#x27;s takes quite a long time to remove.  Use Sea Bond instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. have to use half the tube for just one wearing. Not impressed</li>
            <li> Holding power appears less efficient than the same product previously used in the UK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this adhesive cream lasts like other Fixodent products.  Liked the idea of no zinc and such, but if it doesn&#x27;t work...not much point.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great delivery.  I have used this product for about 12 years. Worked so well I never considered anything else.</li>
            <li> It works ok. No better or worse then the generic stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as the previous products with zinc.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The best there is out there as far as I am concerned..Holds well and is long lasting...Well worth my Amazon purchase</li>
            <li> Does not hold very long...  I need to apply often during the day.</li>
