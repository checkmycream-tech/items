    <ol>
            <li>Love this product works like a dream!!!</li>
            <li>Together they make my hair feel and look great.  </li>
            <li>great product for my husband</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Alone, this Fantasia Moisturizer is soooooo good because it adds elasticity to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I used it with my new DENMAN brush( also from amazon), what a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>Yes I love this product I order 2 at a time I love the combo pack that includes the shampoo!</li>
            <li>What I like the most is that it is not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it made my hair grow :)</li>
            <li>, it does not get your hair dry, and the smell is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>I have actually received many compliments on my hair smelling good and looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product has a great smell, it&#x27;s lightweight, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>I saw the user say this product wasn&#x27;t available in Memphis TN</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for awakening your curls, but it left my hair a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>Curled my course hair and left it looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li>Since it goes on clear, it is easy to use - no need to worry about drying time.  </li>
            <li>However, I will deal with it because it makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>By the way, I purchased it at a beauty supply store in Maryland for a very reasonable price yesterday, so they do still sell it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I recommend it because its smooth and your hair soft and shine</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I also must say that the smell is very fruity, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really do reviews on amazon, but I just had to with this product.</li>
            <li>this product works very well on my hair....</li>
            <li>I used this product and it really made my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula since high school...about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>It smells really well and makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the whole 4b/a works, but I would say that mine is pretty coarse on that scale.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and you only need a little of it.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact the bottle is a nice size and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is taking care of their natural hair.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li>A little does go a long way, but I am still glad I bought two.</li>
            <li>Like better than other moisturizing lotion for black hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and this product compliments my texture without a dry or greasy look.</li>
            <li>It works best for me after I do a co wash(herbal essence totally twisted) and I use very little( pea size or smaller) of the Fantasia Gel tea Activator and rub thoroughly through hair while damp with a little oil to seal moisture and hair fells moisturized all day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula since high school...about 15 years.  Together they make my hair feel and look great.  Alone, this Fantasia Moisturizer is soooooo good because it adds elasticity to my hair.  And that means LESS BREAKAGE.  It has always worked for me.  By the way, I purchased it at a beauty supply store in Maryland for a very reasonable price yesterday, so they do still sell it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. What I like the most is that it is not oily at all. It smells really well and makes my hair soft and manageable. I have natural curly hair and this product compliments my texture without a dry or greasy look.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product after washing/co-washing my hair.  Since it goes on clear, it is easy to use - no need to worry about drying time.  It makes my hair soft without heavy build-up.  It is also non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair which is usually very coarse and hard. I used this product and it really made my hair very soft and shiny. I also like the fact the bottle is a nice size and a little goes a long way. I also must say that the smell is very fruity, which I don&#x27;t like. However, I will deal with it because it makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> Using for years...not too greasy or heavy. Like better than other moisturizing lotion for black hair. Serves multiple purposes...controls hair...add health and shine...no need to wear perfume because you will get compliments on the scent. People always ask me what&#x27;s the name of the perfume I am wearing. I surprise them when I say, &amp;#34;you are smelling my hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have severely dry hair and products that I have used before would keep my hair moisturized for some hours then my hair is dry again. This product has a great smell, it&#x27;s lightweight, and moisturizes at the same time. It works best for me after I do a co wash(herbal essence totally twisted) and I use very little( pea size or smaller) of the Fantasia Gel tea Activator and rub thoroughly through hair while damp with a little oil to seal moisture and hair fells moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this product I order 2 at a time I love the combo pack that includes the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and just got a &amp;#34;big cut&amp;#34;. This means that my &amp;#34;pixie&amp;#34; is growing up and its in that state where I dont know what to do. I use this product every time I wash my hair, it provides the right amount of hold without giving the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; (which i completely hate), it does not get your hair dry, and the smell is WONDERFUL. I would recommend this to anyone who is taking care of their natural hair. Six stars!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product works like a dream!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The order went in twice and I refuse to return the additional one, because I know I will be back for it later.</li>
            <li> I saw the user say this product wasn&#x27;t available in Memphis TN it&#x27;s available at Angel Beauty in Whitehaven along with a lot of the other hard to find IC Fantasia products</li>
            <li> lots of slip detangling is a breeze luv luv luv</li>
            <li> I used this years ago. I got a very bad overprocessed perm and my hair looked like straw. I have used this for a few days every day. My hair is regaining its health. My ends still look rought (may need to cut them) but the rest is softer. The aroma is pleasant. I have actually received many compliments on my hair smelling good and looking shiny and healthy. Cant wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Curled my course hair and left it looking very healthy.  Not drying.  I am very pleased.  Money well spent on this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for awakening your curls, but it left my hair a bit sticky.  It smells nice, and you only need a little of it. Probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with very thick and curly afro like hair. I don&#x27;t know how the whole 4b/a works, but I would say that mine is pretty coarse on that scale. I usually have a hard time with gels because they are usually sticky or really drying on my hair. I used this on my hair without a leave in conditioner or anything and I was surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was. I used it with my new DENMAN brush( also from amazon), what a perfect combination. A little does go a long way, but I am still glad I bought two. I don&#x27;t really do reviews on amazon, but I just had to with this product.</li>
            <li> this product works very well on my hair.... i have been using this product fro a very long x, however, availability in memphis tn is a zzzzz.....</li>
            <li> great product for my husband</li>
            <li> my hair was not soft at all from using this product, so im not very pleased may it works for you</li>
            <li> I recommend it because its smooth and your hair soft and shine</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great moisturizer and it made my hair grow :)</li>
