            <li>Love the kit, will purchase again</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a better product.</li>
            <li>It was okay..</li>
            <li>The clamps are okay but leave scratches on the skin.</li>
            <li>Over all an okay product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, it all came sealed and clean, works very nicely</li>
            <li>The needles are sharp and it arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t pierce yourself if you are not a trained piercer, but this is a pretty nice kit.</li>
            <li>(I just followed the needle with the jewelry and it went in fine.)</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve returned it, but it was cheap, they might have a lot of orders.</li>
            <li>Overall, the needle works great and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Great set and especially for it&#x27;s price can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to use the jewlery that&#x27;s slightly curved which is fine because it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>The jewelry is kind of cheap and the banana ring for the belly button in my kit was only silver,  no gems.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The forceps were nice and sturdy too, although they weren&#x27;t the same ones depicted in the photo.</li>
            <li>I did everything right, and it still got infected.</li>
            <li>The needles were both very sharp, the clamp held good.</li>
            <li>The forceps are very cheaply made and too big for my nose, so I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li>Was pleased with item and will be looking on site in the future</li>
            <li>this kit was amazing!!!!!the needles are VERY sharp and everything was sealed and clean :).I</li>
            <li>In short, this kit did exactly what it was supposed to do for a cheap cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for my $800 doctor bill.</li>
            <li>I had to follow the needle through with the belly ring because it wouldn&#x27;t fit in it properly.</li>
            <li>I only used this kit to pierce my bellybutton and the ring couldn&#x27;t fit through the needle.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well also.</li>
            <li>This kit worked really well.</li>
            <li>The clamp was broken when I got it, but everything else seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li>The clamp worked great and held tight and the needles are very sharp.</li>
            <li>The package brought everything I expected and even 2 extra needles :)</li>
            <li>The nose ring is to large IMO, but I had a smaller gauge.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, however, the jewelry is a little too big for the needles.</li>
            <li>Overall, it got here fast</li>
            <li>The needles are very sharp, but the jewelry that comes with it doesn&#x27;t fit into the needle back</li>
            <li>My package came on the first day it was expected and some people have said they did not receive gloves, but I did.</li>
            <li>Only two needles were sharp and the right size, and only one piercing would open so I could put it</li>
            <li>needles are VERY sharp went very well with my.navel piercing.</li>

            <li> The only problem was that the bellybutton jewelry was maybe a little too big.</li>
            <li> I found that it actually hurt less without the clamp.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that  the belly button jewlery was too big for the 14g needle</li>
            <li> i thought i would be waiting longer but got here before i expected it to.</li>
            <li> Clamps were steel and it didnt come with gloves this wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> The needles are INSANELY sharp that when I was lining up the needle for my naval piercing I poked myself, didn&#x27;t feel it, and started bleeding.</li>
            <li> The needles are insanely sharp!</li>
            <li> And the needles are so incredibly sharp that when you pierce yourself, you don&#x27;t even feel it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use the curved barbell instead of the horseshoe but the balls were screwed so tight, I couldn&#x27;t get them off.</li>
            <li> When it came it was received it was broken and not as described by the photo still awaiting the replacement</li>
            <li> Could have been a lot worse</li>
            <li> The worst problem I had was that the description said I would receive two 16g needles and two 14g needles, but I received three 14g and one 16g.</li>

            <li> This will be my 3rd time ordering this product.  I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Im waitinn on miness .. Can u use it for tongue piercing !?</li>
            <li> My belly button got SEVERLY infected. It came in the mail in a Ziplock baggie. I should&#x27;ve returned it, but it was cheap, they might have a lot of orders. I found instructions on Wiki How since none were included, and I even bought some belly button piercing cleaner. I did everything right, and it still got infected. My doctor says it was from UNSTERILIZED equipment. Thanks a lot for my $800 doctor bill.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! I&#x27;ve been self piercing for over seven years and I pierced my tragus with this kit! I used to curved barbell and it looks great! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> When it came it was received it was broken and not as described by the photo still awaiting the replacement</li>
            <li> Did not come with gloves. I had to follow the needle through with the belly ring because it wouldn&#x27;t fit in it properly.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Pierced my tongue and belly!</li>
            <li> this kit was amazing!!!!!the needles are VERY sharp and everything was sealed and clean :).I used it to pierce my side labret.</li>
            <li> Good buy, good shipping!</li>
            <li> It was all okay except the jewelry!! It was too big for the hole that either of the needles created!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great start up kit for anyone tha</li>
            <li> very quick delivery and very great quality jewelry and needles</li>
            <li> Only two needles were sharp and the right size, and only one piercing would open so I could put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The clamps also cut and bruised me.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li> needles are smaller than the rings</li>
            <li> I bought this to pierce my septum. It came with everything listed in the description. The needles are insanely sharp! The forceps are very cheaply made and too big for my nose, so I couldn&#x27;t use them. I wanted to use the curved barbell instead of the horseshoe but the balls were screwed so tight, I couldn&#x27;t get them off. Overall, the needle works great and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Everything was as described, and packaged properly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, however, the jewelry is a little too big for the needles. I only used this kit to pierce my bellybutton and the ring couldn&#x27;t fit through the needle. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, though. I just stuck the ring in after I pulled out the needle! And the needles are so incredibly sharp that when you pierce yourself, you don&#x27;t even feel it! I love this kit! It was packaged very well also.</li>
            <li> Could have been a lot worse I did what I needed</li>
            <li> If the clamp was metal it might of got 5star. Not to pleased. But oh well</li>
            <li> Came with 3 14g needles and 1 16g</li>
            <li> This kit worked really well. The needles were both very sharp, the clamp held good. The only problem was that the bellybutton jewelry was maybe a little too big. But I was planning on putting a different ring in anyway! In short, this kit did exactly what it was supposed to do for a cheap cost. I liked it.</li>
            <li> The clamp was broken when I got it, but everything else seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li> Overall, it got here fast i thought i would be waiting longer but got here before i expected it to. Came with everything the package said it would except i was expecting the for the septum forcep to be metal not plastic and flimsy. And it came in this plastic bag makes me double think the sterilization process a lil.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with item and will be looking on site in the future</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t pierce yourself if you are not a trained piercer, but this is a pretty nice kit. The needles are very sharp, but the jewelry that comes with it doesn&#x27;t fit into the needle back (I just followed the needle with the jewelry and it went in fine.)

The worst problem I had was that the description said I would receive two 16g needles and two 14g needles, but I received three 14g and one 16g.</li>
            <li> This kit was amazing! The clamps worked better than I thought they would and everything came in it&#x27;s own sterile packet. My only complaint is that  the belly button jewlery was too big for the 14g needle so I ended up having to use the jewlery that&#x27;s slightly curved which is fine because it looks amazing! The needles are INSANELY sharp that when I was lining up the needle for my naval piercing I poked myself, didn&#x27;t feel it, and started bleeding.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, it all came sealed and clean, works very nicely needles are VERY sharp went very well with my.navel piercing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!! worked great!</li>
            <li> Gloves were not included. Thankfully I already had some.</li>
            <li> Clamps were steel and it didnt come with gloves this wasn&#x27;t what I expected but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> My package came on the first day it was expected and some people have said they did not receive gloves, but I did. The package brought everything I expected and even 2 extra needles :)</li>
            <li> Love the kit, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Awesome kit! Pierced my tongue, belly, and nose. The nose ring is to large IMO, but I had a smaller gauge.</li>
            <li> I found that it actually hurt less without the clamp. The needles are sharp and it arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a better product.</li>
            <li> Great set and especially for it&#x27;s price can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I received this kit about an hour ago and I&#x27;ve already pierced myself.  My kit came with everything but I got three 14 Guage needles and one 16 Guage. The clamp worked great and held tight and the needles are very sharp. The jewelry is kind of cheap and the banana ring for the belly button in my kit was only silver,  no gems. I would definitely buy this kit again.</li>
            <li> It was okay.. It doesn&#x27;t come with a tongue ring though only the nipple, belly button, eyebrow and horseshoe rings. The clamps are okay but leave scratches on the skin. Over all an okay product.</li>
