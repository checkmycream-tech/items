            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great brush to use with polmade in men&#x27;s hair...</li>

            <li>But you cant even get this good a brush at Wal-mart for the price, so I&#x27;ll disregard my complaint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>This is good for that use.</li>
            <li>Might be good for cleaning the BBQ grille though.</li>
            <li>A good stocking stuffer for your son.</li>
            <li>this brush is a must to tha guy that want his hair too look an feel good</li>
            <li>This brush is good for me.  </li>
            <li>good buy&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush.  </li>
            <li>and this brush doesn&#x27;t damage any part of my hair and gets the job done in an exceptionally timely manner.  </li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold on to and makes a great travel brush.  </li>
            <li>a decided to use it as his own...</li>
            <li>it is a nice brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and I&#x27;ll use it</li>
            <li>well looks nice thou</li>
            <li>I do admit that I haven&#x27;t owned many brushes in my life, but this one has been quite good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something like it for years, and here it is, convenient and cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it would be nice</li>
            <li>good hand fit and feel.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good brush but not quite as good as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good, there were a lot more reinforcements than boar bristles but for the price it was good</li>
            <li>So I ordered three more for the dogs.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Ambassador olive wood hair brush (costs about 5x more), and it feels and works much better.  </li>
            <li>even so, this Diane brush does not brush the hair into place without more effort and more attempts.  </li>
            <li>It still gets the job done, however, I am much more pleased with the Ambassador brush, both in terms of its utility and the way it feels in the hand.  </li>
            <li>It is OK, but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It stands up to some abuse, having been dropped many times without breaking.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot more than the nylon bristle brush I have.</li>
            <li>more for Men than for Women.  </li>
            <li>This one appears to be better quality; we wil see.</li>
            <li>Love a wave brush.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>i have to buy 2 more</li>
            <li>More plastic than boars hair.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more boar bristle though</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s mostly plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li>This will eventually just be the brush I keep at work while I wait to buy a better quality one.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel more like wire.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Boar&#x27;s bristle brushes most of my life.</li>
            <li>Most of the bristles do break off over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more of the Diane #8118 100% Boar Sterilized brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it works in terms of distributing the oil since most of the bristles are plastic, but it does a medium job detangling.</li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong and make brushing your hair a breeze.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, my cats love it!</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair (but a lot of it) that tends to tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t damage and break your hair and it keeps mine looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine</li>
            <li>This brush works well for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but it is still comfortable and made from beautiful wood.</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t beat it for the money - fabulous deal at just $3.49 with free Prime shipping!!</li>
            <li>Great brush to use as a comb on short hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want your hair to lay and look smooth?</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product for the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush as far as function goes.</li>
            <li>The value is excellent, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For the price though i&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of these brushes as they really do work!</li>
            <li>This brush was just right!</li>
            <li>Also, his waves are in full effect with out and wax.</li>
            <li>However, the craftsmanship was shoddy at best.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and this brush is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>(He credits the brush for having a full head of hair at 84.)  </li>
            <li>lt brings out their natural oils and gives them  nice shiny  hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is not bad at all as a backup brush in the car or something.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheap brush that will do it&#x27;s job, you are in the right place.</li>
            <li>might be good if you have a flat head.</li>
            <li>brush, however, DOES work well, and DOES get through to the hairs underneath the topmost layer, so it does a MUCH better job of smoothing ALL of my hair, and distributing the natural oils on more than just the very top/outside layer.  </li>
            <li>This is a good inexpensive brush in its own right based on price, but against at least one competitor, it does not measure up.</li>
            <li>this hair brush is strong and very well made.</li>
            <li>However, because of the price it wasn&#x27;t worth it to return it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 10% boar bristle, but it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy though.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Finding a hair brush that&#x27;s economical and</li>
            <li>For individuals with thicker/coarse hair or curly hair, this brush probably is not the right choice.  </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to use it in a hurry and in an unthinking way - it would probably claw my head!</li>
            <li>The natural bristles don&#x27;t break or pull my fine hair as much and work the natural oils through my hair, much better.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair or a sensitive scalp I would recommend you try one of their softer brushes.  </li>
            <li>My long-haired Dachshunds love to sit on my lap and be brushed.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The extra firm bristles go thru any type of hair and, best of all, it was not very expensive.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice quality brush; it is hard to find brushes these days that are wood, and have boar bristles like this.  </li>
            <li>but, I believe that IF you have coarse, thick hair, this brush should be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I mean, who can do homework and brush their hair at the same time, LOL!</li>
            <li>This is a good, small brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this nice firm brush that gets to my scalp through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The wood handle has no splinters or rough spots to tangle long hair and the bristles are super-stiff which is great for someone with thicker hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to be a little too thick for it to do it all at once, but that is okay, for the price it is great.</li>
            <li>Its really extra firm and im guessing my husband will not be happy on this.oh</li>
            <li>Brought this comb for my son, he loves it so much that I had to take it away from him while he does homework.</li>
            <li>This brush is not what I was expecting I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it if you need a cheap quality brush.</li>
            <li>This brush didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s much closer than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I really like my brush&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>:It is a very durable/solid comb for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>It really does seem to distribute the oils from my scalp to the rest of my hair as I brush.</li>
            <li>I like the brush but haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should to get clarity as to the benefit and value of using the brush.</li>
            <li>I will report back at a future date as to whether I believe that the product is an excellent product or a waste of money.</li>
            <li>When l finally find one , l buy it in large quantities, enough to last many years !!  </li>
            <li>Certainly not weak.  </li>
            <li>what little hair I have it certainly gets the workout and more.</li>
            <li>Mine is several years old and in fine shape.  </li>
            <li>But it does the job of spreading out the oil in my hair decently well.  </li>
            <li>and I bought this brush not being able to afford the more expensive boar bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend purchasing</li>
            <li>Just as nice as more expensive brushes I have owned of the same design.</li>
            <li>With the great price you cant go wrong.  </li>
            <li>MY IDEA of great is difficult.</li>
            <li>The head of the brush is narrow so u will need to take more strokes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit stiff but nothing treats my hair better than boar bristles.</li>
            <li>These bristle feel more like stiff wire than boar bristle.</li>
            <li>This brush really has plastic bristles--you can barely see any boar bristles in it.</li>
            <li>The large handle makes it easier to grip especially for someone with hand problems.</li>
            <li>A little bigger would be better.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really stiff but they&#x27;re softening up just fine now.</li>
            <li>I have short, straight hair, and</li>
            <li>and it came early as i</li>
            <li>This brush was no where near what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I broke my old brush of 30+ years, so I went to the stores to replace it.  </li>
            <li>There are lots of bristles, and the brush is soft to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed how soft my hair is after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>The extra firm bristles are better then the Boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>It was more trouble sending it back than keeping it.  </li>
            <li>I think the hairs are not as thick, or there aren&#x27;t as many (I&#x27;ve never laid them side by side because one is in the office and one is at home).  </li>
            <li>My Dad had been struggling to find a replacement for his old brush because the bristles were never stiff enough.  </li>
            <li>This brush does have a few natural boar&#x27;s bristles, but most of the bristles are a very firm plastic that doesn&#x27;t flex much.</li>
            <li>It is firm enough to easily brush bushy hair into place but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The only reasons I give it four stars instead of five are: (1) the product name may lead some to believe the bristles are all boar hair, however most of the bristles are synthetic; and (2) I would have preferred to pay a couple bucks more and have the brush made in America instead of China.</li>
            <li>My husband has fine but thick hair</li>
            <li>I generally follow up with a softer brush and  feel that I have done my duty.</li>
            <li>:The hairs are very though so if you aren&#x27;t into it be careful about purchasing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush with VERY stiff bristles; too stiff for me.</li>
            <li>Firm enough, in fact, to pull your hair right out of your head.  </li>
            <li>For someone with very short hair, I find that the ends of the bristles on this particular model are far to sharp, and combined with the stiffness it actually scratches my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a long time for a natural boar bristle, however, this one is a \\&quot;reinforced boar bristle\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is super hard.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to press super hard to get the brush</li>
            <li>exactly what l want : stiff bristles that will slightly soften  in time -- but not too much.</li>
            <li>It distributes the natural oils in your hair evenly so your scalp doesn&#x27;t become dry and flaky and so your ends don&#x27;t split.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really satisfied with this brush for the past few months.</li>
            <li>This brush is firm and is still able to brush through my very thick, coarse, wavy hair, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  </li>

            <li> I have been using the Ambassador olive wood hair brush (costs about 5x more), and it feels and works much better.  </li>
            <li> even so, this Diane brush does not brush the hair into place without more effort and more attempts.  </li>
            <li> It still gets the job done, however, I am much more pleased with the Ambassador brush, both in terms of its utility and the way it feels in the hand.  </li>
            <li> It is OK, but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It stands up to some abuse, having been dropped many times without breaking.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot more than the nylon bristle brush I have.</li>
            <li> more for Men than for Women.  </li>
            <li> This one appears to be better quality; we wil see.</li>
            <li> Love a wave brush.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> i have to buy 2 more</li>
            <li> More plastic than boars hair.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more boar bristle though</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s mostly plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> This will eventually just be the brush I keep at work while I wait to buy a better quality one.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel more like wire.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Boar&#x27;s bristle brushes most of my life.</li>
            <li> Most of the bristles do break off over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more of the Diane #8118 100% Boar Sterilized brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it works in terms of distributing the oil since most of the bristles are plastic, but it does a medium job detangling.</li>
            <li> I personally love it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong and make brushing your hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, my cats love it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair (but a lot of it) that tends to tangle easily.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t damage and break your hair and it keeps mine looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine</li>
            <li> This brush works well for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but it is still comfortable and made from beautiful wood.</li>
            <li> And you really can&#x27;t beat it for the money - fabulous deal at just $3.49 with free Prime shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great brush to use as a comb on short hair.  </li>
            <li> If you want your hair to lay and look smooth?</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product for the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush as far as function goes.</li>
            <li> The value is excellent, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For the price though i&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more of these brushes as they really do work!</li>
            <li> This brush was just right!</li>
            <li> Also, his waves are in full effect with out and wax.</li>
            <li> However, the craftsmanship was shoddy at best.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this brush is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> (He credits the brush for having a full head of hair at 84.)  </li>
            <li> lt brings out their natural oils and gives them  nice shiny  hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is not bad at all as a backup brush in the car or something.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheap brush that will do it&#x27;s job, you are in the right place.</li>
            <li> might be good if you have a flat head.</li>
            <li> brush, however, DOES work well, and DOES get through to the hairs underneath the topmost layer, so it does a MUCH better job of smoothing ALL of my hair, and distributing the natural oils on more than just the very top/outside layer.  </li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive brush in its own right based on price, but against at least one competitor, it does not measure up.</li>
            <li> this hair brush is strong and very well made.</li>
            <li> However, because of the price it wasn&#x27;t worth it to return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 10% boar bristle, but it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy though.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Finding a hair brush that&#x27;s economical and</li>
            <li> For individuals with thicker/coarse hair or curly hair, this brush probably is not the right choice.  </li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to use it in a hurry and in an unthinking way - it would probably claw my head!</li>
            <li> The natural bristles don&#x27;t break or pull my fine hair as much and work the natural oils through my hair, much better.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair or a sensitive scalp I would recommend you try one of their softer brushes.  </li>
            <li> My long-haired Dachshunds love to sit on my lap and be brushed.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The extra firm bristles go thru any type of hair and, best of all, it was not very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality brush; it is hard to find brushes these days that are wood, and have boar bristles like this.  </li>
            <li> but, I believe that IF you have coarse, thick hair, this brush should be perfect.  </li>
            <li> I mean, who can do homework and brush their hair at the same time, LOL!</li>
            <li> This is a good, small brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this nice firm brush that gets to my scalp through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The wood handle has no splinters or rough spots to tangle long hair and the bristles are super-stiff which is great for someone with thicker hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to be a little too thick for it to do it all at once, but that is okay, for the price it is great.</li>
            <li> Its really extra firm and im guessing my husband will not be happy on this.oh</li>
            <li> Brought this comb for my son, he loves it so much that I had to take it away from him while he does homework.</li>
            <li> This brush is not what I was expecting I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I totally recommend it if you need a cheap quality brush.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s much closer than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I really like my brush&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> :It is a very durable/solid comb for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> It really does seem to distribute the oils from my scalp to the rest of my hair as I brush.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should to get clarity as to the benefit and value of using the brush.</li>
            <li> I will report back at a future date as to whether I believe that the product is an excellent product or a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When l finally find one , l buy it in large quantities, enough to last many years !!  </li>
            <li> Certainly not weak.  </li>
            <li> what little hair I have it certainly gets the workout and more.</li>
            <li> Mine is several years old and in fine shape.  </li>
            <li> But it does the job of spreading out the oil in my hair decently well.  </li>
            <li> and I bought this brush not being able to afford the more expensive boar bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend purchasing</li>
            <li> Just as nice as more expensive brushes I have owned of the same design.</li>
            <li> With the great price you cant go wrong.  </li>
            <li> MY IDEA of great is difficult.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is narrow so u will need to take more strokes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stiff but nothing treats my hair better than boar bristles.</li>
            <li> These bristle feel more like stiff wire than boar bristle.</li>
            <li> This brush really has plastic bristles--you can barely see any boar bristles in it.</li>
            <li> The large handle makes it easier to grip especially for someone with hand problems.</li>
            <li> A little bigger would be better.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff but they&#x27;re softening up just fine now.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight hair, and</li>
            <li> and it came early as i</li>
            <li> This brush was no where near what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I broke my old brush of 30+ years, so I went to the stores to replace it.  </li>
            <li> There are lots of bristles, and the brush is soft to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed how soft my hair is after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> The extra firm bristles are better then the Boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> It was more trouble sending it back than keeping it.  </li>
            <li> I think the hairs are not as thick, or there aren&#x27;t as many (I&#x27;ve never laid them side by side because one is in the office and one is at home).  </li>
            <li> My Dad had been struggling to find a replacement for his old brush because the bristles were never stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> This brush does have a few natural boar&#x27;s bristles, but most of the bristles are a very firm plastic that doesn&#x27;t flex much.</li>
            <li> It is firm enough to easily brush bushy hair into place but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The only reasons I give it four stars instead of five are: (1) the product name may lead some to believe the bristles are all boar hair, however most of the bristles are synthetic; and (2) I would have preferred to pay a couple bucks more and have the brush made in America instead of China.</li>
            <li> My husband has fine but thick hair</li>
            <li> I generally follow up with a softer brush and  feel that I have done my duty.</li>
            <li> :The hairs are very though so if you aren&#x27;t into it be careful about purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush with VERY stiff bristles; too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> Firm enough, in fact, to pull your hair right out of your head.  </li>
            <li> For someone with very short hair, I find that the ends of the bristles on this particular model are far to sharp, and combined with the stiffness it actually scratches my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a natural boar bristle, however, this one is a \\&quot;reinforced boar bristle\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is super hard.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to press super hard to get the brush</li>
            <li> exactly what l want : stiff bristles that will slightly soften  in time -- but not too much.</li>
            <li> It distributes the natural oils in your hair evenly so your scalp doesn&#x27;t become dry and flaky and so your ends don&#x27;t split.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really satisfied with this brush for the past few months.</li>
            <li> This brush is firm and is still able to brush through my very thick, coarse, wavy hair, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very firm, which has been great for my thick curly hair, which I usually keep cut fairly short.</li>
            <li> Definitely stiff bristles, but they didn&#x27;t stay in very well.  </li>
            <li> This brush is one of the essential brushes for achieving wave hair styles for people with tight natural curls.  </li>
            <li> and I woudl recommend buying it especially with the bristle brush selection limited</li>
            <li> Quite a firm brush most of the bristles in mine are synthetic (probably nylon or plastic) with a few *very* sparse boar bristles mixed in (probably so they don&#x27;t get in trouble for false claims).</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much boar hair in the bristle, but a lot of hard plastic.</li>
            <li> The brush is too small and bristles not firm enough.</li>
            <li> even though it was much smaller than I expected (almost child size).  </li>
            <li> When this brush arrived, its handle was smaller than I expected but this turned out to be a bonus as I keep it in my car&#x27;s glove box for touchups before exiting.</li>
            <li> When I received this brush it was definitely smaller than I had expected it to be (I noticed the size dimensions after I placed the order, so it&#x27;s not that their description was deceptive).  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and have always wanted to use a Boar Bristle Brush but were always disappointed that they couldn&#x27;t get through your hair, this is definitely a good brush to try!</li>
            <li> I can brush my hair with it, so long as I&#x27;m careful not to take my head along with it.</li>
            <li> My head only has hair on the bottom half.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like how big it is, or how firm the bristles are due to the thick plastic bristles--go ahead and buy a 100% boar brush.</li>
            <li> I have beenn looking for a hair brushwith stiff bristles for a long time, and I finally found 0ne.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a little smaller than I expected, but it does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Bristles are entirely too hard for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> They started to come out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> However the extra firm is extra firm since the boars bristles are mix with a plastic bristle.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I only use it for a few times an</li>
            <li> However, they are very rigid and my poor scalp tingles....</li>
            <li> basically you get what you pay for here and even then this is not much...</li>
            <li> and I brushed my hair a few times to put some oil in it</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> , however, it is, just as it says, extra firm.  </li>
            <li> I may have to try running the brush along a rough surface in order to soften the bristle tips.</li>
            <li> I bought five of them for family members and one member loves using it for wet hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a Boar Bristle brush a couple of years ago and it was always so rough on my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> The wood handle seems to be slip ressiant when wet.</li>
            <li> I have rather thick, straight hair, and this brush is too firm for me.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple other boar bristle brushes and have been disappointed that they won&#x27;t do anything more than slide down the topmost outer \\&quot;layer\\&quot; of my hair -</li>
            <li> Very sturdy - I kept breaking the handles on the fake wood plastic ones from the store.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Have always used boar bristle brushes from Fuller or Bass.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to shed often and had to be brushed twice a day if I don&#x27;t want dreads</li>
            <li> Can definitely brush through thick, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> My other hard Boar Bristle brush only seemed to make my hair frizzier because of how stiff the bristles were.  </li>
            <li> Have been using the brush for less than six months and the bristles are already falling off, one or two at a time.</li>
            <li> My only other disappointment was that the handle was a little to short for the average hand</li>
            <li> It gets all the way down to my scalp without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Bristles hold tight, will not wilt.  </li>
            <li> I think for me it could be just a little less firm, and the handle could be a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> There is no static build up like her other brush.</li>
            <li> However, having one that was a little wider than this one takes some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> only time i would recommend this brush is if you have very thick and bushy hair</li>
            <li> so he needs a firm brush.</li>
            <li> You can also see where the coating over the wood ran and dried as a fat drop that no one bothered to correct.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I had this product for a few months now and the bristles started to fall out.</li>
            <li> It is firm believe that.</li>
            <li> Its almost too firm.</li>
            <li> ; means there&#x27;s just enough soft boar hairs to make it smell bad and raise sanitation concerns, but all the brushing comes from the uncomfortably stiff plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a brush with really stiff bristles that would help remove the tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li> I like a stiff brush and this is it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe too stiff for some, but it works well in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are as stiff as the synthetic ones on the Goody brush too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider my hair to be exceptionally thick, but it still had a little trouble.  </li>
            <li> Very hard brush please be careful on your scalp if you are using it for waves.</li>
            <li> This brush is really small...</li>
            <li> but the handle is&lt;br /&gt;much to small for my hand.</li>
            <li> This brush fits in my small hand so well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the boar bristles were reinforced, but they feel like nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it would be to find a plain brush of this type.  </li>
            <li> Very few bristles compared to the illustration.</li>
            <li> It is very stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably designed for horses but even then I wouldn&#x27;t subject the poor animal to this thing.</li>
            <li> is it was all boar bristle instead of boar and plastic, but for the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> He had a hard time finding one, but this does the job.</li>
            <li> The bristles are unbelievably hard and course.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit hard though.</li>
            <li> Bristles are so hard it feels like you are brushing your scalp with a wire brush.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you the bristles on this brush are really hard, to the point of scratching my scalp...</li>
            <li> It is very hard and stiff and seems like my hair is breaking when I use it.</li>
            <li> If you trynna set your waves though and your hair is kinda thick or just curly, pick this one up.</li>
            <li> It straightens and tidies my hair when other brushes fail.  </li>
            <li> not sure from stimulation or penetration of skin !</li>
            <li> Because I wasn&#x27;t going to be using it as often I went with a less expensive brush like this one, and I can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too hard for no reason an the quality is really poor</li>
            <li> Overall for the price though I&#x27;m not too shocked.</li>
            <li> This might work for people with very thick hair, where the brush would have little contact with your scalp, but I imagine it would still be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If you want a very hard brush, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> not happy about it</li>
            <li> Worse brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Was a little disappointed when I received it</li>
            <li> if it fails you, you can always use this brush as a penis scratcher.</li>
            <li> i was sent the absollute WRONG brush.</li>
            <li> you can,t go wrong with a diane...</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a brush like this for quite sometime.  The natural bristles don&#x27;t break or pull my fine hair as much and work the natural oils through my hair, much better.  It&#x27;s great for brushing out tangles as well</li>
            <li> It was pretty good, there were a lot more reinforcements than boar bristles but for the price it was good</li>
            <li> This is a good, small brush. I needed brushes for my long-haired dogs, but could not afford $35 each that the pet shop wanted for boar brushes, I ordered two of these, and then ended up keeping them for myself. So I ordered three more for the dogs. My long-haired Dachshunds love to sit on my lap and be brushed. So does the short-haired Beagle.  Sure, it would be nice is it was all boar bristle instead of boar and plastic, but for the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Just as nice as more expensive brushes I have owned of the same design.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to have on hand in my office, after using a boar bristle brush at home for the last year or so.  Because I wasn&#x27;t going to be using it as often I went with a less expensive brush like this one, and I can tell the difference.  I have been using the Ambassador olive wood hair brush (costs about 5x more), and it feels and works much better.  I have short, straight hair, and even so, this Diane brush does not brush the hair into place without more effort and more attempts.  I think the hairs are not as thick, or there aren&#x27;t as many (I&#x27;ve never laid them side by side because one is in the office and one is at home).  It still gets the job done, however, I am much more pleased with the Ambassador brush, both in terms of its utility and the way it feels in the hand.  This is a good inexpensive brush in its own right based on price, but against at least one competitor, it does not measure up.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. It distributes the natural oils in your hair evenly so your scalp doesn&#x27;t become dry and flaky and so your ends don&#x27;t split. It won&#x27;t damage and break your hair and it keeps mine looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the essential brushes for achieving wave hair styles for people with tight natural curls.  With the great price you cant go wrong.  Very hard brush please be careful on your scalp if you are using it for waves. It is super hard.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for a natural boar bristle, however, this one is a \\&quot;reinforced boar bristle\\&quot;. There isn&#x27;t much boar hair in the bristle, but a lot of hard plastic. It is OK, but not what I was hoping for. Otherwise it is well made and looks quite durable.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. Works great. Sturdy.</li>
            <li> Definitely stiff bristles, but they didn&#x27;t stay in very well.  They started to come out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  It straightens and tidies my hair when other brushes fail.  It stands up to some abuse, having been dropped many times without breaking.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Good product for a good price. A little bigger would be better.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little smaller than I expected, but it does it&#x27;s job well.  My hair seems to be a little too thick for it to do it all at once, but that is okay, for the price it is great.</li>
            <li> Bristles are entirely too hard for someone with short hair. This is definitely NOT meant to touch a scalp</li>
            <li> Very sturdy - I kept breaking the handles on the fake wood plastic ones from the store.  The extra firm bristles go thru any type of hair and, best of all, it was not very expensive.</li>
            <li> Great brush to use with polmade in men&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> I love this brush. it keeps my hair looking good and it also works good when my balls are itchy. if it fails you, you can always use this brush as a penis scratcher.</li>
            <li> My husband has fine but thick hair so he needs a firm brush. He had a hard time finding one, but this does the job. He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product even though it was much smaller than I expected (almost child size).  It doesn&#x27;t matter.  My head only has hair on the bottom half.  [[ASIN:B0017SBZ62 Diane Reinforced Boar Bristle Club Brush #8158]]</li>
            <li> The extra firm bristles are better then the Boar bristles.  However the extra firm is extra firm since the boars bristles are mix with a plastic bristle.</li>
            <li> Great brush to use as a comb on short hair.  It is so good that my son took it a decided to use it as his own...now he owes me a brush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple other boar bristle brushes and have been disappointed that they won&#x27;t do anything more than slide down the topmost outer \\&quot;layer\\&quot; of my hair - nothing under that even gets touched by the bristles, as they are just way too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS brush, however, DOES work well, and DOES get through to the hairs underneath the topmost layer, so it does a MUCH better job of smoothing ALL of my hair, and distributing the natural oils on more than just the very top/outside layer.  The handle is a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but it is still comfortable and made from beautiful wood. This is a very nice quality brush; it is hard to find brushes these days that are wood, and have boar bristles like this.  And you really can&#x27;t beat it for the money - fabulous deal at just $3.49 with free Prime shipping!!</li>
            <li> Brought this comb for my son, he loves it so much that I had to take it away from him while he does homework. I mean, who can do homework and brush their hair at the same time, LOL! Also, his waves are in full effect with out and wax. JUST WATER AND BRUSHING!!!</li>
            <li> terrible. i was sent the absollute WRONG brush. it was not the one in the picture. not happy about it</li>
            <li> Pulls hair! Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush as far as function goes. However, the craftsmanship was shoddy at best. The brush has a petrified fly in the handle. You can also see where the coating over the wood ran and dried as a fat drop that no one bothered to correct. If you are looking for a cheap brush that will do it&#x27;s job, you are in the right place.</li>
            <li> This brush is not what I was expecting I really don&#x27;t like it it&#x27;s just too hard for no reason an the quality is really poor I only use it for a few times an it already start falling apart</li>
            <li> These bristles are reinforced and may break in over time. However, they are very rigid and my poor scalp tingles....not sure from stimulation or penetration of skin !</li>
            <li> I have beenn looking for a hair brushwith stiff bristles for a long time, and I finally found 0ne.  The end.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a 100% boar bristle brush...it&#x27;s not. It is very hard and stiff and seems like my hair is breaking when I use it. However, because of the price it wasn&#x27;t worth it to return it. I do not recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Quite a firm brush most of the bristles in mine are synthetic (probably nylon or plastic) with a few *very* sparse boar bristles mixed in (probably so they don&#x27;t get in trouble for false claims). Overall for the price though I&#x27;m not too shocked.</li>
            <li> I was getting my 360&#x27;s on!</li>
            <li> This brush i so bad i felt like i was brushing my hair with  WIRE brush..OUCH!!!!  Threw it in the trash imediatelly... basically you get what you pay for here and even then this is not much... only time i would recommend this brush is if you have very thick and bushy hair</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected that&#x27;s probably my fault though. Brush wise it is a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a brush with really stiff bristles that would help remove the tangles in my hair. It works pretty well. I like it a lot more than the nylon bristle brush I have.</li>
            <li> what little hair I have it certainly gets the workout and more. I generally follow up with a softer brush and  feel that I have done my duty.Seems to be well constructed.n</li>
            <li> This brush is really small... more for Men than for Women.  The bristles are nice and I&#x27;ll use it but the handle is&lt;br /&gt;much to small for my hand.</li>
            <li> I like a stiff brush and this is it.  Maybe too stiff for some, but it works well in my hair.  I use a 2nd one in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be well made.  I had another boar hair brush from Sally Beauty, but the paint released from the wood and some of the bristles came out after a year or so.  This one appears to be better quality; we wil see.</li>
            <li> Worse brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  A waste of money.  It&#x27;s probably designed for horses but even then I wouldn&#x27;t subject the poor animal to this thing.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush to my sister. It&#x27;s definitely for thick hair. The label will wear off, but she said it feels great on her scalp. The bristles are close, so UR waves will be deep (if UR into brush waves). It&#x27;s about 10% boar bristle, but it&#x27;s worth the buy. The head of the brush is narrow so u will need to take more strokes.</li>
            <li> Love a wave brush. This seems to be working out well.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this brush is perfect for me. (from here on I had to add because Amazon told me to)I can see how people with thinner hair might not like it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff but they&#x27;re softening up just fine now. My husband bought it to use with his beard and I brushed my hair a few times to put some oil in it and it works PERFECT!</li>
            <li> For the price the article can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> i have coarse Asian hair and it does wonders. my hair i so shiny after using this brush and putting my hair in a ponytail is now faster and easier than ever. love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush and it works.  Not much to say.  Definitely worth the buy though.  I totally recommend it if you need a cheap quality brush.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected. The bristles are a bit stiff but nothing treats my hair better than boar bristles.</li>
            <li> I had this product for a few months now and the bristles started to fall out. Not worth it, now i have to look for another brush. I was hoping to have a brush that would benefit my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It is firm enough to easily brush bushy hair into place but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp.  I am very happy that I selected this product.</li>
            <li> might be good if you have a flat head.</li>
            <li> perfect. keeps my hair how I want it.</li>
            <li> Very good men&#x27;s brush.  I used to use a Goody brush that had synthetic bristles.  This is about the same length, but wider by an inch.  It still fits in my shaving bag for when my wife and I go on vacation, or in the medicine cabinet.  The bristles are as stiff as the synthetic ones on the Goody brush too.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.  I have extremely fine hair (but a lot of it) that tends to tangle easily.  This brush could not get out the tangles at all.  On a positive note, my cats love it!</li>
            <li> Its really extra firm and im guessing my husband will not be happy on this.oh well looks nice thou and it came early as i expected.thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for my beard and it works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it has held up well. Good value!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it every day and does what I wanted it to do but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Reinforced Boar Bristle&#x27; this is a joke... There is about 10% boar bristles on this brush. But you cant even get this good a brush at Wal-mart for the price, so I&#x27;ll disregard my complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was a little disappointed when I received it but it works as intended.</li>
            <li> well i saw a video on youtube that suggest the brush for wave.. i used it and i have to say that its great.. i would suggest leaving it in water overnight to make the brush easier to use if you have short hair... i have to buy 2 more cause the keep \\&quot;disappearing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, brushes it all the way through, and gets the oils distributed. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> More plastic than boars hair. Description states one hundred percent boars hair but i would say it&#x27;s ninety five percent plastic.</li>
            <li> This brush was no where near what I was looking for.  I initially asked for a dubl duck brush with nylon bristles.  It was more trouble sending it back than keeping it.  So....I kept it.</li>
            <li> This brush really has plastic bristles--you can barely see any boar bristles in it. I really didn&#x27;t like how big it is, or how firm the bristles are due to the thick plastic bristles--go ahead and buy a 100% boar brush.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s good.  I wish there was more boar bristle though, it&#x27;s mostly plastic bristles.  But it does the job of spreading out the oil in my hair decently well.  This will eventually just be the brush I keep at work while I wait to buy a better quality one.</li>
            <li> Needed a brush firm enough to untangle, but still gentle. This is good for that use. It is very stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush with VERY stiff bristles; too stiff for me. Might be good for cleaning the BBQ grille though.</li>
            <li> bought this one for my son.  Mine is several years old and in fine shape.  Bristles hold tight, will not wilt.  Certainly not weak.  good hand fit and feel.  Use it every day. Worth the money.  A good stocking stuffer for your son.</li>
            <li> Over 75% of the bristles in this brush seem to be plastic.  In my opinion, it  should be labeled a wooden brush with plastic bristles which includes some boar bristles.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush but not quite as good as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> The brush is too small and bristles not firm enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He is very pleased with it. The value is excellent, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This brush does not hurt my daughter when I brush out the knots.  There is no static build up like her other brush. Her hair looks thicker and fuller after brushing with this Boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> this brush is a must to tha guy that want his hair too look an feel good you can,t go wrong with a diane...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really satisfied with this brush for the past few months. I do admit that I haven&#x27;t owned many brushes in my life, but this one has been quite good and I&#x27;ve been happy with the purchase. The brushes are very firm, which has been great for my thick curly hair, which I usually keep cut fairly short.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. However, having one that was a little wider than this one takes some time to get used to. The brush is fine and I woudl recommend buying it especially with the bristle brush selection limited</li>
            <li> When this brush arrived, its handle was smaller than I expected but this turned out to be a bonus as I keep it in my car&#x27;s glove box for touchups before exiting.</li>
            <li> The bristles are unbelievably hard and course. It actually hurts to use this brush. The bristles feel more like wire. Actually. I was a house painter years ago and this brush&#x27;s bristles are similar to what we used to scrape paint.</li>
            <li> Great brush period! If you want your hair to lay and look smooth? Well this is all you need. A++++++</li>
            <li> I broke my old brush of 30+ years, so I went to the stores to replace it.  I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it would be to find a plain brush of this type.  I looked everywhere and finally found this on Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This brush is good for me.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like it for years, and here it is, convenient and cost effective.  Make no mistake, however, it is, just as it says, extra firm.  If you don&#x27;t want that, try a different brush.  I think for me it could be just a little less firm, and the handle could be a bit longer.  Still, it&#x27;s much closer than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Diane brushes speak for themselves. I&#x27;m happy with this nice firm brush that gets to my scalp through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Firm enough, in fact, to pull your hair right out of your head.  You have been warned.  Caveat emptor, my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Boar&#x27;s bristle brushes most of my life. I bought this one because it was reinforced. Most of the bristles do break off over time. This one is a bit hard though. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to use it in a hurry and in an unthinking way - it would probably claw my head! For the price though i&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> For someone with very short hair, I find that the ends of the bristles on this particular model are far to sharp, and combined with the stiffness it actually scratches my scalp. I may have to try running the brush along a rough surface in order to soften the bristle tips. Suggestions are welcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Goodie for years this is comparable.</li>
            <li> This brush works well for fine hair.  For individuals with thicker/coarse hair or curly hair, this brush probably is not the right choice.  Construction is reasonably solid.  The only reasons I give it four stars instead of five are: (1) the product name may lead some to believe the bristles are all boar hair, however most of the bristles are synthetic; and (2) I would have preferred to pay a couple bucks more and have the brush made in America instead of China.</li>
            <li> I really like my brush&lt;br /&gt;Feels the way I hoped&lt;br /&gt;fits in the palm of my hand the way I hoped it would&lt;br /&gt;A good buy&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend purchasing&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price</li>
            <li> Bristles are so hard it feels like you are brushing your scalp with a wire brush. Definetly would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very few bristles compared to the illustration. Have always used boar bristle brushes from Fuller or Bass. These bristle feel more like stiff wire than boar bristle. Not worth returning. Off to the trash.</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush is an excellent brush.  It gets all the way down to my scalp without being too harsh.  It is easy to hold on to and makes a great travel brush.  I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Not even a week of using it and the bristles have already started falling out. :( I was looking forward to having this brush for awhile.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement brush for one that I have had for maybe 8 years now. The bristles finally started to fall out. This one might last 10 years.</li>
            <li> When I bought this brush, the Diane Men&#x27;s Reinforced Boar Bristle #8158, I also bought Diane Men&#x27;s #8118 100% Boar Brush.  And let me tell you the bristles on this brush are really hard, to the point of scratching my scalp... but, I believe that IF you have coarse, thick hair, this brush should be perfect.  The Men&#x27;s #8118 Club Brush 100% Boar Bristles is, for me, an excellent brush, as I have fine hair, and this brush is absolutely perfect and does a great job. There are lots of bristles, and the brush is soft to the scalp.  I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more of the Diane #8118 100% Boar Sterilized brushes. Excellent Product and well made.</li>
            <li> This brush is not bad at all as a backup brush in the car or something. It is firm believe that. Its almost too firm. If you trynna set your waves though and your hair is kinda thick or just curly, pick this one up.</li>
            <li> When I received this brush it was definitely smaller than I had expected it to be (I noticed the size dimensions after I placed the order, so it&#x27;s not that their description was deceptive).  It&#x27;s a very nice brush.  The wood handle has no splinters or rough spots to tangle long hair and the bristles are super-stiff which is great for someone with thicker hair like mine.  If you have fine hair or a sensitive scalp I would recommend you try one of their softer brushes.  If you have thick hair and have always wanted to use a Boar Bristle Brush but were always disappointed that they couldn&#x27;t get through your hair, this is definitely a good brush to try!</li>
            <li> Pros:It is a very durable/solid comb for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:The hairs are very though so if you aren&#x27;t into it be careful about purchasing. My only other disappointment was that the handle was a little to short for the average hand</li>
            <li> This brush does have a few natural boar&#x27;s bristles, but most of the bristles are a very firm plastic that doesn&#x27;t flex much. I have rather thick, straight hair, and this brush is too firm for me.</li>
            <li> Marvelous product!  I have thick hair that tends to shed often and had to be brushed twice a day if I don&#x27;t want dreads lol and this brush doesn&#x27;t damage any part of my hair and gets the job done in an exceptionally timely manner.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have semi-thick wavy hair and I bought this brush not being able to afford the more expensive boar bristle brushes.  I feel like I have to press super hard to get the brush all the way through my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider my hair to be exceptionally thick, but it still had a little trouble.  I don&#x27;t know how well it works in terms of distributing the oil since most of the bristles are plastic, but it does a medium job detangling.</li>
            <li> This brush fits in my small hand so well.  It&#x27;s sturdy and almost has a massaging effect on the scalp.  I would not be complaining about this brush.  It is a fantastic product for the money.  Disposable items are about this price point and believe me, this is one sturdy brush!  You can&#x27;t lose!  I personally love it. I bought five of them for family members and one member loves using it for wet hair.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Reinfored boar bristles&amp;#34; means there&#x27;s just enough soft boar hairs to make it smell bad and raise sanitation concerns, but all the brushing comes from the uncomfortably stiff plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush.  I bought it for my husband and he is very happy with it.  Very good price.</li>
            <li> I bought a Boar Bristle brush a couple of years ago and it was always so rough on my scalp and hair.  This brush is firm and is still able to brush through my very thick, coarse, wavy hair, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  I have also noticed how soft my hair is after using this brush.  It really does seem to distribute the oils from my scalp to the rest of my hair as I brush. My other hard Boar Bristle brush only seemed to make my hair frizzier because of how stiff the bristles were.  I plan on buying more of these brushes as they really do work!</li>
            <li> This might work for people with very thick hair, where the brush would have little contact with your scalp, but I imagine it would still be uncomfortable. I&#x27;m not sure how the boar bristles were reinforced, but they feel like nails. I can brush my hair with it, so long as I&#x27;m careful not to take my head along with it.</li>
            <li> Have been using the brush for less than six months and the bristles are already falling off, one or two at a time. I only use the brush once a day 5 to 6 days a week for about 2 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> My Dad had been struggling to find a replacement for his old brush because the bristles were never stiff enough.  (He credits the brush for having a full head of hair at 84.)  This brush was just right!</li>
            <li> If you want a very hard brush, this is the one for you. Can definitely brush through thick, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> this hair brush is strong and very well made.The large handle makes it easier to grip especially for someone with hand problems.The bristles are strong and make brushing your hair a breeze.The wood handle seems to be slip ressiant when wet.This is a perfect hair brish</li>
            <li> I like the brush but haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should to get clarity as to the benefit and value of using the brush. I will make a concerted effort in the future to use this brush to determine if it produces the effects as claimed by the maker of this product. I will report back at a future date as to whether I believe that the product is an excellent product or a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Finding a hair brush that&#x27;s economical and MY IDEA of great is difficult. When l finally find one , l buy it in large quantities, enough to last many years !!  This is what l did with this brush !  For me, lt&#x27;s exactly what l want : stiff bristles that will slightly soften  in time -- but not too much. l also use this brush on my dog and cat. lt&#x27;s great for them too. lt brings out their natural oils and gives them  nice shiny  hair.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, Eextra firm bristles, compact and travel ready. I bought it to have an extra at work.</li>
