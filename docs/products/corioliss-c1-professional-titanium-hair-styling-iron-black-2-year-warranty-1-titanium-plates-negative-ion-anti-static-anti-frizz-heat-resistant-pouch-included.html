            <li>I loved it so much I was hesitant to buy a new style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I had one of the old ceramic ones until it broke.</li>
            <li>I had the old one with the ceramic plates</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, but it cools down about the same as the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>I just hope it has the same life as my old one, which lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li>I have several different big $$ brands and I  highly recommend this product.  </li>

            <li> I love how it works on my hair. Makes it very straight without volume.</li>
            <li> Love it. Much better than chi.</li>
            <li> it broke and i tried finding a way to return it, no option</li>
            <li> Thiss is a great flat iron. I use it daily and have had no problems. I really like the heat resistant travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Great styling tool.  Doesn&#x27;t stress the hair as, much as other tools. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement to the flat iron she had and she likes the upgrade and the variable temp control.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used hands down.  Most importantly, it wins on &amp;#34;DOES NOT BURN MY HAIR&amp;#34;.  Other curling irons often  leave a scorched smell to my hair, but the Corioliss C1 curls my hair without the risk of  damaging my hair.  I keep the iron at or below the 248F setting and achieve my desired result, no problem.  Additionally, my hair does not get caught at the edge of the plate like it did with other flatirons so it minimizes breakage from that as well.  Love, love, love the fast heat/cool down features and that the temperature dial stays put.  The travel case is a great bonus and the interior doubles as a safe surface for your hot iron between uses.  This is an all around great product.  I hope the Corioliss Team will consider making this in a 2 inch barrel size too!</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these for gifts after friends have used mine.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality of iron.  It is easy to use and has different temperature levels depending on how much heat is required to maintain different hair types.  I have several different big $$ brands and I  highly recommend this product.  Simple to use and the cord is really long.</li>
            <li> Great product does wonders for natural and extensions. Love these professional irons and easy to use for personal use. Liked the C1 better than C3 and great value!</li>
            <li> Well these are my second pair. Love them, they give a smooth finish and do not disturb the natural curl pattern in the hair. Absolutely awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have light wavy hair.  Not too wavy just not pretty straight. So this iron is great for me.  Gives me perfectly straight hair.p, have t tried to do the iron curls with it yet but it gets pretty hot so maybe. Heats up very fast too. I use 400 degrees (out of 450) and that&#x27;s great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift and I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> It does not damage hair. Good temperture controls, it gets hot almost immediately! Straigthens hair fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic!! I love it! I had one of the old ceramic ones until it broke. I loved it so much I was hesitant to buy a new style.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance based on reviews and I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, and much faster than the ceramic plates. Its settings are useful. It heats up quickly, but it cools down about the same as the ceramic plates. It also doesnt snag as much, in fact hardly at all.&lt;br /&gt;This was a good purchase. I just hope it has the same life as my old one, which lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li> I had the old one with the ceramic plates and I like that better. This one is good but not as good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Say it is better than older model.</li>
