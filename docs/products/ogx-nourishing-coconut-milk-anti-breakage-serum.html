            <li>But its really good.</li>

            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>Shipped well, good price</li>
            <li>I like that there are ingredients to help the oil coat and penetrate the hair - but remains fairly lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten through a winter yet using it, but I think it will do a good job keeping my face moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have received soooo many compliments about how good my hair smells ever since I started to use this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it works good!</li>
            <li>or I can use a blow dryer &amp; it ALWAYS turns out great :-)</li>
            <li>Perfect worth the money</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so silky and smooth its just incredible.</li>
            <li>hope this helps repair my hair, worth the price and smells delicious!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - great for hair or skin</li>
            <li>The best anti-breakage system, her hair looks more bright, smooth and helthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as I said, if your hair is already okay, then you do not need this product and will probably not be happy.</li>
            <li>Love this product,  have for years!  </li>

            <li>amazing product</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing -</li>
            <li>It got darker and kind of frizzy</li>
            <li>i also use it on its own and it adds shine and health to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used ogx lemon highlights spray and liked the results...</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying this: I have medium thickness somewhat wavy hair thay used to be healthy, gorgeous, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Have a really nice scent.</li>
            <li>I have yet to come across an organix product I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable and smells good.</li>
            <li>Nice pump bottle, locks off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than I&#x27;d like but still nice</li>
            <li>I wanted to post my own review to mention something I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mentioning.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>Reduces frizz and moistures nicely.</li>
            <li>Rub it between your hands until warm, and have at it.</li>
            <li>Now my hair, while not yet perfect, is so much softer than it was, and my husband enjoys touching it.</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff smells so good!</li>
            <li>This is great my hair feel smooth and strong.</li>
            <li>I have very fine but curly hair.</li>
            <li>:), the best by far.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, but pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product after styling my hair and damaging it with heat this serum leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, wavy hair, or hair that gets snarls in it, try this product!  </li>
            <li>This product is nice, but doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It is just ok.</li>
            <li>As much as I love it...</li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed with Organix products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just totally love this item.</li>
            <li>thing I love about it?</li>

            <li>Although I cannot use more than one pump</li>
            <li>so i applied a bit more.</li>
            <li>This Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum is my utmost favorite of all the products.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels softer after using it and seems to shine more.</li>
            <li>I put it mostly on my ends.</li>
            <li>I really love this product..</li>

            <li>Love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve been using this with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was breaking even more.</li>
            <li>Product is ok but what I didn&#x27;t like the product got without the dispenser cap.</li>

            <li>This stuff is not only great for your hair</li>

            <li>New favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results</li>
            <li>it causes my hair to dry to a non-frizzy curly finish that am happy to leave the house</li>
            <li>Makes it shiny and happy looking instead of dry and cranky!</li>
            <li>its great to use if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or spending time at the beach though because it doesn&#x27;t rinse out when you get your hair wet.</li>
            <li>My sister uses straight coconut oil from a jar and her hair is so healthy + shiny.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this item is better for straight hair gals.</li>
            <li>my mom also wore the mask and once we washed it off our hair was shiny and full of body and bounce.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that I convince myself do something for my hair when really they do nothing.</li>
            <li>but it sure has made my hair look and feel so much healthier already.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of ogx ♡</li>
            <li>The really impressive thing about it is that the benefits don&#x27;t seem to wash out--so many conditioning/detangling/frizz-free products seem to come out with shampooing and leave my hair in the same condition it was before, if not worse, but this actually does condition my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best serum I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>this is super greasy and makes you look like you havent showered in 10 days.</li>
            <li>quick</li>
            <li>BOX QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I put it on the ends of my hair to give it a super sleek look.  </li>
            <li>The best thing I like about this is that it&#x27;s a great consistency without being overly heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li>seller shipped very fast !</li>
            <li>and it really works!!</li>
            <li>my hair is super right curls.</li>
            <li>I got hooked on how straight and smooth it made my hair, and never used a heat protectant.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best drugstore product i have found to put in my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started putting it in during nighttime and braiding my hair and it gives it a nice sheen, definitely still recommending the product but not for what I though!</li>
            <li>It has such a nice smell that reminds me of summer.</li>
            <li>first week you will have to apply a lot to revive your dead hair maybe but over time you will see beautiful ends with no split hair.</li>
            <li>Also use it on wet hair before protective styling and sets with good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A product well worth the money for anyone looking for healthier hair.</li>
            <li>but when after i use this product my hair is so shiny and soft, i really love it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I was really looking foreword to using this product due to its great reviews.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and it came quick</li>
            <li>(they all have long hair) and now they all use it and love it!</li>
            <li>You can use after a shower or right before you style.</li>
            <li>I use it right after shampooing and conditioning (</li>
            <li>hair RIGHT NOW?</li>
            <li>One box, then another right after.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair very soft and ads a nice shine - not glossy, not shimmery, but a soft shine.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying this product to get pretty hair!!</li>
            <li>It leaves a coconuty sweet scent in my hair which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>My ends looked amazing for going without a haircut that long</li>
            <li>Fast forward a month and a good haircut later, and after putting this stuff in every night, my hair looks healthier and so much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li>unless you run your hands through your hair many, many times, it&#x27;s going to be a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Now that I am using this product, it is growing very rapidly and is soft and silky and healthy all the way from the root to the ends.     </li>
            <li>My hair is now super soft!!!</li>
            <li>So while it may work great on natural hair....use with caution on extensions due to &#x27;oily&#x27; effect it might leave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and worth a try.</li>
            <li>You never need more than a dime-sized amount (1-2 pumps for short to bob length hair).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I used 2 pumps and put it in my roots.  </li>
            <li>My hair will look pretty if i use heat and stuff, but</li>
            <li>really like my hair with this on!</li>
            <li>I bought so many hair masks and different shampoo + conditioners.</li>
            <li>The first day it seemed to make my hair look and feel softer but that is about all.</li>
            <li>This product really, really works!</li>
            <li>Okay, so first off I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, but after reading the reviews, I bought it from my local drug store.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smoother and revitalized and with this serum and overall better nightly care</li>
            <li>so you mistakenly think you&#x27;ll need more than you actually do.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It does what it says and it works within the first use.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel healthier and definitely shine more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo smooth, and sooo soft.</li>
            <li>when I first got it I put a bunch in my hair for 8 hours</li>
            <li>I plan to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I love how I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, this product is going to last me forever!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and leaves your hair SO soft silky and shiney</li>
            <li>Also this company does not test on animals ;)</li>
            <li>But if your hair is damaged, then the scales making up your hair will be open and able to absorb this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I added more the next day.</li>
            <li>I have a very curly hair and I love to use this mixed with a spiking gel for just the right hold.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great to use right out of the shower, while your hair is damp smooth it over your hair mid length to ends, and brush out, and let air dry it will make your hair soft, and straight</li>
            <li>With this product, less is more!</li>
            <li>and I love long locks, so</li>
            <li>after I had my first child, my hair really changed.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and plan on buying a case so I can give one to each of my long haired friends.    </li>
            <li>leaves a pretty intense residue.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first one I really like.</li>
            <li>it does leave hair soft, can weigh it down if too much is used, pretty good against frizziness</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super Shiney as well and as far as I can tell has helped with breakage.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>Cool calm drenched with moist rehydrated but yet Light and fluffy</li>
            <li>Breakage decreased considerably and the product leaves the hair lighter and with a very good smell.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy, do not make the mistake of using too much of it at once.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used it for my skin and it has left me feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The company should really look into this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you do, you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re doing this, GENTLY wipe your palms over your hair, and try to distribute it evenly, but use it sparingly closer to your head, if at all.</li>
            <li>However, it is too sticky and doesnt do much in terms of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It was much softer and smoother as a result, with no frizz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is also very appeasing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not seem to benefit me much and did nothing for my curls.</li>
            <li>This works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so much healthier and adds shine without making hair oily.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and it works.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot</li>
            <li>and I blow dry/flat iron to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely AMAZED by the results I got from this product.</li>
            <li>Thus, I have very frizzy ends and a lot of split ends.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work really well for them too,</li>
            <li>I had really frizzy hair</li>
            <li>As for the anti - breakage claims, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference that comes at the hands of this product.</li>
            <li>You might just need to experiment to figure out how much you should be using for your hair.</li>
            <li>I like the odor so much.</li>
            <li>Although I really like Moroccan oil it doesn&#x27;t have as much effect on my hair as this product.  </li>
            <li>These 2 products alone have made my hair much silkier.  </li>
            <li>very concentrated formula</li>
            <li>As someone with very damaged hair from heat and styling, I am always on the lookout for hydrating and strengthening hair products.</li>
            <li>Once I managed to figure out the amount of product which worked for me, I ended up really liking the product.</li>
            <li>Really works (in moderation!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use too much and you will have very shiny and greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li>very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use too much, WARNING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well it works yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair really greasy i dont like it at all</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of difference to my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li>Too much of this stuff</li>
            <li>I like this product so much.  </li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY shiny.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get the middle of your hair instead of making the mistake of going heavy on the top layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair I thought could never look good past my shoulders is now below my bra strap and looks healthier than ever!</li>
            <li>ive been using new shampoos, like really expensive kinds some of the best out there, trying new conditioners, using hair damage repair masks, argan oils, i stopped using heat on my hair, and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out the right amount, it leaves my hair feeling soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I have literally done NOTHING to my hair other than wash &amp; brush it because it&#x27;s always been straight and healthy...</li>
            <li>her hair was so dry and easily breakable because she dyes her hair very often.</li>
            <li>I will be trying some other product that will help me hydrate and detangle my hair better while also defining my curls...</li>
            <li>I bought this a Walmart originally, and then decided to include the next in my Amazon order.</li>
            <li>Loke other reviews have mentioned, there are many advantages to this product.</li>
            <li>I searched for the one miracle product that would restore my hair back to its original state.</li>
            <li>Focus more on the ends of your hair, and any especially dry or damaged areas.</li>
            <li>Keeps my natural hair moisturized without the buildup and excessive greasy feeling and with a good shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole Organix Coconut Oil line.  </li>
            <li>but wow, it really does the trick!</li>
            <li>when she first applied this serum on her hair she was amazed, her hair become so soft and so shiny</li>
            <li>It smooths down the frizzies, detangles, and has seemed to strengthen my hair and give it more elasticity, not to mention added shine.</li>
            <li>Very nice, does not weigh heavily on hair, a must to have in dry climate.</li>
            <li>I can live with that!</li>
            <li>It is extremely smoothing; extremely good for blow dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other serums that left my hair looking great, I&#x27;ll go back to those brands.</li>
            <li>so much so that friends asked if i was using something new in my hair.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I feel like I have a whole new head of hair.</li>
            <li>It starts catching static electricity like crazy.</li>
            <li>And with any product, start with less, and add more if need be.</li>
            <li>Even less than that is better.</li>
            <li>or it made my hair super oily, but that is simply not the case with this serum.</li>
            <li>It also gives it a vibrant shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for virgin hair ( Brazilian, Peruvian, etc..)</li>
            <li>I have very delicate, fine hair that tends to snap easily.</li>
            <li>It smells delightful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li>I think it really nourishes the hair and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>It doesnt create much shine but it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>make hair very shiny but don&#x27;t be completely dependent on this product to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li>Since our hair is naturally about 70% protein, ruining is is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(normally blond and pin straight-really long-almost to my butt ).  </li>
            <li>My normal hair routine is to use Pantene Pro V Hydrating Curl Shampoo and Conditioner, then Morrocan Hair Oil afterwards - I will now add this product to my hair routine</li>
            <li>I have fine/coarse combination natural hair and split my hair into two big sections and used one full pump in each section and then wrapped for the night.</li>
            <li>I have used better product for breakage that doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy look or feel.</li>
            <li>The product will sit in top of your hair shafts and leave it greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick and coating.</li>
            <li>i have relaxed african american hair and relaxed hair tends to break easily and feel like straw.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t frizzy, or dry, just soft and shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>so after getting hair extension I went &#x27;wild&#x27; and bought endless amounts of hair care products and spent a good chunk of change.  </li>
            <li>I fell my hair healthy, shiny, and just plain GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>because I less hair coming out now, my drains aren&#x27;t clogging, the floor isn&#x27;t covered in hair pieces and my hair is becoming longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>Even if you have super long hair like me, do not listen to your instinct and use two pumps.  </li>
            <li>Comes new.</li>
            <li>and I live in a place where it&#x27;s ALWAYS humid.</li>
            <li>I hope a lot of people grow to like this product because I cannot live without it, and I hope the manufacturer NEVER stops making it.  </li>
            <li>I will say though that it is a nice, light oil that does not leave the hair greasy or weigh it down (when used in moderation at least).</li>
            <li>If it feels too heavy once you rub it in your palms, gently wipe off the excess on a towel, and then smooth your hands through your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this lightweight mosturizer does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Yeah, puffy, frizzy, course, wild wavy/curly hair!</li>
            <li>Better then any serum or cream I have ever tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky and moisturized!</li>
            <li>bleached my hair more then 4 times, no more then 10.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>I have very coarse, damaged hair that I have to staighten and even after flat ironing my hair doesn&#x27;t seem smooth.</li>
            <li>I put 1 1/2 pumps in my hair, from the nape down, and my hair stays virtually snarl/knot free.</li>
            <li>Very heavy product, leaves hair oily if you use more than a dab or the size of a pea.  </li>
            <li>love the smell , feels soft, just be carefull not apply a small amount</li>
            <li>Just a little bit before blow drying seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>I use about half a pump and rub it through the ends of my hair (last 3 or 4 inches which I feel are the most damaged).</li>
            <li>Use too much of this and it will weigh your hair down, but it like all oils evaporates over time, and your hair becomes heavy from your own body oils replacing this oil as it evaporates.</li>
            <li>Ok, so i have super complicated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to dry your hand off on a towel after use as the oil is quite thick and</li>
            <li>I put this on my hair every morning, right out of the shower, and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>(Keratin Smooth Flat Iron Spray) then straighten my hair &amp; it lasts SO LONG.</li>
            <li>used to put simple, pure coconut oil into my hair</li>
            <li>:) i have been trying to take good care of my hair because i used to dye it a lot as well as straighten and curl it and blow dry it like crazy and brushed it every 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product about halfway down, and I&#x27;ve found it to be nothing special.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft when I wore it in buns.</li>
            <li>and my stylist didn&#x27;t believe that I really had not gotten a haircut since I saw her last.  </li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t completely remove frizz, even if it isn&#x27;t the point of this product.</li>
            <li>This product conditioned my ends, gave my hair the weight it needed to look natural, and helped fixed it.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at how gooey this was?</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li>soft, slky, non straw-like hair.</li>
            <li>my hair has movement, body, shine and its soft.</li>
            <li>after shampoo - is soft days after.</li>
            <li>For the last couple of days I have been wearing it curly with the serum; I still haven&#x27;t tried the serum with my hair straight.</li>
            <li>spreading it out evenly, only adding to the ends, adding way too much.</li>
            <li>It does smell like coconut, but it is a natural smell, and it goes away once it&#x27;s set in your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle scent, and while not overly manly, it attracts some attention and complements all the same.</li>
            <li>soft feel.</li>
            <li>hair soft</li>
            <li>People always want to know how I get my hair to look naturally wavy but manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, manageable and takes ALL of the frizz and dryness away.  </li>
            <li>But still in denial about this \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; serum I decided to replace my conditioner and round brush... and wash AGAIN with clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Couple drops of this stuff will have your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>product feels soft and silky</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands soooo soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It takes the frizziness out and keeps it soft and wavy without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>she has 11 year old triplets</li>
            <li>, shiny, bouncy, and shiny with ZERO frizz, which was an unexpected result.</li>
            <li>People are always surprised by a soft beard.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the reasons mine stays soft.</li>
            <li>I have very dry naturally curly hair just below shoulders and used about one and a half pumps, mostly on my ends and about halfway up my hair.</li>
            <li>I just squirt out a couple of small drops and comb it through my hair and it completely untangles it and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>dyed my hair numerous times (mainly permenant dye).&lt;br</li>
            <li>And you only need a little of it and your hair is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and its very moisturizing for my dry hair..</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair, so I don&#x27;t even use a whole pump.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this for women of color with extremely dry hair.     </li>
            <li>It really helps my dry hair stay moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have very naturally blonde and brittle Scandinavian hair and it feels as if you take a teeny tiny bit too much, it just sticks together..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stronger, shinier, and actually seems to be growing (likely because the ends aren&#x27;t breaking off as much).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I went through several different oils and cremes trying to find something to give my wispy, feathery hair some life without making it oily and this stuff is the first I found that actually helps.  </li>
            <li>When I came home a couple hours later, I passed a mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair looked - it was much more wavy than usual (almost curly!)</li>
            <li>time is to apply on fresh after shower when your split ends hair cuticles all wet and open.&lt;br /&gt;Massage smoothly at the end of your locks and brush slightly with a wooden brush for even distrubution and let it AIR dry..</li>
            <li>I did not use too much because i did not want to be left with greasy, flat hair.</li>
            <li>Other products are too heavy and weigh down my hair, and others are too light and do not prevent frizz - this one is just right!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put it on late in the day to soften my hair up and smooth it out just to freshen it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>I barely needed a 1/4 of an inch cut off.  </li>
            <li>I am transitioning from a relaxer back to natural hair</li>
            <li>Remember the old Prell shampoo that use to build up after several uses...?  </li>
            <li>Really  no idea why people like this so much.</li>
            <li>Before using this stuff, and having tried everything from Aveda to John Frieda, I could barely get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>so I had to open the bottle and pour directly in my hand.</li>
            <li>and I only ever treat the length, never anywhere near the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This item came broken, the top where the pump should be was off and could not be put on</li>
            <li>i have really dry and damaged hair normally</li>
            <li>Much thicker and heavier than other serum-type products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products over the years to try to control the frizziness, but the few I&#x27;ve found that do help also weigh down my hair, feel gunky, or make my hair look oily after just a day or two after washing</li>
            <li>Oh, my hair is shoulder length, straight not thin, but thick either.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I can put plain coconut oil in my hair and it does perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>usually use mousse to calm my frizz</li>
            <li>I really like using this serum, especially before I put other products in it.</li>
            <li>The first few days I used 15 or so pumps and slathered it in my hair, then wrapped it in a bun and let my hair stay like that over night.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really weighed down by using it.</li>
            <li>You really need to use just the tiniest bit, or your hair will be greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I usually use coconut oil on my skin after I shower but found this works a little better.</li>
            <li>(Yet, it just make sit super hard, which i like, but it is still frizzy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After smoothing this through my after-shower hair every other day for about a month, I see a big difference in how much breakage I have as well as the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li>The parts I didn&#x27;t get as well were still dry and brittle compared to the rest which felt soft and elastic.</li>
            <li>or sometimes I just twist and dry naturally.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thin and/or short, use less than a full pumps worth of product.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair while hers is thick and long - so that might make the difference.</li>
            <li>but I can say that this stuff is super greasy and thick.</li>
            <li>I applied a little more after I blow dried and flat ironed because my daughter has dry natural african american hair.</li>
            <li>I like this one a lot and the bottle comes in the right shape – not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>I have learned that for my hair, I can only add one squeeze to a quarter size amount  of a less intense serum in my hand and mix well before working through my hair.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old curly dry haired daughter used it - same thing.  </li>
            <li>My hair is the thick kind that you have to wet it down every morning and apply some sort of detangler or conditioner just to get a comb through without snapping and breaking strands too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, colored hair (</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve noticed no improvement in my hair breakage, and if you use just a little too much it looks way too oily.</li>
            <li>I have tried Frizz-Ease and other anti-frizz smoothers that didn&#x27;t live up to the hype</li>
            <li>and I live on the other side of the world.</li>
            <li>This can be good or bad depending on how you wear your hair.  </li>

            <li> Even my hairstylist loved it.</li>
            <li> It smells good though.</li>
            <li> But its really good.</li>
            <li> i bought this at the store but thought it would be good if i reviewed this item on here.</li>
            <li> And feel good after drinking water?</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>

            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> Shipped well, good price</li>
            <li> I like that there are ingredients to help the oil coat and penetrate the hair - but remains fairly lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten through a winter yet using it, but I think it will do a good job keeping my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have received soooo many compliments about how good my hair smells ever since I started to use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works good!</li>
            <li> or I can use a blow dryer &amp; it ALWAYS turns out great :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect worth the money</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so silky and smooth its just incredible.</li>
            <li> hope this helps repair my hair, worth the price and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - great for hair or skin</li>
            <li> The best anti-breakage system, her hair looks more bright, smooth and helthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as I said, if your hair is already okay, then you do not need this product and will probably not be happy.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  have for years!  </li>
            <li> I think I need to buy the shampoo and conditioner for it too because I am in love with this product!</li>

            <li> The smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing product</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing -</li>
            <li> It got darker and kind of frizzy</li>
            <li> i also use it on its own and it adds shine and health to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used ogx lemon highlights spray and liked the results...</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this: I have medium thickness somewhat wavy hair thay used to be healthy, gorgeous, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have yet to come across an organix product I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable and smells good.</li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle, locks off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I&#x27;d like but still nice</li>
            <li> I wanted to post my own review to mention something I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mentioning.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> Reduces frizz and moistures nicely.</li>
            <li> Rub it between your hands until warm, and have at it.</li>
            <li> Now my hair, while not yet perfect, is so much softer than it was, and my husband enjoys touching it.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff smells so good!</li>
            <li> This is great my hair feel smooth and strong.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but curly hair.</li>
            <li> :), the best by far.</li>
            <li> It has a mild, but pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product after styling my hair and damaging it with heat this serum leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, wavy hair, or hair that gets snarls in it, try this product!  </li>
            <li> This product is nice, but doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It is just ok.</li>
            <li> As much as I love it...</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with Organix products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I just totally love this item.</li>
            <li> thing I love about it?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Although I cannot use more than one pump</li>
            <li> so i applied a bit more.</li>
            <li> This Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum is my utmost favorite of all the products.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels softer after using it and seems to shine more.</li>
            <li> I put it mostly on my ends.</li>
            <li> I really love this product..</li>

            <li> Love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been using this with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was breaking even more.</li>
            <li> Product is ok but what I didn&#x27;t like the product got without the dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> But she learned after one washing :-)</li>
            <li> and I swear it&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I coat my ends with it</li>

            <li> I have damaged hair and I thought this would be lovely</li>
            <li> My friend happens to love it though.</li>
            <li> but i really love the product in itself...</li>
            <li> time please package product better...</li>
            <li> agree with the reviews about thinner hair--LESS IS MORE.</li>

            <li> Then I washed and added more.</li>
            <li> but the first time i applied this to my hair after showering my hair looked and felt amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for my dry curly hair.</li>

            <li> I think this is a great store bought product that everybody should have if they are trying to get their hair back to being healthy, shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair is fine, medium length, and split end and damage prone.  </li>

            <li> And, as the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s got a wonderful, toasty, sweet, beachy smell.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not only great for your hair</li>
            <li> But after using this product, it became smooth and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave my hair shine, it was light weight, so my hair still had body after using it.</li>
            <li> Really does nice things for my hair.</li>
            <li> The serum feels light</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a smell.  </li>
            <li> Smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> then smooth it on my ends, hairline and throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great shine and moderate frizz control.</li>
            <li> The serum is SUPERANTISPYWARE light weight and nourishing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky while moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the hair is non viable but still..you want that &#x27;healthy glo&#x27; right?</li>
            <li> It works better if applied right after the shower.</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL MUCH PRODUCT ON YOUR HANDS!!!</li>
            <li> But the smell is a little strong, though it does smell very, very good.</li>
            <li> My hair type is curly but fine and tends to be dry, so this product works great for me.  </li>
            <li> New favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results</li>
            <li> it causes my hair to dry to a non-frizzy curly finish that am happy to leave the house</li>
            <li> Makes it shiny and happy looking instead of dry and cranky!</li>
            <li> its great to use if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or spending time at the beach though because it doesn&#x27;t rinse out when you get your hair wet.</li>
            <li> My sister uses straight coconut oil from a jar and her hair is so healthy + shiny.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this item is better for straight hair gals.</li>
            <li> my mom also wore the mask and once we washed it off our hair was shiny and full of body and bounce.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that I convince myself do something for my hair when really they do nothing.</li>
            <li> but it sure has made my hair look and feel so much healthier already.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of ogx ♡</li>
            <li> The really impressive thing about it is that the benefits don&#x27;t seem to wash out--so many conditioning/detangling/frizz-free products seem to come out with shampooing and leave my hair in the same condition it was before, if not worse, but this actually does condition my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best serum I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li> this is super greasy and makes you look like you havent showered in 10 days.</li>
            <li> quick</li>
            <li> BOX QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I put it on the ends of my hair to give it a super sleek look.  </li>
            <li> The best thing I like about this is that it&#x27;s a great consistency without being overly heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li> seller shipped very fast !</li>
            <li> and it really works!!</li>
            <li> my hair is super right curls.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on how straight and smooth it made my hair, and never used a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best drugstore product i have found to put in my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started putting it in during nighttime and braiding my hair and it gives it a nice sheen, definitely still recommending the product but not for what I though!</li>
            <li> It has such a nice smell that reminds me of summer.</li>
            <li> first week you will have to apply a lot to revive your dead hair maybe but over time you will see beautiful ends with no split hair.</li>
            <li> Also use it on wet hair before protective styling and sets with good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A product well worth the money for anyone looking for healthier hair.</li>
            <li> but when after i use this product my hair is so shiny and soft, i really love it.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really looking foreword to using this product due to its great reviews.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came quick</li>
            <li> (they all have long hair) and now they all use it and love it!</li>
            <li> You can use after a shower or right before you style.</li>
            <li> I use it right after shampooing and conditioning (</li>
            <li> hair RIGHT NOW?</li>
            <li> One box, then another right after.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair very soft and ads a nice shine - not glossy, not shimmery, but a soft shine.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying this product to get pretty hair!!</li>
            <li> It leaves a coconuty sweet scent in my hair which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> My ends looked amazing for going without a haircut that long</li>
            <li> Fast forward a month and a good haircut later, and after putting this stuff in every night, my hair looks healthier and so much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li> unless you run your hands through your hair many, many times, it&#x27;s going to be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Now that I am using this product, it is growing very rapidly and is soft and silky and healthy all the way from the root to the ends.     </li>
            <li> My hair is now super soft!!!</li>
            <li> So while it may work great on natural hair....use with caution on extensions due to &#x27;oily&#x27; effect it might leave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and worth a try.</li>
            <li> You never need more than a dime-sized amount (1-2 pumps for short to bob length hair).</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I used 2 pumps and put it in my roots.  </li>
            <li> My hair will look pretty if i use heat and stuff, but</li>
            <li> really like my hair with this on!</li>
            <li> I bought so many hair masks and different shampoo + conditioners.</li>
            <li> The first day it seemed to make my hair look and feel softer but that is about all.</li>
            <li> This product really, really works!</li>
            <li> Okay, so first off I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, but after reading the reviews, I bought it from my local drug store.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smoother and revitalized and with this serum and overall better nightly care</li>
            <li> so you mistakenly think you&#x27;ll need more than you actually do.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It does what it says and it works within the first use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel healthier and definitely shine more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo smooth, and sooo soft.</li>
            <li> when I first got it I put a bunch in my hair for 8 hours</li>
            <li> I plan to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love how I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, this product is going to last me forever!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and leaves your hair SO soft silky and shiney</li>
            <li> Also this company does not test on animals ;)</li>
            <li> But if your hair is damaged, then the scales making up your hair will be open and able to absorb this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I added more the next day.</li>
            <li> I have a very curly hair and I love to use this mixed with a spiking gel for just the right hold.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great to use right out of the shower, while your hair is damp smooth it over your hair mid length to ends, and brush out, and let air dry it will make your hair soft, and straight</li>
            <li> With this product, less is more!</li>
            <li> and I love long locks, so</li>
            <li> after I had my first child, my hair really changed.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and plan on buying a case so I can give one to each of my long haired friends.    </li>
            <li> leaves a pretty intense residue.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first one I really like.</li>
            <li> it does leave hair soft, can weigh it down if too much is used, pretty good against frizziness</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super Shiney as well and as far as I can tell has helped with breakage.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> Cool calm drenched with moist rehydrated but yet Light and fluffy</li>
            <li> Breakage decreased considerably and the product leaves the hair lighter and with a very good smell.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, do not make the mistake of using too much of it at once.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it for my skin and it has left me feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The company should really look into this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you do, you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re doing this, GENTLY wipe your palms over your hair, and try to distribute it evenly, but use it sparingly closer to your head, if at all.</li>
            <li> However, it is too sticky and doesnt do much in terms of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It was much softer and smoother as a result, with no frizz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is also very appeasing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not seem to benefit me much and did nothing for my curls.</li>
            <li> This works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so much healthier and adds shine without making hair oily.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and it works.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot</li>
            <li> and I blow dry/flat iron to get it straight.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely AMAZED by the results I got from this product.</li>
            <li> Thus, I have very frizzy ends and a lot of split ends.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to work really well for them too,</li>
            <li> I had really frizzy hair</li>
            <li> As for the anti - breakage claims, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference that comes at the hands of this product.</li>
            <li> You might just need to experiment to figure out how much you should be using for your hair.</li>
            <li> I like the odor so much.</li>
            <li> Although I really like Moroccan oil it doesn&#x27;t have as much effect on my hair as this product.  </li>
            <li> These 2 products alone have made my hair much silkier.  </li>
            <li> very concentrated formula</li>
            <li> As someone with very damaged hair from heat and styling, I am always on the lookout for hydrating and strengthening hair products.</li>
            <li> Once I managed to figure out the amount of product which worked for me, I ended up really liking the product.</li>
            <li> Really works (in moderation!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use too much and you will have very shiny and greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li> very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use too much, WARNING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well it works yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really greasy i dont like it at all</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of difference to my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li> Too much of this stuff</li>
            <li> I like this product so much.  </li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY shiny.</li>
            <li> Make sure to get the middle of your hair instead of making the mistake of going heavy on the top layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair I thought could never look good past my shoulders is now below my bra strap and looks healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> ive been using new shampoos, like really expensive kinds some of the best out there, trying new conditioners, using hair damage repair masks, argan oils, i stopped using heat on my hair, and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out the right amount, it leaves my hair feeling soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I have literally done NOTHING to my hair other than wash &amp; brush it because it&#x27;s always been straight and healthy...</li>
            <li> her hair was so dry and easily breakable because she dyes her hair very often.</li>
            <li> I will be trying some other product that will help me hydrate and detangle my hair better while also defining my curls...</li>
            <li> I bought this a Walmart originally, and then decided to include the next in my Amazon order.</li>
            <li> Loke other reviews have mentioned, there are many advantages to this product.</li>
            <li> I searched for the one miracle product that would restore my hair back to its original state.</li>
            <li> Focus more on the ends of your hair, and any especially dry or damaged areas.</li>
            <li> Keeps my natural hair moisturized without the buildup and excessive greasy feeling and with a good shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole Organix Coconut Oil line.  </li>
            <li> but wow, it really does the trick!</li>
            <li> when she first applied this serum on her hair she was amazed, her hair become so soft and so shiny</li>
            <li> It smooths down the frizzies, detangles, and has seemed to strengthen my hair and give it more elasticity, not to mention added shine.</li>
            <li> Very nice, does not weigh heavily on hair, a must to have in dry climate.</li>
            <li> I can live with that!</li>
            <li> It is extremely smoothing; extremely good for blow dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serums that left my hair looking great, I&#x27;ll go back to those brands.</li>
            <li> so much so that friends asked if i was using something new in my hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I feel like I have a whole new head of hair.</li>
            <li> It starts catching static electricity like crazy.</li>
            <li> And with any product, start with less, and add more if need be.</li>
            <li> Even less than that is better.</li>
            <li> or it made my hair super oily, but that is simply not the case with this serum.</li>
            <li> It also gives it a vibrant shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for virgin hair ( Brazilian, Peruvian, etc..)</li>
            <li> I have very delicate, fine hair that tends to snap easily.</li>
            <li> It smells delightful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I think it really nourishes the hair and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> It doesnt create much shine but it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> make hair very shiny but don&#x27;t be completely dependent on this product to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> Since our hair is naturally about 70% protein, ruining is is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (normally blond and pin straight-really long-almost to my butt ).  </li>
            <li> My normal hair routine is to use Pantene Pro V Hydrating Curl Shampoo and Conditioner, then Morrocan Hair Oil afterwards - I will now add this product to my hair routine</li>
            <li> I have fine/coarse combination natural hair and split my hair into two big sections and used one full pump in each section and then wrapped for the night.</li>
            <li> I have used better product for breakage that doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy look or feel.</li>
            <li> The product will sit in top of your hair shafts and leave it greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick and coating.</li>
            <li> i have relaxed african american hair and relaxed hair tends to break easily and feel like straw.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t frizzy, or dry, just soft and shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> so after getting hair extension I went &#x27;wild&#x27; and bought endless amounts of hair care products and spent a good chunk of change.  </li>
            <li> I fell my hair healthy, shiny, and just plain GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> because I less hair coming out now, my drains aren&#x27;t clogging, the floor isn&#x27;t covered in hair pieces and my hair is becoming longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Even if you have super long hair like me, do not listen to your instinct and use two pumps.  </li>
            <li> Comes new.</li>
            <li> and I live in a place where it&#x27;s ALWAYS humid.</li>
            <li> I hope a lot of people grow to like this product because I cannot live without it, and I hope the manufacturer NEVER stops making it.  </li>
            <li> I will say though that it is a nice, light oil that does not leave the hair greasy or weigh it down (when used in moderation at least).</li>
            <li> If it feels too heavy once you rub it in your palms, gently wipe off the excess on a towel, and then smooth your hands through your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this lightweight mosturizer does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Yeah, puffy, frizzy, course, wild wavy/curly hair!</li>
            <li> Better then any serum or cream I have ever tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, silky and moisturized!</li>
            <li> bleached my hair more then 4 times, no more then 10.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, damaged hair that I have to staighten and even after flat ironing my hair doesn&#x27;t seem smooth.</li>
            <li> I put 1 1/2 pumps in my hair, from the nape down, and my hair stays virtually snarl/knot free.</li>
            <li> Very heavy product, leaves hair oily if you use more than a dab or the size of a pea.  </li>
            <li> love the smell , feels soft, just be carefull not apply a small amount</li>
            <li> Just a little bit before blow drying seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> I use about half a pump and rub it through the ends of my hair (last 3 or 4 inches which I feel are the most damaged).</li>
            <li> Use too much of this and it will weigh your hair down, but it like all oils evaporates over time, and your hair becomes heavy from your own body oils replacing this oil as it evaporates.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i have super complicated hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to dry your hand off on a towel after use as the oil is quite thick and</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair every morning, right out of the shower, and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> (Keratin Smooth Flat Iron Spray) then straighten my hair &amp; it lasts SO LONG.</li>
            <li> used to put simple, pure coconut oil into my hair</li>
            <li> :) i have been trying to take good care of my hair because i used to dye it a lot as well as straighten and curl it and blow dry it like crazy and brushed it every 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about halfway down, and I&#x27;ve found it to be nothing special.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft when I wore it in buns.</li>
            <li> and my stylist didn&#x27;t believe that I really had not gotten a haircut since I saw her last.  </li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t completely remove frizz, even if it isn&#x27;t the point of this product.</li>
            <li> This product conditioned my ends, gave my hair the weight it needed to look natural, and helped fixed it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how gooey this was?</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li> soft, slky, non straw-like hair.</li>
            <li> my hair has movement, body, shine and its soft.</li>
            <li> after shampoo - is soft days after.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of days I have been wearing it curly with the serum; I still haven&#x27;t tried the serum with my hair straight.</li>
            <li> spreading it out evenly, only adding to the ends, adding way too much.</li>
            <li> It does smell like coconut, but it is a natural smell, and it goes away once it&#x27;s set in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle scent, and while not overly manly, it attracts some attention and complements all the same.</li>
            <li> soft feel.</li>
            <li> hair soft</li>
            <li> People always want to know how I get my hair to look naturally wavy but manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, manageable and takes ALL of the frizz and dryness away.  </li>
            <li> But still in denial about this \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; serum I decided to replace my conditioner and round brush... and wash AGAIN with clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Couple drops of this stuff will have your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> product feels soft and silky</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands soooo soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It takes the frizziness out and keeps it soft and wavy without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> she has 11 year old triplets</li>
            <li> , shiny, bouncy, and shiny with ZERO frizz, which was an unexpected result.</li>
            <li> People are always surprised by a soft beard.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the reasons mine stays soft.</li>
            <li> I have very dry naturally curly hair just below shoulders and used about one and a half pumps, mostly on my ends and about halfway up my hair.</li>
            <li> I just squirt out a couple of small drops and comb it through my hair and it completely untangles it and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li> dyed my hair numerous times (mainly permenant dye).&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you only need a little of it and your hair is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and its very moisturizing for my dry hair..</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair, so I don&#x27;t even use a whole pump.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for women of color with extremely dry hair.     </li>
            <li> It really helps my dry hair stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very naturally blonde and brittle Scandinavian hair and it feels as if you take a teeny tiny bit too much, it just sticks together..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stronger, shinier, and actually seems to be growing (likely because the ends aren&#x27;t breaking off as much).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I went through several different oils and cremes trying to find something to give my wispy, feathery hair some life without making it oily and this stuff is the first I found that actually helps.  </li>
            <li> When I came home a couple hours later, I passed a mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair looked - it was much more wavy than usual (almost curly!)</li>
            <li> time is to apply on fresh after shower when your split ends hair cuticles all wet and open.&lt;br /&gt;Massage smoothly at the end of your locks and brush slightly with a wooden brush for even distrubution and let it AIR dry..</li>
            <li> I did not use too much because i did not want to be left with greasy, flat hair.</li>
            <li> Other products are too heavy and weigh down my hair, and others are too light and do not prevent frizz - this one is just right!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put it on late in the day to soften my hair up and smooth it out just to freshen it up a bit.  </li>
            <li> I barely needed a 1/4 of an inch cut off.  </li>
            <li> I am transitioning from a relaxer back to natural hair</li>
            <li> Remember the old Prell shampoo that use to build up after several uses...?  </li>
            <li> Really  no idea why people like this so much.</li>
            <li> Before using this stuff, and having tried everything from Aveda to John Frieda, I could barely get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> so I had to open the bottle and pour directly in my hand.</li>
            <li> and I only ever treat the length, never anywhere near the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This item came broken, the top where the pump should be was off and could not be put on</li>
            <li> i have really dry and damaged hair normally</li>
            <li> Much thicker and heavier than other serum-type products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products over the years to try to control the frizziness, but the few I&#x27;ve found that do help also weigh down my hair, feel gunky, or make my hair look oily after just a day or two after washing</li>
            <li> Oh, my hair is shoulder length, straight not thin, but thick either.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I can put plain coconut oil in my hair and it does perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> usually use mousse to calm my frizz</li>
            <li> I really like using this serum, especially before I put other products in it.</li>
            <li> The first few days I used 15 or so pumps and slathered it in my hair, then wrapped it in a bun and let my hair stay like that over night.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really weighed down by using it.</li>
            <li> You really need to use just the tiniest bit, or your hair will be greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I usually use coconut oil on my skin after I shower but found this works a little better.</li>
            <li> (Yet, it just make sit super hard, which i like, but it is still frizzy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After smoothing this through my after-shower hair every other day for about a month, I see a big difference in how much breakage I have as well as the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li> The parts I didn&#x27;t get as well were still dry and brittle compared to the rest which felt soft and elastic.</li>
            <li> or sometimes I just twist and dry naturally.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin and/or short, use less than a full pumps worth of product.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair while hers is thick and long - so that might make the difference.</li>
            <li> but I can say that this stuff is super greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> I applied a little more after I blow dried and flat ironed because my daughter has dry natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> I like this one a lot and the bottle comes in the right shape – not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I have learned that for my hair, I can only add one squeeze to a quarter size amount  of a less intense serum in my hand and mix well before working through my hair.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old curly dry haired daughter used it - same thing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is the thick kind that you have to wet it down every morning and apply some sort of detangler or conditioner just to get a comb through without snapping and breaking strands too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, colored hair (</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve noticed no improvement in my hair breakage, and if you use just a little too much it looks way too oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried Frizz-Ease and other anti-frizz smoothers that didn&#x27;t live up to the hype</li>
            <li> and I live on the other side of the world.</li>
            <li> This can be good or bad depending on how you wear your hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this, but it is very thick and VERY powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with major breakage since I moved from a humid to a dry climate.</li>
            <li> how much you use - even a little too much and my hair looks like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> The thing is, I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on very pricey products that promise the same results and none have worked nearly as well as this product has, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> If I do, my hair looks really stringy and greasy, so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice but not ideal for those having thin hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look amazing-shiny straight, not filled with split-ends!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the reviewer, Clay Dragonfly, kept getting oily results unless she was using WAY to much thinking she needed it because of the length of her hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;ll make your roots greasy if you go overboard.</li>
            <li> My hair is kinda frizzy at the ends from too much flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I then flat iron my hair just to infuse shine.</li>
            <li> If you are the type that likes to flat iron your hair, this would be a plus.  </li>
            <li> Just use less, and focus on the ends rather than near your scalp.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair on low heat and viola!</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this for gals with dry or heat-damaged hair.</li>
            <li> especially considering I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft, shiny and never greasy (as long as a stick to a dime size or less)</li>
            <li> Works well on my long hair especially since it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> My hair is an odd combination of half super straight and half kinky-curly, which creates an overall effect of slightly wavy with frizzy little hairs all over.</li>
            <li> This serum did not fix my split and very dry ends, but it did prevent any further drying.</li>
            <li> and i did not have a lot of breakage only minimal.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, silky effect, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I can get a comb through no problem, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz in the humidity, and it&#x27;s shinier and healthier than it&#x27;s been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used products similar to this in the past that were much more expensive and came in smaller quantities.</li>
            <li> another OGX product that I plan to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed long term affects yet, I have been using it about a week</li>
            <li> I was going to go heavy and was willing to spend a few days feeling greasy if it saves four years of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial ( black and white) and I have coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> A girl of color, I have medium to long length hair that becomes dry.</li>
            <li> May be a bit heavy for those of us with fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I am mixed black and indian so my hair is a tight curl naturally</li>
            <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried (and it&#x27;s a long list!</li>
            <li> I put 3-4 pumps size of this lotion at end of my hairs on one side then do the same for other side.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to other oils for my big, manly beard.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to be very careful</li>
            <li> If you have thin or flat hair make sure you use a small amount so that your hair does not get weighed down.</li>
            <li> I can comb it into my hair, then allow it to air dry</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry, frizzy...like straw.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair before I undo twist or braids.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended a serum to me because my hair is damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> Apply it at the end part of your hair the ones that dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and even before my hair was completely dry</li>
            <li> Was suffering from dry scalp and after my wife suggested I use this oil I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I wear braids, and after a while, my hair gets dry and tangled.  </li>
            <li> At this point, my hair will absorb about 4 pumps, and I do this a couple times a day, even if my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> so, i now have damaged dry hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft every time with little to no tangles!</li>
            <li> Although my hair felt shiny and silky the next day, it was a bit weighed down for my liking.</li>
            <li> I always thought I would never be able to grow my hair long because the ends always looked so bad</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this product, then my hair is so dry and brittle!</li>
            <li> If your hair looks greasy, use less next time, and keep the product away from your scalp!  </li>
            <li> I used it when my hair was wet and when it was dry.</li>
            <li> and I put this in when my hair is still wet, scrunch my hair, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thin and the ends always break and get dry and brittle once it gets to a certain length.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and sometimes my hair can get very, very dry.</li>
            <li> After the summer of swimming in a chlorinated pool, my hair was very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> my hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and my horrible frizzy split ends have turned into normal, pretty hair!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found (tried at least 20 others) that actually works in my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> This do not work as well for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to put a lot on your hair as your hair may feel greasy and</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday actually.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my wet hair before styling as it says but, I also use on my off days when I don&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Use it on wet hair after shower and brush it through.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday and sometimes curl it too, so my hair goes through a lot of heat and strain on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> After my shower, when my hair was still wet, a put 2 pumps in my hair and avoided the roots.</li>
            <li> Organiz Coconut Milk serum glides onto my hair when it is wet and provides some moisture.  </li>
            <li> If you have straight hair it would work well also, but I would avoid it if you have thin hair.    </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling heavy and stiff and not soft and glossy as I expected.</li>
            <li> A small amount here goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Usually when I straighten my hair it becomes smooth and silky, but lately it has been breaking badly at the crown of my head causing the hair to stick straight up and look dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This kept up for about a year, until I went natural for a day and noticed my hair was dry, frizzy, tangled, broken off, split ends everywhere....</li>
            <li> And like some other comments say, the effect of this serum lasts.</li>
            <li> And despite some other comments, I CAN use this even when I want some volume.</li>
            <li> Also, I use this is conjunction with the other Organix Coconut styling line.</li>
            <li> It smells divine, it is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like the other store brands do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands of coconut milk and oil and they&#x27;ve all been thinner in texture.</li>
            <li> I use this and the Phyto Organics extreme moisture conditioner/shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This serum gives my hair shine like none other.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> i have used other oils before</li>
            <li> But with extensions you can&#x27;t wash your hair as often as you would normally due to adhesion issues and longevity of hair placement.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well for me as for other reviewers.</li>
            <li> despite the price for such a small amount, i used it as a body oil in the summer, then threw it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i perfer this brands other hair products like the shea butter hair treatment, and the sea kelp.</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking at the other reviews</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially retiring all of the other products I used before.</li>
            <li> when it starts to get dry and you get those little tangles.</li>
            <li> empty or less.</li>
            <li> I started off using too much of it at once which left me feeling dirty, oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that becomes poofy when I allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li> After a few days of applying this product while my hair was dry, and a few times while it was wet, my hair changed dramatically.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of the price.</li>
            <li> : very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth saving those strands and having hair that looks</li>
            <li> stringy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason this gets 2 stars is because it at least smelled like coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have thin hair or just naturally silky hair, work your way up.</li>
            <li> Slowly but surly, I am seeing an improvement and all of my edges are growing back too!</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down, but that&#x27;s what I NEED it to do because I have poofy curly hair.</li>
            <li> It will weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> When I straightened it, it laid down with no frizzies sticking up and looked and felt shiny and silky with movement.</li>
            <li> and I never get that greasy or weighed down look.</li>
            <li> Bleaching breaks down the protein.</li>
            <li> Every other serum I&#x27;ve used weighs my hair down and makes it looks oily no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> other won&#x27;t waste $$ like I did.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product I noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> Together with this serum I have noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> you do less damage.</li>
            <li> When I use it before scrunching it, it leaves my curls a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less breakage after using this for a month and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first and was disappointed because it left my hair so greasy</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for something that would make my split ends less noticeable</li>
            <li> Buying it through Amazon means I have it for 40% less than anywhere else in Oz</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is extremely thick and dry....</li>
            <li> thick, frizzy, dry, damaged, no curl pattern</li>
            <li> Alright guys I have THICK dry</li>
            <li> One little squirt</li>
            <li> two avocados and two tablespoons of this oil two table spoons apple cider vinegar and a little bit of honey and kept it on my hair for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Just the ends and a little up.</li>
            <li> little greasy&lt;br /&gt;Heavy</li>
            <li> but the package was not secure on shipment and my cap is broke.</li>
            <li> I have been applying the serum on towel dried hair and then blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell at all that I have frizzy, dead ends anymore when I have the serum on</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair with Dawn dish detergent 3 times to get rid of all the grease and buildup it left behind.</li>
            <li> A few days of using this serum, and</li>
            <li> Took a few days to wear off.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t waste your money here-go too Wal Mart, Target or RiteAid.  </li>
            <li> when it dried I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I apply this stuff to my scalp every few days and it works its way into my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days.</li>
            <li> So it being oily and heavy does wonders.</li>
            <li> I use on towel dried hair and after drying and styling and as needed.</li>
            <li> I thought the serum was going  to be heavy</li>
            <li> so I use a little bit to help keep the ends hydrated and help tame any frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is not as thick as some of the other hair serums, but it is thicker than Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> hair was badly damaged and crisp.</li>
            <li> one my hair has dried after a wash (usually once a week).</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry by the night that I have to wet it down periodically before bed so that it isn&#x27;t driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair though, and I can tell you from personal experience to use a SMALL amount if your hair is like mine!</li>
            <li> and it leaves the treated hair heavy, dull and greasy --</li>
            <li> 2-3 pumps usually will coat all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair using aphogee shampoo</li>
            <li> Just a small dab on the hand will do</li>
            <li> I usually get it from Target.</li>
            <li> but then I started small and worked my way up.</li>
            <li> This product did stop breakage, but it made my hair oily anywhere i applied it, no matter how small.</li>
            <li> i usually like the OGX lines</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard for to write a review of this product.</li>
            <li> Makes thin hair a little greasy</li>
            <li> Too thick when applied and hard to get rid of even with cleanser shampoo.</li>
            <li> It sucks that I do have some breakage where I part my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of serums and all the ones I&#x27;ve used that were as cheap as this product worked HORRIBLY!</li>
            <li> My hair looked unwashed and dirty after 1 use, and it wouldn&#x27;t wash out with regular shampoo for over a week.</li>
            <li> I was desperate, and hopped from one ripoff product to the next.</li>
            <li> I was desperate, and looked for any product at my local store with protein, which over-bleached hair needs.</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair felt icky.</li>
            <li> I have thin waste length hair and swear by this as a portion of my hair regimen</li>
            <li> I have thick butt length hair that likes to snarl &amp; literally tie</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, high-and low-lighted hair--a recipe for snarls.  </li>
            <li> I put this in my damp hair as directed and since my hair is thick</li>
            <li> either just thick wavy</li>
            <li> But she has thick frizzy curly curly hair.</li>
            <li> When a hair stylist recommended this, I was skeptical due to the price and the fact that you can get it from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Mine is on the thin side, generally straight, and not to mention I have thyroid disease, which affects my hair terribly, causing it to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I hate heavy, sticky products especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t get a hold of the seller to get an exchange, ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair feel dirty and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers recommend not using it on thin hair.</li>
            <li> It does it all worse when it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li> Absolute worst purchase ever!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone with oily or thin hair, or if you want a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a girly girl and my poor hair has been breaking and the heat damage is probably irreversible.  </li>
            <li> One of the least expensive hair products that works for me.  </li>
            <li> , I have very long hair (about 18 inches from the base of my neck)</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend another dime on a useless product that would just sit on my dresser not being used.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product (which i purchased at a grocery store for $7).</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and I also bleach it at home.</li>
            <li> My hair was so awful I almost cut what I&#x27;d spent four years growing out.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use something like this because I was afraid of getting greasy hair, but out of desperation, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> The frizz, ehh, its not AS bad, but i still have it.</li>
            <li> in a nutshell, I needed a miracle or could go ahead and buy the shaving cream and razor, as it was that bad.</li>
            <li> But when I got it I was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I messed up with a home bleaching kit and stupidly did it twice in a row.</li>
            <li> This serum is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have terribly frizzy hair</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. If you&#x27;re a guy, do not make the mistake of using too much of it at once. A small amount here goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product but my daughter loves it - so I&#x27;ve combined my mediocre review with her outstanding one. I have short, fine hair while hers is thick and long - so that might make the difference. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Really good product for controlling frizzy hair. Love it</li>
            <li> This do not work as well for me as I expected. It does not give my hair the shine that I wanted. It is just ok. I am African American with relaxed medium length hair</li>
            <li> This is great my hair feel smooth and strong. The best thing is my hair doesnt&#x27;t feel all oil. Recieved quick!</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is very thick and VERY powerful stuff. I have learned that for my hair, I can only add one squeeze to a quarter size amount  of a less intense serum in my hand and mix well before working through my hair. Otherwise, it makes my hair oily. It is a good product, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use it straight without diluting it with another product. Also, my hair is extremely thick and dry....</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product I noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> I use this serum after washing/conditioning my hair with the coordinating shampoo/conditioner and towel drying my hair. It works as a thermal protectant or when I put it in before bed will help define/defrizz my curls overnight. Allowing me to practically roll out of bed and go!</li>
            <li> As much as I love it...its been causing severe hair fall! Mixed Feelings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about halfway down, and I&#x27;ve found it to be nothing special. As an oil and a sort of primer product, it performs fine. But I&#x27;ve noticed no improvement in my hair breakage, and if you use just a little too much it looks way too oily. It does not weigh my hair down, but that&#x27;s what I NEED it to do because I have poofy curly hair. Overall I am impressed with Organix products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Wow! Easy to dab on damp ends..creates silky smoothness. Do not rinse it out. Do not use on bangs. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not only great for your hair but I&#x27;ve used it for my skin and it has left me feeling silky smooth. I usually use coconut oil on my skin after I shower but found this works a little better. It&#x27;s thicker. The company should really look into this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers recommend not using it on thin hair. Mine is on the thin side, generally straight, and not to mention I have thyroid disease, which affects my hair terribly, causing it to be dry and brittle. I take very good care of my hair because of the problems I have with it, though I still do style with heat sometimes, and like to blow it dry. This serum helps a LOT, and it&#x27;s the only one that does so. Every other serum I&#x27;ve used weighs my hair down and makes it looks oily no matter how little I use. And like some other comments say, the effect of this serum lasts. It smooths down the frizzies, detangles, and has seemed to strengthen my hair and give it more elasticity, not to mention added shine. I don&#x27;t need to use this every time I wash, and it still has helped give me healthier hair.  And despite some other comments, I CAN use this even when I want some volume. Just use less, and focus on the ends rather than near your scalp. If your hair is thin and/or short, use less than a full pumps worth of product.YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL MUCH PRODUCT ON YOUR HANDS!!! If you do, you&#x27;re using too much. And with any product, start with less, and add more if need be. If it feels too heavy once you rub it in your palms, gently wipe off the excess on a towel, and then smooth your hands through your hair. When you&#x27;re doing this, GENTLY wipe your palms over your hair, and try to distribute it evenly, but use it sparingly closer to your head, if at all. The hair closest to your head is the healthiest, because it&#x27;s the newest. Focus more on the ends of your hair, and any especially dry or damaged areas. If your hair looks greasy, use less next time, and keep the product away from your scalp!  Also, I use this is conjunction with the other Organix Coconut styling line. This product is what convinced me to try the rest of them! All of their products are great, one just has to know how to use them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with low expectaions because I have tried every hair serum I have ever come accross to no avail. I have long thick hair that becomes poofy when I allow it to air dry. Everytime I have tried a serum it either has not worked at all or it made my hair super oily, but that is simply not the case with this serum. I can comb it into my hair, then allow it to air dry or I can use a blow dryer &amp; it ALWAYS turns out great :-) It also smells AWESOME! I have received soooo many compliments about how good my hair smells ever since I started to use this stuff! BUY it! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I just totally love this item. My hair is kinda frizzy at the ends from too much flat ironing. But after using this product, it became smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenses the serum easily.  Just be careful not to put a lot on your hair as your hair may feel greasy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing I love about it? The smell!  It leaves a coconuty sweet scent in my hair which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed African American Hair. My stylist used this on my hair after a wash and rollerset. From that moment on I was hooked! It smells divine, it is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like the other store brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  June 2013- this is still my go to product! I love it. I now have a pixie cut and I use this on my hair every night before I wrap it for bed and every morning before I style. You never need more than a dime-sized amount (1-2 pumps for short to bob length hair). Keeps my hair soft, shiny and never greasy (as long as a stick to a dime size or less)</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and sometimes my hair can get very, very dry. I read about this product on some of the haircare forums and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I absolutely loved it. It gave my hair shine, it was light weight, so my hair still had body after using it. I used it when my hair was wet and when it was dry. Even my hairstylist loved it. My hair was extremely soft when I wore it in buns. My fiance kept rubbing my head.     This stuff is amazing. I wish they made it in a bigger bottle. I absolutely recommend this for women of color with extremely dry hair.     Works best after a wash and set and for buns and ponytails.</li>
            <li> this product does its job of coating your hair which may prevent further breakage. However, it is too sticky and doesnt do much in terms of moisturizing. It smells good though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. My hair felt dry, frizzy...like straw. After a few days of applying this product while my hair was dry, and a few times while it was wet, my hair changed dramatically. It was much softer and smoother as a result, with no frizz. I&#x27;m going to stock up!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair.  The first time I used this product, I used 2 pumps and put it in my roots.  Big mistake.  My hair looked like it wasn&#x27;t washed in days.  Although I cannot use more than one pump and I do not apply it to my roots since it&#x27;s an oil, I must say that it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, I started using this product and just went for a haircut a week ago.  I barely needed a 1/4 of an inch cut off.  My ends looked amazing for going without a haircut that long and my stylist didn&#x27;t believe that I really had not gotten a haircut since I saw her last.  It sucks that I do have some breakage where I part my hair but it&#x27;s not worth saving those strands and having hair that looks unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also very appeasing.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i have super complicated hair. Yeah, puffy, frizzy, course, wild wavy/curly hair! My hair will look pretty if i use heat and stuff, but im trying to go natural.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use mousse to calm my frizz (Yet, it just make sit super hard, which i like, but it is still frizzy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i tried this, since my mom had it and she never uses it. Woah!!! My hair is now super soft!!! The frizz, ehh, its not AS bad, but i still have it. So it doesn&#x27;t completely remove frizz, even if it isn&#x27;t the point of this product. But its really good. I fell my hair healthy, shiny, and just plain GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like my hair with this on! A definite keeper!!!</li>
            <li> I have had anemia the longest time and I love long locks, so my split ends were unavoidable. This product conditioned my ends, gave my hair the weight it needed to look natural, and helped fixed it. Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried (and it&#x27;s a long list! :), the best by far.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how gooey this was? I&#x27;ve had other brands of coconut milk and oil and they&#x27;ve all been thinner in texture. I have very naturally blonde and brittle Scandinavian hair and it feels as if you take a teeny tiny bit too much, it just sticks together.. I&#x27;ve started putting it in during nighttime and braiding my hair and it gives it a nice sheen, definitely still recommending the product but not for what I though!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best serum I have ever used on my hair. After the summer of swimming in a chlorinated pool, my hair was very dry and brittle. Nothing I did would help it. I bought so many hair masks and different shampoo + conditioners. I came across this product and hesitated, because nothing was working and I didn&#x27;t want to spend another dime on a useless product that would just sit on my dresser not being used. I caved and bought.I was pleasantly surprised. This softened my hair like nothing I&#x27;ve used before. I apply it to the back of my hair and the ends. It makes my hair so soft and it smells great. Coconut it a wonderful product all around. My sister uses straight coconut oil from a jar and her hair is so healthy + shiny. I haven&#x27;t gotten the courage to try that yet though.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff! I use this and the Phyto Organics extreme moisture conditioner/shampoo.  All I can say is wow.  My hair always looks like I just came from the salon.  I use this product everyday actually.  I never have oily buildup or anything.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product (which i purchased at a grocery store for $7). I have very dry naturally curly hair just below shoulders and used about one and a half pumps, mostly on my ends and about halfway up my hair. The first day it seemed to make my hair look and feel softer but that is about all. The next day there was no noticeable benefit leftover so i applied a bit more. My hair is the thick kind that you have to wet it down every morning and apply some sort of detangler or conditioner just to get a comb through without snapping and breaking strands too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not seem to benefit me much and did nothing for my curls. I did not use too much because i did not want to be left with greasy, flat hair. I will say though that it is a nice, light oil that does not leave the hair greasy or weigh it down (when used in moderation at least). Perhaps this item is better for straight hair gals. It&#x27;s just not for me. I will be trying some other product that will help me hydrate and detangle my hair better while also defining my curls...</li>
            <li> This serum gives my hair shine like none other. I use it on dry hair before I undo twist or braids. It smells delightful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all. 2-3 pumps usually will coat all of my hair. *Remember* A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love,love,love all the Organix products.  It&#x27;s all I will use on my hair anymore!  This Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum is my utmost favorite of all the products.  I use it on my wet hair before styling as it says but, I also use on my off days when I don&#x27;t shampoo.  One little squirt and I apply on the ends only, leaving them with a bit of body and looking like I just got a trim.  I gave this product to my best girlfriends at Christmas and dubbed it \\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot;.  Those girlfriends are now hooked too!</li>
            <li> This was the best product I have EVER used on my hair. i have relaxed african american hair and relaxed hair tends to break easily and feel like straw. I usually wash my hair using aphogee shampoo and then I used the reconstructor then I apply this coconut oil after towel drying my hair. I blow dry my hair on low heat and viola! soft, slky, non straw-like hair. I then flat iron my hair just to infuse shine. my hair has movement, body, shine and its soft. TRUST ME! it works!!</li>
            <li> love the smell , feels soft, just be carefull not apply a small amount</li>
            <li> I only used one bottle of this product and I decided to buy another one! I think it really nourishes the hair and makes your hair soft. If I don&#x27;t use this product, then my hair is so dry and brittle!</li>
            <li> Comes new. My hair feels softer after using it and seems to shine more. Use it on wet hair after shower and brush it through. I put it mostly on my ends. Just a small dab on the hand will do</li>
            <li> I really love this product..I used it only once and i did not have a lot of breakage only minimal.  I am transitioning from a relaxer back to natural hair and I defintitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works REALLY well. A girl of color, I have medium to long length hair that becomes dry. I read a report that applying serum after shampoo and conditioned helps to seal in moisture. I have never heard of this product, and read the reviews so decided to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works! My hair - after shampoo - is soft days after. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I applied a little more after I blow dried and flat ironed because my daughter has dry natural african american hair. I can&#x27;t believe how silky and bouncy her hair is. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it handles the humidity.</li>
            <li> I have literally done NOTHING to my hair other than wash &amp; brush it because it&#x27;s always been straight and healthy...after I had my first child, my hair really changed.  It got darker and kind of frizzy (normally blond and pin straight-really long-almost to my butt ).  I saw a comment on Instagram that a woman with hair similar to mine uses coconut oil.  I was hesitant to use something like this because I was afraid of getting greasy hair, but out of desperation, I decided to give it a shot.  LIFE CHANGING!  It makes my hair look amazing-shiny straight, not filled with split-ends!  I use one pump, and use it on the bottom 10&amp;#34; or so of my hair...no problem with it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> i bought this at the store but thought it would be good if i reviewed this item on here. its WONDERFUL and smells WONDERFUL TOO! i made a hair mask with it using, two avocados and two tablespoons of this oil two table spoons apple cider vinegar and a little bit of honey and kept it on my hair for 2 hours. my mom also wore the mask and once we washed it off our hair was shiny and full of body and bounce. i also use it on its own and it adds shine and health to my hair. i love this product, my hair is so shiny i cant get over it i have used other oils before but my hair has never been this healthy looking and shiny. even when i dont put the oil on my hair is still shiny. love it. and i havent had one flake on my hair since using this product, my scalp is even getting healthier. i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used ogx lemon highlights spray and liked the results...so after getting hair extension I went &#x27;wild&#x27; and bought endless amounts of hair care products and spent a good chunk of change.  I plan to post on them all in hope other won&#x27;t waste $$ like I did.&lt;br /&gt;This products I bought at CVS for close to 9.00....yea....rip off.  After washing and air drying my hair I used several pumps in my extensions and noticed they became softer but also kinda &#x27;greasy&#x27; looking.  It&#x27;s almost like it coats the hair rather than nourishes.  Granted the hair is non viable but still..you want that &#x27;healthy glo&#x27; right? Remember the old Prell shampoo that use to build up after several uses...?  That&#x27;s what this reminds me of.  I personally think that it works different on everyone&#x27;s hair and that user discretion to amount and timing is the key.  But with extensions you can&#x27;t wash your hair as often as you would normally due to adhesion issues and longevity of hair placement.  So while it may work great on natural hair....use with caution on extensions due to &#x27;oily&#x27; effect it might leave.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It makes my hair look so much healthier and adds shine without making hair oily.  Will continue to buy and it&#x27;s such a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this a Walmart originally, and then decided to include the next in my Amazon order. it makes my hair very soft and ads a nice shine - not glossy, not shimmery, but a soft shine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I usually get it from Target. It has such a nice smell that reminds me of summer. I have wavy hair and I put this in when my hair is still wet, scrunch my hair, and let it air dry. It looks shiny and smells great. No frizz. Also, this product isn&#x27;t sticky. I hate heavy, sticky products especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Perfect worth the money</li>
            <li> It has a mild, but pleasant coconut smell. My stylist recommended a serum to me because my hair is damaged and dry. I have medium length hair and two pumps is all I need. It&#x27;s a good idea to dry your hand off on a towel after use as the oil is quite thick and unless you run your hands through your hair many, many times, it&#x27;s going to be a little greasy. Use too much of this and it will weigh your hair down, but it like all oils evaporates over time, and your hair becomes heavy from your own body oils replacing this oil as it evaporates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten highlights, and when I do, my hair feels like straw for a while afterwards.  A couple days later, I picked this up and tried it.  I could not believe the difference - my hair felt silkier than it had even before my highlights!  The thing is, I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on very pricey products that promise the same results and none have worked nearly as well as this product has, at a fraction of the price.  This will definitely be a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this serum. I really like it and it works. After washing and conditioning my hair I just squirt out a couple of small drops and comb it through my hair and it completely untangles it and leaves it smooth. Before washing I also occasionally use a coconut oil and rosemary oil combo to leave on my hair for an hour. Together with this serum I have noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> Payment Shipping within,cheaper than KOREA. So I bought amazon. Frequetly used. will buy again. thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only a couple of days and I already notice a difference in the texture and quality of my hair. My normal hair routine is to use Pantene Pro V Hydrating Curl Shampoo and Conditioner, then Morrocan Hair Oil afterwards - I will now add this product to my hair routine one my hair has dried after a wash (usually once a week). I am mixed black and indian so my hair is a tight curl naturally and I blow dry/flat iron to get it straight. For the last couple of days I have been wearing it curly with the serum; I still haven&#x27;t tried the serum with my hair straight.</li>
            <li> but the package was not secure on shipment and my cap is broke.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair feel dirty and weighed down. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well for me as for other reviewers. I have been applying the serum on towel dried hair and then blow drying my hair. It left my hair feeling heavy and stiff and not soft and glossy as I expected. I&#x27;ve tried other serums that left my hair looking great, I&#x27;ll go back to those brands.</li>
            <li> Love this. Not greasy, silky effect, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously. Love this product,  have for years!  I have thin waste length hair and swear by this as a portion of my hair regimen</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and plan on buying a case so I can give one to each of my long haired friends.    I have thick butt length hair that likes to snarl &amp; literally tie it&#x27;s self into knots. It does it all worse when it&#x27;s humid and I live in a place where it&#x27;s ALWAYS humid. So I am always in the search for things that work on my hair and this stuff does a great job. I put 1 1/2 pumps in my hair, from the nape down, and my hair stays virtually snarl/knot free. When I don&#x27;t braid my hair before bed it can take 10-15 minutes in the morning to brush it out but with Organix Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum it takes 30 seconds and 5-6 brush strokes. I think the &#x27;anti-breakage&#x27; isn&#x27;t because it makes the hair stronger or anything like that but because there are fewer tangles to brush out you do less damage. I&#x27;m not sure how the reviewer, Clay Dragonfly, kept getting oily results unless she was using WAY to much thinking she needed it because of the length of her hair. I&#x27;ve never had a problem but then I started small and worked my way up.</li>
            <li> This product really, really works! I have tried so many products that I convince myself do something for my hair when really they do nothing. This has actually salvaged my hair. I always am trying to grow it out but it&#x27;s thin and the ends always break and get dry and brittle once it gets to a certain length. Now that I am using this product, it is growing very rapidly and is soft and silky and healthy all the way from the root to the ends.     * for the record, I don&#x27;t use this like a serum when styling. I put it in my pony tail every time I go to the gym, leave it in for an hour or two and when I&#x27;m done with my workout, I shower it out. I suppose I&#x27;ve been using it a bit like a leave-in conditioner but wow, it really does the trick!</li>
            <li> Do Not Like.&lt;br /&gt;On my hair</li>
            <li> My Favorite Item....I use routinely....</li>
            <li> I was really looking foreword to using this product due to its great reviews. But when I got it I was completely disappointed. The top of the bottle is completely broken off! I can&#x27;t even use it! Absolute worst purchase ever! I also can&#x27;t get a hold of the seller to get an exchange, ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Okay, so first off I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, but after reading the reviews, I bought it from my local drug store. I was absolutely AMAZED by the results I got from this product. I straighten my hair everyday and sometimes curl it too, so my hair goes through a lot of heat and strain on a daily basis. Thus, I have very frizzy ends and a lot of split ends. I was a little skeptical at first because of the price. I&#x27;ve used a lot of serums and all the ones I&#x27;ve used that were as cheap as this product worked HORRIBLY! But because of all the rave reviews I bought it, and I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I did. It&#x27;s definitely oily on your hands but as soon as it hits your hair it turns to silk. It makes your hair so silky and smooth its just incredible. It&#x27;s easy to apply and a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. You can&#x27;t tell at all that I have frizzy, dead ends anymore when I have the serum on and I just love that. The BEST PART is, is that it makes my hair look longer because my ends don&#x27;t break as often anymore. That sort of makes my hair seems to grow a lot faster then it used to. I&#x27;ve tried it on friends who have thicker hair then mine and thinner hair then mine and it seemed to work really well for them too, so in my opinion, it works well for any hair type. DON&#x27;T HESITATE to buy this item, you won&#x27;t regret it! Thanks for reading! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This serum is horrible. I had to wash my hair with Dawn dish detergent 3 times to get rid of all the grease and buildup it left behind. My hair looked unwashed and dirty after 1 use, and it wouldn&#x27;t wash out with regular shampoo for over a week. Going in the trash!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time on my hair, only the ends. It helps my hair keep the moisture and smells delicious. I have had this for over a year and still have about 1/8 left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Too greasy for me. Smells amazing though</li>
            <li> I have blonde, curly/wavy/frizzy hair. my hair is damaged from heat styling almost every week a year ago. my hair is very dry. i call it &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; sometimes. This product did stop breakage, but it made my hair oily anywhere i applied it, no matter how small. i tried everything. spreading it out evenly, only adding to the ends, adding way too much. this is super greasy and makes you look like you havent showered in 10 days. despite the price for such a small amount, i used it as a body oil in the summer, then threw it out. it had no use to me because i would get comments from classmates and friends saying &amp;#34;you hair looks... stringy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason this gets 2 stars is because it at least smelled like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;i perfer this brands other hair products like the shea butter hair treatment, and the sea kelp.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!! Use this product for moisture with my LCO method!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I had really frizzy hair and it really works!! It works better if applied right after the shower. Not just that it really leaves your hair super smooth and does not look oily!!! Love it. Definitely do recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This product showed up with the cap unscrewed and leaked everywhere!</li>
            <li> This is great. It makes my hair soft every time with little to no tangles!</li>
            <li> Really does nice things for my hair. Makes it shiny and happy looking instead of dry and cranky!</li>
            <li> But the smell is a little strong, though it does smell very, very good. It is extremely smoothing; extremely good for blow dry. This is amazing stuff. The best hair serum I have ever used. Nice and thick and coating.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My hair has never been softer. I think I need to buy the shampoo and conditioner for it too because I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> No need for fancy words..do you know how you feel when you thirsty? And feel good after drinking water? Thats excatly how your hair will feel. Cool calm drenched with moist rehydrated but yet Light and fluffy too.&lt;br /&gt;Trick to this-Know your amount- everyones hair different. I put 3-4 pumps size of this lotion at end of my hairs on one side then do the same for other side. Just the ends and a little up. Do nut put this on your roots! It will weigh your hair down.Apply it at the end part of your hair the ones that dry and brittle. repeat daily or everyother day..first week you will have to apply a lot to revive your dead hair maybe but over time you will see beautiful ends with no split hair. Hair that is hydrated moist and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Then all u need apply couple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Best time is to apply on fresh after shower when your split ends hair cuticles all wet and open.&lt;br /&gt;Massage smoothly at the end of your locks and brush slightly with a wooden brush for even distrubution and let it AIR dry..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day(s) you will feel most smooth hair..&lt;br /&gt;Awesome smell-hawaian breeze coconuty too. :))</li>
            <li> Really  no idea why people like this so much. I don&#x27;t like the smell, and it leaves my hair frizzy and &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;. My hair is so dry by the night that I have to wet it down periodically before bed so that it isn&#x27;t driving me crazy. It starts catching static electricity like crazy. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing.  I have thick, wavy, high-and low-lighted hair--a recipe for snarls.  Before using this stuff, and having tried everything from Aveda to John Frieda, I could barely get a comb through it.  A few days of using this serum, and I can get a comb through no problem, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz in the humidity, and it&#x27;s shinier and healthier than it&#x27;s been in a long time.  The really impressive thing about it is that the benefits don&#x27;t seem to wash out--so many conditioning/detangling/frizz-free products seem to come out with shampooing and leave my hair in the same condition it was before, if not worse, but this actually does condition my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day.  And, as the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s got a wonderful, toasty, sweet, beachy smell.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Loke other reviews have mentioned, there are many advantages to this product. It smells great, works well and if affordable. The best thing I like about this is that it&#x27;s a great consistency without being overly heavy or too thick. I personally purchased this because I noticed some split ends and wanted a serum to use on my hair that gave it some shine/moisture when I&#x27;m wearing it blown out. This definitely does the trick. My hair feels smoother and revitalized and with this serum and overall better nightly care I can get my blow outs to last almost a month now. As for the anti - breakage claims, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference that comes at the hands of this product. Also use it on wet hair before protective styling and sets with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: very little goes a long way. I have fine/coarse combination natural hair and split my hair into two big sections and used one full pump in each section and then wrapped for the night. Although my hair felt shiny and silky the next day, it was a bit weighed down for my liking. Took a few days to wear off. The serum feels light so you mistakenly think you&#x27;ll need more than you actually do. Don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
            <li> I use this with an anti-frizz cream and glossy gel that turns my wavy hair into perfect curls!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this: I have medium thickness somewhat wavy hair thay used to be healthy, gorgeous, and shiny. Until I tried a straightening iron. I got hooked on how straight and smooth it made my hair, and never used a heat protectant. This kept up for about a year, until I went natural for a day and noticed my hair was dry, frizzy, tangled, broken off, split ends everywhere.... in a nutshell, I needed a miracle or could go ahead and buy the shaving cream and razor, as it was that bad. I searched for the one miracle product that would restore my hair back to its original state. I was desperate, and hopped from one ripoff product to the next. I found this at Ulta about a month ago, and went ahead and bought it. After my shower, when my hair was still wet, a put 2 pumps in my hair and avoided the roots. Fast forward a month and a good haircut later, and after putting this stuff in every night, my hair looks healthier and so much softer than it was before. After a month of putting this in my almost-mid-back-length hair, the bottle is maybe 1/8 (?) empty or less. A product well worth the money for anyone looking for healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I went through several different oils and cremes trying to find something to give my wispy, feathery hair some life without making it oily and this stuff is the first I found that actually helps.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this product.</li>
            <li> Have a really nice scent. Good</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Makes thin hair a little greasy so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using Silk Therapy by Biosilk to give my hair some shine and reduce tangles, but I wanted to move away from silicone. This was recommended to me, and I have to say, I am quite pleased. It does smell like coconut, but it is a natural smell, and it goes away once it&#x27;s set in your hair. I have thin, fine hair, so I don&#x27;t even use a whole pump. If I do, my hair looks really stringy and greasy, so a little goes a long way! It does add shine and reduce tangles, so it does what I wanted it to. You might just need to experiment to figure out how much you should be using for your hair.</li>
            <li> I get complements a lot when I use this oil. It&#x27;s a gentle scent, and while not overly manly, it attracts some attention and complements all the same. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for skin and hair alike.</li>
            <li> I like the odor so much.</li>
            <li> I really like using this serum, especially before I put other products in it. When I use it before scrunching it, it leaves my curls a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product is not as thick as some of the other hair serums, but it is thicker than Moroccan oil. Although I really like Moroccan oil it doesn&#x27;t have as much effect on my hair as this product.  Organiz Coconut Milk serum glides onto my hair when it is wet and provides some moisture.  (I still use a leave in conditioner because I have curly hair.)  I also use the Organix self warming oil in the shower.  These 2 products alone have made my hair much silkier.  The only downside to having silkier hair is your curl tends to droop.  This can be good or bad depending on how you wear your hair.  If you have allergies, like I do, this product should not bother you.  I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a smell.  Once the product is in my hair, I don&#x27;t notice any greasiness and I use about 3 good size squirts.      I would not recommend this for anyone with oily or thin hair, or if you want a lot of body.  As I said, it does cause the hair to droop.  If you are the type that likes to flat iron your hair, this would be a plus.  My hair type is curly but fine and tends to be dry, so this product works great for me.  If you have straight hair it would work well also, but I would avoid it if you have thin hair.    I will buy again.  I highly recommend the whole Organix Coconut Oil line.  The shampoo and conditioner are luxurious.</li>
            <li> i use all organix coconut milk products.. the shampoo, conditioner and then before blowdrying i run this through my hair. don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;ll make your roots greasy if you go overboard. but! this product does miracles for my hair. i have really dry and damaged hair normally but when after i use this product my hair is so shiny and soft, i really love it. you can even smell the coconut even after i hit my hair with the blowdryer and the hair iron. one of my must have hair products. would recommend to friends and buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing..instant shine... soft feel. Better then any serum or cream I have ever tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair every morning, right out of the shower, and let my hair air dry.  A little goes a long way.  It does not weigh it down, keeps the frizzies at bay, and smells wonderful!  I will always use it - I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, medium length, and split end and damage prone.  I am working on growing my hair out, so I wanted a product that would help postpone haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great like creamy coconut 😍&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft&lt;br /&gt;Helps with split ends&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;A very concentrated formula&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little greasy&lt;br /&gt;Heavy formula&lt;br /&gt;Scent fades after the hair dries&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include many silicones&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product.  If you have thin or flat hair make sure you use a small amount so that your hair does not get weighed down.</li>
            <li> leaves a pretty intense residue.  so much so that friends asked if i was using something new in my hair.  its great to use if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or spending time at the beach though because it doesn&#x27;t rinse out when you get your hair wet.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  A really good product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rate items but I think this product is a life saver and deserves a review. I&#x27;m not a girly girl and my poor hair has been breaking and the heat damage is probably irreversible.  I started reading up on what vitamins and products help your hair and I bought this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and it&#x27;s made a huge difference! My hair is so soft and my horrible frizzy split ends have turned into normal, pretty hair!! I highly suggest buying this product to get pretty hair!! Do it! Hurry!!!!!</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t waste your money here-go too Wal Mart, Target or RiteAid.  If you go on the Organix website they have a list of places to purchase</li>
            <li> As someone with very damaged hair from heat and styling, I am always on the lookout for hydrating and strengthening hair products. After seeing a rave review for this product, I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After smoothing this through my after-shower hair every other day for about a month, I see a big difference in how much breakage I have as well as the overall health of my hair. It helps with breakage and it also makes your hair shine dramatically. Plus, it smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for gals with dry or heat-damaged hair. ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my hair type! (Curly and out of control!)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great way to put some shine into your hair, it&#x27;s great to use right out of the shower, while your hair is damp smooth it over your hair mid length to ends, and brush out, and let air dry it will make your hair soft, and straight</li>
            <li> I love this... It makes my hair so soft and its very moisturizing for my dry hair..it smells great too thumbs up organix</li>
            <li> this is by far the best drugstore product i have found to put in my towel dried hair. it causes my hair to dry to a non-frizzy curly finish that am happy to leave the house/go to work with. forget argan oil. for 8 bucks this sure beats the price of that stuff and it works. plus, it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local wal-mart after reading the reviews on here. I am bi-racial ( black and white) and I have coarse curly hair. Usually when I straighten my hair it becomes smooth and silky, but lately it has been breaking badly at the crown of my head causing the hair to stick straight up and look dry and brittle. I put this in my damp hair as directed and since my hair is thick I didn&#x27;t get some parts of my hair as well and when it dried I could tell the difference. The parts I didn&#x27;t get as well were still dry and brittle compared to the rest which felt soft and elastic. When I straightened it, it laid down with no frizzies sticking up and looked and felt shiny and silky with movement. My father-in-law even asked if I was wearing a weave! That&#x27;s when I knew it made a difference. I&#x27;ve only used this the one time so I can&#x27;t say if it repaired my breakage but it sure has made my hair look and feel so much healthier already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before... it does the job.  Helps to detangle the hair. The scent is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my hair. It also gives it a vibrant shine. I learned the hard way a little goes along way! I have yet to come across an organix product I haven&#x27;t liked. I use this along with the coconut milk shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I began using this product because of the constant heat styling my hair was going through. I have fine, thin, colored hair (at the time when I was using this it was blonde) that would constantly break and I just looked like a slob. So, I began using this to try to rescue my hair and make it look and feel healthier. I started off using too much of it at once which left me feeling dirty, oily and greasy. Once I managed to figure out the amount of product which worked for me, I ended up really liking the product. I use about half a pump and rub it through the ends of my hair (last 3 or 4 inches which I feel are the most damaged). It leaves my hair soft, silky and moisturized! Not to mention, it smells WONDERFUL! I think this is a great store bought product that everybody should have if they are trying to get their hair back to being healthy, shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;2. Price- can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;3. Really works (in moderation!)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. May be a bit heavy for those of us with fine, thin hair but it&#x27;s all about the amount you use</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! I use the coconut milk shampoo so I bought this to along with it. I love that this line is sulfate free and seems to keep my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used products similar to this in the past that were much more expensive and came in smaller quantities. This serum keeps my hair in control, and helps restore my split ends. My hair is very thin and I also bleach it at home. My hair is often damaged after bleaching, but this serum protects and restores. It also has a nice, light coconut smell. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff. The smell is just amazing. It does what it says and it works within the first use. A little goes a long way with this oil. Use too much and you will have very shiny and greasy looking hair. You can use after a shower or right before you style. My hair did start to feel great and I noticed a difference very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its another OGX product that I plan to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a very curly hair and I love to use this mixed with a spiking gel for just the right hold. It&#x27;s a great price for the product.</li>
            <li> i usually like the OGX lines but i&#x27;ve been using this with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was breaking even more. It smells good i just wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works good!</li>
            <li> I use this to seal my hair, after moisturizing. It leaves my hair smelling sweet and lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over a year now.  It is used instead of conditioner.  After washing, I spray some in my palm and rub it through my hair.  It untangles and allows me to comb through easily.  Smell is fantastic.  Nothing gooey or gummy.  Just a great hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Product is ok but what I didn&#x27;t like the product got without the dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> If you relax and especially color your hair, this product is a must. I have tried Frizz-Ease and other anti-frizz smoothers that didn&#x27;t live up to the hype and this is the first one I really like. I use it right after shampooing and conditioning (the Organix coconut oil shampoo &amp; conditioner are great too!) then smooth it on my ends, hairline and throughout my hair. The silicone smoother is not too oily and leaves my hair moisturized before blow-drying or sometimes I just twist and dry naturally. People always want to know how I get my hair to look naturally wavy but manageable. My sister is now using it too!</li>
            <li> it does leave hair soft, can weigh it down if too much is used, pretty good against frizziness</li>
            <li> I have noticed less breakage after using this for a month and because I less hair coming out now, my drains aren&#x27;t clogging, the floor isn&#x27;t covered in hair pieces and my hair is becoming longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my mom. her hair was so dry and easily breakable because she dyes her hair very often. when she first applied this serum on her hair she was amazed, her hair become so soft and so shiny, she&#x27;s very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I have very delicate, fine hair that tends to snap easily. I always thought I would never be able to grow my hair long because the ends always looked so bad a month or so after a haircut. After using this product, I feel like I have a whole new head of hair. It&#x27;s stronger, shinier, and actually seems to be growing (likely because the ends aren&#x27;t breaking off as much). The hair I thought could never look good past my shoulders is now below my bra strap and looks healthier than ever! The only downside is that you have to be very careful how much you use - even a little too much and my hair looks like an oil slick. Start off with the tiniest amount and add if you need. With this product, less is more! It lasts forever too since you only need about a pump every day. I will definitely be repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> Best. Smells great, leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product after styling my hair and damaging it with heat this serum leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;naturally my hair is super right curls. I&#x27;ve relaxed my hair twice (5 year difference). bleached my hair more then 4 times, no more then 10. dyed my hair numerous times (mainly permenant dye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair RIGHT NOW? thick, frizzy, dry, damaged, no curl pattern either just thick wavy chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE MY HAIR SLEEK, SILKY, SHINY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair or just naturally silky hair, work your way up. don&#x27;t use too much, WARNING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no matter what hair texture you have, always start at ends / middle. any leftover you&#x27;ll wipe on roots/top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo (Awapuhi Shampoo - Organix) condition (Tresemme Anti Breakage) apply this. let my hair air dry. apply heat protec. (Keratin Smooth Flat Iron Spray) then straighten my hair &amp; it lasts SO LONG. I can go 5 days without washing (hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy quick lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-) I bought mine from the store lol.</li>
            <li> very good product. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works well on my long hair especially since it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with major breakage since I moved from a humid to a dry climate. When a hair stylist recommended this, I was skeptical due to the price and the fact that you can get it from the supermarket. Also, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be designed for ethnic hair....Boy was I wrong! I apply this stuff to my scalp every few days and it works its way into my hair. Slowly but surly, I am seeing an improvement and all of my edges are growing back too!</li>
            <li> Eh!  I did not realize it had cones in it which makes the hair appear to be moisturized but coating it instead.&lt;br /&gt;No thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. It makes my hair feel soft, manageable and takes ALL of the frizz and dryness away.  I would recommend this product to EVERYONE!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, does not weigh heavily on hair, a must to have in dry climate.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to coconut oil for my hair. I use it every few days. It makes my hair feel healthier and definitely shine more. This item has a better price than other coconut oils and it also works great!</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I thought for sure there was something wrong with my usual SHAMPOO - that had to be the reason my hair came out oily, so I bought a clarifying shampoo next day to wash out the residue.  As soon as I put the serum in, grease pit again.  But still in denial about this \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; serum I decided to replace my conditioner and round brush... and wash AGAIN with clarifying shampoo.  Put the serum in... again Crisco in the can.  After four days of smelling and looking like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair in a week, today I decided not to use it.  My hair is perfect.  So, if you like greasy hair (or feel you want to gamble getting it) then pick this product up.  Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.  Oh, my hair is shoulder length, straight not thin, but thick either.  My 15 year old curly dry haired daughter used it - same thing.  But she learned after one washing :-)</li>
            <li> This smells so delightful. It doesnt create much shine but it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This serum makes your hair feel amazing! I highly recommend for virgin hair ( Brazilian, Peruvian, etc..) when it starts to get dry and you get those little tangles. Couple drops of this stuff will have your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This item came broken, the top where the pump should be was off and could not be put on so I had to open the bottle and pour directly in my hand. I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well it works yet but I can say that this stuff is super greasy and thick. For now I&#x27;ll give it three stars until I can comment on how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is much more manageable and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love it! Keeps my natural hair moisturized without the buildup and excessive greasy feeling and with a good shine.</li>
            <li> I got this from target and I swear it&#x27;s magical. It&#x27;s sooo smooth, and sooo soft. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily even though I know it has oil in it. It feels great on my hair, and also on my hands. It&#x27;s nothing you need to rinse off either, you can rub the excess onto your hands. Also, one use uses the tiniest bit of product and I know it&#x27;ll go alon way especially considering I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day. I&#x27;m using this along with the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and even before my hair was completely dry it felt great c: five stars!!</li>
            <li> when I first got it I put a bunch in my hair for 8 hours... sorta like a deep conditioner .. my hair felt like silk the next day... amazing product</li>
            <li> This is a great product it gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down I love it and it really smells good. I plan to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel so soft! I can&#x27;t tell yet if it is helping with split ends.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Makes my hair feel smooth and shiny. I use it in conjunction with the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I coat my ends with it and it gives my hair a polished, silky look.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff smells so good! And you only need a little of it and your hair is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Was suffering from dry scalp and after my wife suggested I use this oil I ordered.  Boy Am I glad that I listed to her this time... This product has cured my scalp dryness and made my hair look healthy and my scalp is no longer flaking.</li>
            <li> I use this in a mixture with Argan and Tea Tree oil as a beard conditioner.  Nice pump bottle, locks off.  Very good quality.  Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> make hair very shiny but don&#x27;t be completely dependent on this product to moisturize your hair. I have 4c African american hair, I use a moisturizer then this product for lasting shine through out the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I&#x27;d like but still nice</li>
            <li> Too thick when applied and hard to get rid of even with cleanser shampoo.</li>
            <li> hope this helps repair my hair, worth the price and smells delicious! seller shipped very fast !</li>
            <li> Very heavy product, leaves hair oily if you use more than a dab or the size of a pea.  I have used better product for breakage that doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy look or feel.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair. It&#x27;s very oily. My hair gets really weighed down by using it. On the other hand, I can put plain coconut oil in my hair and it does perfectly fine. I have damaged hair and I thought this would be lovely but it&#x27;s not for me. My friend happens to love it though. But she has thick frizzy curly curly hair. So it being oily and heavy does wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice but not ideal for those having thin hair</li>
            <li> Smells yummy.Great shine and moderate frizz control. Shipped well, good price</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really greasy i dont like it at all</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly and a little goes a long way!  I have naturally curly hair so I use a little bit to help keep the ends hydrated and help tame any frizz.</li>
            <li> product feels soft and silky did i mention it smells very good ... the only issue i had was how the product was wrapped it actually came spilled and a third of the bottle was in the box I may send the leaking bottle back but i really love the product in itself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time please package product better... box had oily stains in it from the serum....</li>
            <li> I wanted to post my own review to mention something I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mentioning. It leaves my hands soooo soft. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the reviews about thinner hair--LESS IS MORE. I didn&#x27;t like it at first and was disappointed because it left my hair so greasy, I have very long hair (about 18 inches from the base of my neck) and I used a pump on the ends of my hair and a pump throughout. I lessened that to one pump in total focusing on the ends. Even less than that is better. Once I figured out the right amount, it leaves my hair feeling soft and lightweight. I love how I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, this product is going to last me forever! I haven&#x27;t noticed long term affects yet, I have been using it about a week but I&#x27;m looking at the other reviews and I&#x27;m very excited!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product! This stuff makes my hair so soft and silky. I love the smell. It&#x27;s wonderful for my dry curly hair. I love the bottle and how the product dispenses out. I tend to mix this with my shampoo and conditioner to add extra conditioning and I also mix it with my leave in. It really helps my dry hair stay moisturized. I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair. Its wonderful.</li>
            <li> The serum is SUPERANTISPYWARE light weight and nourishing. I use it daily on my ends and I never get that greasy or weighed down look. Smells fantastic and leaves your hair SO soft silky and shiney</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps to stop fly-aways after a wash. Makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.... my daughter loves it and gave it as a gift for my niece too.</li>
            <li> This cured my split ends problem! Made my hair look healthier and shinier too.</li>
            <li> I have terribly frizzy hair and this works great for smoothing it out.  One of the least expensive hair products that works for me.  I use it on both wet and dry hair.  Sometimes I put it on late in the day to soften my hair up and smooth it out just to freshen it up a bit.  It takes the frizziness out and keeps it soft and wavy without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I hope a lot of people grow to like this product because I cannot live without it, and I hope the manufacturer NEVER stops making it.  If you have fine hair, wavy hair, or hair that gets snarls in it, try this product!  I told my neighbor to try this -- she has 11 year old triplets (they all have long hair) and now they all use it and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard for to write a review of this product. I didn&#x27;t see much of difference to my hair after using it.  Perhaps my hair texture has something to do with it! Totally on the fence with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and this brand. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and smells good!</li>
            <li> I like it but it makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li> This product is fine when USED SPARINGLY.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  Even if you have super long hair like me, do not listen to your instinct and use two pumps.  Just one.  Too much of this stuff and it leaves the treated hair heavy, dull and greasy -- and I only ever treat the length, never anywhere near the scalp.  Just a little bit before blow drying seems to be fine.  Not sure I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky while moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Organix Macadamia leave-in oil.  Went to my regular grocery store last week and they had discontinued it (figures).  So I tried this coconut milk stuff.  It leaves my hair greasy, I don&#x27;t like it at all.  It smells very good though.  Now I need to find my Macadamia oil again.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SHINE.  I JUST STARTED USING IT SO I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT IS HELPING MY HAIR YET.  I RECEIVE IT IN MY MAIL BOX QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> This smells very pleasant. Makes my hair feel softer and less frizzy. I have very coarse, damaged hair that I have to staighten and even after flat ironing my hair doesn&#x27;t seem smooth. This has made my hair smoother. I use on towel dried hair and after drying and styling and as needed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - great for hair or skin</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!!! I would be a lost soul!!!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and shine. I leave it on my curly hair with leave-in conditioner and avoid the drying in my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fabulous!!! I have thin hair though, and I can tell you from personal experience to use a SMALL amount if your hair is like mine! A little goes a long way! It makes my hair super Shiney as well and as far as I can tell has helped with breakage. I use the OGX keratin shampoo and the collagen conditioner along with this. I am VERY happy with all of the products they make. I was literally combing my hair and loosing handfuls!  I was worried I was going to go bald! I started taking 10,000 Mcg of biotin along with using these and I have maybe 2 hairs come out now. 2!!! I can live with that! Also this company does not test on animals ;) another note: walmart sells their products for $5.49 (very good price for quality products)</li>
            <li> I wear braids, and after a while, my hair gets dry and tangled.  I use this product to help loosen tangles as I unbraid.  Seems to give enough slip so that I can finger through strands without snapping hairs.  It can get quite greasy, but since I have braids, not a big deal to me.  Overall, a good product that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this lightweight mosturizer does not weigh it down. The sheen last all day and the serum smells terrific.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much.  This is the only product that I have found (tried at least 20 others) that actually works in my wavy hair.  Finally no need to blow-dry every day - I can finally wash, put this product in, and go.  Other products are too heavy and weigh down my hair, and others are too light and do not prevent frizz - this one is just right!</li>
            <li> Great for my hair. I have very fine but curly hair.</li>
            <li> This serum did not fix my split and very dry ends, but it did prevent any further drying. I used it as suggested – a very tiny amount on damp hair. My strands became silkier and it disentangled them.&lt;br /&gt;I used to put simple, pure coconut oil into my hair but it would always make it so oily. I had no idea there would be coconut milk products, too. I like this one a lot and the bottle comes in the right shape – not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Much thicker and heavier than other serum-type products I&#x27;ve used.  You really need to use just the tiniest bit, or your hair will be greasy and weighed down.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as shiny as others I&#x27;ve tried, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;anti-breakage&amp;#34; benefits.  Not terrible, but overall I&#x27;m not impressed.  Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for something that would make my split ends less noticeable (I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out) and reduce breakage. The first time I used it, I was in a hurry and just worked some into the ends and let my hair air-dry as usual while I ran some errands. When I came home a couple hours later, I passed a mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair looked - it was much more wavy than usual (almost curly!), shiny, bouncy, and shiny with ZERO frizz, which was an unexpected result. My hair is an odd combination of half super straight and half kinky-curly, which creates an overall effect of slightly wavy with frizzy little hairs all over. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products over the years to try to control the frizziness, but the few I&#x27;ve found that do help also weigh down my hair, feel gunky, or make my hair look oily after just a day or two after washing (I only shampoo about twice a week). This stuff is amazing - it moisturizes and creates shine without feeling greasy, and my ends aren&#x27;t crunchy and frayed-out anymore. I&#x27;m officially retiring all of the other products I used before.</li>
            <li> I thought the serum was going  to be heavy but it really wasn&#x27;t. My hair is silky and smooth.  I love the whole line of ogx ♡ Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I put it on the ends of my hair to give it a super sleek look.  I have also put it in my hair to condition it overnight and washed it out in the morning and it makes my hair super soft.  I only use it on the ends of my hair as it makes my scalp look greasy.  I love the coconut smell.  I was traveling recently and forgot a moisturizer for my arms and legs and used this and I love it! I use it regularly on the ends of my hair and all over my body. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I wanted and it came quick and I live on the other side of the world.</li>
            <li> New favorite hair product! Reduces frizz and moistures nicely.</li>
            <li> I use it among a rotation of oils to care for my beard.  I like that there are ingredients to help the oil coat and penetrate the hair - but remains fairly lightweight.  People are always surprised by a soft beard.  This is one of the reasons mine stays soft.</li>
            <li> Alright guys I have THICK dry kinda waves frizzy hair I&#x27;m seeing alot of split ends and im hoping this will help with that. Well I just bought this serum today and I just applied it to my hair.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results but il let you guys knw my verdict. As of knw it&#x27;s a Neutral 3.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to other oils for my big, manly beard.  It keeps it moisturized and helps prevent beardruff.  I haven&#x27;t gotten through a winter yet using it, but I think it will do a good job keeping my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend just loves it! Great product. The best anti-breakage system, her hair looks more bright, smooth and helthy. Breakage decreased considerably and the product leaves the hair lighter and with a very good smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for my hair. I have used it for 10 years. I hope it is never discontinued. Buying it through Amazon means I have it for 40% less than anywhere else in Oz</li>
            <li> If your hair is already strong and healthy, this product is not for you. The product will sit in top of your hair shafts and leave it greasy and heavy. But if your hair is damaged, then the scales making up your hair will be open and able to absorb this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was badly damaged and crisp. I messed up with a home bleaching kit and stupidly did it twice in a row. One box, then another right after. My hair was so awful I almost cut what I&#x27;d spent four years growing out. I was desperate, and looked for any product at my local store with protein, which over-bleached hair needs. Bleaching breaks down the protein. Since our hair is naturally about 70% protein, ruining is is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks. The first few days I used 15 or so pumps and slathered it in my hair, then wrapped it in a bun and let my hair stay like that over night. I added more the next day. Yes, my hair felt icky. I was going to go heavy and was willing to spend a few days feeling greasy if it saves four years of hair growth. Then I washed and added more. Now my hair, while not yet perfect, is so much softer than it was, and my husband enjoys touching it. My hair is VERY shiny. At this point, my hair will absorb about 4 pumps, and I do this a couple times a day, even if my hair is dry. Rub it between your hands until warm, and have at it. Make sure to get the middle of your hair instead of making the mistake of going heavy on the top layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, if your hair is already okay, then you do not need this product and will probably not be happy.</li>
            <li> Ilive by this stuff. great for weaves and natural hair</li>
            <li> AWESOME! :) i have been trying to take good care of my hair because i used to dye it a lot as well as straighten and curl it and blow dry it like crazy and brushed it every 5 minutes. so, i now have damaged dry hair. ive been using new shampoos, like really expensive kinds some of the best out there, trying new conditioners, using hair damage repair masks, argan oils, i stopped using heat on my hair, and nothing seemed to work. but the first time i applied this to my hair after showering my hair looked and felt amazing! it wasn&#x27;t frizzy, or dry, just soft and shiny and smooth. i would recommend this to anyone.</li>
