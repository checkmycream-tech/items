    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, Nabi makes a really great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>So many great colors!!!</li>
            <li>I feel like they are a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>the lip liners are nice</li>
            <li>Nice to have all these colors.</li>
            <li>Some of the eyeliner colors are very light.</li>
            <li>Love wearing all of this</li>
            <li>I will order this again and again I also am thinking of gifting it out at the holidays :)</li>
            <li>The eyeliners need to be reapplied despite not even touching them.</li>
            <li>The lip liners I have used from this were actually more pigmented than the pencil set I had gotten (because some of the colors are duplicates).</li>
            <li>People love to buy these things.</li>
            <li>ALLTy :)</li>
            <li>Love the product but got 24 eye liners and 12 lip liners instead of 36 eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The best part is, they can double as full eye shadows</li>
            <li>but they rub off easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now getting that out of the way they do work pretty good for the price there not as good as an urban decay 24 eyeliner</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>VERY FAST W SHIPPING LOVE</li>
            <li>I was soooo excited when I opened the package</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>every single color was different and showed up GREAT!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to be worth it for someone who has huge lids like myself to do it very often</li>
            <li>The lip liners were much softer and easier to work with and lasted better on the lid better than the actual eyeliners themselves.</li>
            <li>While they are not super high end quality, they are still very good and soft.</li>
            <li>They last better even after eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>Basically what I&#x27;m saying is don&#x27;t expect to get exactly what&#x27;s described in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eyeliners didn&#x27;t work on my bottom lid (but that&#x27;s more because I line above my eyelashes rather than below); they do work on my eyelids</li>
            <li>I really like these liners!</li>
            <li>Thanks Nabi!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me so much...</li>
            <li>All glide on really well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably well made for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not that this will be true for every set they send out, but let me list the colors I actually received as eyeliners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White</li>
            <li>I Got More Than Half Of Lip Liners.</li>
            <li>of the colors are the same and most aren&#x27;t pigmented enough for the color to show up on skin.</li>
            <li>High pigment</li>
            <li>Value for money, highly recommended</li>
            <li>Ok I was nervous about ordering this after reading the reviews but what the hell I am addicted to make up and this would be a straight steal if works and it arrived realtively fast</li>
            <li>The darker color are soft to draw</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the glitter shades kind of hurt when going on the eyes.</li>
            <li>, I Spent My Money On Eye Liners, That&#x27;s Exactly What I Wanted.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok I was nervous about ordering this after reading the reviews but what the hell I am addicted to make up and this would be a straight steal if works and it arrived realtively fast I was soooo excited when I opened the package every single color was different and showed up GREAT! Love wearing all of this I will order this again and again I also am thinking of gifting it out at the holidays :)</li>
            <li> Some of the eyeliner colors are very light. I prefer the lip liners over the eyeliners. They last better even after eating and drinking. The eyeliners need to be reapplied despite not even touching them.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the thing: I got half eyeliners, half lipliners. Wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me so much...if I hadn&#x27;t already bought their bulk set of pencil lipliners. Basically what I&#x27;m saying is don&#x27;t expect to get exactly what&#x27;s described in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Nabi makes a really great product! The lip liners I have used from this were actually more pigmented than the pencil set I had gotten (because some of the colors are duplicates). The eyeliners didn&#x27;t work on my bottom lid (but that&#x27;s more because I line above my eyelashes rather than below); they do work on my eyelids well though. The best part is, they can double as full eye shadows (if you want to take the time to fill in your lid--the sticks are pretty thin so it&#x27;s not going to be worth it for someone who has huge lids like myself to do it very often but you could). Also, it&#x27;s about a 1.25&amp;#34; stick of color when you extend it all the way--if that helps anyone decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this will be true for every set they send out, but let me list the colors I actually received as eyeliners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White&lt;br /&gt;Silver&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Grey&lt;br /&gt;Lime&lt;br /&gt;Peacock&lt;br /&gt;Satin Blue&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Blue&lt;br /&gt;Navy Blue&lt;br /&gt;Purple&lt;br /&gt;Natural Glitter&lt;br /&gt;Auburn&lt;br /&gt;Khaki&lt;br /&gt;Gold&lt;br /&gt;Brown&lt;br /&gt;Dark Brown&lt;br /&gt;Black Brown&lt;br /&gt;Black&lt;br /&gt;Black Glitter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, they&#x27;re not really the outrageous colors I was hoping for (for modeling shoots). But again, it&#x27;s a solid product and I expect them to last awhile so I can&#x27;t be too upset.</li>
            <li> I really like these liners! When I ordered, I knew it was a mixture of eye and lip liners, which was just what I wanted. I feel like they are a good value for the price. While they are not super high end quality, they are still very good and soft. They don&#x27;t tug at all, and they stay put all day. My only complaint is that the glitter shades kind of hurt when going on the eyes. There are only a few though so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Good packaging. All came intact. All glide on really well. High pigment but they rub off easy.</li>
            <li> We bought this to re sell. People love to buy these things.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST W SHIPPING LOVE THEM ALLTy :)</li>
            <li> Excellent. The product came on time.</li>
            <li> Nothing too special.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the colors are the same and most aren&#x27;t pigmented enough for the color to show up on skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product but got 24 eye liners and 12 lip liners instead of 36 eyeliners.  I also ordered the 18pc lip liners and the 12 lipsticks.  I hope I don&#x27;t get doubles on the lip liners.  But they will get used.  Thanks Nabi!</li>
            <li> So it says eyeliners but like half of the &amp;#34;eyeliners &amp;#34; I received were actually lip liners:&lt;br /&gt;Light pink&lt;br /&gt;L. Pink glitter&lt;br /&gt;Mauve&lt;br /&gt;Hot cocoa&lt;br /&gt;peach&lt;br /&gt;soft pink&lt;br /&gt;Pink pearl&lt;br /&gt;pink glitter&lt;br /&gt;Shinning red&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;Rust&lt;br /&gt;Plush red&lt;br /&gt;purple glitter&lt;br /&gt;natural&lt;br /&gt;Hot red&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pink&lt;br /&gt;Cabaret&lt;br /&gt;They even say lip liner on them so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just mine but be warned there are lip liners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now getting that out of the way they do work pretty good for the price there not as good as an urban decay 24 eyeliner but they don&#x27;t suck.&lt;br /&gt;And the lip liners are nice</li>
            <li> I Hate It, I Spent My Money On Eye Liners, That&#x27;s Exactly What I Wanted. I Got More Than Half Of Lip Liners. I Don&#x27;t Use Lip Liners, So I Basically Spent My Money On This For Nothing.</li>
            <li> The reason for the three stars here is actually because of the lip liners that I got despite the fact I ordered eyeliners. The lip liners were much softer and easier to work with and lasted better on the lid better than the actual eyeliners themselves. The lip liners did well for their intended purpose as well which is why I would recommend  the lip liners to people looking to try the brand. I unfortunately can not do the same for the eyeliners as they weren&#x27;t as pigmented and were quite difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Value for money, highly recommended</li>
            <li> My daughter loves all of these retractable waterproof eyeliners she bought, she carries them with her no matter where she goes.</li>
            <li> Got them today on time as promised. I love them. So many great colors!!! Thanks again Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Nice to have all these colors. Reasonably well made for the price.</li>
            <li> The darker color are soft to draw and it&#x27;s stay put........I don&#x27;t like the lighter color they are hard to draw.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this product. But, sadly, they are super low quality. They simply don&#x27;t paint/color my skin at all. I have an olive skin color complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed. :-(</li>
