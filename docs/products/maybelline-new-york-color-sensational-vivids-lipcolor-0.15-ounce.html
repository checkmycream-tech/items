            <li>I love the color and got many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>There are so many choices for hyper pigmented cosmetics that this description is a bit dated by today&#x27;s standards.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I am glad I purchased this color.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t justify spending more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I had blend it with lip liner to get that extra pop I was looking for, but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li>it, it was more of a fuschia.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>The color is more purple in the tube but on the lips there is some reddish/pinkish tint to it.  </li>
            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>I just love the brazen berry.  </li>
            <li>The lip gloss does change the color a some but still love the color.  </li>
            <li>I love it with or without the gloss.  </li>
            <li>I know that I used the word love a lot in this review</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lipstick of all time.</li>
            <li>It is a bright purple which is fantastic for me since i love bold colors.</li>
            <li>Was more pinkish than purple and wasn&#x27;t really as expected color wise, but it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Love the taste, would not reccomend on light skin tones.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and just looks great overall.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, bright enough purple color.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect color for me because I don&#x27;t care for very dark shades for daytime</li>
            <li>and I found it in the New vivids color sensational -Brazen</li>
            <li>on smoothly</li>
            <li>This is a smooth and creamy lipstick but it isn&#x27;t a vivid or sensational color.</li>
            <li>Wasnt too sure about this color at first</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a bright violet,not a deep purple that glides on smoothly like all Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m very nervous about lip colors.</li>
            <li>Ideal for more mature aged woman.</li>
            <li>the color was bold but also had a touch of moisturizer</li>
            <li>Color was amazing even better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I try to wear this lipstick a few times a week just because it&#x27;s so beautiful</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, looks purple but not neon, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect,and worth the price</li>
            <li>Color As expected and smells good.</li>
            <li>If you want to be noticed with something that&#x27;s fun to wear then purple is for you.  </li>
            <li>Wow lovely color...</li>
            <li>This one is just right</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s Berry Couture is toned down a bit more, if that&#x27;s more what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>; nothing on it that actually said &amp;#34;Maybelline.&amp;#34;  If I thought more about it at the time, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it on given that it had no safety</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying a color</li>
            <li>long lasting and great price...</li>
            <li>I like vibrant, fun colors.</li>
            <li>I love this color but it starts to flake and make my lips look dry with cryola after 15 mintues.</li>
            <li>It should have a higher wax content, which high end lipsticks have.  </li>
            <li>(Arrived in 4 days in a HUGE box, was not expecting that, so beware, its a big box... )</li>
            <li>I am writing this again just because of how much i like the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual, which is why I like it.</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li>seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted a very purple lipstick for a costume.  </li>
            <li>Nice everyday color for work or shopping.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t reapply or mix it with Chapstick or other lipstick either because it just makes it even more crumbly on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick, at first it came on as a hot pink sheer but after putting more on it was a simular shade as pictured (a little lighter).</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a new color.</li>
            <li>and I must constantly lick my lips because this lipstick seems to wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li>only problem is, I&#x27;m not certain because I&#x27;ve never ordered lipstick I always buy it at the pharmacy, but this didn&#x27;t have any kind of wrapping or safety seal on it.</li>
            <li>I play around with alot of colors, and this by far is my fave!</li>
            <li>The color is not vivid as merchandised and it&#x27;s oily, so it falls off easily and you need to reapply it constantly.</li>
            <li>It goes nicely with berry blush (Bare Minerals Glee) and denim, black or white clothing.  </li>
            <li>I am Black with light skin.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this (BRAZEN BERRY) along with a clear lip liner to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>To make it shine, I also use a clear lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>It is very sheer and comes on in a much pinker looking shade than purple.  </li>
            <li>I am usually a natural color girl</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re not very brave to sport purple lips but would love to try, this color is for you.  </li>
            <li>It definitely wouldn&#x27;t work for more yellow undertones because it does have a bit of pink mixed in with the purple.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much brighter than I expected, but I guess I should&#x27;ve figured that from the name &amp;#34;Vivids&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The color is not as purple as seen in the image, is much lighter, it even seems pink.</li>
            <li>The deep yet vivacious purple coloring is fun and can be used with either casual or fancy wear, and is smooth and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>The Brazen Berry color is a vivid purple with a touch of pink that is quite unexpected.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick feels light and moisturizes my lips and is half the price of other brands.</li>
            <li>I am kind of afraid to use this product considering it came completely unsealed and unmarked.</li>

            <li> I am kind of afraid to use this product considering it came completely unsealed and unmarked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair, which is why I can get away with this very different shade.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I think this shade would also work well for medium, olive or darker skin with similar or pink undertones.  </li>
            <li> I may definitely try the other colors in this line..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with my lips being dry</li>
            <li> I wanted a purple lipstick, and not a dark one, which would be too goth (I&#x27;m well past that stage in life)</li>
            <li> But I decided to go a little different and chose brazen berry.</li>
            <li> They are either too pink or too lavender.</li>
            <li> First, the packaging about this was weird.  </li>
            <li> The Vivids were a limited edition issue and my local grocery store (always behind the times) still had it in stock.</li>
            <li> Just a little sketchy...</li>
            <li> and my lips feel so moist even in this cold New York weather.</li>
            <li> but I also looked washed out if I wear very pale shades.</li>
            <li> Being a Black woman, sometimes colors can either bleach out our skin or just look all wrong.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was damaged, not good at all it was all melted.</li>
            <li> and I usually go for reds, which can sometimes drain my complexion and make me look pale and sickly.</li>
            <li> (An insider secret.)</li>
            <li> Not happy!  </li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad product it just lacks intensity.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, however, I feel like I can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>

            <li> Beautiful, bold, and rich! Love this color. I ordered this (BRAZEN BERRY) along with a clear lip liner to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly and I can skip chapstick without feeling dryness later. Blotting takes away shine without removing color but I think it has a nice shine, without lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uploaded photos for you to see the color. It leans towards raspberry on me, with a nice punch of violet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that different colors can look different on everyone, I&#x27;ll mention that I am of SE Asian descent. Smile. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much brighter than I expected, but I guess I should&#x27;ve figured that from the name &amp;#34;Vivids&amp;#34;. My bad. Still a nice lipstick, just more of a going out type of color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect,and worth the price</li>
            <li> This plum color was perfect for my complexion. I am olive toned and my lips have a natural purple undertone so this was wonderful. I love the color and got many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Inlove with this lipstick. Color As expected and smells good. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> The lady loves it, got it for her for Christmas, purple Friday, GO RAVENS!</li>
            <li> I have written this review 3 times and it hasn&#x27;t saved for some reason. I am writing this again just because of how much i like the color. It is a bright purple which is fantastic for me since i love bold colors.</li>
            <li> If you want to be noticed with something that&#x27;s fun to wear then purple is for you.  Goes on smooth, looks purple but not neon, I really like it.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth and creamy lipstick but it isn&#x27;t a vivid or sensational color. There are so many choices for hyper pigmented cosmetics that this description is a bit dated by today&#x27;s standards. It isn&#x27;t a bad product it just lacks intensity.</li>
            <li> Color was amazing even better than I expected! I try to wear this lipstick a few times a week just because it&#x27;s so beautiful the color was bold but also had a touch of moisturizer so you didn&#x27;t have to mix two products to wear it. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Looks sexy as hell on the girlfriend! I like the bright colors on her! If a woman has a nice pair of lips, she deserves to show them off with these brighter colors!</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline color sensational lipsticks and have some ,but I wanted a bright violet shade and I found it in the New vivids color sensational -Brazen Berry - It&#x27;s a bright violet,not a deep purple that glides on smoothly like all Maybelline lipsticks.It looks very nice on me,I have a light to medium skin tone.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a new color.</li>
            <li> Bought this because i did not want to pay the price for MAC heroine. I love it</li>
            <li> Wasnt too sure about this color at first but I am glad I purchased this color. It is a nice, bright enough purple color.</li>
            <li> This color comes out beautiful on any skin tone.The lipstick feels light and moisturizes my lips and is half the price of other brands. Comparable to Mac&#x27;s Heroine only difference being the Mac brand is &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; and this one is creamy. Gorgeous purple!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m very nervous about lip colors. Being a Black woman, sometimes colors can either bleach out our skin or just look all wrong. My skin is medium brown and I usually go for reds, which can sometimes drain my complexion and make me look pale and sickly. But I decided to go a little different and chose brazen berry. OH MY GOD! This color is on point! It&#x27;s just a hint of pinky-purple, it goes so nicely with my skin tone. I wore it today and got tons of compliments on it and my lips feel so moist even in this cold New York weather. I LOVE it!!!! I&#x27;m thinking of getting a different color in my next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is, I&#x27;m not certain because I&#x27;ve never ordered lipstick I always buy it at the pharmacy, but this didn&#x27;t have any kind of wrapping or safety seal on it. I checked it out and it didn&#x27;t look tampered with so I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s just the way it comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way awesome color, I WILL be buying it again and recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this color but it starts to flake and make my lips look dry with cryola after 15 mintues. You can&#x27;t reapply or mix it with Chapstick or other lipstick either because it just makes it even more crumbly on your lips.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was damaged, not good at all it was all melted.</li>
            <li> I like vibrant, fun colors. This wasn&#x27;t it at all. Ideal for more mature aged woman. Nice everyday color for work or shopping.</li>
            <li> Love this color. A bit overpriced but nice!</li>
            <li> The Brazen Berry color is a vivid purple with a touch of pink that is quite unexpected.  It goes nicely with berry blush (Bare Minerals Glee) and denim, black or white clothing.  It&#x27;s unusual, which is why I like it. It&#x27;s a perfect summer color.  I just wish it lasted longer upon the lips. It should have a higher wax content, which high end lipsticks have.  However, I won&#x27;t wear this shade often so I can&#x27;t justify spending more.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with my lips being dry and I must constantly lick my lips because this lipstick seems to wear off quickly.  I wanted a purple lipstick, and not a dark one, which would be too goth (I&#x27;m well past that stage in life) but simply because I like to look different.  This shade definitely perks up the complexion. I use a Mood Matcher lipstick in purple underneath, which helps the color last longer. (An insider secret.) I&#x27;m light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair, which is why I can get away with this very different shade.  It&#x27;s bright, but not garish.  I think this shade would also work well for medium, olive or darker skin with similar or pink undertones.  It definitely wouldn&#x27;t work for more yellow undertones because it does have a bit of pink mixed in with the purple.  Revlon&#x27;s Berry Couture is toned down a bit more, if that&#x27;s more what you&#x27;re looking for. The Vivids were a limited edition issue and my local grocery store (always behind the times) still had it in stock. So I didn&#x27;t pay much for it. I&#x27;m giving this four stars, not five, even though I like it.  I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shade of lipstick. I absolutely love it. Goes on very smooth and just looks great overall. I had blend it with lip liner to get that extra pop I was looking for, but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with it. I feel it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, at first it came on as a hot pink sheer but after putting more on it was a simular shade as pictured (a little lighter). Love the taste, would not reccomend on light skin tones. (Arrived in 4 days in a HUGE box, was not expecting that, so beware, its a big box... )All in all, I&#x27;m in love! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am kind of afraid to use this product considering it came completely unsealed and unmarked. Just a little sketchy...</li>
            <li> Beautiful lipstick, bold color! Love it! And i didnt have to pay $16 for it!!</li>
            <li> First, the packaging about this was weird.  No plastic seal; nothing on it that actually said &amp;#34;Maybelline.&amp;#34;  If I thought more about it at the time, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it on given that it had no safety seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted a very purple lipstick for a costume.  It is very sheer and comes on in a much pinker looking shade than purple.  Disappointed, however, I feel like I can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li> I like the formula of the Vivids lipsticks. This is a perfect color for me because I don&#x27;t care for very dark shades for daytime but I also looked washed out if I wear very pale shades. This one is just right and I will reorder this shade.</li>
            <li> The color is not as purple as seen in the image, is much lighter, it even seems pink. The color is not vivid as merchandised and it&#x27;s oily, so it falls off easily and you need to reapply it constantly.</li>
            <li> This product looked like a purple but when I rec&#x27;d. it, it was more of a fuschia. I can&#x27;t find a truly purple lipstick anywhere. They are either too pink or too lavender.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it was not the color that was in the picture. I thought it was a deep glossy purple.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Was more pinkish than purple and wasn&#x27;t really as expected color wise, but it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> my name is lisa i loved it mwahh xoxoxo</li>
            <li> The color is more purple in the tube but on the lips there is some reddish/pinkish tint to it.  So if you&#x27;re not very brave to sport purple lips but would love to try, this color is for you.  I have olive skin and this is truly flattering on me. I would imagine anybody and any skin tone can pull this off.</li>
            <li> Wow lovely color...this is my first time trying a color this bright...I am usually a natural color girl but I wanted to try something different...I love this color...Great creamy coverage without the dryness...long lasting and great price...I may definitely try the other colors in this line..</li>
            <li> I just love the brazen berry.  I am Black with light skin.  To make it shine, I also use a clear lip gloss.  The lip gloss does change the color a some but still love the color.  I love it with or without the gloss.  I know that I used the word love a lot in this review but I LOVE IT!  I&#x27;m about to order a spare one just in case they run out. BTW, I ordered it on the May 18,2013 and received it on May 20, 2013.  Very quick shipment. It wasn&#x27;t wrapped in fancy packaging but who cares, I throw that stuff away anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update.  I went to purchase another one from this vendor and the price has increased to $13.44.  Not happy!  You can get if for $5.54 at Target!  I lowered my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars because of this.</li>
            <li> I am Brownskin and this shade looks very pretty with my complexion!!!!! I play around with alot of colors, and this by far is my fave! I will order another!</li>
            <li> Love it its great lipstick</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lipstick of all time. The deep yet vivacious purple coloring is fun and can be used with either casual or fancy wear, and is smooth and long-lasting. The color does appear lighter on the lips than the actual lipstick looks.</li>
