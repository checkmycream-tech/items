    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Baxter nailed it this is the best pomade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great!</li>
            <li>someone&#x27;s word for it who has search for the perfect hair product for 26 years.</li>
            <li>A very good product but</li>
            <li>It holds your hair great, but, to me, the smell was the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for that \\&quot;Just finished surfing, but your hair still looks sweet\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to believe the beautiful glass jar full of nutrients and licorice smell but nothing.</li>
            <li>I honestly can not recommend this product</li>
            <li>the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.</li>
            <li>With Sumo Tech you get a product that easily washes off, doesn&#x27;t smell and provides good hold with matte finish.  </li>
            <li>far I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This pomade is excellent, because you get great hold that you can adjust or manage, a firm yet flexable non \\&quot;hard\\&quot;, or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, look for your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shape and not too fat, and easily fits in my hand when cupped without worry of dropping</li>
            <li>Smell is real mild and you can sleep on it.</li>
            <li>So, already it is 25% more product.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a clay than it is anything else.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>Most cosmetics have many harmful chemicals that cause neurotoxicity, organ system toxicity, reproductive harm, and cancer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what product styles your hair better then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my hair up with various styles for 20 years and this is the best hair product around for my hair style.  </li>
            <li>Before my hair had sideswept bangs and one day I decided to part it with a more texturized elevated top.</li>
            <li>worry, it washes out with shampoo easily.</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s easy to mold, isn&#x27;t gooey or sticky and holds forever.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong hold and texturizing paste like qualities without looking like</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very happy.</li>
            <li>One is posted faked volume size (2.5oz) and another one is original size (2.0oz).</li>
            <li>That day I did all my research on the best products for thick long-ish hair.</li>
            <li>and I had not seen that beautiful dark brown color I once had</li>
            <li>Still a good product and the only one I use.</li>
            <li>And most importantly - no white flakes or residue that most products leave behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>You should have been in my head to understand the excitement I felt reading all the amazing reviews, a new hairdo; a new outlook on life!</li>
            <li>The nice thing about a 2.5oz container is it is 0.5oz larger than all of the products I was using.</li>
            <li>To prevent this make sure you put the clay in shortly after towel drying your hair, or simply lightly dampening your hands and then running it through your hair either before application, or after.</li>

            <li>saw this product recommended for my hair type online, and I&#x27;m glad to say it works better than any other type of pomade, clay, fiber, or gel</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;recommended for those who dont want the wet tacky finnish</li>
            <li>Clay is a very natural product that allows for a very nice matte finish with minimal crunch.</li>
            <li>It has a nice strong hold - a little more tacky feeling than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>(but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just the texture left on it,</li>
            <li>Make sure when rubbing in this product to use a lot of pressure and briskly rub it evenly and deeply into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure when rubbing in this product to use a lot of pressure and briskly rub it evenly and deeply into your hair.  </li>
            <li>You can use this product with wet hair for more of a spikey look or on dryer hair for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Most of the sites I came up swore by this product and American Crew Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>holds the hair nice all day and isnt shiny like a lot of other pomade products.</li>
            <li>Amazon been honest, I would highly recommend the product, but given the  gross misrepresentation and the cheap coverup, this is a total rip off!!</li>
            <li>While this product holds your hair well, it contains too much clay for my liking.</li>
            <li>much prefer [[ASIN:B0008IV7BU</li>
            <li>You really need to distribute it evenly around in your hands before putting it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well it did nothing but cause me stress because I really wanted it to work on me.</li>
            <li>I cant really complain.</li>
            <li>As a manly man, I don&#x27;t want anything in my hair that smells like flowers or fruit, and this pomade fits that criteria as it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to finally receive this when it came to me in the mail.</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish, short to medium long hair!</li>
            <li>far as the smell of this pomade, it seems pretty neutral to me.</li>
            <li>The main drawback is that the clay does tend to buildup on your hair/scalp after a couple of days so a super thorough shampoo ever 2-3 days is key.</li>
            <li>, this is very hard to wash out (and in this case, that&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to someone looking for those qualities.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and worth the extra cash by a longshot.</li>
            <li>Flexible, not hard or brittle</li>
            <li>This product does take a bit of shampoo to get out, but if you&#x27;re going to just slap it right back in your hair again</li>
            <li>This product does take a bit of shampoo to get out, but if you&#x27;re going to just slap it right back in your hair again</li>
            <li>It looked like I had a new weave in my hair and not to mention the fact of</li>
            <li>I live in a windy area and tend to sweat a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different clays and waxes before finding Baxter&#x27;s I wasn&#x27;t completely comfortable with the price, but once I began using it</li>
            <li>Damp with blowdryer, dry with fingers, dry with palms, using more of it and</li>
            <li>The old clay used to be a slightly different color and had a little more &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or clay.</li>
            <li>The pomade doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same anymore, and I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t recommend this clay enough -</li>
            <li>Before this product arrived in the mail I went to Wal-Mart to try out American Crew Fiber and was stunned when my hair stayed up, parted and texturized THE WHOLE DAY.</li>
            <li>and I really like it overall.</li>
            <li>hair type is 3 inches on the top, thick</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair, and most styling products make my hair limp or greasy, or leave it flat after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 yo  with thin hair (not balding, I just have fine, straight hair)</li>
            <li>clay not only keeps my hair up all day, it leaves my hair looking very natural.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, when it arrived it is only 2 ounces -- label clearly says 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>American Crew Fiber 3.0 oz.]] which performs nearly almost as well but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all clay-like.</li>
            <li>Maybe they still make the old formula under a different name?</li>
            <li>The new container is prettier, but an ounce smaller (same price).</li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place without leaving as hard of a residue as many other hair clays.  </li>
            <li>My hair more or less looked dull and flat</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However an Amazon sticker on the bottom of the jar tries to conceal the fact that the jar clearly states that it is only 2 ounces.......20% less than advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it last all day but it avoids the crunchy / flaky factor that other products give.  </li>
            <li> As it currently stands I will be purchasing this item again, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well holding matte finish with minimal crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I spent double my money having to replace this productI spent double my money having to replace this product</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use about a pea sized amount of this, rubbing it briskly between both hands, and then very roughly rubbing it deep into my hair.</li>
            <li> As it currently stands I will be purchasing this item again, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well holding matte finish with minimal crunchiness.just the texture left on it, and not that it is actually dried out).</li>
            <li> not coarse black</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, I used a very small amount on my short dry, clean hair every morning, and this small container last at least 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product could be overkill for fine hair unless you feel like doing something crazy but for my hair type I haven&#x27;t found anything better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned by a few bad reviews on this product, but excited by its rating of 0 for chemicals tested to cause cancer, and 2 overall at the Skin Deep Cosmetic</li>
            <li> They always left my hair flat, or dull, or sticky, or greasy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With extreme power comes extreme</li>
            <li> The container it comes in is very heavy and made of solid glass.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, and I found it helps the application if your hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall there is limited danger from this product - though I&#x27;d prefer less and would switch to less risk if I knew of one.</li>
            <li> use a substantial amount less of this Clay than I did other pomades, fibers, etc.</li>
            <li> not greasy, but it is hard to wash out the next day.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the price.</li>
            <li> I have thick red hair which is about 3\\&quot; tall.</li>
            <li> The finish is matte and it needs little to no restyling.</li>
            <li> This has very few of those elements compared to other cosmetic hair products.</li>
            <li> and not that it is actually dried out).</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair in terms of closeness of hair and density.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update January 2013: Unfortunately, this product has gone downhill since I initially started using it in 2009.</li>
            <li> not sure i would buy again.</li>

            <li> Baxter nailed it this is the best pomade I have ever used. Smell is real mild and you can sleep on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very happy. I was concerned by a few bad reviews on this product, but excited by its rating of 0 for chemicals tested to cause cancer, and 2 overall at the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviews stated they were shipped a 2oz container, although the item listing says 2.5oz. I can verify the item shipped to me was 2.5oz. The nice thing about a 2.5oz container is it is 0.5oz larger than all of the products I was using. So, already it is 25% more product. The container it comes in is very heavy and made of solid glass. It is a nice shape and not too fat, and easily fits in my hand when cupped without worry of dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a substantial amount less of this Clay than I did other pomades, fibers, etc. I have thick red hair which is about 3\\&quot; tall. I use about a pea sized amount of this, rubbing it briskly between both hands, and then very roughly rubbing it deep into my hair. This pea sized amount will easily last me all day. If my hair does start to fail at holding up I simply lightly dampen my hands, and run it through my hair for an instant re-hold. Like I will say later with the shampoo, this is very hard to wash out (and in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review complained the product was too \\&quot;clay like.\\&quot; I hate to break it to you, but if you buy this item thinking it&#x27;s not a clay you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. This product is more of a clay than it is anything else. Do not buy this product thinking it is a pomade. Clay, just like it sounds, is dirt. Now, don&#x27;t be turned away from that! Clay is a very natural product that allows for a very nice matte finish with minimal crunch. However, when running your hands through hair with any type of clay in it you&#x27;re going to feel almost a \\&quot;balloon\\&quot; like texture (it&#x27;s not sticky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review said the product was hard to wash out. They&#x27;re correct. When shampooing my hair it feels almost \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just the texture left on it, and not that it is actually dried out). This product does take a bit of shampoo to get out, but if you&#x27;re going to just slap it right back in your hair again what does it matter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review said the product left a glue-like texture you could visibly see. If this product is doing that, it is because you probably dried your hair too much before applying it. To prevent this make sure you put the clay in shortly after towel drying your hair, or simply lightly dampening your hands and then running it through your hair either before application, or after. It also may be doing this because you didn&#x27;t rub it in enough. Make sure when rubbing in this product to use a lot of pressure and briskly rub it evenly and deeply into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been very happy with this product. I will continue to use this product and change my review if my impressions of it change in the future. As it currently stands I will be purchasing this item again, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well holding matte finish with minimal crunchiness.just the texture left on it, and not that it is actually dried out).

            <li> While this product holds your hair well, it contains too much clay for my liking. I literally felt like I had clay in my hair all day and when I would run my hand through my hair during the day, it would come out with a bit of clay on it such that I felt the need to then wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer [[ASIN:B0008IV7BU American Crew Fiber 3.0 oz.]] which performs nearly almost as well but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all clay-like. It&#x27;s also cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as 2.5 ounces.  However, when it arrived it is only 2 ounces -- label clearly says 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 years and love it. It keeps my hair in place all day without feeling too crunchy or sticky. You really need to distribute it evenly around in your hands before putting it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2013: Unfortunately, this product has gone downhill since I initially started using it in 2009. About a year ago the manufacturer changed the packaging. The new container is prettier, but an ounce smaller (same price). Moreover, the recipe recently changed. The pomade doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same anymore, and I don&#x27;t like it as much. It&#x27;s pastier and feels \\&quot;cheaper.\\&quot; I&#x27;m afraid I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading the reviewed and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  The smell is horrible and I found it hard to get it off my hair after the day was over.  It holds your hair great, but, to me, the smell was the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech or, if you want to keep the shine, try Sumo Wax.  With Sumo Tech you get a product that easily washes off, doesn&#x27;t smell and provides good hold with matte finish.  Both are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It has a nice strong hold - a little more tacky feeling than American Crew Fiber. The finish is matte and it needs little to no restyling. The hold isn&#x27;t crunchy in any way either.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself functions very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes me choose this product over others though is the ingredients. Most cosmetics have many harmful chemicals that cause neurotoxicity, organ system toxicity, reproductive harm, and cancer. This has very few of those elements compared to other cosmetic hair products. See [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall there is limited danger from this product - though I&#x27;d prefer less and would switch to less risk if I knew of one.</li>
            <li> This pomade is excellent, because you get great hold that you can adjust or manage, a firm yet flexable non \\&quot;hard\\&quot;, or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, look for your hair.</li>
            <li> not greasy, but it is hard to wash out the next day.  also hard to get off your hands after application.  does hold my very heavy hair, though.  not sure i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 yo  with thin hair (not balding, I just have fine, straight hair) and I like to style my hair like Brooklyn hipsters (very short on sizes with hair combed back). For 20 years I&#x27;ve searched for product that could keep my hair up. Since I have straight, fine hair it&#x27;s very hard to get my hair to stay up and to look full. I&#x27;ve tried wax, gel, you name it. They always left my hair flat, or dull, or sticky, or greasy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clay not only keeps my hair up all day, it leaves my hair looking very natural. No greasy gel look. No waxy wax look. And most importantly - no white flakes or residue that most products leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t recommend this clay enough - I can&#x27;t imagine what product styles your hair better then this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take someone&#x27;s word for it who has search for the perfect hair product for 26 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my hair up with various styles for 20 years and this is the best hair product around for my hair style.  I have thick dark hair in terms of closeness of hair and density.  This product could be overkill for fine hair unless you feel like doing something crazy but for my hair type I haven&#x27;t found anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it last all day but it avoids the crunchy / flaky factor that other products give.  You can use this product with wet hair for more of a spikey look or on dryer hair for a more natural look.  Highly recommended and worth the extra cash by a longshot.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to finally receive this when it came to me in the mail. You should have been in my head to understand the excitement I felt reading all the amazing reviews, a new hairdo; a new outlook on life! Before my hair had sideswept bangs and one day I decided to part it with a more texturized elevated top. That day I did all my research on the best products for thick long-ish hair. Most of the sites I came up swore by this product and American Crew Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like licorice and looks like glue stick in my hair. I though it was maybe me or maybe it was something in the elements but no. Before this product arrived in the mail I went to Wal-Mart to try out American Crew Fiber and was stunned when my hair stayed up, parted and texturized THE WHOLE DAY. I was thinking whoah, I can only imagine what Baxters will do. Well it did nothing but cause me stress because I really wanted it to work on me. I wanted to believe the beautiful glass jar full of nutrients and licorice smell but nothing. My hair more or less looked dull and flat and I tried every combination to see what I could do. Damp with blowdryer, dry with fingers, dry with palms, using more of it and nothing it all looked the same. Not to mention it did not \\&quot;clump\\&quot; my hair into a texturized mold. Instead it look like a bunch of fly-aways hairs made up my scalp. I honestly can not recommend this product but MAYBE it will work for YOU. For the price and lack of reviews (yes 3 or 4 reviews sprinkled here and there should have warned me) I would go and just buy/try American Crew Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked dull for a while and I had not seen that beautiful dark brown color I once had and with two uses of American Crew Fiber it came back. It looked like I had a new weave in my hair and not to mention the fact of it&#x27;s strong hold and texturizing paste like qualities without looking like I had anything in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is 3 inches on the top, thick not coarse black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Note: I spent double my money having to replace this productI spent double my money having to replace this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this pomade for a couple of years and I really like it overall. The main drawback is that the clay does tend to buildup on your hair/scalp after a couple of days so a super thorough shampoo ever 2-3 days is key.</li>
            <li> A very good product but grossly misrepresented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider this to be one  of the pricier men&#x27;s grooming products.  It was advertised at 2.5 ounces.  However an Amazon sticker on the bottom of the jar tries to conceal the fact that the jar clearly states that it is only 2 ounces.......20% less than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had Amazon been honest, I would highly recommend the product, but given the  gross misrepresentation and the cheap coverup, this is a total rip off!!</li>
            <li> The old clay used to be a slightly different color and had a little more &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or clay. Still a good product and the only one I use. Maybe they still make the old formula under a different name?</li>
            <li> Works well, holds my hair with the matte finish I was looking for. Only negative is the price. Seems like a small amount but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I call this \\&quot;The Horse Glue\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve actually gone surfing for several hours, came out, and it&#x27;s still in my hair.  Great for that \\&quot;Just finished surfing, but your hair still looks sweet\\&quot; look.  When my friends want to borrow it, I tell them \\&quot;Use caution. With extreme power comes extreme responsibility\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry, it washes out with shampoo easily.</li>
            <li> Usage: Daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No shine, matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;- Drys quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Flexible, not hard or brittle&lt;br /&gt;- No odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have people asking what I use in my hair, both guys and girls. I&#x27;ve used several different clays and waxes before finding Baxter&#x27;s I wasn&#x27;t completely comfortable with the price, but once I began using it I learned it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it seemed, a little goes a long way, I used a very small amount on my short dry, clean hair every morning, and this small container last at least 6-8 weeks. I cant really complain.</li>
            <li> Nice matte finish, short to medium long hair! Very pleased with the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;recommended for those who dont want the wet tacky finnish</li>
            <li> holds the hair nice all day and isnt shiny like a lot of other pomade products. I highly recommend this to someone looking for those qualities.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair, and most styling products make my hair limp or greasy, or leave it flat after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product recommended for my hair type online, and I&#x27;m glad to say it works better than any other type of pomade, clay, fiber, or gel I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, and I found it helps the application if your hair is slightly damp. It&#x27;s called a pomade, but it&#x27;s not shiny or greasy at all, which to me is a plus. If you are a Dapper Dan man and want a slicked back look, then move along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell of this pomade, it seems pretty neutral to me. As a manly man, I don&#x27;t want anything in my hair that smells like flowers or fruit, and this pomade fits that criteria as it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.</li>
            <li> Totally different size. I ordered two items, but all of them are 2 oz. One is posted faked volume size (2.5oz) and another one is original size (2.0oz). It is con.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick. When they describe it as clay, it&#x27;s no joke. Some mornings I wash my hair twice. BUT it&#x27;s easy to mold, isn&#x27;t gooey or sticky and holds forever. I live in a windy area and tend to sweat a lot and this stuff keeps up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It holds my hair in place without leaving as hard of a residue as many other hair clays.  highly recommended</li>
