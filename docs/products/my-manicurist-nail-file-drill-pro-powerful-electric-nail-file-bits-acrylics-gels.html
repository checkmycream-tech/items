            <li>I was able to successfully manicure my nails.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it!</li>
            <li>but yet it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>that I started doing my own at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use it on my children&#x27;s toenails, which they find highly amusing.</li>
            <li>For use by myself on my own nails and my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I purchased this in hopes of doing my own acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my own nails, and my dogs nails.</li>
            <li>For the price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I do my own acrylic overlays and</li>
            <li>I needed a nail drill because i do my own nails.  </li>
            <li>ITS NICE</li>
            <li>I just started doing my own acrylics</li>
            <li>I wanted to save some money and do my own acrylic nails..</li>
            <li>Now I can do all my own manicure/pedicures and</li>
            <li>The book that comes with kit is very easy to understand how to use the appliance  </li>
            <li>With all the attachments and grinders it makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for my dogs, because I liked Pedipaws</li>
            <li>A lot better than the ones you buy at the drug store, more power and better built!</li>
            <li>great very speedy delivery very happy with produce just what I needed many thanks</li>
            <li>Great for the money and the seller shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>so I am going to order another which is no big deal since the price is awesome.</li>
            <li>That is ok for now and for the purpose I am using it, but I am still looking for another with variable speed.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>plus you get all top quality files &amp; bits.if this thing works on my feet - it will work for anybody.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what your doing, it&#x27;s a lil more guess work.  </li>
            <li>The product is ok IF you get one that works.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were 4 or 5 stars</li>
            <li>I am giving this 3 stars because it does work; but the packaging could be much better.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great because they offer so many choices, and provide reviews to make your choices so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Thought I would be able to figure it out</li>
            <li>Love it love it.</li>

            <li>I GOT MORE BITS</li>
            <li>So overall I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and at a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>Already made sure it works by plugging it in.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>OK product for my purposes</li>
            <li>and the cord is better too</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I purchased My Manicurist Maxim kit from Amazon and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I love mine and use it to prep and prepare my gel  nails myself thereby saving quite a bit of money</li>
            <li>Top quality</li>
            <li>Love this nail grinder.</li>
            <li>I love the Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill Grinder Pro.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for personal use at home for those of us that have to fix our nails after getting them done!</li>
            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>works great no problem works like a charm hassle free came right on time</li>
            <li>Very powerful and does the job needed nicely.  </li>
            <li>but this drill is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says it is and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled it worked great!,,,,,,,,,, for a few uses.</li>
            <li>It comes with many attachments and easy to use.</li>
            <li>as good or better than the others that cost 3x as much -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the easy speed adjuster wheel.</li>
            <li>I had spent months reading reviews, searching on Amazon trying to find the best nail drill.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>You really do get what it says you are getting at a good price.</li>
            <li>Adjustable speeds and an easy to hold and control tool makes nail work a cinch.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The drill bits are easy to change out</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to maintain my nails.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I put on the grinding (sandpaper) attachment (easy) and she lets me do them with no problem ,</li>
            <li>Easy purchase thank you</li>
            <li>and he isn&#x27;t that easy to please</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to change grinder tips and</li>
            <li>Easy to handle for the price</li>
            <li>So far so good, definitely better than a manual nail file for toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Although I think this a good product , it is obviously packaged for a trained manicurist, not someone like me trying to learn how to do their own gels.  </li>
            <li>the speed control is pretty handy.</li>
            <li>The My Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill is easy to use and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable!!</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have much use for it for my feet but let me tell you this thing works great on my watches</li>
            <li>When I took it out of the package, my husband commented on how cheap the product looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light too</li>
            <li>And it was free</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.....</li>
            <li>I like that it is light weight with variable speeds not to mention the generous supply of sanders.</li>
            <li>but it is so much more powerful.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the nail kit I noticed that the drill seemed a bit flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>but now I feel so comfortable using it</li>
            <li>This tool is powered via an electric cord which I believe is important for power.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>This lil machine is super strong and powerful, def able to handle any mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>very powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone who does their own nails at home. :)</li>
            <li>and it did it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Also great for single applications for individuals.</li>
            <li>My feet are now super soft:) I just love the results</li>
            <li>Over all the quality of the product is not fancy but it does the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price, also i received this really fast :)</li>
            <li>I used it that morning to do a full acrylic set on myself.</li>
            <li>diffeernt speeds , light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it worked really well on nail as well:)</li>
            <li>But I bought it because I read the other reviews and saw that it seemed great because I didn&#x27;t need a nail tequnichian quality.</li>
            <li>i had serious doubts when i ordered this product, but I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Worthy of trust.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was really quick.  </li>
            <li>It arrived yesterday and I quickly tried it....</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li>speed, very easy to grind all the way through the nail to the nail bed if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing (I&#x27;m moderately experienced, but I found this out the HARD way)!  </li>
            <li>It cuts down the time it takes her to do my nails greatly.</li>
            <li>I love my new nail drill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this so far!</li>
            <li>is so much easier on my hands!!</li>
            <li>Love this product so far!</li>
            <li>Love it, my pedicure looks professional!</li>
            <li>The drill has low to fast settings which is a really good feature for me because I sometimes don&#x27;t need it to spin quickly around the cuticle</li>
            <li>In fact, it worked a little too great.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job on my toe nails and removing dead skin from my heels.</li>
            <li>Love the way it works so far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth every penny, just wish it had a instructional disk or manual.</li>
            <li>Not only working on the nails which looks good yet needs several more treatments.  </li>
            <li>Gronder Pro Powerful Electric Nail File.  </li>
            <li>, this one has great reviews and the price is very decent comparing to other drills I have looked into.  </li>
            <li>and small, easy to hold, good power.</li>
            <li>The power is great -- much better than other such tools that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was so excited I had gotten it so fast</li>
            <li>He was right.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I put it together to use right away, but the motor burned out and I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once.  </li>
            <li>I returned it right away for a refund.</li>
            <li>you know what you are doing and need a portable drill that will fit in a small space for travel, this is a good investment.  </li>
            <li>I love the different speeds you can adjust to and its very lightweight and easy to control.</li>
            <li>It works great-can quickly remove thick cuticles and also does a great job of removing callused skin on the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li>I only gave three stars because I continue to use the good old emery board!</li>
            <li>Amazon was kind enough to give me credit due to their own warranty.</li>
            <li>The groomers have larger grinders and she wasn&#x27;t happy with that BIG THING coming at her.  </li>
            <li>It was very reasonable priced</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>but I do feel when it starts to get hot</li>
            <li>the operator, not so much!</li>
            <li>Overall I am in love with my purchase and will be buying another for a friend who is going to nail tech school.</li>
            <li>but i finally figured out how to use it and am pleased withe the results.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li>It worked great on my thick toenails.  </li>
            <li>i have to pay more money to send back to company</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>I just got done with my first grinding and my feet are SCREAMING with relief.  </li>
            <li>it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered had a faulty switch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It has all the proper attachments, a good long cord, and the right amount of power.  </li>
            <li>Well my first pruchase didn&#x27;t go very well since it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle even with your less dominant hand.</li>
            <li>so this helps me buff it down nice and evenly.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and has several drill bits.</li>
            <li>This set is easy to use and works with all types of manicures from basic, to gels, to pedicures.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, keeps my nails neat and shapely and would recommend this product to anyone who would like to achieve the same result.</li>
            <li>OVERALL, THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT FOR THE FIRST FEW TIMES</li>
            <li>Maybe a wire is loose - I can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
            <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should buy this or not from the other reviews</li>
            <li>its worth the money and far better than the pink one please dont buy the pink one stick to this one its better</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the seller &amp; product!</li>
            <li>This works better then expected.</li>
            <li>My speed control quit working very soon.</li>
            <li>I expected to have to pay much more for an electric file of this quality.  </li>
            <li>PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m much more careful now.</li>
            <li>This shipper amazed me with how fast they processed and shipped the order.</li>
            <li>It broke as soon as I got it, but when reported it, a replacement was sent fast.</li>
            <li>It really performs and has the power that I needed to shape and form my gel nails.</li>
            <li>PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for my father in law and he absolutely loves it..</li>
            <li>The company sent another part which was better but not what I expected.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I received this drill</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t really have any points of comparison.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it was reasonably priced and would do the job.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer this to the battery operated dremel mini mite I used before.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister, who is a nail tech, and she can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it.</li>
            <li>It is much faster and efficient than manually filing them.  </li>
            <li>This item has really worked out.  </li>
            <li>and this worked very well.  </li>
            <li>first time to shop on line and most likely my last !!</li>
            <li>I used this product daily on my hard soles and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>i needed something with power to clean under my fingernails and remove the last bit of nail polish/clean around my toenail bed -and had the pointed ceramic attachments that i find easier to use than metal.</li>
            <li>, I like the small size and light weight since it is electric and has a nice long cord also.  </li>
            <li>The drill itself is pretty lightweight comparing to my old kit</li>
            <li>I was super lucky that I didn&#x27;t scar the nail bed and only had to wait about 8-10 weeks for the nail to grow back out to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this mainly for toenails, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>the speeds are way too high, even at the lowest speed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this product and have two things to say about it, one is that it really works better than a professional manicure and second it does not come with instructions</li>
            <li>It took forever to file them down myself, but the nail drill grinder did a great job in less time.  </li>
            <li>I love this little tool.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much power, and the first time I used it one of the tiny pieces popped off and I never could find it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to get me through a few more weeks before having to get my nails touched up.&lt;br /&gt;Works just like the one in a salon.</li>
            <li>new drill</li>
            <li>are too smooth to do a thorugh job of removing the RENEWED NAIL product and grinding down the new nail growth.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver even with my non-dominant hand, unlike my old rechargeable Dremel (the battery weighed it down).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to smooth and grind down acrylic nails</li>
            <li>This is a hidden gem, I thought it would be cheap</li>
            <li>It was a little light weight.</li>
            <li>If you press to hard against the toenails it tends to stop spinning -- which is what you want, better than goring the living bejesus out of your nails.</li>
            <li>Once it warms up I have only one speed - high!</li>
            <li>Professional results.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>However, it stated on the package that it was professional quality</li>
            <li>As a result of this nail tool, I have moved my nail look up to a professional level.</li>
            <li>I am old and can&#x27;t get to my toe&#x27;s anymore without help.</li>
            <li>I did speak to a customer service person there that was more than rude.</li>
            <li>It actually goes at a much faster speed</li>
            <li>If you have ever had your nails professionally prepared for gel or acrilic nails</li>
            <li>I may try it on my child&#x27;s toes (7 yrs old).  </li>
            <li>Wow, I recommend this device and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I now use the tool to manicure my natural fingernails and toenails.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would be very easy to use,but being hemipledic, (using one hand), makes it very very hard to change the attachments.</li>
            <li>The attachments are the replaceable heavy grit rounds, along with 2 metal fine-grit attachments, 2 pink super fine attachments and a white polishing/buffing</li>
            <li>This kit is exactly what the professionals use but at such a moderate price.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done much with it yet, and I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so many of the bits are not things I would use.  </li>
            <li>just right, it tends to be too slow or too fast.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy a pink drill</li>
            <li>I thought it would be larger in size and work like a professional drill.</li>
            <li>but they are too thin and getting them done at the salon sometimes ends up damaging them more.</li>
            <li>Not sure how long it will last as the plastic is cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful too, I usually keep it at the lowest setting</li>
            <li>I actually used it for something completely different, I have a tortoise with a long beak and used it to file it down;)</li>
            <li>I read the reviews considered all good and bad.</li>

            <li> I was able to successfully manicure my nails.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it!</li>
            <li> but yet it works amazing.  </li>
            <li> that I started doing my own at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it on my children&#x27;s toenails, which they find highly amusing.</li>
            <li> For use by myself on my own nails and my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of doing my own acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my own nails, and my dogs nails.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylic overlays and</li>
            <li> I needed a nail drill because i do my own nails.  </li>
            <li> ITS NICE</li>
            <li> I just started doing my own acrylics</li>
            <li> I wanted to save some money and do my own acrylic nails..</li>
            <li> Now I can do all my own manicure/pedicures and</li>
            <li> The book that comes with kit is very easy to understand how to use the appliance  </li>
            <li> With all the attachments and grinders it makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li> I mostly bought it for my dogs, because I liked Pedipaws</li>
            <li> A lot better than the ones you buy at the drug store, more power and better built!</li>
            <li> great very speedy delivery very happy with produce just what I needed many thanks</li>
            <li> Great for the money and the seller shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> so I am going to order another which is no big deal since the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> That is ok for now and for the purpose I am using it, but I am still looking for another with variable speed.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> plus you get all top quality files &amp; bits.if this thing works on my feet - it will work for anybody.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what your doing, it&#x27;s a lil more guess work.  </li>
            <li> The product is ok IF you get one that works.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were 4 or 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am giving this 3 stars because it does work; but the packaging could be much better.</li>
            <li> Amazon is great because they offer so many choices, and provide reviews to make your choices so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would be able to figure it out</li>
            <li> Love it love it.</li>
            <li> We both just love the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DRILL...</li>
            <li> I GOT MORE BITS</li>
            <li> So overall I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and at a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Already made sure it works by plugging it in.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and it did ok job, but</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this grinder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> OK product for my purposes</li>
            <li> and the cord is better too</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I purchased My Manicurist Maxim kit from Amazon and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I love mine and use it to prep and prepare my gel  nails myself thereby saving quite a bit of money</li>
            <li> Top quality</li>
            <li> Love this nail grinder.</li>
            <li> I love the Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill Grinder Pro.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for personal use at home for those of us that have to fix our nails after getting them done!</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  </li>
            <li> works great no problem works like a charm hassle free came right on time</li>
            <li> Very powerful and does the job needed nicely.  </li>
            <li> but this drill is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled it worked great!,,,,,,,,,, for a few uses.</li>
            <li> It comes with many attachments and easy to use.</li>
            <li> as good or better than the others that cost 3x as much -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the easy speed adjuster wheel.</li>
            <li> I had spent months reading reviews, searching on Amazon trying to find the best nail drill.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> You really do get what it says you are getting at a good price.</li>
            <li> Adjustable speeds and an easy to hold and control tool makes nail work a cinch.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The drill bits are easy to change out</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to maintain my nails.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I put on the grinding (sandpaper) attachment (easy) and she lets me do them with no problem ,</li>
            <li> Easy purchase thank you</li>
            <li> and he isn&#x27;t that easy to please</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to change grinder tips and</li>
            <li> Easy to handle for the price</li>
            <li> So far so good, definitely better than a manual nail file for toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Although I think this a good product , it is obviously packaged for a trained manicurist, not someone like me trying to learn how to do their own gels.  </li>
            <li> the speed control is pretty handy.</li>
            <li> The My Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill is easy to use and very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable!!</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have much use for it for my feet but let me tell you this thing works great on my watches</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the package, my husband commented on how cheap the product looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light too</li>
            <li> And it was free</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.....</li>
            <li> I like that it is light weight with variable speeds not to mention the generous supply of sanders.</li>
            <li> but it is so much more powerful.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the nail kit I noticed that the drill seemed a bit flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> but now I feel so comfortable using it</li>
            <li> This tool is powered via an electric cord which I believe is important for power.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> This lil machine is super strong and powerful, def able to handle any mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> very powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone who does their own nails at home. :)</li>
            <li> and it did it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Also great for single applications for individuals.</li>
            <li> My feet are now super soft:) I just love the results</li>
            <li> Over all the quality of the product is not fancy but it does the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price, also i received this really fast :)</li>
            <li> I used it that morning to do a full acrylic set on myself.</li>
            <li> diffeernt speeds , light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it worked really well on nail as well:)</li>
            <li> But I bought it because I read the other reviews and saw that it seemed great because I didn&#x27;t need a nail tequnichian quality.</li>
            <li> i had serious doubts when i ordered this product, but I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Worthy of trust.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was really quick.  </li>
            <li> It arrived yesterday and I quickly tried it....</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li> speed, very easy to grind all the way through the nail to the nail bed if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing (I&#x27;m moderately experienced, but I found this out the HARD way)!  </li>
            <li> It cuts down the time it takes her to do my nails greatly.</li>
            <li> I love my new nail drill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this so far!</li>
            <li> is so much easier on my hands!!</li>
            <li> Love this product so far!</li>
            <li> Love it, my pedicure looks professional!</li>
            <li> The drill has low to fast settings which is a really good feature for me because I sometimes don&#x27;t need it to spin quickly around the cuticle</li>
            <li> In fact, it worked a little too great.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job on my toe nails and removing dead skin from my heels.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works so far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth every penny, just wish it had a instructional disk or manual.</li>
            <li> Not only working on the nails which looks good yet needs several more treatments.  </li>
            <li> Gronder Pro Powerful Electric Nail File.  </li>
            <li> , this one has great reviews and the price is very decent comparing to other drills I have looked into.  </li>
            <li> and small, easy to hold, good power.</li>
            <li> The power is great -- much better than other such tools that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was so excited I had gotten it so fast</li>
            <li> He was right.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I put it together to use right away, but the motor burned out and I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once.  </li>
            <li> I returned it right away for a refund.</li>
            <li> you know what you are doing and need a portable drill that will fit in a small space for travel, this is a good investment.  </li>
            <li> I love the different speeds you can adjust to and its very lightweight and easy to control.</li>
            <li> It works great-can quickly remove thick cuticles and also does a great job of removing callused skin on the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I only gave three stars because I continue to use the good old emery board!</li>
            <li> Amazon was kind enough to give me credit due to their own warranty.</li>
            <li> The groomers have larger grinders and she wasn&#x27;t happy with that BIG THING coming at her.  </li>
            <li> It was very reasonable priced</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> but I do feel when it starts to get hot</li>
            <li> the operator, not so much!</li>
            <li> Overall I am in love with my purchase and will be buying another for a friend who is going to nail tech school.</li>
            <li> but i finally figured out how to use it and am pleased withe the results.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li> It worked great on my thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> i have to pay more money to send back to company</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> I just got done with my first grinding and my feet are SCREAMING with relief.  </li>
            <li> it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered had a faulty switch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> It has all the proper attachments, a good long cord, and the right amount of power.  </li>
            <li> Well my first pruchase didn&#x27;t go very well since it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle even with your less dominant hand.</li>
            <li> so this helps me buff it down nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and has several drill bits.</li>
            <li> This set is easy to use and works with all types of manicures from basic, to gels, to pedicures.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, keeps my nails neat and shapely and would recommend this product to anyone who would like to achieve the same result.</li>
            <li> OVERALL, THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT FOR THE FIRST FEW TIMES</li>
            <li> Maybe a wire is loose - I can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should buy this or not from the other reviews</li>
            <li> its worth the money and far better than the pink one please dont buy the pink one stick to this one its better</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the seller &amp; product!</li>
            <li> This works better then expected.</li>
            <li> My speed control quit working very soon.</li>
            <li> I expected to have to pay much more for an electric file of this quality.  </li>
            <li> PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m much more careful now.</li>
            <li> This shipper amazed me with how fast they processed and shipped the order.</li>
            <li> It broke as soon as I got it, but when reported it, a replacement was sent fast.</li>
            <li> It really performs and has the power that I needed to shape and form my gel nails.</li>
            <li> PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my father in law and he absolutely loves it..</li>
            <li> The company sent another part which was better but not what I expected.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I received this drill</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t really have any points of comparison.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was reasonably priced and would do the job.  </li>
            <li> Much prefer this to the battery operated dremel mini mite I used before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, who is a nail tech, and she can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and efficient than manually filing them.  </li>
            <li> This item has really worked out.  </li>
            <li> and this worked very well.  </li>
            <li> first time to shop on line and most likely my last !!</li>
            <li> I used this product daily on my hard soles and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> i needed something with power to clean under my fingernails and remove the last bit of nail polish/clean around my toenail bed -and had the pointed ceramic attachments that i find easier to use than metal.</li>
            <li> , I like the small size and light weight since it is electric and has a nice long cord also.  </li>
            <li> The drill itself is pretty lightweight comparing to my old kit</li>
            <li> I was super lucky that I didn&#x27;t scar the nail bed and only had to wait about 8-10 weeks for the nail to grow back out to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this mainly for toenails, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> the speeds are way too high, even at the lowest speed.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and have two things to say about it, one is that it really works better than a professional manicure and second it does not come with instructions</li>
            <li> It took forever to file them down myself, but the nail drill grinder did a great job in less time.  </li>
            <li> I love this little tool.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power, and the first time I used it one of the tiny pieces popped off and I never could find it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to get me through a few more weeks before having to get my nails touched up.&lt;br /&gt;Works just like the one in a salon.</li>
            <li> new drill</li>
            <li> are too smooth to do a thorugh job of removing the RENEWED NAIL product and grinding down the new nail growth.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver even with my non-dominant hand, unlike my old rechargeable Dremel (the battery weighed it down).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to smooth and grind down acrylic nails</li>
            <li> This is a hidden gem, I thought it would be cheap</li>
            <li> It was a little light weight.</li>
            <li> If you press to hard against the toenails it tends to stop spinning -- which is what you want, better than goring the living bejesus out of your nails.</li>
            <li> Once it warms up I have only one speed - high!</li>
            <li> Professional results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> However, it stated on the package that it was professional quality</li>
            <li> As a result of this nail tool, I have moved my nail look up to a professional level.</li>
            <li> I am old and can&#x27;t get to my toe&#x27;s anymore without help.</li>
            <li> I did speak to a customer service person there that was more than rude.</li>
            <li> It actually goes at a much faster speed</li>
            <li> If you have ever had your nails professionally prepared for gel or acrilic nails</li>
            <li> I may try it on my child&#x27;s toes (7 yrs old).  </li>
            <li> Wow, I recommend this device and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I now use the tool to manicure my natural fingernails and toenails.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would be very easy to use,but being hemipledic, (using one hand), makes it very very hard to change the attachments.</li>
            <li> The attachments are the replaceable heavy grit rounds, along with 2 metal fine-grit attachments, 2 pink super fine attachments and a white polishing/buffing</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what the professionals use but at such a moderate price.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done much with it yet, and I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so many of the bits are not things I would use.  </li>
            <li> just right, it tends to be too slow or too fast.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy a pink drill</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger in size and work like a professional drill.</li>
            <li> but they are too thin and getting them done at the salon sometimes ends up damaging them more.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last as the plastic is cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful too, I usually keep it at the lowest setting</li>
            <li> I actually used it for something completely different, I have a tortoise with a long beak and used it to file it down;)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews considered all good and bad.</li>
            <li> I also filed down the bottom of my nail between the new nail and the ridge from the acrylic so that when I repolished them, the ridge wasn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t fast enough or small enough for my min pins nails.</li>
            <li> I also like one of the thin bits that comes with the kit as it helps clean the build up underneath my nail after I&#x27;ve put the finishing filing touches.  </li>
            <li> Too bad - it is very appealing at the price point.</li>
            <li> BUT THE DRILL DIDNT LAST LONG.</li>
            <li> The speed is set by a dial, so you have total control over how fast or slow it goes.</li>
            <li> The drill comes with different attachments it has a control speed slow to fast.  </li>
            <li> Just be very careful when using this filer, especially if you are just starting, it will burn you.</li>
            <li> I filled my nails way too thin!  </li>
            <li> easys to use with a long cord.</li>
            <li> Manual devices are needed a long with this instrument</li>
            <li> Now I can do them whenever I want and they will not get so long ..</li>
            <li> I have looked a long time for this type outfit to do my toe nails.</li>
            <li> There are no clear instructions how to put it together.</li>
            <li> So if any other pet owners are wondering what to do, I totally recommend an Electric nail file!  </li>
            <li> The electrical cord is very long.</li>
            <li> I only need it to trim my toenails and grind the dead skin off my heals which I can do with the same tool.</li>
            <li> My main purpose in ordering the nail drill was to use on thick nails on elderly.....</li>
            <li> Now I can get it done in half the time it took with the pedipaws and the smaller handle on this</li>
            <li> Its like the one they use in the local nail place except this is less than one visit to a store</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting my nails done with acrylic for years and got tired of spending sooooo much money, waiting for appointments etc...</li>
            <li> It has loads of power for sanding off calluses, need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to krazy glue the sanding bands to the tip of the sander metal pink</li>
            <li> Will be doing a manicure in the next few days and will report if I have any problems.</li>
            <li> I now have my nails long and all I do is put acrylic over them and file them down a lot faster.</li>
            <li> This is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> kinda complicated to figure out what you need but after a while you get the hang of it, very fast and efficient</li>
            <li> I had to use the metal drill bit that came with the other nail drill.</li>
            <li> Instructions sheet is pretty much useless</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> but I can get into areas with the sharp grinders that provide relief.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the sanding bands were slightly too big/loose for the sander metals.  </li>
            <li> The filer has not shut down from over heating yet</li>
            <li> Brought down fungused nail quite a bit in three sessions.  </li>
            <li> I could keep them ground down to the length I desired as they grew out and reduce the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; where they started.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to cut down my filing time when with clients.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I ordered this to do my little dogs nails.  </li>
            <li> .Please submit this message so other customers do not have to waste their time and money on this product like i did.</li>
            <li> Abrasive wheels slipped until I enlarged the hub slightly.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth $60 dollars!  </li>
            <li> What do I do with the little gold things?</li>
            <li> There is little vibration when you put it at the highest setting</li>
            <li> It was a little wanting on the instructions and unless you know how these work, it will take a little time to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Would like to have it a little stronger</li>
            <li> we can just do them a little a few times a month ..</li>
            <li> What a let down!</li>
            <li> Took down a destructive high filling in a tooth in two minutes w/spherical bit.  </li>
            <li> use the drill to get rid of the lifting that happens after a few weeks and to shape the nail after I&#x27;ve applied the acrylic.  </li>
            <li> I had a HomeMedic electric nail kit that I received as a christmas gift quite a few years ago, I used it minaly to file my toe nails</li>
            <li> it stopped working a few days ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built like it should hold up for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It took a few once overs to get used to</li>
            <li> broken total waste of money/</li>
            <li> Will not buy this one again due to the control failure.</li>
            <li> In the past my husband was never satisfied how my toes looked after cutting them with a large toe clipper.</li>
            <li> and I desperately needed a new kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a *little* bit hard to get the speed</li>
            <li> The directions are awful, so it took me quite a while to figure out how to fit the bits on the base; but now I&#x27;ve got it and it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> No more nail salons for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I am going to keep it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not &#x27;cheap&#x27; or flimsy in the least.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use and did not have enough accessories to work with.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this product to anyone who uses fake nails whether gel, acrylic or plain fake.</li>
            <li> Main purpose was to file painful callus and it rely works on that.</li>
            <li> I have toenail fungus and the Podiatrist used a drill with a metal cone shaped file to grind down a thin layer of the nail and then applied a product to the nail bed called RENEWED NAIL.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad toenail problem and this is the only thing i ever used that ground them down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this grinder as I always get tense and anxious when I have to cut, trim, or file them.  </li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails, but like to wait at least three weeks between visits to the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> This was such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Little complicated when attaching the parts, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Not well made and very hard to change the attachments.</li>
            <li> I like it to be a really thin layer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how it would work since my toenails are very thick.</li>
            <li> Husband has real thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the package at all.</li>
            <li> My nails formed and grew in weird shapes.  </li>
            <li> Unable to use this.</li>
            <li> nails that defy cutting.  </li>
            <li> My review of this disappointing product will be found in my review  of the Pro Sanding Bands  Robert E. Yim M.D.</li>
            <li> Unable to use!</li>
            <li> so I could let them grow out without looking so bad.  </li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst product i have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sent as shown.  Worthy of trust.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Very effective at-home drill. I lost a piece to mine so I am going to order another which is no big deal since the price is awesome. The cord does get in the way sometimes but again, the price is awesome so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
            <li> did not  work for  me</li>
            <li> I love my new nail drill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting my nails done with acrylic for years and got tired of spending sooooo much money, waiting for appointments etc...that I started doing my own at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the drill to get rid of the lifting that happens after a few weeks and to shape the nail after I&#x27;ve applied the acrylic.  Love the way it works so far.  I also like one of the thin bits that comes with the kit as it helps clean the build up underneath my nail after I&#x27;ve put the finishing filing touches.  The drill has low to fast settings which is a really good feature for me because I sometimes don&#x27;t need it to spin quickly around the cuticle area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really quick.  I would highly recommend the seller &amp; product!</li>
            <li> This item works as designed-no complaints-It can get not when rotation over time. It comes with many attachments and easy to use. The electrical cord is very long.</li>
            <li> This works better then expected. Adjustable speeds and an easy to hold and control tool makes nail work a cinch. I also use it on my children&#x27;s toenails, which they find highly amusing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy for the price. It has loads of power for sanding off calluses, need to be careful. Also has lots of good attachments.     My speed control quit working very soon. Once it warms up I have only one speed - high! That is ok for now and for the purpose I am using it, but I am still looking for another with variable speed. Will not buy this one again due to the control failure. Too bad - it is very appealing at the price point.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk! When I took it out of the package, my husband commented on how cheap the product looked. I shared that it got good reviews on Amazon. He was right. After filing my 7th toenail, the drill sputtered and died. The next day, I took out the screws and, when I push the motor to the side of the case, it works. Maybe a wire is loose - I can&#x27;t tell for sure. I plan on purchasing a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> For use by myself on my own nails and my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and small, easy to hold, good power. Love it! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great tool for the price.  Definitely NOT a beginner&#x27;s tool, though!  Does not have a &amp;#34;very low&amp;#34; speed, very easy to grind all the way through the nail to the nail bed if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing (I&#x27;m moderately experienced, but I found this out the HARD way)!  I was super lucky that I didn&#x27;t scar the nail bed and only had to wait about 8-10 weeks for the nail to grow back out to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know what you are doing and need a portable drill that will fit in a small space for travel, this is a good investment.  I recommend AGAINST using this drill with carbide tips!  There just isn&#x27;t enough control and the speeds are way too high, even at the lowest speed.</li>
            <li> The MANICURIST MAXIM Nail Drill Grinder is just what I needed to take care of my feet. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this product! No more nail salons for me. All of you will benifit from using this product. Whether it is just cleaning up your cuticles or smoothing your feet. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This drill is veeeeeery good, and it comes with good drill parts, i love it! If i have to buy another one for any reason i will buy this same one without a doubt. Plus i got my drill in 3 days!</li>
            <li> This is great for doing your nails at home. At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should buy this or not from the other reviews but this product is great. Especially for someone who is trying to save money and is learning to do nails. The filer has not shut down from over heating yet but I do feel when it starts to get hot so I just give it a 3min break and then continue.     I&#x27;ve always wanted to grow my nails but they are too thin and getting them done at the salon sometimes ends up damaging them more. I now have my nails long and all I do is put acrylic over them and file them down a lot faster. Just be very careful when using this filer, especially if you are just starting, it will burn you. Over all the quality of the product is not fancy but it does the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price, also i received this really fast :)</li>
            <li> kinda complicated to figure out what you need but after a while you get the hang of it, very fast and efficient</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Professional results.  Easy to use.  Good value. Lots of different attachments for different uses. Would recommend for acrylic nail touchups.</li>
            <li> I did not open the package till I was overseas since it was supposed to be dual voltage. It did not work. I returned to the US after 3 months and they would not exchange it. Amazon was kind enough to give me credit due to their own warranty.</li>
            <li> look no further. buy this product. as good or better than the others that cost 3x as much - plus you get all top quality files &amp; bits.if this thing works on my feet - it will work for anybody. very powerful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of doing my own acrylic nails.  Um, not going to happen.  I just don&#x27;t have the patience.  But, this file worked great.  In fact, it worked a little too great.  I filled my nails way too thin!  So the product worked great...the operator, not so much!</li>
            <li> This lil machine is super strong and powerful, def able to handle any mani/pedi. Well worth every penny, just wish it had a instructional disk or manual. If you don&#x27;t know what your doing, it&#x27;s a lil more guess work.  DEF BUY THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> i had serious doubts when i ordered this product, but I am very happy with it! i needed something with power to clean under my fingernails and remove the last bit of nail polish/clean around my toenail bed -and had the pointed ceramic attachments that i find easier to use than metal. this works faster than the battery operated products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this so far! I use it on my own nails, and my dogs nails. I mostly bought it for my dogs, because I liked Pedipaws but it wasn&#x27;t fast enough or small enough for my min pins nails. Now I can get it done in half the time it took with the pedipaws and the smaller handle on this is so much easier on my hands!! Love this product so far! Worth the price!!</li>
            <li> works great no problem works like a charm hassle free came right on time best bang for your buck promise</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I expected to have to pay much more for an electric file of this quality.  I have absolutely no complaints.  Delivery was within days of purchase.</li>
            <li> My main purpose in ordering the nail drill was to use on thick nails on elderly.....nails that defy cutting.  The drill worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used all the accessories, but look forward to doing so.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  Just a mini dremmel tool but that is what you want.  Plenty of bits and pieces to do all you need to do.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004D58LWW MY MANICURIST MAXIM Nail Drill Grinder PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete. Manicuring, pedicuring, or removal of calluses. Dremel bits compatible]]just purchased the nail machine, model#6600.  the sander heads that came with it came flying off when i tried to use it.  has anyone else experienced this problem?</li>
            <li> Buyer beware.  The product is ok IF you get one that works.  I ordered this set which cost about $37.  When I got it I immediately opened it and the motor did not work.  I had to pay to send it back PLUS send a check for $15 dollars to cover shipping and handling for a replacement.  Once it was all said and done,  I had to pay about $57 to get a working drill.  This product is not worth $60 dollars!  I definitely would not buy again!  I would not do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool.  It has all the proper attachments, a good long cord, and the right amount of power.  For the price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a hidden gem, I thought it would be cheap but this drill is pretty good. I do my own acrylic overlays and I like it to be a really thin layer so this helps me buff it down nice and evenly. It&#x27;s powerful too, I usually keep it at the lowest setting and I&#x27;m good to go. It&#x27;s really light too so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver even with my non-dominant hand, unlike my old rechargeable Dremel (the battery weighed it down). The drill bits are easy to change out and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far. Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone who does their own nails at home. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased My Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill for pedicures.  I have toenail fungus and the Podiatrist used a drill with a metal cone shaped file to grind down a thin layer of the nail and then applied a product to the nail bed called RENEWED NAIL.  He recommended I get a nail drill to do this myself at home on a weekly basis.  I had purchased an inexspensive battery operated manicuring drill and it didn&#x27;t have the power to do a thorough job.  The My Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill is easy to use and very powerful.  I would have given it a 5 star rating except the metal drill bits that come with the drill are too smooth to do a thorugh job of removing the RENEWED NAIL product and grinding down the new nail growth.  I had to use the metal drill bit that came with the other nail drill.</li>
            <li> I was relucent to order this manicure nail drill because I have a similiar one and it simply does not have the power needed for grinding and removing calluses.  However, it stated on the package that it was professional quality so I ordered it. It arrived yesterday and I quickly tried it....it is awesome!!!! Very powerful and does the job needed nicely.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I still cannot figure out how to use this.  I have watched the video twice.  Can anyone tell me how to keep the file bit from falling out?  What do I do with the little gold things?</li>
            <li> This machine works great - but I think I overused it a bit trying to remove my cuttical - I&#x27;m much more careful now.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is and at a good price. I really would recommend this product to anyone who uses fake nails whether gel, acrylic or plain fake. You really do get what it says you are getting at a good price.</li>
            <li> I had spent months reading reviews, searching on Amazon trying to find the best nail drill. I really wanted to buy a pink drill but the reviews discouraged me from purchasing. I finally ran into this drill. I read the reviews considered all good and bad. Most of the reviews were 4 or 5 stars so I decided to buy it. I placed my order on 3/31 and it was delivered 4/3. This shipper amazed me with how fast they processed and shipped the order. I was so excited I had gotten it so fast I used it that morning to do a full acrylic set on myself. The machine does magic even at it&#x27;s lowest setting! There is little vibration when you put it at the highest setting but it&#x27;s no big deal. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle even with your less dominant hand. This is a great buy for begginers or if you plan to do nails as a hobby. Overall I am in love with my purchase and will be buying another for a friend who is going to nail tech school.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 3 stars because it does work; but the packaging could be much better.</li>
            <li> This is everything I hoped it would be.  Makes it so easy to maintain my nails.  Easy to use. Price is excellent. Amazon is great because they offer so many choices, and provide reviews to make your choices so much easier.  You don&#x27;t get that in a retail location!</li>
            <li> OVERALL, THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT FOR THE FIRST FEW TIMES I USED IT BUT THEN IT STOPPED WORKING - I THINK IT OVER HEATED. HOWEVER, I AM GIVING IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY WITH THE PRICE &amp; SHIPPING BUT THE DRILL DIDNT LAST LONG.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  I wish everything worked as well as this gizmo. I am very happy with it. And it was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It did everything I hoped it would do and it did it quickly and easily. Alrighty then pilgrim.</li>
            <li> So far so good, definitely better than a manual nail file for toe nails.  It&#x27;s a *little* bit hard to get the speed just right, it tends to be too slow or too fast.  If you press to hard against the toenails it tends to stop spinning -- which is what you want, better than goring the living bejesus out of your nails.</li>
            <li> Forgive me if I misspelled dremel.......This product is good but I was expecting it to make doing my nails easier and faster and it doesn&#x27;t. I think I just need practice. I only gave three stars because I continue to use the good old emery board!</li>
            <li> Its like the one they use in the local nail place except this is less than one visit to a store</li>
            <li> Great Manicurist Drill !  Everyone of my friends want to buy this . It works just like the salons and  the price was good too</li>
            <li> I have a bad toenail problem and this is the only thing i ever used that ground them down. easys to use with a long cord.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use or how to change heads! Thought I would be able to figure it out but I can&#x27;t! No directions! Unable to use!</li>
            <li> I used this product daily on my hard soles and it worked beautifully.  I recommend this, for not only calloused soles, for callouses especially.</li>
            <li> Love it, my pedicure looks professional!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would be very easy to use,but being hemipledic, (using one hand), makes it very very hard to change the attachments.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion. Instructions sheet is pretty much useless but i finally figured out how to use it and am pleased withe the results. Main purpose was to file painful callus and it rely works on that.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst product i have ever purchased. The instructions given did not explain how to assemble the product, so we are throwing it away. STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> Little complicated when attaching the parts, but it does the job</li>
            <li> It broke as soon as I got it, but when reported it, a replacement was sent fast. It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy... as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails, but like to wait at least three weeks between visits to the nail salon.  I also like to keep my nails short.  It took forever to file them down myself, but the nail drill grinder did a great job in less time.  I also filed down the bottom of my nail between the new nail and the ridge from the acrylic so that when I repolished them, the ridge wasn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not well made and very hard to change the attachments. I am not sure I am going to keep it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger in size and work like a professional drill.</li>
            <li> I needed a nail drill because i do my own nails.  The drill is amazing ! diffeernt speeds , light weight and powerful. Great for the money and the seller shipped very fast. Love it love it.</li>
            <li> As a result of this nail tool, I have moved my nail look up to a professional level. It really performs and has the power that I needed to shape and form my gel nails.</li>
            <li> This is not very powerful. Manual devices are needed a long with this instrument</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and have two things to say about it, one is that it really works better than a professional manicure and second it does not come with instructions I basically figured it out for myself.</li>
            <li> Works well, and met my expectations. Abrasive wheels slipped until I enlarged the hub slightly.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully! I actually used it for something completely different, I have a tortoise with a long beak and used it to file it down;) So if any other pet owners are wondering what to do, I totally recommend an Electric nail file!  Oh, and it worked really well on nail as well:)</li>
            <li> When I bought this nail drill I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t be the \\&quot;best\\&quot; because of the price. But I bought it because I read the other reviews and saw that it seemed great because I didn&#x27;t need a nail tequnichian quality. So I went along to buying it and OMG! It is so nice! I before bought a battery powered but did not want that so I had to return it...it was $65.00 and it wasn&#x27;t even close to as good as this one! It has multiple speeds and lots of different bits. So i suggest you buy this or.... your missin&#x27; out![[ASIN:B004D58LWW MY MANICURIST MAXIM Nail Drill Grinder PRO Powerful Electric Nail File w/ Bits Acrylics Gels, complete. Manicuring, pedicuring, or removal of calluses. Dremel bits compatible]]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how it would work since my toenails are very thick. In the past my husband was never satisfied how my toes looked after cutting them with a large toe clipper. We both just love the product. It was easy to use and has several drill bits. This enable one to make any needed adjustments to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it! A lot better than the ones you buy at the drug store, more power and better built!</li>
            <li> BEST tool I ever bought, works great between maniucures.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.....</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I ordered this to do my little dogs nails.  I was taking her in every 3 to 4 weeks and paying $11 plus tip each time.  The groomers have larger grinders and she wasn&#x27;t happy with that BIG THING coming at her.  This is great .. I put on the grinding (sandpaper) attachment (easy) and she lets me do them with no problem ,, I like the small size and light weight since it is electric and has a nice long cord also.  Now I can do them whenever I want and they will not get so long .. we can just do them a little a few times a month .. and my chihuahua knows she gets a cookie when we are done .. very happy.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.. Just like they use at the nail shop..&lt;br /&gt;I can save a lot with this item.. And keep my nails up in between appointments..&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it..</li>
            <li> There are no clear instructions how to put it together. after 30 mins I accidentally put  a piece in, and another piece in and it worked. There is no phone # to call for help. Not sure how long it will last as the plastic is cheap. I only need it to trim my toenails and grind the dead skin off my heals which I can do with the same tool. I am old and can&#x27;t get to my toe&#x27;s anymore without help. This tool works good once you get it together. There are lots of pieces in the kit.</li>
            <li> Easy purchase thank you</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and on time.  It was a little wanting on the instructions and unless you know how these work, it will take a little time to get the hang of it.  Works very good and has what I needed.  Would like to have it a little stronger but yet you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I could use a slower speed in addition to set speed.</li>
            <li> Good nail drill.  My only complaint is that the sanding bands were slightly too big/loose for the sander metals.  I ended up having to krazy glue the sanding bands to the tip of the sander metal pink ends.  Literally.  Afterwards, it stayed in place.  I was able to successfully manicure my nails.  I would recommend buying this product and krazy glue &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; you have to glue the sanding bands to the sanding metal sticks.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It worked great on my thick toenails.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My review of this disappointing product will be found in my review  of the Pro Sanding Bands  Robert E. Yim M.D.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  Will be doing a manicure in the next few days and will report if I have any problems.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DRILL...ITS NICE AND IT TAKE TAKE THE DRILL BITS I ALREADY HAVE. I GOT MORE BITS AND IT WORKS WONDERED.....MY NAILS SHINE!!</li>
            <li> This was such a disappointment.  It doesn&#x27;t have much power, and the first time I used it one of the tiny pieces popped off and I never could find it.  What a let down!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my father in law and he absolutely loves it..he said it was the best one he had ever used..and he isn&#x27;t that easy to please just so you know..so it must really be good</li>
            <li> Well my first pruchase didn&#x27;t go very well since it wasn&#x27;t working. The company sent another part which was better but not what I expected.    I did speak to a customer service person there that was more than rude. So overall I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I received this drill and I really love it! I love the different speeds you can adjust to and its very lightweight and easy to control.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to get me through a few more weeks before having to get my nails touched up.&lt;br /&gt;Works just like the one in a salon. The only con was not having enough directions as to what each piece did.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price and it was shipped and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had electric and battery operated manicure sets; I prefer the electric. This set is easy to use and works with all types of manicures from basic, to gels, to pedicures. I like that it is light weight with variable speeds not to mention the generous supply of sanders. It does a great job and at a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> This item cannot be used because it lacks the ability to connect the files onto the electric manicure equipment! A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I put it together to use right away, but the motor burned out and I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once.  I returned it right away for a refund.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. Got it this morning. Nothing wrong with the package at all. It was actually a tiny bit sooner than the shopping progress said. Already made sure it works by plugging it in. Love it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is faulty did not even turn on now i have to pay more money to send back to company do not suggest anyone purchase this product .My first time to shop on line and most likely my last !!.Please submit this message so other customers do not have to waste their time and money on this product like i did.</li>
            <li> I had a HomeMedic electric nail kit that I received as a christmas gift quite a few years ago, I used it minaly to file my toe nails and it did ok job, but it stopped working a few days ago and I desperately needed a new kit.  I like to do a lot of research before buying stuff, this one has great reviews and the price is very decent comparing to other drills I have looked into.  I decided to give this a try.  It arrived within just 3 days which is great.  The drill itself is pretty lightweight comparing to my old kit but it is so much more powerful.  I used on my calluses tonight and it did a great job.  My feet are now super soft:) I just love the results and I hope it can last for years to come.</li>
            <li> I just started doing my own acrylics and I absolutely love this grinder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased, so I don&#x27;t really have any points of comparison. But I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and I simply love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the easy speed adjuster wheel. It actually goes at a much faster speed than I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism would be that they don&#x27;t provide a medium grit attachment. The attachments are the replaceable heavy grit rounds, along with 2 metal fine-grit attachments, 2 pink super fine attachments and a white polishing/buffing attachment.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m going to need to purchase a medium grit attachment. But as a starter kit, it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this grinder. It seems like it was a great buy for the price point and it&#x27;s not &#x27;cheap&#x27; or flimsy in the least. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> OK product for my purposes</li>
            <li> great very speedy delivery very happy with produce just what I needed many thanks</li>
            <li> new drill it works great for me its worth the money and far better than the pink one please dont buy the pink one stick to this one its better and the cord is better too</li>
            <li> Fantastic item glad I purchased this. It has made a big difference with my toenails. I highly recommend this. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was reasonably priced and would do the job.  When I opened the nail kit I noticed that the drill seemed a bit flimsy and cheap.  I have had it for one month and used it one time.  Now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this nail file!!!  It was very reasonable priced but yet it works amazing.  It was very easy to understand how to work it and the quality is great!  So glad that i purchased this item!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased My Manicurist Maxim kit from Amazon and am extremely pleased. If you have ever had your nails professionally prepared for gel or acrilic nails you will remember seeing them use an electrical appliance that works as a nail file reshaping your nails, etc.  The appliance comes with several \\&quot;sander heads\\&quot; used during this process before and after gel/acrilic application.  The book that comes with kit is very easy to understand how to use the appliance  This kit is exactly what the professionals use but at such a moderate price.  I love mine and use it to prep and prepare my gel  nails myself thereby saving quite a bit of money let alone time traveling to and from a nail salon.  Highly recommend this product.  Top quality</li>
            <li> It works.  So far, so good.  It&#x27;s built like it should hold up for a few years.  Have used it twice.  It&#x27;s easy to change grinder tips and the speed control is pretty handy.</li>
            <li> after 4 months you cannot attach tools.  broken total waste of money/</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly mother for Christmas.  She used it once for about 10 minutes and it stopped working.  Returning to company.</li>
            <li> For years and years I&#x27;ve always DREADED trimming or filing my toe nails.  I never took proper care of my toes as a youth and it plagued my adulthood with ingrown toe nails, etc.  My nails formed and grew in weird shapes.  I purchased this grinder as I always get tense and anxious when I have to cut, trim, or file them.  NO MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has given me relief.  I will now look forward to doing this once a week.  With all the attachments and grinders it makes it very easy.  I know this sounds gross but I can get into areas with the sharp grinders that provide relief.  I just got done with my first grinding and my feet are SCREAMING with relief.  It feels so good.  It took a few once overs to get used to but now I feel so comfortable using it I may try it on my child&#x27;s toes (7 yrs old).  Wow, I recommend this device and give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not only working on the nails which looks good yet needs several more treatments.  Brought down fungused nail quite a bit in three sessions.  Took down a destructive high filling in a tooth in two minutes w/spherical bit.  I had to thank you.</li>
            <li> Although I think this a good product , it is obviously packaged for a trained manicurist, not someone like me trying to learn how to do their own gels.  There is no guide to tell you how the different attachments are used so I am having to experiment to figure it out.</li>
            <li> great tool for your nails and toes.  In my opinion it was a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I wanted to save some money and do my own acrylic nails.. this is perfect. Works great. Easy to handle for the price it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, keeps my nails neat and shapely and would recommend this product to anyone who would like to achieve the same result.</li>
            <li> Seams to work well.  Price is very reasonable!! Will help Begining Nail Tecks get started in their careers. Also great for single applications for individuals.</li>
            <li> Love this nail grinder. The speed is set by a dial, so you have total control over how fast or slow it goes. Much prefer this to the battery operated dremel mini mite I used before.</li>
            <li> My Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill Gronder Pro Powerful Electric Nail File.  I love the Manicurist Maxim Nail Drill Grinder Pro.  It did a great job on my toe nails and removing dead skin from my heels.</li>
            <li> Husband has real thick toe nails.  This is the only thing the we have used in our home that works</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered had a faulty switch but the seller was very good about it and sent me a replacement.  It works great-can quickly remove thick cuticles and also does a great job of removing callused skin on the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, who is a nail tech, and she can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it. It cuts down the time it takes her to do my nails greatly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used for several years with no issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to smooth and grind down acrylic nails so I could let them grow out without looking so bad.  It worked great!  I could keep them ground down to the length I desired as they grew out and reduce the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; where they started.  I now use the tool to manicure my natural fingernails and toenails.  It is much faster and efficient than manually filing them.  I am completely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this machine to polish my watches, i&#x27;m a guy so I really don&#x27;t have much use for it for my feet but let me tell you this thing works great on my watches that&#x27;s all I can say....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done much with it yet, and I don&#x27;t use fake nails, so many of the bits are not things I would use.  The directions are awful, so it took me quite a while to figure out how to fit the bits on the base; but now I&#x27;ve got it and it seems to work just fine.  I haven&#x27;t used the shaping bits yet, those are next.  I&#x27;m using this mainly for toenails, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product was not heavy duty as I expected it to be. It was difficult to use and did not have enough accessories to work with. It was a little light weight.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled it worked great!,,,,,,,,,, for a few uses. Then out of no where. It just,,,,,,,,, died! I was bummed.</li>
            <li> Bought this to cut down my filing time when with clients. Couldn&#x27;t be happier for a good product with a great price :)</li>
            <li> This item has really worked out.  I used it on a family members toe nails since I have seen these done in the salons when they do pedicures and this worked very well.  The drill comes with different attachments it has a control speed slow to fast.  work good.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item. Does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the sander to receive the sander bit. Unable to use this. A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> It has great power and all the attachments are awesome.  Perfect for personal use at home for those of us that have to fix our nails after getting them done!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. It does a great job. The power is great -- much better than other such tools that I have tried. This tool is powered via an electric cord which I believe is important for power.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see. Havem&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> I just received my nail drill and I&#x27;m happy as a lark!  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  Now I can do all my own manicure/pedicures and everyone else&#x27;s lol.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and did the job.  I have looked a long time for this type outfit to do my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  It is exactly as described and very reasonable.  Easy to use and adjustable speed is awesome.</li>
