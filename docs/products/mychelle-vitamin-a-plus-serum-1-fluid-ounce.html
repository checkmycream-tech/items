    <ol>
            <li>Smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The difference it has made in the texture of my skin is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Great for lifting, brightening and toning the face.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Brighter clearer more beautiful skin!</li>
            <li>and ive been using this for a good 2 years now</li>
            <li>love the smell of it and the texture, it absorbs very nice, not sticky at  all</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>as well, I love it!</li>
            <li>All MyChelle products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MyChelle&#x27;s face wash and cream, so I figured that the serum would be just as good ...</li>
            <li>A serum is great- results quickly.  </li>
            <li>so it leaks all over the place - you end up wasting more than you use.  </li>
            <li>Love MyChelle products.</li>
            <li>I just ran out of this product and I need more.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Mychelle products, so this is nothing against the product itself, which I know to be high-quality.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>i love this serum, I bought it at sprouts and they will stop caring it, sad,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really love the product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>My skinceuticals retinol does a MUCH better job; probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>As a licensed esthetician I have found this vitamin A serum to be just as effective as the higher end brands without containing all those toxic ingredients!</li>
            <li>, fine lines are diminished and the texture of the skin is smooth and evening out.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that it is available on Amazon for a lower price as well as &amp;#34;subscribe and save.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love the product it makes my skin super soft and definately improves the clarity.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of Vitamin A for me.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have, my skin is back to looking great and my acne scars are fading just by using the Mychelle products I was using prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with this serum, I strongly suggest CeraVe Moisturizing Cr&amp;egrave;me with Hyaluronic Acid and vital Ceramides.</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my forearms, knowing they had the most sun damage and in one application I felt a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Great product that works slowly over time.</li>
            <li>They have never come back so long as I use this great product.</li>
            <li>but costs more than TWICE as much, yet both products are the same!</li>
            <li>and I cn really say it has helped.</li>
            <li>The CeraVe is also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Again, nothing against Mychelle, just too much for my sensitive, acne-prone skin to handle right now.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for the mild retinol effect.</li>
            <li>It also is extremely highly recommended by my dermatologist to apply after this serum.</li>
            <li>As far as my pores go, there has been no dramatic difference</li>
            <li>but the top doesnt screw on firmly</li>
            <li>I just turned 58 and even though I still have the normal sagging , I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have not used retinol products before, but decided to give it a try in an effort to keep my skin in good shape and draw out damage that has occurred with time and living a life where time playing or working outdoors was not uncommon.  </li>
            <li>My son has adult acne and he is hooked on it.  </li>
            <li>I have felt a difference in my skins softness and noticed that at my temple area, where I have had precancerous issues, the A serum seems to draw out the damage, making it rough for a short time until it becomes soft and smooth again.  </li>
            <li>far (I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the improvement is miraculous but it is early days.</li>
            <li>I use it at night with nothing else and by morning my skin is so soft and supple and moist.  </li>
            <li>In looking into natural products with retinol, this was the only one with natural retinol and without harmful ingredients added.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it&#x27;s like in another few weeks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because my skin is oily with large pores and an uneven skin tone.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a while along with other MyChelle products and like it, but since the line is expensive I am always looking to save and found it cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the packaging - not sure if mine is defective</li>

            <li> I have been using this for a week or 2 now and I am waiting to see results</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband....he seams to like  both of the products recommended by our dermatologist when we had our annual screening.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while along with other MyChelle products and like it, but since the line is expensive I am always looking to save and found it cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> This retinol product performs as well as more expensive brands I have purchased. Used in the evening before moisturizing, it shows a difference in only a few days. Great for lifting, brightening and toning the face.</li>
            <li> Im an esthetician so I know skin care products.  All MyChelle products are amazing.  I recommend them to family and friends, as well as clients.  This vit. A serum is great- results quickly.  My son has adult acne and he is hooked on it.  I use it daily for the mild retinol effect.</li>
            <li> I love the product it makes my skin super soft and definately improves the clarity.  I absolutely hate the packaging - not sure if mine is defective but the top doesnt screw on firmly so it leaks all over the place - you end up wasting more than you use.  Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Love MyChelle products. I noticed results after just a few days. My pores actually got smaller. I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> I previously had some problems with blackheads and overall clogged dull skin and ive been using this for a good 2 years now and I cn really say it has helped. Brighter clearer more beautiful skin! I love it!</li>
            <li> I just ran out of this product and I need more.  The difference it has made in the texture of my skin is incredible.  I just turned 58 and even though I still have the normal sagging , I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mychelle products, so this is nothing against the product itself, which I know to be high-quality. However, I recently went through a massive round of breakouts and only managed to get it under control by switching to a Mychelle regimen. I purchased the Vitamin A Plus Serum to try to reduce the appearance of my recent acne scars, but it only made me start breaking out again, so I stopped using it. Now that I have, my skin is back to looking great and my acne scars are fading just by using the Mychelle products I was using prior to this purchase. Again, nothing against Mychelle, just too much for my sensitive, acne-prone skin to handle right now.</li>
            <li> I have not used retinol products before, but decided to give it a try in an effort to keep my skin in good shape and draw out damage that has occurred with time and living a life where time playing or working outdoors was not uncommon.  I have felt a difference in my skins softness and noticed that at my temple area, where I have had precancerous issues, the A serum seems to draw out the damage, making it rough for a short time until it becomes soft and smooth again.  Areas with wrinkles have softened and become less noticeable.  I have even used it on my forearms, knowing they had the most sun damage and in one application I felt a big difference.  I have used MyChelle products for years and this one is one I will continue to use.  It defiantly makes a difference.  I am thankful that it is available on Amazon for a lower price as well as &amp;#34;subscribe and save.&amp;#34;  In looking into natural products with retinol, this was the only one with natural retinol and without harmful ingredients added.  It is a winner.</li>
            <li> If I could give this stuff six stars, I would! Healing, smoothing, brightening, no break outs... What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> i love this serum, I bought it at sprouts and they will stop caring it, sad,&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it and the texture, it absorbs very nice, not sticky at  all and I can see results in my skin, fine lines are diminished and the texture of the skin is smooth and evening out. It does not bother my eyes a bit and it shrinks pores  as well, I love it!</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician I have found this vitamin A serum to be just as effective as the higher end brands without containing all those toxic ingredients!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Smells wonderful.  Goes on smooth.  Just the right amount of Vitamin A for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and plan to continue use for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Great product that works slowly over time. It will help to control those pesky oil gland bumps that form on your forehead you get after 50yo. They have never come back so long as I use this great product. My dermatologist sells Retriderm&#x27;s version which is identical . . . . but costs more than TWICE as much, yet both products are the same! I would suggest buying this MyChelle instead, unless money is no object for you. My dermatologist agreed that this MyChelle brand is the same as Retriderm. In conjunction with this serum, I strongly suggest CeraVe Moisturizing Cr&amp;egrave;me with Hyaluronic Acid and vital Ceramides. It also is extremely highly recommended by my dermatologist to apply after this serum. The CeraVe is also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I purchased this item because my skin is oily with large pores and an uneven skin tone. Also prone to break outs. I had read the reviews and wanted to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;So far (I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks) I really love the product. It leaves skin feeling and smelling amazing. As far as my pores go, there has been no dramatic difference but I believe my skin tone has improved and the General appearance has improved slightly. I wouldn&#x27;t say the improvement is miraculous but it is early days. I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it&#x27;s like in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it at night with nothing else and by morning my skin is so soft and supple and moist.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MyChelle&#x27;s face wash and cream, so I figured that the serum would be just as good ... I guess it&#x27;s okay.  My skinceuticals retinol does a MUCH better job; probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
