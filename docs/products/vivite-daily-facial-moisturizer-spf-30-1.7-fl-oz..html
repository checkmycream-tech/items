            <li>This product is great.  </li>

            <li>Extremely good moisturizer that works beautifully under make-up.</li>
            <li>Very light and perfect for under makeup!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and it has sun screen and the exfoliation is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product, non-greasy, goes on nicely, SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>Applies smoothly with excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li>and I am fanatical about good skin care.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Again replacing MD-Forte and has SPF so its a good value and works with out a hitch.</li>
            <li>I buy it when I feel affluent and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I love amazon!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I just love this cream and it&#x27;s price !</li>
            <li>Goes on light and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great light moisturizer with 30 spf.</li>
            <li>Loved it even more than the night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>would really expect some consideration, as with this type of pump, this is not an uncommon occurrence!</li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GOOD, I LOVE IT UNDER MAKEUP...</li>
            <li>I liked that it has a retinol product in it and do notice the texture of my skin is much better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>A very light weight moisturizer with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but I would prefer no scent or a very light one.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I got a better saving ordering it in Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I think it is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love their night cream though - my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love all Vivite products...</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this product -</li>
            <li>I now use this product solely for incidental sun exposure days - days when I don&#x27;t plan on getting more than a couple of minutes of sun exposure at a time.</li>
            <li>I love the Vivite products.........</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to layer a sunscreen on top of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer and I found it here for a much better price than in their office.</li>
            <li>probably over 60 or more, depending on how you apply it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I had to get my husband to tear the top off to be able to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product line.</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month before I saw a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I do look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I love vivite products.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>but I like the MD Forte packaging better.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Vivite products.</li>
            <li>I always store it upside-down so that the lotion stays at the top of the bottle and no air pockets are created.</li>
            <li>Better than anything you can get in the stores ladies.</li>
            <li>I had read all the reviews about the pump being troublesome but I bought it anyway (as I love all of their cream and exfoliating cleanser).</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin, but don&#x27;t like a lot of greasy stuff on my face, but this is the perfect consistency to wear under foundation and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all.</li>
            <li>It is a good daily face lotion, has SPF 30 sunscreen included, seems to do a good job on fine lines.</li>
            <li>Lovely and light, no scent.</li>
            <li>the rest of my face dries up easily.</li>
            <li>This has a chemical&#x27;ish scent, but it does dissipate very quickly and it isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li>This cap pops off easily.</li>
            <li>Product does not smell strongly of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Gives you immediate results by diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This cream leaves your skin smooth, exfoliated, moisturized and protected with SPF 30 sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to like, it does everying in one fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>i rarely ever review items..but havt to tell you that i love this line...</li>
            <li>skin is fantastic....</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer, others had said the pump giver trouble, which it does , but someone had written bang it on the side and that really works, so for me this was a great buy..!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself is light and absorbs well without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>A great facial moisturizer with SPF</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find on Amazon, saved me the 30 minute drive each way to the dermatologist, and the price was good.</li>
            <li>The product is great, leaves your skin with a dew all day long.</li>
            <li>If I had bought it at the Spa where it was first sold to me, I would be able to exchange it.</li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t use it in summer because is too much dew in the skin during humid summers, but overall is very good</li>
            <li>, this lotion doesn&#x27;t make you break up more at all, is just pure moisture.</li>
            <li>think this product is great for winter days when skin is super dry</li>
            <li>good for all different skin..</li>
            <li>amazon is the most reasonable ive found.</li>
            <li>Paid full price.  </li>
            <li>Purchased off of Amazon for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This product has a sweet flowery scent.</li>
            <li>However, no matter how much I pump the top, no lotion will come out.  </li>
            <li>The container was full but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It is not bad for the price at all.</li>
            <li>Of all the low and high end brands, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Cool, soft, gentle, revitalizing, and effective on the skin.  </li>
            <li>, I tend to burn easily, so I needed a better daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This daily moisturizer is not the best for dry skin</li>
            <li>This product goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave me with too much of a shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer for the skin to keep it soft and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>-I bought one at a spa and liked the actual product.</li>
            <li>This every morning, applied after Daily Antioxidant Serum, has made a nice difference in the texture and health of my skin.  </li>
            <li>worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, and many cosmetics cause breakouts (still -- I am well into my 50s),but</li>
            <li>use this lotion everyday and was excited it was sold on your site with a good savings.  </li>
            <li>sloughs right off.  </li>
            <li>I am still searching for the write moisturizer that is right for me.</li>
            <li>but it would be fine for normal skin.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking moist and fresh throughout the day and that&#x27;s rare considering that most day time products I use require several applications to keep my skin from drying out again.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice in that you can see how much you have left!!  </li>
            <li>the melasma is fading, but unfortunately not gone.</li>
            <li>Tap the bottom of the bottle first then you can pump the product.</li>
            <li>.. gives skin a soft smooth feel..</li>
            <li>First purchased this product from a spa.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First i cleanse my face</li>
            <li>When I consistently use the products of it, my skin clears and pores shrink....not changing anytime soon.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the product but wish the delivery system was different.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using the product now ;-)</li>
            <li>order arrived and first bottle i took out would not pump and had to be returned.  </li>
            <li>very recommended - I will keep purchase it !</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li>Also, certain products in this line have a bit of an odor, but I got used to that.  </li>
            <li>you will see a difference in the appearance of fine lines in just a short time...</li>
            <li>I really like to apply my serum beforehand.</li>
            <li>Very oily nose area and</li>
            <li>I use more than this to cover all the spots.&lt;br /&gt;Small con: if you have never used glicolic acid it stings a bit your face, I touched my eyes after I touched my face and stinged my eyes, so try to be careful not to get it inside the eyes or close to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need to use so much</li>
            <li>This is a moisturizer that has it all and works very well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like the contents but after about two uses, the pump quit functioning.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to really take care of their skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could afford their whole line.</li>
            <li>And reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbs fast .</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, feels great, not sticky, or thick or dry like others, not hard to spread on your face</li>
            <li>The other bottle was ok</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>if I put this on first, my skin stays clear, no matter what products I use over it.</li>
            <li>my skin isn&#x27;t very oily anymore and needed a little more moisture without the heaviness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a problem to return the product and get a refund or a new container.</li>
            <li>I would say it is okay overall, but my main problem with it is that if I use a serum prior to applying this moisturizer, I noticed that it chunks up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this line.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I try something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but I never see equal or better results.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, sure enough the pump was not working ;-(  I called the number on the bottle to see if they could help, but they insisted that I contact the Amazon dealer, since they said they only sold the product to doctor offices.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I switched to Vivete products at our dermatologist when the price of SkinCeuticals became to high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone battling the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>very hydrating... but not heavy and doesnt lay on skin</li>
            <li>Really works, skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t flake like it use to.</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and in apparently good shape; however, the dispenser inside the bottle is broken and you cannot use the pump to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I only need a little to cover the whole face!</li>
            <li>Skin becomes soft after only a few uses and overall is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I usually only have to push the bottom up when I first start a new bottle or when it is almost out.  </li>
            <li>My doctor actually sold me my first container of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But I think it probably works better on dry skin or dry climates.</li>
            <li>I have recently been applying only this moisturizer without the initial serum or toner and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Great disappointment.</li>
            <li>Vivete is cheaper and seems to do the job so far, I have no allergic reactions to their products.</li>
            <li>a representative from Amazon had called me and told me that the pump does not have a tube attached and it just worked on a pumping action.</li>
            <li>After about a minute of applying you can literally lightly rub your face and all the dead skin</li>
            <li>i have finally purchased the whole line...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m 52 yrs old...</li>
            <li>I found out today that the only way to get the product out of the container is to tap the end of it gently against your palm.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and since the replenish cream works so well for me</li>
            <li>I ran out for a short time and tried to use up another moisturizer, but really noticed the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>so i will probably not know that i need to reorder until i completely run out.</li>
            <li>The top cannot be unscrewed so I am left with an almost full bottle of product and unable to use it or return it for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have had the same problem with the pump not working properly when I tried to use my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I live not having to put on a separate sunscreen daily.</li>
            <li>They definetly need a different container.&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to use only 2 pumps for the whole face</li>
            <li>Gave 4 stars because it is more expensive than drug-store brands, but not as much as if I bought it from the dermatologist office.  </li>
            <li>I am on my fifth bottle and although I love the product, the pump dispenser sucks!</li>
            <li>Push the pump down, then using your finger or some other device (I use my toothbrush handle) push the interior white plastic bottom up towards the pump which pushes the lotion up towards the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Vivite one product at a time as old products run out, since a laser procedure left my face with blotchy areas of melasma.  </li>
            <li>Face feels taunt and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would warn anyone who may buy this product is that, if you have a new bottle and it pumps out the product then later on nothing would pump, please do not unscrew the pump.</li>
            <li>this new product has a pump and the bottle is not clear.  </li>
            <li>My face is never dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, is only slightly greasy when first applied, then that goes away.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I liked that it has a retinol product in it and do notice the texture of my skin is much better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> A very light weight moisturizer with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but I would prefer no scent or a very light one.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I got a better saving ordering it in Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I think it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love their night cream though - my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love all Vivite products...</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this product -</li>
            <li> I now use this product solely for incidental sun exposure days - days when I don&#x27;t plan on getting more than a couple of minutes of sun exposure at a time.</li>
            <li> I love the Vivite products.........</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to layer a sunscreen on top of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer and I found it here for a much better price than in their office.</li>
            <li> probably over 60 or more, depending on how you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I had to get my husband to tear the top off to be able to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product line.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month before I saw a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I do look more youthful.</li>
            <li> I love vivite products.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> but I like the MD Forte packaging better.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Vivite products.</li>
            <li> I always store it upside-down so that the lotion stays at the top of the bottle and no air pockets are created.</li>
            <li> Better than anything you can get in the stores ladies.</li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews about the pump being troublesome but I bought it anyway (as I love all of their cream and exfoliating cleanser).</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin, but don&#x27;t like a lot of greasy stuff on my face, but this is the perfect consistency to wear under foundation and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> It is a good daily face lotion, has SPF 30 sunscreen included, seems to do a good job on fine lines.</li>
            <li> Lovely and light, no scent.</li>
            <li> the rest of my face dries up easily.</li>
            <li> This has a chemical&#x27;ish scent, but it does dissipate very quickly and it isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li> This cap pops off easily.</li>
            <li> Product does not smell strongly of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Gives you immediate results by diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin smooth, exfoliated, moisturized and protected with SPF 30 sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like, it does everying in one fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> i rarely ever review items..but havt to tell you that i love this line...</li>
            <li> skin is fantastic....</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer, others had said the pump giver trouble, which it does , but someone had written bang it on the side and that really works, so for me this was a great buy..!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is light and absorbs well without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> A great facial moisturizer with SPF</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find on Amazon, saved me the 30 minute drive each way to the dermatologist, and the price was good.</li>
            <li> The product is great, leaves your skin with a dew all day long.</li>
            <li> If I had bought it at the Spa where it was first sold to me, I would be able to exchange it.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t use it in summer because is too much dew in the skin during humid summers, but overall is very good</li>
            <li> , this lotion doesn&#x27;t make you break up more at all, is just pure moisture.</li>
            <li> think this product is great for winter days when skin is super dry</li>
            <li> good for all different skin..</li>
            <li> amazon is the most reasonable ive found.</li>
            <li> Paid full price.  </li>
            <li> Purchased off of Amazon for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This product has a sweet flowery scent.</li>
            <li> However, no matter how much I pump the top, no lotion will come out.  </li>
            <li> The container was full but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is not bad for the price at all.</li>
            <li> Of all the low and high end brands, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Cool, soft, gentle, revitalizing, and effective on the skin.  </li>
            <li> , I tend to burn easily, so I needed a better daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This daily moisturizer is not the best for dry skin</li>
            <li> This product goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave me with too much of a shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer for the skin to keep it soft and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> -I bought one at a spa and liked the actual product.</li>
            <li> This every morning, applied after Daily Antioxidant Serum, has made a nice difference in the texture and health of my skin.  </li>
            <li> worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, and many cosmetics cause breakouts (still -- I am well into my 50s),but</li>
            <li> use this lotion everyday and was excited it was sold on your site with a good savings.  </li>
            <li> sloughs right off.  </li>
            <li> I am still searching for the write moisturizer that is right for me.</li>
            <li> but it would be fine for normal skin.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking moist and fresh throughout the day and that&#x27;s rare considering that most day time products I use require several applications to keep my skin from drying out again.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice in that you can see how much you have left!!  </li>
            <li> the melasma is fading, but unfortunately not gone.</li>
            <li> Tap the bottom of the bottle first then you can pump the product.</li>
            <li> .. gives skin a soft smooth feel..</li>
            <li> First purchased this product from a spa.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First i cleanse my face</li>
            <li> When I consistently use the products of it, my skin clears and pores shrink....not changing anytime soon.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I need in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the product but wish the delivery system was different.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using the product now ;-)</li>
            <li> order arrived and first bottle i took out would not pump and had to be returned.  </li>
            <li> very recommended - I will keep purchase it !</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li> Also, certain products in this line have a bit of an odor, but I got used to that.  </li>
            <li> you will see a difference in the appearance of fine lines in just a short time...</li>
            <li> I really like to apply my serum beforehand.</li>
            <li> Very oily nose area and</li>
            <li> I use more than this to cover all the spots.&lt;br /&gt;Small con: if you have never used glicolic acid it stings a bit your face, I touched my eyes after I touched my face and stinged my eyes, so try to be careful not to get it inside the eyes or close to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need to use so much</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer that has it all and works very well for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like the contents but after about two uses, the pump quit functioning.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to really take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford their whole line.</li>
            <li> And reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs fast .</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, feels great, not sticky, or thick or dry like others, not hard to spread on your face</li>
            <li> The other bottle was ok</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> if I put this on first, my skin stays clear, no matter what products I use over it.</li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t very oily anymore and needed a little more moisture without the heaviness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a problem to return the product and get a refund or a new container.</li>
            <li> I would say it is okay overall, but my main problem with it is that if I use a serum prior to applying this moisturizer, I noticed that it chunks up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this line.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I try something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but I never see equal or better results.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, sure enough the pump was not working ;-(  I called the number on the bottle to see if they could help, but they insisted that I contact the Amazon dealer, since they said they only sold the product to doctor offices.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I switched to Vivete products at our dermatologist when the price of SkinCeuticals became to high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone battling the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> very hydrating... but not heavy and doesnt lay on skin</li>
            <li> Really works, skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t flake like it use to.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in apparently good shape; however, the dispenser inside the bottle is broken and you cannot use the pump to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, I only need a little to cover the whole face!</li>
            <li> Skin becomes soft after only a few uses and overall is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I usually only have to push the bottom up when I first start a new bottle or when it is almost out.  </li>
            <li> My doctor actually sold me my first container of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But I think it probably works better on dry skin or dry climates.</li>
            <li> I have recently been applying only this moisturizer without the initial serum or toner and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great disappointment.</li>
            <li> Vivete is cheaper and seems to do the job so far, I have no allergic reactions to their products.</li>
            <li> a representative from Amazon had called me and told me that the pump does not have a tube attached and it just worked on a pumping action.</li>
            <li> After about a minute of applying you can literally lightly rub your face and all the dead skin</li>
            <li> i have finally purchased the whole line...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m 52 yrs old...</li>
            <li> I found out today that the only way to get the product out of the container is to tap the end of it gently against your palm.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and since the replenish cream works so well for me</li>
            <li> I ran out for a short time and tried to use up another moisturizer, but really noticed the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> so i will probably not know that i need to reorder until i completely run out.</li>
            <li> The top cannot be unscrewed so I am left with an almost full bottle of product and unable to use it or return it for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had the same problem with the pump not working properly when I tried to use my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I live not having to put on a separate sunscreen daily.</li>
            <li> They definetly need a different container.&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to use only 2 pumps for the whole face</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars because it is more expensive than drug-store brands, but not as much as if I bought it from the dermatologist office.  </li>
            <li> I am on my fifth bottle and although I love the product, the pump dispenser sucks!</li>
            <li> Push the pump down, then using your finger or some other device (I use my toothbrush handle) push the interior white plastic bottom up towards the pump which pushes the lotion up towards the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Vivite one product at a time as old products run out, since a laser procedure left my face with blotchy areas of melasma.  </li>
            <li> Face feels taunt and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would warn anyone who may buy this product is that, if you have a new bottle and it pumps out the product then later on nothing would pump, please do not unscrew the pump.</li>
            <li> this new product has a pump and the bottle is not clear.  </li>
            <li> My face is never dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, is only slightly greasy when first applied, then that goes away.</li>
            <li> Plus other ingredients that help keep my skin clear, but protected.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Aveeno sunscreen when I need something milder.</li>
            <li> The package can be hard to use at first, but once it starts pumping you do not lose any of the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is real.</li>
            <li> it was no cost to return it, just a hassle to buy a product and think it is a good deal and then be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> EXCEPT that the sun protection it provides does not last for very long.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get red spots or irritations from other facial products but have never had a problem with Vivite.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time - you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s, and Vivite has reduced occasional minor adult acne to non-existent.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily feeling, nor does it feel dry.</li>
            <li> I needed a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t so oily and that also doubled as a moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will apply my loose powder and my face will still be flaky.</li>
            <li> If I accidentally rub my face, I notice that it produces little white chunks of the lotion.</li>
            <li> The directions say to reapply &amp;#34;at least every 2 hours&amp;#34; - and it really is necessary, especially if you spend time outdoors.  </li>
            <li> I only knew about it from my dermatologists after mentioning to her the trouble I have with the pump on this product and that is when she informed me that all I need to do is tap it at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This small tube last very long.</li>
            <li> This one lasts about 5-6 months because I use only a small amount each day.  </li>
            <li> I have to leave it upside down for it will not pump out.</li>
            <li> has made my skin smoother, with less blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with Vivite, there&#x27;s no way to open up the bottle to put the lotion in a different container.</li>
            <li> Less break outs from clogged pores and fresher look.</li>
            <li> Some moisturizers will be thick and creamy but will still leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> It feels a little oily when it goes on but soon absorbs in.</li>
            <li> a few days or so... know others who use it..</li>
            <li> I adore this product and use it everyday and always will.  </li>
            <li> Regardless it was a waste of money, because I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> It is anything but heavy on the face .</li>
            <li> : the pump is very bad, at the beginning seems ok, then when air is inside the bottle you need to make an effort to pump it out.</li>
            <li> This is extremely irritating especially for such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> It has very little scent which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is heavy and thick for me.</li>
            <li> I just now tried to use this product and either it was empty to start with or the pump is broken.  </li>
            <li> I use all vivite products :  I have used this for the past year and have found a difference</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s very expensive; however, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Like other customers, I feel the pump on this bottle is ridiculously bad.</li>
            <li> I have terrible adult acne, and this product does not cause outbreaks, with my acne medications</li>
            <li> Every one of the pumps breaks after using them one to two times, and you have to put your finger in it to get it out which is beyond frustrating!</li>
            <li> While I like the product, it is difficult to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it was just disappointing</li>
            <li> Frustrating!!</li>
            <li> Too bad this product hss been discontined...</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and protects from sun rays but keep it away from your lips (or from around them) because the cream tastes terrible,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cool, soft, gentle, revitalizing, and effective on the skin.  You need but one squirt for all day moisture and protection.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It keeps my skin hydrated and it has sun screen and the exfoliation is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Vivite one product at a time as old products run out, since a laser procedure left my face with blotchy areas of melasma.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the Vivite and protecting my face from the sun the melasma is fading, but unfortunately not gone.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product as it was recommended to me by my Dermatologists four/five months ago.  This small tube last very long. It is not bad for the price at all. I paid $49.00 for this product at my dermatologists office. I got a better saving ordering it in Amazon.  Also, with this product you only need a peasize to cover the entire face.  It is a great moisturizer for the skin to keep it soft and younger looking.  I use it daily especially during the day.    FYI - The only thing I would warn anyone who may buy this product is that, if you have a new bottle and it pumps out the product then later on nothing would pump, please do not unscrew the pump. Tap the bottom of the bottle first then you can pump the product. Believe me, I learn the hardway. I remember not seeing any instructions about the bottle itself. I only knew about it from my dermatologists after mentioning to her the trouble I have with the pump on this product and that is when she informed me that all I need to do is tap it at the bottom.</li>
            <li> My wife and I switched to Vivete products at our dermatologist when the price of SkinCeuticals became to high. Vivete is cheaper and seems to do the job so far, I have no allergic reactions to their products. Like other customers, I feel the pump on this bottle is ridiculously bad. They should just have a cap on the bottle and be done with it, it would enable them to sell it cheaper anyway. It is a good daily face lotion, has SPF 30 sunscreen included, seems to do a good job on fine lines. No scent or color, which I prefer anyway. I was surprised to find on Amazon, saved me the 30 minute drive each way to the dermatologist, and the price was good.</li>
            <li> The product is FANTASTIC! I am on my fifth bottle and although I love the product, the pump dispenser sucks! Every one of the pumps breaks after using them one to two times, and you have to put your finger in it to get it out which is beyond frustrating! I wish they would spend a couple cents and get quality bottles for this awesome product. I will stop using it does not change.</li>
            <li> I have tried several moisturizers and this is the only one to work for me. Some moisturizers will be thick and creamy but will still leave my face dry. I will apply my loose powder and my face will still be flaky. This one works. My face is never dry or greasy. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This product goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave me with too much of a shine throughout the day. I would say it is okay overall, but my main problem with it is that if I use a serum prior to applying this moisturizer, I noticed that it chunks up throughout the day. If I accidentally rub my face, I notice that it produces little white chunks of the lotion. I have recently been applying only this moisturizer without the initial serum or toner and it works just fine. I will not continue using the product because of this reason though. I really like to apply my serum beforehand. This product does make my nose a bit oily though, but I do have combination skin. Very oily nose area and the rest of my face dries up easily. So maybe the oily nose area is specific to my skin type. I think it is an okay product. I love their night cream though - my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love all Vivite products... this is one of my GO TO face creams... very hydrating... but not heavy and doesnt lay on skin.. gives skin a soft smooth feel.. you will see a difference in the appearance of fine lines in just a short time... a few days or so... know others who use it..good for all different skin.. amazon is the most reasonable ive found. I love amazon!</li>
            <li> First purchased this product from a spa.  Paid full price.  Happy with the product, non-greasy, goes on nicely, SPF 30.  I felt like using this product along with the nightly moisturizer has made my skin smoother, with less blemishes.  One bottle lasted me almost 6 months.  Purchased off of Amazon for a much more reasonable price.  Will not be buying from the spa again!</li>
            <li> While I like the product, it is difficult to get out of the container. a representative from Amazon had called me and told me that the pump does not have a tube attached and it just worked on a pumping action. that hasn&#x27;t been the case for me.I  can pump it 30 times and not have  results. I guess I will have to throw it away when the q [[ASIN:B001CSOZU0 Vivite Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 30 1.7 fl oz (50 ml)]]tip no longer reaches the moisturizer in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly in perfect condition from what I can see. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the price was great &amp; I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it. I would use this Vendor again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Use it over the Vivite daily serum. Face feels taunt and soft at the same time. I am an outdoors person and the protection from the sun is greatly needed.</li>
            <li> The product is great, leaves your skin with a dew all day long. Which may not be convenient under make up, seems to me my make up runs, but I needed the extra moisture during winter. Skin becomes soft after only a few uses and overall is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the pump is very bad, at the beginning seems ok, then when air is inside the bottle you need to make an effort to pump it out. They definetly need a different container.&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to use only 2 pumps for the whole face I use more than this to cover all the spots.&lt;br /&gt;Small con: if you have never used glicolic acid it stings a bit your face, I touched my eyes after I touched my face and stinged my eyes, so try to be careful not to get it inside the eyes or close to them.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is great for winter days when skin is super dry, I won&#x27;t use it in summer because is too much dew in the skin during humid summers, but overall is very good and I will recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 38 and break up once in a while, this lotion doesn&#x27;t make you break up more at all, is just pure moisture. But I think it probably works better on dry skin or dry climates.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  My skin has never looked better.  After about a minute of applying you can literally lightly rub your face and all the dead skin sloughs right off.  This cream leaves your skin smooth, exfoliated, moisturized and protected with SPF 30 sunscreen.  What&#x27;s not to like, it does everying in one fabulous product.  I adore this product and use it everyday and always will.  Thank you Amazon for the great service and price.</li>
            <li> i have finally purchased the whole line...i rarely ever review items..but havt to tell you that i love this line...skin is fantastic....even after 43 years of abuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years now - has SPF 30 and is a great moisturizer.  I tend to get red spots or irritations from other facial products but have never had a problem with Vivite.  It also lasts a long time - you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it each time.</li>
            <li> Product does not smell strongly of sunscreen.  I have terrible adult acne, and this product does not cause outbreaks, with my acne medications, I tend to burn easily, so I needed a better daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 because it not only moisturizes my skin but it protects my skin with the SPF 30.  First i cleanse my face then i spray on epionce balance toner then the moisturizer.  It goes along way and you really don&#x27;t need to use so much</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product - EXCEPT that the sun protection it provides does not last for very long.  The directions say to reapply &amp;#34;at least every 2 hours&amp;#34; - and it really is necessary, especially if you spend time outdoors.  I now use this product solely for incidental sun exposure days - days when I don&#x27;t plan on getting more than a couple of minutes of sun exposure at a time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have been using this for over 2 years and have found it to be one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.  It&#x27;s a little oily but I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m 52 yrs old...I live not having to put on a separate sunscreen daily.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s very expensive; however, a little goes a long way.  I buy it when I feel affluent and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product from Amazon, and I could not get the product to flow. I wrote a review downgrading the container, and I returned the product to Amazon.  I found out today that the only way to get the product out of the container is to tap the end of it gently against your palm.  This will allow the product to replace the air bubble inside.  There is no physical pump stem with this product.  It works under air pressure.  If you try the tapping method, it will work flawlessly.  Also, this is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Loved it even more than the night moisturizer.  Applies smoothly with excellent coverage.  I strongly recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in apparently good shape; however, the dispenser inside the bottle is broken and you cannot use the pump to get the product out.  This is extremely irritating especially for such an expensive product.  I love the Vivite products.........but I won&#x27;t buy them from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this line.  My face likes it too.  When I consistently use the products of it, my skin clears and pores shrink....not changing anytime soon.</li>
            <li> My doctor actually sold me my first container of this moisturizer. I have rosacea and dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily feeling, nor does it feel dry. It is exactly what I need in a moisturizer. It also has sunscreen in it so I don&#x27;t have to layer a sunscreen on top of the moisturizer. It has very little scent which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have used Vivite Replenish Hydrating Cream for years but I needed a SPF for sun protection.  I have sensitive skin and since the replenish cream works so well for me, I decided to try VIVITE DAILY FACIAL SPF30.  Works great with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product lasts me almost a year. I am in my third month of using it and the pump dispenser has stopped dispensing any of the lotion!! The top cannot be unscrewed so I am left with an almost full bottle of product and unable to use it or return it for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I would really expect some consideration, as with this type of pump, this is not an uncommon occurrence! It is, however enough for me to never purchase this product again online. If I had bought it at the Spa where it was first sold to me, I would be able to exchange it. Lesson learned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patti Reich</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. Occasionally, I try something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but I never see equal or better results. I highly recommend this product to anyone battling the signs of aging. It can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer and I found it here for a much better price than in their office. I have pretty normal skin, but don&#x27;t like a lot of greasy stuff on my face, but this is the perfect consistency to wear under foundation and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all. And it has sunscreen in it - which is a great bonus as well!</li>
            <li> Product as described. A very light weight moisturizer with sunscreen.  Excellent</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer that has it all and works very well for my skin.  I am 47 and I am fanatical about good skin care.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years.  YOu don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it will last over  30 days...probably over 60 or more, depending on how you apply it.  It absorbs well, is only slightly greasy when first applied, then that goes away. I liked that it has a retinol product in it and do notice the texture of my skin is much better when I use this product.  I ran out for a short time and tried to use up another moisturizer, but really noticed the difference between the two.  I also like that it has a 30SPF.  The packaging is nice in that you can see how much you have left!!  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the way it smells.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but I would prefer no scent or a very light one.  This has a chemical&#x27;ish scent, but it does dissipate very quickly and it isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li> This daily moisturizer is not the best for dry skin but it would be fine for normal skin.  A little pricey.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I needed a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t so oily and that also doubled as a moisturizer for my dry skin. It keeps my skin looking moist and fresh throughout the day and that&#x27;s rare considering that most day time products I use require several applications to keep my skin from drying out again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...why did they discontinue?!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and perfect for under makeup! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is real. This product has a sweet flowery scent. The one I purchased from a dermatologist doesn&#x27;t. I question it. I don&#x27;t know if the scent changes over time &amp; that&#x27;s why it smells different.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product hss been discontined...</li>
            <li> I really like the contents but after about two uses, the pump quit functioning.  I had to get my husband to tear the top off to be able to use the product.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all-in-one facial moisturizer and this one did the trick. Now that I&#x27;m 30 my skin isn&#x27;t very oily anymore and needed a little more moisture without the heaviness. I may be 30 but I&#x27;ll still breakout. Goes on light and feels great. The SPF is also a must.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product. I have to leave it upside down for it will not pump out. Great disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this product line. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to really take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> The pump does not work.I wish I could tell also how much is left in the bottle-I bought one at a spa and liked the actual product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer, others had said the pump giver trouble, which it does , but someone had written bang it on the side and that really works, so for me this was a great buy..!</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for about a year and love it.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever switching brands.  I wish I could afford their whole line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day for about 3 years. Of all the low and high end brands, this is by far the best. The SPF 30 is very good protection from sun damage. The moisturizer itself is light and absorbs well without a greasy feeling. It&#x27;s perfect for under makeup. It took about a month before I saw a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I do look more youthful. I have sensitive skin and this works beautifully. I use 2 pumps a day, but I apply liberally. I use this every day, 2 pumps a day and 1 bottle lasts about 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not open the bottle as the packaging is airtight. Just keep pumping until the product dispenses. If it stops dispensing, then tap the bottle to get the product to settle, then keep pumping until it starts again.</li>
            <li> I love vivite products. I have struggled with the pump on this product. It sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t. Frustrating!!</li>
            <li> I had used this product before. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It feels a little oily when it goes on but soon absorbs in. Love the fact that it has SPF 30.  I would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Plus other ingredients that help keep my skin clear, but protected.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Aveeno sunscreen when I need something milder.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion promptly.  However, no matter how much I pump the top, no lotion will come out.  I am returning this product immediately.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and protects from sun rays but keep it away from your lips (or from around them) because the cream tastes terrible,</li>
            <li> Good product. Gives you immediate results by diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Vivite is the Cadillac of skin care.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I only need a little to cover the whole face! Goes on smooth, feels great, not sticky, or thick or dry like others, not hard to spread on your face and it is a great moisturizer to boot!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product but wish the delivery system was different. It is unreliable.</li>
            <li> A great facial moisturizer with SPF</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, knowing that people had had issues with the pump not working.  When it arrived, sure enough the pump was not working ;-(  I called the number on the bottle to see if they could help, but they insisted that I contact the Amazon dealer, since they said they only sold the product to doctor offices.  I prepared my package for return, but then I re-read the comments and saw the review that explained to tap the bottom of the bottle.  I did just that and it started to flow!  I look forward to using the product now ;-)</li>
            <li> The container was full but the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t work. Unfortunately, with Vivite, there&#x27;s no way to open up the bottle to put the lotion in a different container. My guess is the vendor realized this before they sold it on Amazon. I love this product but I feel as though I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face. This moisturizer is heavy and thick for me. It awesome but just not for me. I am still searching for the write moisturizer that is right for me.</li>
            <li> Great light moisturizer with 30 spf. I use it in the am, after the Vivite serum. Great under mineral powder makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the contents, but two out of three containers refused to give up the product after the first use.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It&#x27;s too much of a problem to return the product and get a refund or a new container.</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my skin hydrated,smooth and protected from the sun. I just love it.  And reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> This product replaced MD Forte.  Great product but I like the MD Forte packaging better.  It was in a tube and you knew when you are running low.  this new product has a pump and the bottle is not clear.  so i will probably not know that i need to reorder until i completely run out.</li>
            <li> This every morning, applied after Daily Antioxidant Serum, has made a nice difference in the texture and health of my skin.  I am in my late 40s, and Vivite has reduced occasional minor adult acne to non-existent.  I use the night cream as well,  which has no SPF, as recommended by the dermatologist.  Gave 4 stars because it is more expensive than drug-store brands, but not as much as if I bought it from the dermatologist office.  Also, certain products in this line have a bit of an odor, but I got used to that.  This one lasts about 5-6 months because I use only a small amount each day.  Over the course of a year, Vivite products are costly up front, but lasts quite a while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> A great product and it lasts for months!  glycolic acid AND sunscreen?  Talk about multitasking!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase this forever</li>
            <li> I just now tried to use this product and either it was empty to start with or the pump is broken.  Regardless it was a waste of money, because I can&#x27;t use it.  When you can use the product, it is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Really works, skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t flake like it use to. Less break outs from clogged pores and fresher look.</li>
            <li> One step to sun protection and moisturizer.  The package can be hard to use at first, but once it starts pumping you do not lose any of the product.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Vivite products. The Daily Moisture works well for me. I have been using it for about 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> I have had the same problem with the pump not working properly when I tried to use my first bottle. I figured out a way to get it to work and I hope it will help others. I am currently on my fourth pump problem-free bottle. If the pressure is lost and nothing comes out when you pump it, remove the silver cap on the bottom of the bottle. This cap pops off easily. Push the pump down, then using your finger or some other device (I use my toothbrush handle) push the interior white plastic bottom up towards the pump which pushes the lotion up towards the top. Push it until it seems like it won&#x27;t go any further. This gets rid of any air pockets in the lotion. The lotion should pump out now. I always store it upside-down so that the lotion stays at the top of the bottle and no air pockets are created. I usually only have to push the bottom up when I first start a new bottle or when it is almost out.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> use this lotion everyday and was excited it was sold on your site with a good savings.  order arrived and first bottle i took out would not pump and had to be returned.  it was no cost to return it, just a hassle to buy a product and think it is a good deal and then be disappointed.  makes me think the reason the price is lower is because it is defective or rejected products on the quality line.  The other bottle was ok but it was just disappointing and now i will look for a different source to purchase.</li>
            <li> I use all vivite products :  I have used this for the past year and have found a difference</li>
            <li> I just love this cream and it&#x27;s price ! It is anything but heavy on the face . Not greasy and absorbs fast . SPF 30 if perfect protection. I use it every morning under foundation . very recommended - I will keep purchase it !</li>
            <li> Perfect day moisturizer for me, as it has SPF and glycolic acid.  Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like many other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Extremely good moisturizer that works beautifully under make-up. Lovely and light, no scent. My skin is extremely sensitive, and many cosmetics cause breakouts (still -- I am well into my 50s),but if I put this on first, my skin stays clear, no matter what products I use over it. The eye cream is the best I have ever used. For $10 you can purchase the eye cream in the Vivite travel kit on this site. Best value in the world --</li>
            <li> Again replacing MD-Forte and has SPF so its a good value and works with out a hitch. Better than anything you can get in the stores ladies.</li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews about the pump being troublesome but I bought it anyway (as I love all of their cream and exfoliating cleanser). Guess what? the pump did not work! I tried tapping the bottom with my finger, with my palm, tapping on the countertop, nothing came out of the pump. I pumped it like 50x!!! nothing. so I&#x27;m getting a refund.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GOOD, I LOVE IT UNDER MAKEUP...I TRY TO USE IT SPARINGLY, BECAUSE OF THE COST.</li>
