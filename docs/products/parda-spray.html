            <li>Product was authentic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Love</li>
            <li>Two if you are into strong smells....</li>
            <li>TOO STRONG AND OVER-POWERING.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS</li>
            <li>Recommended for people who like very rich, sweet and long-lasting essences.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does wear off quite quickly and has a more &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and so glad I did as my savings were worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love this light, fresh, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>her new favorite!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the same, doesn&#x27;t smell good; and it burns my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>The sample I was first introduced to was a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>I received a flyer in a local ad and was amazed by this scent, truly lovely.</li>
            <li>I felt like I fell into a vat of candy floss when I first sprayed it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Eau de Toilette has a very robust scent.</li>
            <li>I had read it also had a caramel smell, but I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>Thank you for getting this to me really fast.</li>
            <li>The scent is much sweeter than the &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; sample in the magazine.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, only one spray is really necessary...</li>
            <li>My new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my daughter.......</li>
            <li>All we can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>It is sweet and smells a little of vanilla and powder.</li>

            <li> This Eau de Toilette has a very robust scent. It is sweet and smells a little of vanilla and powder. I had read it also had a caramel smell, but I can&#x27;t really tell. The scent is strong, only one spray is really necessary... Two if you are into strong smells.... Which makes it a great value.

            <li> TOO STRONG AND OVER-POWERING.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS LIKE KMS HAIR GEL (PRUNES)....I DON&#x27;T KNOW, THE ORIGINAL PRADA CANDY IS GREAT THIS IS NOT AND I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE BUT NO.</li>
            <li> I  wasn&#x27;t please with the fragrance.  The sample I was first introduced to was a whole lot better.  Not sure why..</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell of my skin in Prada Candy Eau de Toilette. I also love this light, fresh, sweet scent. The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. However, I do plan to purchase it again and I get a better deal on Amazon than I do in the retail department stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck purchasing fragrances through Amazon. But this did not smell good. I usually get the Prada Candy Parfum, so thought I would try this. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same, doesn&#x27;t smell good; and it burns my eyes and nose. Can&#x27;t return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with this fragrance that I can&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> I received a flyer in a local ad and was amazed by this scent, truly lovely. I decided to check Amazon and so glad I did as my savings were worth it.</li>
            <li> Did not have the same sent as in the department store</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its scent is perfect for a night out, Guys if your looking to buy a lady friend a perfume or just a friend. Then I surely recommend this one. Also the seller shipped the product in a timely manner. Would recommend buying from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Exallent, got it on time.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like it does in the store. I spent $70 on something I&#x27;m not going to use now. Very, very upsetting!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift to my granddaughter, who was ecstatic when she opened the gift.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised.  Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this Eau de Toilette from Prada, it has a great scent.  Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This met my expectations and the price was cheaper than anyone else. Love this perfume have used another for years wanted to try this and I am so happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> My girl loves its so u win.</li>
            <li> The scent is much sweeter than the &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; sample in the magazine. I felt like I fell into a vat of candy floss when I first sprayed it on.&lt;br /&gt;It does wear off quite quickly and has a more &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; vanilla smell after a couple of hours. My husband thought I smelled like &#x27;Little old lady&amp;#34; powder smell.</li>
            <li> My border arrived the next day!  Product was authentic.  I am very pleased with my order.</li>
