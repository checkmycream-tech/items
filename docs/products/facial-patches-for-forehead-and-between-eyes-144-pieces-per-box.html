            <li>This is excellent to use with the Frownies products.</li>

            <li>And omg it was amazing! !!</li>

            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s done a good job of hydrating my &amp;#34;frownies.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s also good for spraying on your face to keep skin moist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good in-the-middle-of-the-day hydrator after a moisturizer has been put on in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to the frownies so glad I added this to my order..</li>
            <li>Love frownies!</li>
            <li>I bought it on a suggestion and found that it saved me on many trips!</li>
            <li>but it is a lot better than botox!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>It was pricey in my opinion, but it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice spray to go with frownies eye gels, and I use it as a cleanser</li>
            <li>I use the rose water as a moistener for my Frownies.</li>
            <li>It helps them adhere and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I am a subscriber to Birchbox and in one of their boxes, I received the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray.  </li>
            <li>cannot wait to tell my piercer about the Frownies Rose Hydrator Spray product.</li>
            <li>I like the feel and smell of this rose water.  </li>
            <li>I liked it with the frownies.</li>
            <li>Best products out there for natural wrinkle reduction!</li>
            <li>OMG I love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>Better to get rose water and add a bit of glycerin, shake well &amp; spray.</li>
            <li>Also has a lovely tea rose smell.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and noce in my face, I spray it on after a hot day working in the garden and it feels awesome.  </li>
            <li>I try it under makeup and the makeup goes in very smoothly (after it dries of course).</li>
            <li>Very light and so,</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I Love Frownies.</li>
            <li>Lovely stuff</li>
            <li>refreshing, quality priced.</li>
            <li>This hydrator works much better.  </li>
            <li>Just OK...</li>
            <li>This product has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li>so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>You can really smell the rose in this rose water.  </li>
            <li>This is a rosewater spray that feels good when misted onto the face directly - I would give it zero credit for helping with paper tape activation, but it is light, refreshing and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Right away I saw the lines go away!!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, goes on cool, but is nothing really special.</li>
            <li>but it needs more power which I discovered on my own thanks</li>
            <li>It does make a difference in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Water would do fine for the Frownies--but I did not like Frownies.</li>
            <li>so I gently cleaned them with the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray.</li>
            <li>Works alright but gave me a better idea that works a million times better thanks for the idea</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice natural feeling spray for your face</li>
            <li>These product really do discourage lines from becoming deeper as you sleep.</li>
            <li>The spray should smell of roses as it&#x27;s rose water and this particular one smells old.</li>
            <li>and it arrived right onTime, nonproblems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little product!</li>
            <li>I would never spend $9 on this again, but the bottle is useful from the first time and id have no idea where to buy a bottle like this.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product if u have small likes</li>
            <li>I was also very disapointed in the fragrance of the product.</li>
            <li>I gently sprayed the tip of a Q-Tip with the product and then cleansed the piercings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipment from seller.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessary to use, but does feel and smell nice for extra pampering.</li>
            <li>I try so many products hoping to find the one that makes my normal to dry skin feel refreshed and moist</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has piercings.</li>
            <li>Just be clear about the realistic use of the spray...</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased because usually I will put chamomile tea bags on my piercings when they become irritated and swollen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Roses and Rose Waters are known for their healing properties such as calming down irritated skin, moisturizing dry skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second box of frowns and at first I used only water to moisten them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product before from another source and amazon as well, so I was surprised when I received this frownies spray and noticed immediately that it&#x27;s not the same product.</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend the Frownies product at all (see my Frownies review for the reasons), but if you are looking for a spritzer to refresh your face, this one does the trick and the bottle is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I only use it with the frowns, not as a general hydrator.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The skin around the dermals were red, swollen, and dry</li>
            <li> frownies would,nt stick for long</li>
            <li> Within a few hours, the skin around my dermals were no longer red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I used it to wet Frownies, but now just use the bottle for water.  </li>
            <li> someone else said, now I use this product for the spray bottle with water to wet frownies.</li>
            <li> , i would put moisturizer on before i ever used this to wet frownies, during using this to wet frownies, and after now that i use water on frownies again.  </li>
            <li> : if you use frownies, get some sort of spray bottle to wet them: this one if you want to try this.</li>
            <li> I received this product as expected, however I can&#x27;t review it because I didn&#x27;t receive the frownies that I ordered, and there is no use for this without that.</li>
            <li> Used it on flight as recommended and have to say my skin wasn&#x27;t dry or tight or as tired looking as tired as i felt:)</li>
            <li> at all I gave up after a few tries and threw it all away.</li>
            <li> But this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - buy Frownies instead.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Frownies really work for breaking bad habits of knitting your brows together.</li>
            <li> Also works well for removing those last traces of make-up cleansers and cold creams often miss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted now.</li>

            <li> Feels smooth and noce in my face, I spray it on after a hot day working in the garden and it feels awesome.  I try it under makeup and the makeup goes in very smoothly (after it dries of course).</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I Love Frownies. Use them religiously every night.  And they work.     But this product is a waste of money. You can go out and buy any brand of toner to get the same results. Cleaner face.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - buy Frownies instead.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, goes on cool, but is nothing really special. Its convenient, to spray on bk of frownies, instead of wetting it yourself, i think that&#x27;s the biggest advantage.</li>
            <li> This product burned my under-eyes. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Love frownies! Used it on flight as recommended and have to say my skin wasn&#x27;t dry or tight or as tired looking as tired as i felt:)</li>
            <li> This is excellent to use with the Frownies products.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I bought it on a suggestion and found that it saved me on many trips!</li>
            <li> Thanks! Lovely stuff and it arrived right onTime, nonproblems.</li>
            <li> This is a rosewater spray that feels good when misted onto the face directly - I would give it zero credit for helping with paper tape activation, but it is light, refreshing and smells nice. Just be clear about the realistic use of the spray...its water with some vitamins and rosewater scenting...not a miracle.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell of this product. Better to get rose water and add a bit of glycerin, shake well &amp; spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray to use in conjunction with the Frownies product. It was pricey in my opinion, but it does smell nice. I do NOT recommend the Frownies product at all (see my Frownies review for the reasons), but if you are looking for a spritzer to refresh your face, this one does the trick and the bottle is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this with the frownies it is a temporary fix but it is a lot better than botox! You can also use it alone just spray over the face and it softens your face like rainwater.</li>
            <li> This is a nice spray to go with frownies eye gels, and I use it as a cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice natural feeling spray for your face however it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Frownies really work for breaking bad habits of knitting your brows together. It does make a difference in the appearance of fine lines. This spray makes the frownies easier to apply as it perfectly wets the adhesive. Also has a lovely tea rose smell.</li>
            <li> refreshing, quality priced. great for hydrating face in the indoor heat of winter</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s done a good job of hydrating my &amp;#34;frownies.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
            <li> this is everything it promised to be!!!!  my eyes are lifted and look so much younger!!!!  please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product to use to apply frownies.  The frownies stay on all night no matter how restless I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m on my second box of frowns and at first I used only water to moisten them.  This hydrator works much better.  I gave it four stars because I only use it with the frowns, not as a general hydrator.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this spray so I got it for her.</li>
            <li> The spray nossle did not work. I was also very disapointed in the fragrance of the product. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> All the Frownies  products are great.  I use the rose water as a moistener for my Frownies. It helps them adhere and has a nice smell.  Best products out there for natural wrinkle reduction!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the frownies so glad I added this to my order..</li>
            <li> Goes perfect with my frownies.  Smells great and does a great job of keeping frownies hydrated if they can be reused,</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin. Does a great job of securing the frownies to my face. Also works well for removing those last traces of make-up cleansers and cold creams often miss.</li>
            <li> I am a subscriber to Birchbox and in one of their boxes, I received the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray.  I didn&#x27;t use it with the Frownies Eye Gels but I used it for my piercings instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roses and Rose Waters are known for their healing properties such as calming down irritated skin, moisturizing dry skin, etc.  My micro-dermals had been irritated for several days.  The skin around the dermals were red, swollen, and dry so I gently cleaned them with the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray. Within a few hours, the skin around my dermals were no longer red and irritated.

            <li> Just OK... Water would do fine for the Frownies--but I did not like Frownies. Fast shipment from seller.</li>
            <li> I use this mist to adhere the Frownies between my brows.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell of this rose water.  I used it to wet Frownies, but now just use the bottle for water.  It isn&#x27;t necessary to use, but does feel and smell nice for extra pampering.</li>

            <li> This product has a lovely scent. I use it to moisten the Frownies patches for between the eyes. These product really do discourage lines from becoming deeper as you sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it for the gel strips.  It helps keep them moist so you can use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s also good for spraying on your face to keep skin moist.</li>
            <li> I liked it with the frownies.</li>
            <li> I just got this to see what it was/to use with frownies patches because my pillow makes me wake up with a giant red crease between my eyebrows (which frownies solves).&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else said, now I use this product for the spray bottle with water to wet frownies. I personally found the smell of this liquid gross, and debated just dumping it to fill with water. It may or may not have effects on the skin, i would put moisturizer on before i ever used this to wet frownies, during using this to wet frownies, and after now that i use water on frownies again.  I never noticed a change in anything where i used this product while it was the independent variable.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: if you use frownies, get some sort of spray bottle to wet them: this one if you want to try this. I would never spend $9 on this again, but the bottle is useful from the first time and id have no idea where to buy a bottle like this.</li>
            <li> You can really smell the rose in this rose water.  I bought it to use with the frownies patches and it works well with them.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a girl that does makeup tutorials on youtube. The way she described what it did was so incredible that I went on amazon and bought a pack.  And omg it was amazing! !! Right away I saw the lines go away!! I&#x27;m addicted now. Its the safest way to take away lines. You need to try this!!</li>
            <li> This along with the frownies stickers don&#x27;t work well at all I gave up after a few tries and threw it all away.</li>
            <li> Works alright but gave me a better idea that works a million times better thanks for the idea it&#x27;s a good product if u have small likes but it needs more power which I discovered on my own thanks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t say much more than that. My skin feels great when I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought the spray to moisten the frownies that I purchased.  I&#x27;ve used it alone a couple of times and felt a tingle, and saw some skin hydration afterwards.  It&#x27;s a good in-the-middle-of-the-day hydrator after a moisturizer has been put on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I received this product as expected, however I can&#x27;t review it because I didn&#x27;t receive the frownies that I ordered, and there is no use for this without that.</li>
            <li> frownies would,nt stick for long</li>
            <li> OMG I love, love this product!  I try so many products hoping to find the one that makes my normal to dry skin feel refreshed and moist and I have found it with this spray!  Very light and so, so refreshing.  Will buy again and again.</li>
