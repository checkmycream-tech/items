    <ol>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Even though it came off the stick the loofah works wonderfully and I would recommend and purchase it again!!!</li>
            <li>After having used many products from Bed Bath and Beyond..this is the best.</li>
            <li>While the concept is good, the construction is lacking.</li>
            <li>This is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels so good on my back&lt;br /&gt;Product came wrapped and unused (thank</li>
            <li>I dont know what kind of luffa this came from</li>
            <li>and you have to go through an elaborate procedure to get any softness.  </li>
            <li>maybe it will have a better appreciation for it.</li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>The loofah is just ok.  </li>
            <li>They (I forgot) always do this-and this one is looooooong, never softens, and now has blck mold spots in many places on it......</li>
            <li>Mold spots formed on this very quickly hanging from a hook in my shower.</li>
            <li>Loofah is fine otherwise</li>
            <li>$5 max just go to the $1 store and by one and make your own for under $2 real rip off</li>
            <li>I have had problems reaching my back to take care of acne, and this is great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>cleaning instruction that came in it were good and will follow those for cleaning loofah products in the future.</li>
            <li>I really dont like to spend my money and not be satisfied.</li>
            <li>A true find.  </li>
            <li>haha :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my dead skin cells and oils laughed as they stayed just where they were.</li>
            <li>The picture gives me the sense the handle will separate right quick...</li>
            <li>When you have an itch, calm it and scratch it.  </li>
            <li>It was more akin to rubbing a smooth stone on my back.</li>
            <li>Anyways, my husband is happy and I&#x27;m happy, because I&#x27;m sick of buying these things after they break.</li>
            <li>Used it last night and it was great, it has a pretty big size, perfect to reach the back area,my back feels smoother now</li>
            <li>Pretty much, the only good thing I can say is the handle stays put.</li>
            <li>The stick broke free from the main loofah.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d think it is -- a chunk of loofah on a stick.  </li>
            <li>Loofah itself is good if you like harsh material (I like it).</li>
            <li>have tries tons of loofah brushes and hands down this one works and lasts the best.</li>
            <li>Love to feel clean and this just helps you exfoliate your skin in places you can&#x27;t get to with other loofahs...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s securely fastened together and she was pleasantly surprised at how large it was.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered the large ones with a long handle.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can find someone who wants to exfoliate the bejesus out of his/her flesh.  </li>
            <li>but I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>THe one I received has an unusual shape.</li>
            <li>ships fast, price and item description.</li>
            <li>Sturdy (very).</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough and it shipped as promised.  </li>
            <li>Since I have difficulty reaching back to wash my back this comes in so handy.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I figure it&#x27;ll last as long as the loofah does.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more important exfoliating my skin has become and I have used a few different things to accomplish this</li>
            <li>It works wonders and I highly recommend it for your use.</li>
            <li>Well, we live and learn.  </li>
            <li>Although stiff, it&#x27;s too smooth to exfoliate as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li>The handle is INSIDE the loofa part (which is longer than usual), so I guess it is staying better.  </li>
            <li>If I have to pour boiling water over it and hot water in the tub isnt enough to soften it that  tells me it was chemically treated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, as I pulled the thing out of the bleach water, the stick came out, restoring the concrete loofah to its natural state, lying in wait to decorticate some passing animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I bought this Loofah Back Brush with Large 8\\&quot; Loofah.  </li>
            <li>Now,  loofahs are plants that can naturally range in suppleness, but this one is way off the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should be flat - would be much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li>I soaked the thing in very hot chlorine bleach water for half an hour.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and strong and appears to be a solid glue job, which is hard to find in these products.</li>
            <li>the first day, even submerged in hot water for half an hour, the loofah was hard as concrete.  </li>
            <li>single people have dirty backs&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not if they own one of these!</li>
            <li>The loofakeeps sliding off of the stick, which kind of makes it pointless to reach those hard to reach places on your back</li>

            <li> a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I  plead total ignorance.  I didn&#x27;t consult with anyone as I shouldd have.  I erroneously a loofah was similar to a sponge which becomes soft when wet.  Well, I discovered it stays hard as a rock and you have to go through an elaborate procedure to get any softness.  Well, we live and learn.  Maybe I can find someone who wants to exfoliate the bejesus out of his/her flesh.  Not much invested - no harm done.</li>
            <li> There are other reviews that praise the fact the loofah stays glued to the stick. Mine arrived seemingly never glued to the stick. It came off within seconds of taking it out of the box. I&#x27;m not sure if they just forgot to glue mine on or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not worth the time for me to do a return and pay for return shipping for a product that was not that expensive. I ended up just using the loofah without the stick and found one that worked for my back in the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning instruction that came in it were good and will follow those for cleaning loofah products in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product!! After having used many products from Bed Bath and Beyond..this is the best.</li>
            <li> The loofakeeps sliding off of the stick, which kind of makes it pointless to reach those hard to reach places on your back</li>
            <li> You know how the handles always come off of these things.  It has been a couple of months and the handle hasn&#x27;t come off.  The handle is INSIDE the loofa part (which is longer than usual), so I guess it is staying better.  Anyways, my husband is happy and I&#x27;m happy, because I&#x27;m sick of buying these things after they break.</li>
            <li> Even though it came off the stick the loofah works wonderfully and I would recommend and purchase it again!!!</li>
            <li> its just a $1 loofah with a 50 cent piece of wood should be $5 max just go to the $1 store and by one and make your own for under $2 real rip off</li>
            <li> I dont know what kind of luffa this came from but I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the product. THe one I received has an unusual shape. I really dont like to spend my money and not be satisfied. This one is hard and wont soften. If I have to pour boiling water over it and hot water in the tub isnt enough to soften it that  tells me it was chemically treated. I prefer a loofah over bath towels. THis loofah will be my garbage cans food maybe it will have a better appreciation for it. Afterall it is garbage!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d think it is -- a chunk of loofah on a stick.  I&#x27;ve got the version that has the big section of loofah with a handle that&#x27;s actually in the sponge itself, not the small one (which I think is a piece of loofah glued onto a wooden back and handle). So far so good, I figure it&#x27;ll last as long as the loofah does.</li>
            <li> Love to feel clean and this just helps you exfoliate your skin in places you can&#x27;t get to with other loofahs...</li>
            <li> While the concept is good, the construction is lacking. I&#x27;ve used it twice, and the handle came unglued from inside the Loofah. Now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Loofah itself is good if you like harsh material (I like it). The handle is round and difficult to hold, especially covered with soap. It should be flat - would be much easier to use.</li>
            <li> The handle came loose from the loofah on the second use.  Loofah is fine otherwise but without the handle I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought and bought and then bought again in the search for a brush or scrubbing cloth or SOMETHING to do the job.  This is a good thing.  The picture gives me the sense the handle will separate right quick...but no, it is well embedded... this is a find.  A true find.  I Love it and it outdoes any of the back brushes purchased in my hunt prior to finding this coolest of scratcher-scrubbers.</li>
            <li> When you have an itch, calm it and scratch it.  It works wonders and I highly recommend it for your use.</li>
            <li> I heard a comedian ask one time;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Do single people have dirty backs&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not if they own one of these! haha :-)</li>
            <li> have tries tons of loofah brushes and hands down this one works and lasts the best. Highly recommend this for daily use.</li>
            <li> Stiffer than I expecte, but seems to be breaking in somewhat.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more important exfoliating my skin has become and I have used a few different things to accomplish this but I don&#x27;t understand how people use these things for that purpose. I bought this to exfoliate my back and it is so stiff, I can&#x27;t use it. There is no flex or give to it. It is too hard so it can&#x27;t conform to your body, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Used it last night and it was great, it has a pretty big size, perfect to reach the back area,my back feels smoother now&lt;br /&gt;,one thing i noticed is that the stick is glued, i just hope that with time it does not come undone...im a guy by the way</li>
            <li> Since I have difficulty reaching back to wash my back this comes in so handy. And I use it on my legs and it gets the dead skin off...</li>
            <li> It just slides around, making it pretty useless for its purpose until you figure out some way to glue or tack it together</li>
            <li> The loofah is just ok.  Its scratchy, and hard.  No amount of water was going to soften this loofah!!  And once the soap, or body wash was on the loofah, nothing!!  No bubbles--nothing.  Infact, the soap or body wash doesn&#x27;t leave the loofah, it just stays there, nothing gets transferred to your back.  Pretty much, the only good thing I can say is the handle stays put.</li>
            <li> I use it to scrub my back everyday. I am glad I ordered the large ones with a long handle.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and strong and appears to be a solid glue job, which is hard to find in these products. Buy.</li>
            <li> Although stiff, it&#x27;s too smooth to exfoliate as much as I wanted. It was more akin to rubbing a smooth stone on my back. I&#x27;m sure my dead skin cells and oils laughed as they stayed just where they were.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would exfoliate my skin as I bathed and this is just a hard &amp;#34;sponge on a stick&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t quite exfoliate my skin the way I hoped.</li>
            <li> Mold spots formed on this very quickly hanging from a hook in my shower. They (I forgot) always do this-and this one is looooooong, never softens, and now has blck mold spots in many places on it......POSITIVES:ships fast, price and item description. Sturdy (very).</li>
            <li> I have had problems reaching my back to take care of acne, and this is great for exfoliation. Does require cleaning.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels so good on my back&lt;br /&gt;Product came wrapped and unused (thank goodness)&lt;br /&gt;Bought the product under $20 but I&#x27;m not sure how much they usually cost&lt;br /&gt;This is the 1st back brush I have ever bought and realized I have been missing out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I had a loofah back scrubber for ten years but it fell apart.  So I bought this Loofah Back Brush with Large 8\\&quot; Loofah.  It was cheap enough and it shipped as promised.  But it has a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, even submerged in hot water for half an hour, the loofah was hard as concrete.  I sometimes use Scotch Brite pads, but this is tough stuff.  Now,  loofahs are plants that can naturally range in suppleness, but this one is way off the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, even as it hung to dry, patches of black mildew appeared under the surface.  By the second day, the splotches had grown and spread.  I soaked the thing in very hot chlorine bleach water for half an hour.  It&#x27;s still very stiff, but nearly all the ugly black sooty stuff has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I pulled the thing out of the bleach water, the stick came out, restoring the concrete loofah to its natural state, lying in wait to decorticate some passing animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I wish I bought a brush.</li>
            <li> The stick broke free from the main loofah.  There wasn&#x27;t enough glue attached when it was built.  Threw out the handle and now just have a loofah :/</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter at Christmas because she&#x27;d had problems with other brands falling apart. Not this one. It&#x27;s securely fastened together and she was pleasantly surprised at how large it was.</li>
