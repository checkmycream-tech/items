    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love all the Blueberry products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great body wash, smells nice and cleans well. Free of parabens. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it really burns if it gets in your eyes, more so than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Make my skin soft. But like to the smell should be more good itÂ´s not smell awful but about 1 to 5 I give it 3.</li>
            <li> I like the Blueberries Hydrating Body Wash.  It is creamy, light and has a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the natural aspect of \\&quot;yes to\\&quot; products. The smell is great and not too strong. My whole family uses it. The yes to cucumber products are my other faves!</li>
            <li> See headline. Took me a week to figure out the smell! Despite the weird association, this body wash is mild and soft. I use it to cleanse and shave.</li>
            <li> This is really great for the skin. And it&#x27;s natural and isn&#x27;t tested on animals so that&#x27;s a plus omin my book!!!!</li>
            <li> It is ok. Nearly impossible to get out of the bottle. I have to take the cap off every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lowered my review from 5 stars to 2 due to continued frustration of the lid design. The container is impossible to use in the bath or shower. Why can&#x27;t the manufacturer invest a bit more money to provide a simple, managable cap? I find their current cap impossible to open in the bath/shower and struggle to not drop it while trying, so not to break the container, chip the tub, or break a toe. If I can find a comparable product from a manufacture who gives recognition to having a usable container, I&#x27;ll switch. For now, I&#x27;m looking for another container to transfer the soap into. This wash is Oh so very good!!! Having sensitive skin that reacts to allergies by becoming itchy, I went shopping for a gentle SLS free wash. This one lathers beautifully, rinses cleanly, and has a super wonderful fragrance. Not only is it much better than I expected based on reviews of other SLS free washes, it is much more pleasant to use than any of the nourishing body washes I&#x27;ve purchased from grocery stores, such as Dove, St Ives, etc. (seemingly all having SLS). The only disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t have a real flip top. The flip lid built into the screw on top is held in place with tape and does not popup for me. Because of the difficulty using the flip lid, I either do not completely close the flip lid or keep it shut and unscrew the top. Either way, it is a big inconveniece. Fortunately, the top of the bottle narrows to create a small spout, so pouring out the needed small amount of the lotion is not a problem.</li>
            <li> This smells so good -- not too strong, not too weak.  I&#x27;ve recently switched to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite body wash - it leaves my skin hydrating and the scent is very fresh. However, like previous reviewers have mentioned, the cap is poorly designed. It is easily breakable and when it works the wash comes out really slow. I wish they had used a pump design, otherwise a great product that I recommend.</li>
            <li> feels good, great scent</li>
            <li> Like the other Yes To line of products in this packaging, this body wash is difficult to use and get product out because of the top part of the dispenser. It uses a contemporary-looking snapping hinge, which can be difficult to open completely. I ended up taking the top part off because of how frustrating it is to get product out of the package. The product is great (inside).</li>
            <li> Not my most favorite of the Yes-To body washes (that honor goes to the [[ASIN:B003PF406M Yes To Carrots Shower Gel]]) but it shares the line&#x27;s commitment to natural ingredients and the reasonable pricing. The gel lathers up nicely, and I don&#x27;t have to use very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent has a mild but distinct note of blueberries (nice), but the reason I&#x27;m not crazy about this Yes-To product is that blueberry scent is mixed with lavender (or that&#x27;s how my nose reads it).  Which is a bit more feminine than I wanted, and while this is a natural body wash, lavender bath scents unfortunately remind me of the nasty mall-store bath gels that reek of synthetic perfumes-- you know the stores you walk by and you can still smell them a hundred feet later?  The scent is also reminiscent of your grandmother&#x27;s potpourri sachets...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, the container is opaque white instead of the clear bottles like the other Yes-To gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GF and I both use the same bath gels, and I&#x27;m sensitive to fake fragrances, so we look for natural products that are strong enough to get me clean, but not hard on her skin, and don&#x27;t smell excessively gender-specific-- I don&#x27;t want to smell like strawberries + candy and she doesn&#x27;t want to smell like musk + pine! This one isn&#x27;t as gender-neutral as the Yes-to-Carrots or Yes-to-Cucumbers, but the ultra-hydrating aspect works well in the mid-atlantic&#x27;s winter \\&quot;dry air\\&quot; season.  So I consider this a \\&quot;winter\\&quot; flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other criteria for me are: not be drying or harsh, and not have any of the cloyingly fake smells mainstream bath gels often have. This \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; matches my requirements, as do all the other Yes-To body-washes I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t experience any drying or irritation despite my skin generally being sensitive. I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their heavy carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice natural shower gel, but better for those who prefer a touch of a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; scent, or are addressing dry skin issues.uch of a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; scent, or are addressing dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My fave is the Yes to Carrots orange one. I would buy this again except its really hard to get the liquid out of the opening. My hand hurts squeezing the bottle. They definitely need to improve on this</li>
            <li> Gentle, relatively natural and benign ingredients, and seems to clean my skin without drying. However, the container is absolutely awful - as others have mentioned, the top doesn&#x27;t want to open all the way and in my efforts to force it to, I broke the top and had to simply let it be open and squeeze out product as needed (which is ok, as long as it doesn&#x27;t spill).  Definitely the worst container of any shower gel I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell like blueberries to me (which is ok); instead, it smells like lavender (which is not ok with me, but might be fine with others as long as they&#x27;re aware).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Smell Like Blueberries, more like mint which is okay, but it&#x27;s not blueberry.</li>
            <li> This has a light fruity scent mixed with a light lavender scent- real lavender, like French lavender- but its mild. The soap is a liquid cream so it runs out of the bottle easily but its not watery. It&#x27;s good for your skin with its ingredients but not bad for your health with some of the poisonous ingredients in other soaps</li>
            <li> It was a present for my son; he likes it a lot. Asked me when should I order another one for him. Soon!</li>
            <li> It smells good. However, I wish it would moisten my skin more.</li>
            <li> not crazy about the very strong scent</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I switched products to SLS free. This still cleanses great, you only need a small amount on your sponge or loofa! Great smell, and huge bottle. Gentle on the skin as well. My skin has been less dry since I got this one month ago.</li>
