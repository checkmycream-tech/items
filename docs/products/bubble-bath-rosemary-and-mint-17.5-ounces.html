            <li>I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I wan&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>The aroma is wonderful too.</li>
            <li>It is probably the best purchase I have ever made, period.</li>
            <li>Lots of suds and a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my wife and she was really happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got it.</li>
            <li>Great bubbly suds and great scent for when you need a bath to send your stress away.</li>
            <li>smells great.</li>
            <li>The amount of bubble is very good and the smell is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>just pleasant.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good, but thats about it.</li>
            <li>You could get something just as good anywhere else for way cheaper.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make good bubbles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing a rosemary bush all over your body, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be good for clearing your head, lifting your spirits, that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Nice bubble bath at a good price.</li>
            <li>Love this bubble bath!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Nice Scent.</li>
            <li>Dr Teal&#x27;s is a lot better and a good value.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice you might even use it yourself once or twice (be honest fellers, you love a bubble bath too.)</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get as many bubbles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get more when I run out of this bottle</li>
            <li>This is currently my favorite bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the combination of rosemary and mint</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This has a nice minty scent that filled the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>but it grows on you quickly, even the kids love it!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very clean.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, organic bubble bath which smells terrific and is incredibly soothing.</li>
            <li>not so strong that it burns or makes you cough though.</li>
            <li>Secondly, most, if not all, of the ingredients are organic (the first being organic aloe leaf juice - which is lovely).</li>
            <li>many disolve too quickly.</li>
            <li>And the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brand which makes great bubbles.</li>
            <li>It is cruelty free</li>
            <li>Kind of weak smell and not as many bubbles as really good bubble bath.</li>
            <li>She really likes to take lots of baths and she looks forward to it even more with this product.</li>
            <li>I really want to try more of this brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment about that, except that I love the smell, and THAT lifts my spirits!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Not too pungent, not too mild, but</li>
            <li>Fourth, and probably most important, is that it makes a lot of bubbles!</li>
            <li>After a long day of work, this bubble bath formula is a good complement to my bathing activity.</li>
            <li>she was on cloud nine, telling me that the bubble bath was &amp;#34;took the stress right away and made me relax instantly.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fragrance of this bubble bath and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves their bubble baths.</li>
            <li>Only takes an ounce or so to get great bubbles (and they last awhile).</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>very relaxing and soothing!</li>
            <li>First bubble bath I&#x27;ve used that still had bubbles when I let the water out of the tub.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of these.  </li>
            <li>Wish I would have purchased a couple the first time.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li>The scent is just strong enough to fill your room with this relaxing aroma.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and there&#x27;s really no criticism.  </li>
            <li>very bubbly</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell girly, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>She absolutely adored it and could not wait to fill up a tub and try the bubble bath out.  </li>
            <li>I found that with hot water, you get a lot of bubbles, but I usually use warm water-</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a husband who is tired of your wife smelling like flowers and/or bubble gum, I recommend this as a pleasantly scented alternative.</li>
            <li>This fragrance seems a little strong at first</li>
            <li>The smell packs a lovely little \\&quot;poke\\&quot;</li>
            <li>All natural as far as I can tell; works better than expected.</li>
            <li>This was my first deep steep purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even the fake peppermint, either, it smells fresh and very strong, but not overpowering at all (</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are a wonderfulf plus, and why I choose it.</li>
            <li>Not heavily minty either thank God.</li>
            <li>however, I simply didn&#x27;t find it to be intense enough, lasting enough or interesting enough to purchase again-</li>
            <li>til your ready to get out, wich for me could be a long time.</li>
            <li>the bubbles don&#x27;t last as long as your average bubble bath, but they last long enough for the kids to enjoy them, get clean, and get out.  </li>
            <li>bubbles were so, so and not very long lasting.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very relaxing and soothing! After a long day of work, this bubble bath formula is a good complement to my bathing activity. I love the scent and there&#x27;s really no criticism.  very bubbly</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  First bubble bath I&#x27;ve used that still had bubbles when I let the water out of the tub.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  All natural as far as I can tell; works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife and she was really happy with the product.  She really likes to take lots of baths and she looks forward to it even more with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice Scent. Invigorating.  Pairs well with using rosemary and argan oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Only takes an ounce or so to get great bubbles (and they last awhile). I like the scent, as it does not smell like fake chemicals. The scent is definitely present, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. The smell is wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I found that with hot water, you get a lot of bubbles, but I usually use warm water- and you don&#x27;t get as many bubbles. That being said, I plan to only use this product (and the other scents) for my baths going forward. Bubbles do last a long time. My bath is about 45 minutes and I usually still have a few remaining.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, organic bubble bath which smells terrific and is incredibly soothing. A must for all hedonists. And the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  It does not produce a lot of bubbles unless you add about 1/3 of the bottle and the fragrance is almost nonexistent.  Dr Teal&#x27;s is a lot better and a good value.</li>
            <li> It stinks. I grow a variety of rosemarys and mints; how did this combination get made? it is terrible.</li>
            <li> Love this bubble bath! It&#x27;s a treat after a long day.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Once and a while I like to soak some sore muscles and have some suds in the tub as well. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell girly, and it works really well. I&#x27;m happy I got it. I&#x27;ll probably get more when I run out of this bottle</li>
            <li> I wan&#x27;t impressed. There is nothing wrong with the fragrance however, I simply didn&#x27;t find it to be intense enough, lasting enough or interesting enough to purchase again- bubbles were so, so and not very long lasting. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bubble up under running water. even after running the jets, the bath water still didn&#x27;t bubble up. disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite bubble bath.  The amount of bubble is very good and the smell is quite nice.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the combination of rosemary and mint but it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The smell is very clean. It is just that I had to get used to it because I am used to lavender and chamomile smelling bubble baths. This reminds me of the lemon pine sol cleaner a little. I absolutely love it. It fills the bathroom and hallway with the scent. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fragrance of this bubble bath and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves their bubble baths.</li>
            <li> Kind of weak smell and not as many bubbles as really good bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was a little worried about buying before smelling and purchasing online. No worries. This has a nice minty scent that filled the bathroom. not so strong that it burns or makes you cough though. just pleasant. The bubbles lasted a long time too which I like bc many disolve too quickly. I really want to try more of this brand. This was my first deep steep purchase and I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  She absolutely adored it and could not wait to fill up a tub and try the bubble bath out.  After lighting a few candles and sinking in with her Kindle she was on cloud nine, telling me that the bubble bath was &amp;#34;took the stress right away and made me relax instantly.&amp;#34;  Would recommend this for any guy who has a significant other whom might be hard to shop for.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of rosemary-mint aromatherapy.  It&#x27;s supposed to be good for clearing your head, lifting your spirits, that kind of thing.  I can&#x27;t really comment about that, except that I love the smell, and THAT lifts my spirits!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I took a \\&quot;test sniff,\\&quot; I could tell this product was all it is advertised to be.  The smell packs a lovely little \\&quot;poke\\&quot; that both wakes me up and relaxes me at the same time.  I just wish it was a little cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good, but thats about it. You could get something just as good anywhere else for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> The scent is just strong enough to fill your room with this relaxing aroma.  I will definitely order more of these.  Wish I would have purchased a couple the first time.  Quite decadent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  It doesn&#x27;t make good bubbles.  I didn&#x27;t notice any scent.  I bought a different brand which makes great bubbles.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is very gentle on your skin. The aroma is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a husband who is tired of your wife smelling like flowers and/or bubble gum, I recommend this as a pleasantly scented alternative. Not too pungent, not too mild, but just right. It smells so nice you might even use it yourself once or twice (be honest fellers, you love a bubble bath too.) It&#x27;s like rubbing a rosemary bush all over your body, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Great bubbly suds and great scent for when you need a bath to send your stress away. Is not drying and the bubbles last til your ready to get out, wich for me could be a long time. The natural ingredients are a wonderfulf plus, and why I choose it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bubble bath because the kids are enticed by bubbles and I don&#x27;t want them soaking in excessive dyes and chemicals.  This fragrance seems a little strong at first but it grows on you quickly, even the kids love it!  It may seem pricey for a bubble bath but the bottle lasts for quite some time and I even use a little extra for excessive bubbles.  The only downside... the bubbles don&#x27;t last as long as your average bubble bath, but they last long enough for the kids to enjoy them, get clean, and get out.  Furthermore, we have had no rashes or allergic reactions from this product.</li>
            <li> Nice bubble bath at a good price.</li>
            <li> smells great. makes lots of bubbles with a small amount. expensive though.</li>
            <li> It is only the second time I&#x27;ve used it, but I couldn&#x27;t help myself - I had to write a review. I LOVE this stuff! It is probably the best purchase I have ever made, period. First of all, they do not test on animals. It is cruelty free and I could pronounce everything on the bottle with ease. Secondly, most, if not all, of the ingredients are organic (the first being organic aloe leaf juice - which is lovely). Third is that it smells DIVINE. If you like peppermint, you&#x27;re in for a treat. It&#x27;s not even the fake peppermint, either, it smells fresh and very strong, but not overpowering at all (unless you use a lot, which leads to my next point). Fourth, and probably most important, is that it makes a lot of bubbles! A little goes a long way and they actually LAST. The bubbles are comparable to sulfate-laced competitors, and they actually last longer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that if you want a luxurious bubble bath without all the chemicals, you want this.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a bubble bath! Lots of suds and a beautiful scent. Not heavily minty either thank God.</li>
