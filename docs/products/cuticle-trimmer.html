            <li>The BEST!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought that it must have been a wonderful product, for the price.  </li>
            <li>These are great cuticle cutters.  </li>
            <li>Steel seems to be great quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>To the point(no pun intended),this \\&quot;tool\\&quot; is a very nice addition to my manicure kit.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing !</li>
            <li>absolutly LOVE it !</li>
            <li>Ever since i bought it there was something i really liked about it, but i could not put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made out of a nice weighted metal.</li>
            <li>The stainless handle on this trimmer is beautiful and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>The cuticle trimmer end is a bit wider than most</li>
            <li>- it works tremendously better because the bottom is V shaped.</li>
            <li>my wife is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to find this instead.</li>
            <li>it worked much better.</li>
            <li>If I could figure out how to sharpen it, it would be better.</li>
            <li>Squeezing the points together with a pair of pliers wrapped aroung a cloth so as to not scratch it made that angle perfect as well,as it was a bit wide for my taste.</li>
            <li>At [...] plus free shipping, I purchased 2 more after getting my 1st one.</li>
            <li>After 4 months of ownership, it&#x27;s usable but not exactly the best anymore.</li>
            <li>Great on pushing cuticles back, love it.</li>
            <li>The cheap ones either don&#x27;t cut well or will cut so easily</li>
            <li>We had a cheap plastic trimmer that worked wonders but being plastic</li>
            <li>This was a cheap $1 item which I was charged 6X that amount.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Looked all over for a cuticle trimmer that would really trim cuticles; so many do NOT work well, but when they do work, I love using them.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pusher\\&quot; end is even sharpened and it comes in very handy and is much more versatile than a simple flat end.</li>
            <li>It is worth buying just for</li>
            <li>It works quite well, it is quite sharp, and (most importantly)</li>
            <li>The end that pushes back cuticles works better than any I have ever used.</li>
            <li>All Steel, so no lousy plastic to break.</li>
            <li>I found I needed to adjust the angle of the trimmer end by placing the two points on a flat surface &amp; pressing til it bent to where I felt it trimmed much better.</li>
            <li>The stainless is ground with a sharp enough edge to be able to push back the cuticle cleanly and easily and safely.</li>
            <li>It is made entirely of  high quality stainless steel,is even nice &amp; \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;,and sharp as a blade.</li>
            <li>But isn&#x27;t that the whole point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The primary detail I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom of the curved blade, the underside of the \\&quot;wings\\&quot;, are flat.</li>
            <li>Stays sharp and removes old cuticles after soaking very easily .</li>
            <li>so it takes a bit more pressure to trim cuticles but the advantage of this design is that it doesn&#x27;t cut too deep into the quick like some other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>The cutting head is pretty big in cuticle pusher standards and not the kind of tool you want if you&#x27;re looking for a more precise closer cut in smaller areas.</li>
            <li>I like it and would recommend this high quality product to anyone.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, well made tool.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>This is probably because the opening is so wide that it cannot cut precisely with ease.</li>
            <li>Lastly,it will last a long time for sure.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are very sharp and accurate</li>
            <li>Compared to those usual plastic brown handle trimmers is like comparing a wooden nail file to a nice crystal or Porcelain file.</li>
            <li>And even though the blade is dull, it is still able to cut your cuticles to the point where you bleed.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great tool after you use pliers to make it a little less wide.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviews said, initially it&#x27;s sharp but it dulls rather fast.</li>
            <li>After about 8 months now its not really sharp anymore.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order this product, and I would use serious discretion before I ordered from a seller that marked up their cheap products like this.</li>
            <li>It is very effect and (beware) very sharp.  </li>
            <li>The blade is dull and the opening is so wide it does not cut precisely.</li>

            <li> It is very effect and (beware) very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blade is dull and the opening is so wide it does not cut precisely.</li>
            <li> Because the bottom is flat, instead of V shaped, this tool does not scoop cuticles or dead skin very well.</li>
            <li> can only imagine that Body Toolz made the bottom flat because if it were V-shaped, you might actually cut yourself.</li>
            <li> huge fail.  </li>
            <li> But this one is made of metal and costs roughly the same as plastic ones (if not cheaper).</li>
            <li> The other end will push back your cuticles well.</li>
            <li> came in a little plastic sleeve, which was cute, but also useless.</li>
            <li> This is sufficiently sharp, but because of the design, doesn&#x27;t cut so deep, you draw blood.  </li>
            <li> have another cuticle cutter (unknown brand - a gift and was part of a lager set) which has a V shape</li>
            <li> The cuticle cutter is not too sharp like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> &quot; together like other reviews have discussed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it is very sharp</li>
            <li> not sharp enough to cut cuticles, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is made in Pakistan.  </li>
            <li> It broke in half in the package  before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> I have bought several cheaper products that were either not good cutters or torture tools.</li>
            <li> For $10 I&#x27;d expect this little tool to work well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these; what a disappointment since other reviews claimed they worked well, particularly if you tweeked them a little by prying the wings closer together.</li>
            <li> I was sick of buying cuticle trimmers with plastic handles that broke with normal usage.</li>
            <li> the little V was very dull.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is completely dull so it rips your cuticles-  </li>
            <li> The blade was too dull to cut.</li>
            <li> She had informed me that if we wanted one that &#x27;didn&#x27;t make her fingernails bleed every time&#x27; that it would cost at least $20 from a beauty shop.</li>
            <li> It is a very dull product.  </li>
            <li> well made,but needs to have the cutting edge thinned for closer trimming.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Had to squeeze the edges together with a pair of pliers to get it to trim. After about 8 months now its not really sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> To the point(no pun intended),this \\&quot;tool\\&quot; is a very nice addition to my manicure kit.It is made entirely of  high quality stainless steel,is even nice &amp; \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;,and sharp as a blade.Compared to those usual plastic brown handle trimmers is like comparing a wooden nail file to a nice crystal or Porcelain file.The \\&quot;pusher\\&quot; end is even sharpened and it comes in very handy and is much more versatile than a simple flat end.I found I needed to adjust the angle of the trimmer end by placing the two points on a flat surface &amp; pressing til it bent to where I felt it trimmed much better.Squeezing the points together with a pair of pliers wrapped aroung a cloth so as to not scratch it made that angle perfect as well,as it was a bit wide for my taste.If you have a problem with the angles I suggest you do the same.Lastly,it will last a long time for sure. At [...] plus free shipping, I purchased 2 more after getting my 1st one. Worth $20.00 at least.The BEST!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great tool after you use pliers to make it a little less wide. Great on pushing cuticles back, love it.</li>
            <li> Made of metal, so I think it will last.  The cuticle cutter is not too sharp like some other brands.  The other end will push back your cuticles well.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are very sharp and accurate but I&#x27;ve noticed they really only stay that way for about 90 days.  They&#x27;re so inexpensive I just buy 4-5 at a time!  ;o)</li>
            <li> I was sick of buying cuticle trimmers with plastic handles that broke with normal usage. The stainless handle on this trimmer is beautiful and ergonomic. The end that pushes back cuticles works better than any I have ever used. The stainless is ground with a sharp enough edge to be able to push back the cuticle cleanly and easily and safely. The cuticle trimmer end is a bit wider than most so it takes a bit more pressure to trim cuticles but the advantage of this design is that it doesn&#x27;t cut too deep into the quick like some other ones I have used. I like it and would recommend this high quality product to anyone.</li>
            <li> the little V was very dull. not sharp enough to cut cuticles, unfortunately. came in a little plastic sleeve, which was cute, but also useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for maybe a year now, and have been dissapointed by it. The primary detail I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom of the curved blade, the underside of the \\&quot;wings\\&quot;, are flat. Because the bottom is flat, instead of V shaped, this tool does not scoop cuticles or dead skin very well. I have not tried bending the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; together like other reviews have discussed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine that Body Toolz made the bottom flat because if it were V-shaped, you might actually cut yourself. But isn&#x27;t that the whole point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another cuticle cutter (unknown brand - a gift and was part of a lager set) which has a V shape - it works tremendously better because the bottom is V shaped.</li>
            <li> It works quite well, it is quite sharp, and (most importantly) my wife is pleased with it. She had informed me that if we wanted one that &#x27;didn&#x27;t make her fingernails bleed every time&#x27; that it would cost at least $20 from a beauty shop. Thankfully I was able to find this instead.</li>
            <li> It works well at cleaning up your fingernail cuticle area.  Stays sharp and removes old cuticles after soaking very easily . Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> well made,but needs to have the cutting edge thinned for closer trimming. It is worth buying just for it&#x27;s reliability.</li>
            <li> What is this, $10? For $10 I&#x27;d expect this little tool to work well. The blade is dull and the opening is so wide it does not cut precisely. And even though the blade is dull, it is still able to cut your cuticles to the point where you bleed. This is probably because the opening is so wide that it cannot cut precisely with ease. I used to have one of these, I think it was a revlon-- it worked much better. I am really disappointed in this. The only reason I give it two starts is because it&#x27;s still better than those weird prong scissors.</li>
            <li> We had a cheap plastic trimmer that worked wonders but being plastic it of course broke.  Hoped this trimmer would work just as well and last longer. . . huge fail.  The trimmer is completely dull so it rips your cuticles-  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is very effect and (beware) very sharp.  Ever since i bought it there was something i really liked about it, but i could not put my finger on it.</li>
            <li> These are great cuticle cutters.  I have bought several cheaper products that were either not good cutters or torture tools. The cheap ones either don&#x27;t cut well or will cut so easily you will need band aids. This is sufficiently sharp, but because of the design, doesn&#x27;t cut so deep, you draw blood.  Steel seems to be great quality.  My only complaint is that it is made in Pakistan.  But it does appear to be well made.  Appears that this will last for some time.  All Steel, so no lousy plastic to break.</li>
            <li> But this one is made of metal and costs roughly the same as plastic ones (if not cheaper). I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> While it surely don&#x27;t deserve 1 star, it&#x27;s not a perfect product. The cutting head is pretty big in cuticle pusher standards and not the kind of tool you want if you&#x27;re looking for a more precise closer cut in smaller areas. Like many of the other reviews said, initially it&#x27;s sharp but it dulls rather fast. After 4 months of ownership, it&#x27;s usable but not exactly the best anymore. It&#x27;s 4$, don&#x27;t buy it expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing ! it is like hospital or surgical standards ! absolutly LOVE it ! can&#x27;t go anyware without it !</li>
            <li> Looked all over for a cuticle trimmer that would really trim cuticles; so many do NOT work well, but when they do work, I love using them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these; what a disappointment since other reviews claimed they worked well, particularly if you tweeked them a little by prying the wings closer together. NOTHING I tried worked; I tossed them in the trash.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap $1 item which I was charged 6X that amount.  I thought that it must have been a wonderful product, for the price.  Cheap and flimsy.  Don&#x27;t order this product, and I would use serious discretion before I ordered from a seller that marked up their cheap products like this.</li>
            <li> It broke in half in the package  before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, well made tool.  Just be careful, it is very sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The blade was too dull to cut. It just tares. It&#x27;s made out of a nice weighted metal. If I could figure out how to sharpen it, it would be better.</li>
            <li> It is a very dull product.  It just pushed the cuticles around.  I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before purchasing, and see that I&#x27;m not the only one to have this problem.</li>
