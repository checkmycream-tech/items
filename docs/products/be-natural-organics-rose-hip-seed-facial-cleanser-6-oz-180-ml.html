            <li>I love the smell, it smells just lightly of roses.  </li>
            <li>With that said, it has a nice smell but doesn&#x27;t really lather up well.</li>
            <li>but it also leaves my skin feeling clean and baby</li>
            <li>Nice smell, gentle but not too gentle like the foaming version.</li>
            <li>And am very pleased with the facial wash.  </li>
            <li>This smells great (not overpowering just fresh and clean) and foams up nicely when rubbed vigorously between wet hands (fingers) before applying to wet face.</li>
            <li>, it smells great, it washes all my make up off with no problem, you only need a tiny amount of it to get your whole face and neck squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This is such a great facial wash.</li>
            <li>This works really well as a mild cleanser, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and gets everything off including my mascara (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof).</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Mild scent, cleans makeup well, leaves skin soft.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It felt very drying to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It not only gets rid of all my makeup (which cetaphils gentle cleansing face wash never did!)</li>
            <li>I now use only this to remove all my makeup, even eye (used Vasiline my whole life, ack!)</li>
            <li>It is a natural product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and there is no redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I ordered because it was a natural product.</li>
            <li>This product claims to be all natural, but it did not seem so in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Instead of smelling like natural roses, it had a fake fragrance to it and smelled more like a hand soap to me.</li>

            <li> Would recommend this product.  It takes makeup and eyemakeup off.  It is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. Mild scent, cleans makeup well, leaves skin soft. Glad I purchased it. Wish it would come in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It smells fabulous and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It is simply the best!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash!  It takes off everything without trouble, keeps my skin clear and never irritates.</li>
            <li> favorite fash wash ever!</li>
            <li> After learning about EWG / cosmeticdatabase.com I came across this product.  I love the smell, it smells just lightly of roses.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have sensitive skin and there is no redness or irritation.  Best of all it completely removes my mascara and eyeliner without the need for additional eye makeup remover.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> a cleanser with a small list of ingredients; just the way i like it!    This cleanser is perfect for my redness face.  i love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that works for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry and I am not allergic to it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so I try to use non-harsh products. I had no expectations for buying this except that it was good for my skin and free of toxins. To my surprise, it is one of the best facial cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used! It not only gets rid of all my makeup (which cetaphils gentle cleansing face wash never did!) but it also leaves my skin feeling clean and baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that it does make your face feel tight after cleansing but apply moisturizer/oil and you&#x27;ll never want to stop touching your face because it feels so nice. Would definitely recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the smell and the feel. However, I am not gonna buy it again because it is just two expensive and there are other alternatives with simple ingredients (hint: coconut water) that you can get for 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I keep trying other stuff but always come back to this.  It is a clean product based on ewg, smell is nice, cleans great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, no allergic reaction..just a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the very light fragrance of rose and the gel type cleanser.  It has helped a couple of red, scaly spots on my cheeks.  I use it night and morning and plan to order more.  I&#x27;m trying to get away from toxic skin products.  I just wish it was a larger size.</li>
            <li> Very light (too much?), nice smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered because it was a natural product. And am very pleased with the facial wash.  Would recommend to anyone looking for your basic cleanser without all the chemicals and  has a great rose fragrance.  Thank You</li>
            <li> I like how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; this makes my face.  However, it is a bit pricey and with my skin type it would be drying to use twice a day.  I will use it once a day instead and won&#x27;t need to buy another one so soon .</li>
            <li> This product claims to be all natural, but it did not seem so in my opinion. It felt very drying to my sensitive skin. Instead of smelling like natural roses, it had a fake fragrance to it and smelled more like a hand soap to me. It did not over exceede my expectations, and I would not purchase it again. However, it does do the job of clensing.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! Everything about it is awesome! It is organic and safe for your skin, it smells great, it washes all my make up off with no problem, you only need a tiny amount of it to get your whole face and neck squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product as an eye makeup remover because in the picture, it said eye makeup remover on the actual bottle. When I received the product, it only says facial cleanser on the bottle.  I emailed the seller asking if they shipped me the wrong product and they replied no, it was the same product, just different packaging. I was a bit disappointed. This product has to be used with water as a facial cleanser (I thought it was a cream to remove makeup). With that said, it has a nice smell but doesn&#x27;t really lather up well. It does an ok job removing makeup. But for the price, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. Nice smell, gentle but not too gentle like the foaming version. Only complaint is the high price, but the container does last a while (one pump is plenty). Tested with acne prone skin, dry skin, and ageing skin, and works well for all.</li>
            <li> This smells great (not overpowering just fresh and clean) and foams up nicely when rubbed vigorously between wet hands (fingers) before applying to wet face. I now use only this to remove all my makeup, even eye (used Vasiline my whole life, ack!) and it is non-stinging and gentle. Will definitely stick with this product.</li>
            <li> Yummy smell. This is such a great facial wash. Love the way it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin...and did I say that is smells amazing? Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works really well as a mild cleanser, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and gets everything off including my mascara (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof). I like the smell but it is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Seems really soapy and drying...</li>
