            <li>This stuff is great for costuming.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>As for the product, however, it&#x27;s not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I received it on time and it was a good product</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>I find that it also is good for lighting up darker makeup as well.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>All in all, very pleased with the product and seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Great shipping/delivery, LOVE the product.</li>
            <li>Recommend for sure!</li>
            <li>Still love Manic Panic!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the packaging!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It pretty much gives me this perfect flawless coverage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pressed powder</li>
            <li>and it also kind of makes you look like your glowing.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price though MAC will always be my favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind re-applying every so often, it is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>Came in a cute mesh bag, I love the packaging!</li>
            <li>Smooth coverage and good product.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, the powder does kind of sit on top of your face when you use it.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re wanting a you-but-much-paler, almost natural look, this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great stuff, getting ready to buy more!</li>
            <li>This powder applies so nicely with a foundation brush and stays pretty nicely over a good liquid foundation (I use</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>Using the brush makes it go on a lot easier, but it&#x27;s like the makeup sits on top of my foundation, and</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this many months ago for a vampire Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>The coverage was even better than I would have hoped for, given that this is a powder.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my cheekbones and brows, under and on top of foundation, and used it to blend blushes.</li>
            <li>But i like it alot:)</li>
            <li>so make sure you put some lotion on before you use it.</li>
            <li>Will definately be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I used this for Halloween and it was a thousand times better than using costume makeup.</li>
            <li>Love wearing it out to goth clubs.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to exfoliate &amp; moisturize before usage and you will love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For white out costume makeup, this is perfect!</li>
            <li>It feels nice and light on my skin</li>
            <li>I love manic panic products and I have a gothic side I love this makeup it makes me look the way I want it when I want it</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay, because I treated it as another substitute for Clown make up...</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and quick response</li>
            <li>All in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and have never been able to find makeup that matches my skin tone until I bought this, the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have any moisterizers in it</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly, beautiful white, very light weight.</li>
            <li>It is mostly talc, comes with a cheap foam pad instead of one of those smoother applicators.</li>
            <li>I had the Moonlight one, which I loved, and which matched my skin tone, but I wanted to go lighter, and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going for very clean and precise.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and reapply, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so it is a good classic company to go to for makeup &amp; hair color.</li>
            <li>The only powder that I can set my under eye concealer with and still have a nice highlight considering just how incredibly fair my skin tone gets in the winter time.</li>
            <li>My tried and true favorite make up ever</li>
            <li>like I said it is a little chalky, but the color and application are still excellent</li>
            <li>The HUGE problem is the texture/finish.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I only have two things I wasn&#x27;t so happy with.</li>
            <li>Feels light.</li>
            <li>Have to use a *really* light hand or it cakes and looks patchy.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice to apply smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It is best when used alone as light coverage for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and I have loved it so far.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, it did exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed by Manic Panic cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This a great product to set very light liquid concealers under the eyes or elsewhere for those of us who are pale Spring, Summer, Fall, and/or Winter.</li>
            <li>For the perfect goth vampire look i put this over the manic panic white foundation and even used it on my body to hide my tan and complete my vampire halloween look.</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s pretty translucent but can also be layered for full coverage.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of application and tone of the powder, however I did hit pan pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Smooth application, opaque color, feels like better quality than Manic Panic&#x27;s Supernatural Pressed Powder.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly the same, great quality.</li>
            <li>Great pure white compact.</li>
            <li>It shipped really quickly, in 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews about it, so I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect, but in my personal experience, it&#x27;s a huge win.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great paired with the Mani Panic&#x27;s liquid white foundation if you&#x27;re going for a classic goth</li>
            <li>stays on good, but if its hot outside I would recommend not wearing it</li>
            <li>Trying not to dust off the excess makes one look like one has caked it on and doesn&#x27;t really make for the smooth, marble-like complexion for which I&#x27;d been hoping.</li>
            <li>Manic panic is vegan, cruelty free, &amp; reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Especially when I top it off with some light blush.</li>
            <li>I guess fresh.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want to look goth, or pale.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be turned off by the &amp;#34;gothic&amp;#34; themed branding; it&#x27;s great for anyone who&#x27;s pale and needs quality powder.</li>
            <li>A light coating of this powder looks completely natural (I use white eyeliner sometimes for a light concealer, and this is perfect to set it) and not too pale at all.</li>
            <li>This powder works awesome wet or dry  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pure, matte white, with no sheen or glitter of any kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really soft powder and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It also evened out the white out makeup so that it looked totally smooth and streak free.</li>
            <li>But that is easily fixed when you accompany it with the gothic white cream stuff and give it a good blend.</li>
            <li>I also love the adorable black draw-string bag it comes in!</li>
            <li>Perfect for vampires, zombies, or just for a pale white look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very very oily.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find something light enough to brighten up my under eye area.</li>
            <li>SO glad I found this company and actually gave them a shot.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything under the sun within many different price points.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this product from the seller.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how much I love this, and the goth white liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>, I feel it would&#x27;ve been a better bet to put the mirror in the same compartment as the applicator.</li>
            <li>All in all I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>Definitely works better if applied with a brush.</li>
            <li>I used it for a Harley Quinn costume, and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would give it a higher review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a foundation but more like a primer which acts to get the red tones out of your skin.</li>
            <li>Add to that the fact that I break out really easily, it makes it tough to find a product that will look good and not cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li>1-The pot that holds the powder was glued into the casing very well and fell out right upon opening it for the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be a little more finely milled,</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a very opaque, bright white finish, like what you would get with white pancake makeup</li>
            <li>It is very white, so I used a bit more blush than I normally would.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and have no problem&#x27;s using this product.</li>
            <li>It does, but it&#x27;s spotty unless I use a large brush and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily since I received it and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The seller packaged my item with care and was very speedy about the shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and powder really helps with it.</li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>Worked very well...better than make-up from Halloween stores.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this to people with light skin, or to people who want their skin to look lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going for the whole &amp;#34;dead bride&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not so much at night..</li>
            <li>But I am a tan native and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Only white pressed powder I&#x27;ve ever actually liked.</li>
            <li>And I have tried other white loose powders, but this pressed powder is the best.</li>
            <li>During the winter, nothing is light enough for me, but this fixes that problem, and blends seamlessly with a finishing brush!!!</li>
            <li>However, the powder was not cracked and did not make a mess; a little hot glue fixed the problem perfectly.</li>
            <li>Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish).</li>
            <li>It also is so dry that it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and that is coming from someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>Most pressed powders I have found are much, much too dark and leave me with an orange cast to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a well seasoned professional published makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I also used Mehron white magic sticks (which is like an opaque white out stick foundation).</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with less redness and a normal (instead of oily) skin type could make better use of this.is.</li>
            <li>The cute bats, the bones, the font, the colors, the little rhinestones on the i&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I typically lightly apply it all over my face, with a little extra on my cheek bones and it makes my face look fantastic.</li>
            <li>It gave me a lovely pale complexion.</li>
            <li>For such a large container there isn&#x27;t much in there, but that seems to often be the case with Manic Panic products.</li>
            <li>Would be hard to blend for costume coverage but very doable, definitely a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so you could maybe just use babypowder for way less but that would be easy to breathe in and that&#x27;s bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, and it did not irritate it in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin, even makeup specifically made for paleskin/redheads is typically too dark for me.</li>
            <li>Everything I ordered is COMPLETELY RUINED!</li>
            <li>Many other reviews have the same problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m painfully white, and this powder is the first time I&#x27;ve not looked like I smeared dirt or tanner on my skin.</li>
            <li>(use wet for full coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years because for a long time no one made a powder light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>pure white</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned naturally, so I was just looking for something that would get rid of the little bit of pink tone and make me nice and white.</li>
            <li>Even if you wanted to go vampire pale with it, the texture is a little too chalky on its own to really be a foundation.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase it directly from Manic Panic, but found it at a lower price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would know, as I have been using this powder for nearly 5 years.</li>
            <li>White out makeup tends to be the only thing light enough.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t mind the flaky effect as you can only really tell very close up, in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>It also sits heavy, it definitely feels like you are wearing a lot more makeup than you are.</li>
            <li>look for Halloween and I really hate that whit face paint that rubs off everywhere, so this was an excellent solution.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin more pale without making it look too white.</li>
            <li>But it does last a long time and is very convenient for quick white out!</li>
            <li>This also makes a great base eyeshadow, inner corner/brow highlight, or pretty much any matte highlight.</li>
            <li>A really decent purchase, would definitely repurchase (though I use it sparingly so it&#x27;ll be a while before I run out).</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to put too much rubbing alcohol in if you do this!</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying white powder to use normally, even though I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people have suggested it.</li>
            <li>and I still have people asking me how I was able to achieve and completely dry, matte, shine free, even, streak free white base.</li>
            <li>She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it.</li>
            <li>Loved this only problem is I figured out I could use it as a regular foundation, was not aware that I was this pale!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than the Illamasqua pure white powder as well as other comparable high end brand powders.</li>
            <li>Though if you buff it onto your face with a big brush on top of a foundation base, it will create more of an even finish.</li>
            <li>The little puff that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t work, but not a bad thing to have for usage with other powders and such.</li>
            <li>and so she was able to be perfectly pale without having all that gunky paint on, so even though it wasn&#x27;t real it looked for like the pale you would see in Twilight minus the sparkles.</li>
            <li>But about a week into daily use...it was nearly gone, and I only use a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>and i was burning up and the makeup started looking uneven, and it was pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>It almost gives you the appearance of having black heads in big pores, the exact opposite of what I am looking for in my daily makeup.</li>
            <li>FINALLY something pale enough for my skin and not cheesy</li>
            <li>You can control how much white color you want to put on by how much you apply or wether you apply it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little intense for all-over wear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> BUT, as a highlighter, it is great.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a compact which makes it great for touch ups while your at work or out and about.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It looks great over my foundation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for costuming.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> As for the product, however, it&#x27;s not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and it was a good product</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I find that it also is good for lighting up darker makeup as well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> All in all, very pleased with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Great shipping/delivery, LOVE the product.</li>
            <li> Recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> Still love Manic Panic!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the packaging!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It pretty much gives me this perfect flawless coverage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pressed powder</li>
            <li> and it also kind of makes you look like your glowing.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price though MAC will always be my favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind re-applying every so often, it is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> Came in a cute mesh bag, I love the packaging!</li>
            <li> Smooth coverage and good product.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, the powder does kind of sit on top of your face when you use it.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re wanting a you-but-much-paler, almost natural look, this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great stuff, getting ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> This powder applies so nicely with a foundation brush and stays pretty nicely over a good liquid foundation (I use</li>
            <li> I love this powder.</li>
            <li> Using the brush makes it go on a lot easier, but it&#x27;s like the makeup sits on top of my foundation, and</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this many months ago for a vampire Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> The coverage was even better than I would have hoped for, given that this is a powder.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my cheekbones and brows, under and on top of foundation, and used it to blend blushes.</li>
            <li> But i like it alot:)</li>
            <li> so make sure you put some lotion on before you use it.</li>
            <li> Will definately be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I used this for Halloween and it was a thousand times better than using costume makeup.</li>
            <li> Love wearing it out to goth clubs.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to exfoliate &amp; moisturize before usage and you will love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For white out costume makeup, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> It feels nice and light on my skin</li>
            <li> I love manic panic products and I have a gothic side I love this makeup it makes me look the way I want it when I want it</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay, because I treated it as another substitute for Clown make up...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and quick response</li>
            <li> All in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and have never been able to find makeup that matches my skin tone until I bought this, the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have any moisterizers in it</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, beautiful white, very light weight.</li>
            <li> It is mostly talc, comes with a cheap foam pad instead of one of those smoother applicators.</li>
            <li> I had the Moonlight one, which I loved, and which matched my skin tone, but I wanted to go lighter, and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going for very clean and precise.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and reapply, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> so it is a good classic company to go to for makeup &amp; hair color.</li>
            <li> The only powder that I can set my under eye concealer with and still have a nice highlight considering just how incredibly fair my skin tone gets in the winter time.</li>
            <li> My tried and true favorite make up ever</li>
            <li> like I said it is a little chalky, but the color and application are still excellent</li>
            <li> The HUGE problem is the texture/finish.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I only have two things I wasn&#x27;t so happy with.</li>
            <li> Feels light.</li>
            <li> Have to use a *really* light hand or it cakes and looks patchy.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of practice to apply smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> It is best when used alone as light coverage for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and I have loved it so far.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it did exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed by Manic Panic cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This a great product to set very light liquid concealers under the eyes or elsewhere for those of us who are pale Spring, Summer, Fall, and/or Winter.</li>
            <li> For the perfect goth vampire look i put this over the manic panic white foundation and even used it on my body to hide my tan and complete my vampire halloween look.</li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s pretty translucent but can also be layered for full coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of application and tone of the powder, however I did hit pan pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Smooth application, opaque color, feels like better quality than Manic Panic&#x27;s Supernatural Pressed Powder.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly the same, great quality.</li>
            <li> Great pure white compact.</li>
            <li> It shipped really quickly, in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews about it, so I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect, but in my personal experience, it&#x27;s a huge win.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great paired with the Mani Panic&#x27;s liquid white foundation if you&#x27;re going for a classic goth</li>
            <li> stays on good, but if its hot outside I would recommend not wearing it</li>
            <li> Trying not to dust off the excess makes one look like one has caked it on and doesn&#x27;t really make for the smooth, marble-like complexion for which I&#x27;d been hoping.</li>
            <li> Manic panic is vegan, cruelty free, &amp; reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Especially when I top it off with some light blush.</li>
            <li> I guess fresh.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to look goth, or pale.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be turned off by the &amp;#34;gothic&amp;#34; themed branding; it&#x27;s great for anyone who&#x27;s pale and needs quality powder.</li>
            <li> A light coating of this powder looks completely natural (I use white eyeliner sometimes for a light concealer, and this is perfect to set it) and not too pale at all.</li>
            <li> This powder works awesome wet or dry  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pure, matte white, with no sheen or glitter of any kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really soft powder and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It also evened out the white out makeup so that it looked totally smooth and streak free.</li>
            <li> But that is easily fixed when you accompany it with the gothic white cream stuff and give it a good blend.</li>
            <li> I also love the adorable black draw-string bag it comes in!</li>
            <li> Perfect for vampires, zombies, or just for a pale white look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very very oily.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find something light enough to brighten up my under eye area.</li>
            <li> SO glad I found this company and actually gave them a shot.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun within many different price points.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this product from the seller.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how much I love this, and the goth white liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> , I feel it would&#x27;ve been a better bet to put the mirror in the same compartment as the applicator.</li>
            <li> All in all I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> Definitely works better if applied with a brush.</li>
            <li> I used it for a Harley Quinn costume, and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would give it a higher review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a foundation but more like a primer which acts to get the red tones out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Add to that the fact that I break out really easily, it makes it tough to find a product that will look good and not cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li> 1-The pot that holds the powder was glued into the casing very well and fell out right upon opening it for the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be a little more finely milled,</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a very opaque, bright white finish, like what you would get with white pancake makeup</li>
            <li> It is very white, so I used a bit more blush than I normally would.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and have no problem&#x27;s using this product.</li>
            <li> It does, but it&#x27;s spotty unless I use a large brush and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily since I received it and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The seller packaged my item with care and was very speedy about the shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and powder really helps with it.</li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> Worked very well...better than make-up from Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to people with light skin, or to people who want their skin to look lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going for the whole &amp;#34;dead bride&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not so much at night..</li>
            <li> But I am a tan native and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Only white pressed powder I&#x27;ve ever actually liked.</li>
            <li> And I have tried other white loose powders, but this pressed powder is the best.</li>
            <li> During the winter, nothing is light enough for me, but this fixes that problem, and blends seamlessly with a finishing brush!!!</li>
            <li> However, the powder was not cracked and did not make a mess; a little hot glue fixed the problem perfectly.</li>
            <li> Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish).</li>
            <li> It also is so dry that it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and that is coming from someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Most pressed powders I have found are much, much too dark and leave me with an orange cast to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a well seasoned professional published makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I also used Mehron white magic sticks (which is like an opaque white out stick foundation).</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with less redness and a normal (instead of oily) skin type could make better use of this.is.</li>
            <li> The cute bats, the bones, the font, the colors, the little rhinestones on the i&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I typically lightly apply it all over my face, with a little extra on my cheek bones and it makes my face look fantastic.</li>
            <li> It gave me a lovely pale complexion.</li>
            <li> For such a large container there isn&#x27;t much in there, but that seems to often be the case with Manic Panic products.</li>
            <li> Would be hard to blend for costume coverage but very doable, definitely a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so you could maybe just use babypowder for way less but that would be easy to breathe in and that&#x27;s bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, and it did not irritate it in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin, even makeup specifically made for paleskin/redheads is typically too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Everything I ordered is COMPLETELY RUINED!</li>
            <li> Many other reviews have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m painfully white, and this powder is the first time I&#x27;ve not looked like I smeared dirt or tanner on my skin.</li>
            <li> (use wet for full coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years because for a long time no one made a powder light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> pure white</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned naturally, so I was just looking for something that would get rid of the little bit of pink tone and make me nice and white.</li>
            <li> Even if you wanted to go vampire pale with it, the texture is a little too chalky on its own to really be a foundation.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase it directly from Manic Panic, but found it at a lower price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would know, as I have been using this powder for nearly 5 years.</li>
            <li> White out makeup tends to be the only thing light enough.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t mind the flaky effect as you can only really tell very close up, in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> It also sits heavy, it definitely feels like you are wearing a lot more makeup than you are.</li>
            <li> look for Halloween and I really hate that whit face paint that rubs off everywhere, so this was an excellent solution.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin more pale without making it look too white.</li>
            <li> But it does last a long time and is very convenient for quick white out!</li>
            <li> This also makes a great base eyeshadow, inner corner/brow highlight, or pretty much any matte highlight.</li>
            <li> A really decent purchase, would definitely repurchase (though I use it sparingly so it&#x27;ll be a while before I run out).</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to put too much rubbing alcohol in if you do this!</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying white powder to use normally, even though I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people have suggested it.</li>
            <li> and I still have people asking me how I was able to achieve and completely dry, matte, shine free, even, streak free white base.</li>
            <li> She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it.</li>
            <li> Loved this only problem is I figured out I could use it as a regular foundation, was not aware that I was this pale!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the Illamasqua pure white powder as well as other comparable high end brand powders.</li>
            <li> Though if you buff it onto your face with a big brush on top of a foundation base, it will create more of an even finish.</li>
            <li> The little puff that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t work, but not a bad thing to have for usage with other powders and such.</li>
            <li> and so she was able to be perfectly pale without having all that gunky paint on, so even though it wasn&#x27;t real it looked for like the pale you would see in Twilight minus the sparkles.</li>
            <li> But about a week into daily use...it was nearly gone, and I only use a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> and i was burning up and the makeup started looking uneven, and it was pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> It almost gives you the appearance of having black heads in big pores, the exact opposite of what I am looking for in my daily makeup.</li>
            <li> FINALLY something pale enough for my skin and not cheesy</li>
            <li> You can control how much white color you want to put on by how much you apply or wether you apply it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little intense for all-over wear.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin and have a hard time finding a shade light enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t quite as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> This powder helped it actually set so that it was dry to the touch and lasted all night (</li>
            <li> The compact itself is pretty - it has little rhinestones on it and comes in a black chiffon bag (for some reason the bag always came apart when I ordered it from Manic Panic, but not when I bought it off of Amazon</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over any other powder for white out costume makeups like skulls, but for daily wear it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It can create a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look to finish off pale foundation or it can be built up for a more dramatic look or for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> 2-The mirror is in the same compact area as the powder causing the mirror to get dirty and foggy easily</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all my pale princesses out there who are lighter than the lightest of MAC, MUFE, Kat von D, and other brand&#x27;s foundation and concealer ranges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opaque without being solid, and it doesn&#x27;t pull other colors up if you put it over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never use other Gothic white powders again.</li>
            <li> I also never accidentally rubbed it off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: be prepared for it to accentuate any areas of dry skin or enlarged pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t happen with skin toned makeup.</li>
            <li> My only problem was that it was a little messy (which powder can be) and that it seemed to wear/fade fairly quickly as far as makeup I&#x27;ve used goes.</li>
            <li> It arrive completely shattered and got on ALL my other products!!!</li>
            <li> Way easier than loose powder.</li>
            <li> Even using a primer, a long-lasting foundation, and setting spray, my oil breaks this powder down in about 8 hours and touch ups become very necessary.  </li>
            <li> It looks bad pretty much immediately upon application, and just looks cakier the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> Originally for a costume where I needed a white face, I tried cream makeup, but that was a disaster (thick and hard to apply, felt weird and itchy on, cracked in lines that made me look older than I am, etc.).</li>
            <li> Over a natural looking foundation or tinted moisturizer, this looks very cakey and artificial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for roughly a week now</li>
            <li> so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> trying to dust off the excess doesn&#x27;t leave you with much left on your face, so although you&#x27;re not shiny anymore, you&#x27;re also not as pale as you&#x27;d like to be (and</li>
            <li> I am already pale, so I use it as regular foundation.</li>
            <li> Just when I seem to find a product that works for me and is pale enough to match my complexion, it always seems to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been everywhere and tried everything, and no brand makes makeup pale enough for me.</li>
            <li> This powder is white as paper, but on my skin it doesn&#x27;t look as pale as all that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing this for anything other than paling yourself up).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it looks patchy it</li>
            <li> She always has a dark line just under her chin.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin and helps lighten up my (always too dark) foundation.</li>
            <li> I used a fluffy blush brush to buff on a layer of the powder and it gave me a very pale finish without looking clown white.</li>
            <li> I did try applying it wet once just to see how heavy a coat I could get, and it was heavier but a little streaky.</li>
            <li> It helps even out my skin tone (my face flushes in odd places) and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller was very quick getting the product out considering I ordered a few days before Halloween, unfortunately my powder was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the price</li>
            <li> It does tend to get a little flaky..</li>
            <li> but it was a little messy.  </li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re not pale) because it looks bad when you sweat a little.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the sponge applicator and used a spare fluffy one instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for a couple years</li>
            <li> only thing I dislike about it is that it appears it always arrives broken.</li>
            <li> If you are a pale as paper redhead like myself who&#x27;s tired of having an orange face, this is definitely a product to try.</li>
            <li> But that is me as being pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale and I use this as my highlighter.</li>
            <li> This is the whitest powder you can get for you pale skin (like mine).</li>
            <li> You have to put ALOT on to get pale.</li>
            <li> I bought this for costume makeup and would recommend this for anyone looking for a dramatic white face powder.</li>
            <li> It settles into pores very badly, making them look huge and dark.</li>
            <li> One thin layer looks like dry skin all over your face.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I usually use with a stipple brush under my eyes and it works to even out the tone of my face while still adding a highlight.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this!</li>
            <li> hooray for being pale!!</li>
            <li> While this was annoying, I didn&#x27;t want to make the effort to send it back and get a refund, so I tried the rubbing alcohol trick to repack the makeup.</li>
            <li> The applicator that comes with it is about useless when trying to apply the makeup itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Not in a weird way.</li>
            <li> very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this powder. I use a powder brush instead of the applicator provided. It makes my skin more pale without making it look too white. 👍</li>
            <li> My tried and true favorite make up ever</li>
            <li> Perfect! Smooth application, opaque color, feels like better quality than Manic Panic&#x27;s Supernatural Pressed Powder. I bought this for costume makeup and would recommend this for anyone looking for a dramatic white face powder.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to look goth, or pale. Great for halloween. Easy to use. It&#x27;s a nice pressed powder so  it goes on smooth. Way easier than loose powder. It does the job. Smooth coverage and good product.</li>
            <li> This powder did the trick and made me into the ghostly vampire I wanted to be!!!</li>
            <li> The seller was very quick getting the product out considering I ordered a few days before Halloween, unfortunately my powder was broken when I received it. (Though I wasn&#x27;t worried about it.)    Again another so-so product from Manic Panic. Like another reviewer said, the powder does kind of sit on top of your face when you use it. Though if you buff it onto your face with a big brush on top of a foundation base, it will create more of an even finish. You do have to use quite a lot of powder to get that desired white finish. I only bought this for Halloween so it&#x27;s the only time I&#x27;ve ever had a need to use it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time and the store is reliable.     As for the product, however, it&#x27;s not as good as I hoped it would be. I had hoped that it would lighten my skin. It does, but it&#x27;s spotty unless I use a large brush and a lot of it. The applicator that comes with it is about useless when trying to apply the makeup itself. Using the brush makes it go on a lot easier, but it&#x27;s like the makeup sits on top of my foundation, and trying to dust off the excess doesn&#x27;t leave you with much left on your face, so although you&#x27;re not shiny anymore, you&#x27;re also not as pale as you&#x27;d like to be (and I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing this for anything other than paling yourself up). Trying not to dust off the excess makes one look like one has caked it on and doesn&#x27;t really make for the smooth, marble-like complexion for which I&#x27;d been hoping.</li>
            <li> This make-up is awesome. It is best when used alone as light coverage for everyday use. I used to purchase it directly from Manic Panic, but found it at a lower price on Amazon. The product was exactly the same, great quality. I would know, as I have been using this powder for nearly 5 years. The compact itself is pretty - it has little rhinestones on it and comes in a black chiffon bag (for some reason the bag always came apart when I ordered it from Manic Panic, but not when I bought it off of Amazon - this was the only difference I could find between the two, and it doesn&#x27;t relate to the quality of the make-up itself.) I will be ordering this make-up again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed. SO glad I found this company and actually gave them a shot. Don&#x27;t be turned off by the &amp;#34;gothic&amp;#34; themed branding; it&#x27;s great for anyone who&#x27;s pale and needs quality powder. Mix it or apply as is depending on your coloring.  I typically lightly apply it all over my face, with a little extra on my cheek bones and it makes my face look fantastic. Especially when I top it off with some light blush. Great stuff, getting ready to buy more! Not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am already pale, so I use it as regular foundation. It pretty much gives me this perfect flawless coverage and it also kind of makes you look like your glowing. Not in a weird way. It just makes you look I guess fresh. But that is me as being pale. My niece was a vampire for Halloween so I used it on her and so she was able to be perfectly pale without having all that gunky paint on, so even though it wasn&#x27;t real it looked for like the pale you would see in Twilight minus the sparkles. It&#x27;s great I would recommend everyone to get it. So yeah hooray for being pale!!</li>
            <li> I am a VERY fair redhead who has combination skin. I have tried everything under the sun within many different price points. Just when I seem to find a product that works for me and is pale enough to match my complexion, it always seems to be discontinued. Most pressed powders I have found are much, much too dark and leave me with an orange cast to my skin tone. I have recently tried MAC Blot in Translucent, but it&#x27;s $22 and creases in the t-zone area after several hours. I was a bit hesitant to try this, but I received it yesterday and I have loved it so far. It is very white, so I used a bit more blush than I normally would. I also didn&#x27;t like the sponge applicator and used a spare fluffy one instead. It does blend quite well, but my suggestion would be to exfoliate well and moisturize prior to use.     If you are a pale as paper redhead like myself who&#x27;s tired of having an orange face, this is definitely a product to try. The seller packaged my item with care and was very speedy about the shipping. I will definitely buy more of this product from the seller. All in all, very pleased with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and quick response</li>
            <li> It arrive completely shattered and got on ALL my other products!!! Everything I ordered is COMPLETELY RUINED! very disappointed! Ugh...</li>
            <li> FINALLY something pale enough for my skin and not cheesy</li>
            <li> I use this to apply on after foundation and it makes the look I&#x27;m going for very clean and precise. Love this stuff. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> With this product it is best to use a powder brush to ensure even coverage. It can create a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look to finish off pale foundation or it can be built up for a more dramatic look or for costume makeup. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for a couple years and I&#x27;ve only bought two compacts in that time. Manic panic is vegan, cruelty free, &amp; reasonably priced so it is a good classic company to go to for makeup &amp; hair color.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of application and tone of the powder, however I did hit pan pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve had this product for roughly a week now and I have already started to run out.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder. I have very fair skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find something light enough to brighten up my under eye area. This did an incredible job of brightening up my eyes when used over my setting powder. My only complaint is that it looks patchy it I don&#x27;t set my foundation before applying it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is snow white and can never find makeup that matches her at all. She always has a dark line just under her chin. She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it. It worked so well that she now looks like a china doll. Perfect! If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li> During the winter, nothing is light enough for me, but this fixes that problem, and blends seamlessly with a finishing brush!!! Recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> I cannot say how much I love this, and the goth white liquid foundation. They work well together and separately. I&#x27;m extremely pale and I use this as my highlighter. Doesn&#x27;t crease in the under eye area! The search is over, if you have porcelain skin, you need this in your life.</li>
            <li> The only powder that I can set my under eye concealer with and still have a nice highlight considering just how incredibly fair my skin tone gets in the winter time. I highly recommend this to all my pale princesses out there who are lighter than the lightest of MAC, MUFE, Kat von D, and other brand&#x27;s foundation and concealer ranges. It&#x27;s cheaper than the Illamasqua pure white powder as well as other comparable high end brand powders. This also makes a great base eyeshadow, inner corner/brow highlight, or pretty much any matte highlight. I highly recommend this product as a well seasoned professional published makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it did exactly as I had hoped. But about a week into daily use...it was nearly gone, and I only use a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and it was a good product but it was a little messy.  The case has powder on it...but that&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years because for a long time no one made a powder light enough for my skin tone. This powder works awesome wet or dry  (use wet for full coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the sponge, I&#x27;m a brush girl (I just toss the sponge when I get it). This powder applies so nicely with a foundation brush and stays pretty nicely over a good liquid foundation (I use Kat Von D Tattoo Lock-It).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very very oily. Even using a primer, a long-lasting foundation, and setting spray, my oil breaks this powder down in about 8 hours and touch ups become very necessary.  It does not absorb oil so I&#x27;m switching to Youngblood Rice Powder because they make a shade that will work for me and help extend the life of my makeup application. I will, however, be keeping this powder on hand as a highlighter. Still love Manic Panic!</li>
            <li> This is the whitest powder you can get for you pale skin (like mine). I LOVE the packaging! The cute bats, the bones, the font, the colors, the little rhinestones on the i&#x27;s...I love it all. I also love the adorable black draw-string bag it comes in! I only have two things I wasn&#x27;t so happy with. 1-The pot that holds the powder was glued into the casing very well and fell out right upon opening it for the first time. However, the powder was not cracked and did not make a mess; a little hot glue fixed the problem perfectly. 2-The mirror is in the same compact area as the powder causing the mirror to get dirty and foggy easily, I feel it would&#x27;ve been a better bet to put the mirror in the same compartment as the applicator. All in all I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder that goes well with my skin tone. I have oily skin, and powder really helps with it. I also have the Manic Panic Dreamtone Foundation, which I prefer, but when I am in a rush this powder does the trick! It helps even out my skin tone (my face flushes in odd places) and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about it is that it appears it always arrives broken. Many other reviews have the same problem. While this was annoying, I didn&#x27;t want to make the effort to send it back and get a refund, so I tried the rubbing alcohol trick to repack the makeup. It worked really well and I don&#x27;t think it affected the makeup at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell like rubbing alcohol, either. Just be careful not to put too much rubbing alcohol in if you do this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this many months ago for a vampire Halloween costume. I&#x27;m very fair-skinned naturally, so I was just looking for something that would get rid of the little bit of pink tone and make me nice and white. This worked beautifully. I used a fluffy blush brush to buff on a layer of the powder and it gave me a very pale finish without looking clown white. The coverage was even better than I would have hoped for, given that this is a powder. The great part was that it stayed on all day. In fact, I wore this on four separate occasions (two parties, Halloween night, and a wear-your-costume day at work) and it last all day and all night every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a very opaque, bright white finish, like what you would get with white pancake makeup, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. I did try applying it wet once just to see how heavy a coat I could get, and it was heavier but a little streaky. But if you&#x27;re wanting a you-but-much-paler, almost natural look, this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also make a great matte highlighting powder for very fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> For the perfect goth vampire look i put this over the manic panic white foundation and even used it on my body to hide my tan and complete my vampire halloween look.</li>
            <li> worked perfect for Halloween costume!</li>
            <li> used it for Halloween, it gave me even coverage, used with Manic Panic Virgin White Dreamtone Foundation Goth Vamp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pure, matte white, with no sheen or glitter of any kind. It&#x27;s a little intense for all-over wear. Even if you wanted to go vampire pale with it, the texture is a little too chalky on its own to really be a foundation. BUT, as a highlighter, it is great. I have used it on my cheekbones and brows, under and on top of foundation, and used it to blend blushes. It&#x27;s opaque without being solid, and it doesn&#x27;t pull other colors up if you put it over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be a little more finely milled, like I said it is a little chalky, but the color and application are still excellent</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Vampire White Foundation. I have extremely pale skin and have a hard time finding a shade light enough for my skin. Add to that the fact that I break out really easily, it makes it tough to find a product that will look good and not cause my face to break out. I am extremely happy with this product. I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily since I received it and it has made a huge difference. My skin hasn&#x27;t gotten irritated by it at all. I am extremely happy with this product. I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews about it, so I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect, but in my personal experience, it&#x27;s a huge win. I plan to keep ordering this as needed and make this a daily part of my every day make up.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, beautiful white, very light weight.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this makeup</li>
            <li> Great pure white compact.If you want your complexion to be that of a corpse than this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you know how to use it. You have to put ALOT on to get pale. One thin layer looks like dry skin all over your face. If you put alot on you will look vampirish which is probably why you want the product. But i like it alot:)</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and have never been able to find makeup that matches my skin tone until I bought this, the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have any moisterizers in it so make sure you put some lotion on before you use it. I find that it also is good for lighting up darker makeup as well. It&#x27;s also a compact which makes it great for touch ups while your at work or out and about. Will definately be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed by Manic Panic cosmetics. Only white pressed powder I&#x27;ve ever actually liked.</li>
            <li> I used this for Halloween and it was a thousand times better than using costume makeup. It gave me a lovely pale complexion.</li>
            <li> Definitely works better if applied with a brush. Goes on evenly. Did have to re-apply a couple times but I wore without foundation so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Worked very well...better than make-up from Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product. Love wearing it out to goth clubs.</li>
            <li> Loved this only problem is I figured out I could use it as a regular foundation, was not aware that I was this pale! Good product for the price though MAC will always be my favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to exfoliate &amp; moisturize before usage and you will love it. ^v^ I will never use other Gothic white powders again.</li>
            <li> It shipped really quickly, in 3 days. It looks great over my foundation. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this. Definitely recommend this to people with light skin, or to people who want their skin to look lighter.</li>
            <li> Was as described &amp; shipping was only 2 days. It was on the pricey side, yet needing it so close to Halloween it did in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for costuming. Originally for a costume where I needed a white face, I tried cream makeup, but that was a disaster (thick and hard to apply, felt weird and itchy on, cracked in lines that made me look older than I am, etc.). This powder works and feels just like any face powder, and also was transclucent enough to show the blush underneath that the makeup job required for costume accuracy. It&#x27;s easy to apply and reapply, and lasts all day. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the price but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m going for the whole &amp;#34;dead bride&amp;#34; look for Halloween and I really hate that whit face paint that rubs off everywhere, so this was an excellent solution.</li>
            <li> This a great product to set very light liquid concealers under the eyes or elsewhere for those of us who are pale Spring, Summer, Fall, and/or Winter. There&#x27;s no shimmer so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it as a cheekbone highlighter but it can work if you&#x27;re going for a matte look. It&#x27;s also great paired with the Mani Panic&#x27;s liquid white foundation if you&#x27;re going for a classic goth look :) It&#x27;s pretty translucent but can also be layered for full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and have no problem&#x27;s using this product. I&#x27;m painfully white, and this powder is the first time I&#x27;ve not looked like I smeared dirt or tanner on my skin. It&#x27;s a really soft powder and easy to work with. I use it with a stipling brush and it&#x27;s perfect. My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t quite as much as I would like. i haven&#x27;t had it long and I&#x27;m already seeing the bottom peek through. For such a large container there isn&#x27;t much in there, but that seems to often be the case with Manic Panic products. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Halloween costume as well as daily wear. I have extremely fair skin, even makeup specifically made for paleskin/redheads is typically too dark for me. White out makeup tends to be the only thing light enough. I also bought this for my Halloween costume which involved white out skull makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For white out costume makeup, this is perfect! I also used Mehron white magic sticks (which is like an opaque white out stick foundation). This powder helped it actually set so that it was dry to the touch and lasted all night (7+ hours) with no touch up needed! It also evened out the white out makeup so that it looked totally smooth and streak free. I got compliments on it all night and I still have people asking me how I was able to achieve and completely dry, matte, shine free, even, streak free white base. This is ideal for costume makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could say the same for daily wear :/ The color is perfect for my skin tone! It evens out my skin and helps lighten up my (always too dark) foundation. The HUGE problem is the texture/finish. Over a natural looking foundation or tinted moisturizer, this looks very cakey and artificial. It settles into pores very badly, making them look huge and dark. It almost gives you the appearance of having black heads in big pores, the exact opposite of what I am looking for in my daily makeup. It looks bad pretty much immediately upon application, and just looks cakier the longer you wear it. It also is so dry that it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and that is coming from someone with oily skin. It also sits heavy, it definitely feels like you are wearing a lot more makeup than you are. The sheer white color also seems to exacerbate the appearance of redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend this over any other powder for white out costume makeups like skulls, but for daily wear it just didn&#x27;t work for me :/ Maybe someone with less redness and a normal (instead of oily) skin type could make better use of this.is.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying white powder to use normally, even though I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people have suggested it. First off, I&#x27;m very pale. I&#x27;ve been everywhere and tried everything, and no brand makes makeup pale enough for me. I have cool/blue undertones. A light coating of this powder looks completely natural (I use white eyeliner sometimes for a light concealer, and this is perfect to set it) and not too pale at all. This powder is white as paper, but on my skin it doesn&#x27;t look as pale as all that. It feels nice and light on my skin (I used a kabuki brush, not the included pad), and doesn&#x27;t make me paler, just looks like it should as powder.</li>
            <li> works great!! stays on good, but if its hot outside I would recommend not wearing it (especially if you&#x27;re not pale) because it looks bad when you sweat a little. wore it to a convention and i was burning up and the makeup started looking uneven, and it was pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> perfect for my halloween..</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation and it worked wonderfully. Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish). I also never accidentally rubbed it off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: be prepared for it to accentuate any areas of dry skin or enlarged pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t happen with skin toned makeup. All in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li> This worked well and got me the color I wanted. It is legitimately white-white. I used it for a Harley Quinn costume, and it was exactly what I wanted. I also have very sensitive skin, and it did not irritate it in the slightest. My only problem was that it was a little messy (which powder can be) and that it seemed to wear/fade fairly quickly as far as makeup I&#x27;ve used goes. But if you don&#x27;t mind re-applying every so often, it is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s perfect in every way. I had the Moonlight one, which I loved, and which matched my skin tone, but I wanted to go lighter, and this works very well. And I have tried other white loose powders, but this pressed powder is the best.</li>
            <li> best color! pure white</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for about ten years and it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve found to get that &amp;#34;freshly dead&amp;#34; look. Perfect for vampires, zombies, or just for a pale white look. It does tend to get a little flaky.. But that is easily fixed when you accompany it with the gothic white cream stuff and give it a good blend. I personally don&#x27;t mind the flaky effect as you can only really tell very close up, in direct sunlight. Not so much at night.. And let&#x27;s face it.. If you&#x27;re using this stuff, you&#x27;re probably not a &amp;#34;day person&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love manic panic products and I have a gothic side I love this makeup it makes me look the way I want it when I want it I recommend this product to anyone that loves manic panic products and to anyone with a gothic side</li>
            <li> Great shipping/delivery, LOVE the product. I usually use with a stipple brush under my eyes and it works to even out the tone of my face while still adding a highlight. The little puff that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t work, but not a bad thing to have for usage with other powders and such. Came in a cute mesh bag, I love the packaging! Overall, doesn&#x27;t break me out. Feels light. A really decent purchase, would definitely repurchase (though I use it sparingly so it&#x27;ll be a while before I run out). Would recommend this seller and this product to anyone. GREAT for fair skin! Would be hard to blend for costume coverage but very doable, definitely a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; white makeup. Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white powder. It&#x27;s got talc in it so you could maybe just use babypowder for way less but that would be easy to breathe in and that&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;Would give it a higher review but it&#x27;s so overpriced. It is mostly talc, comes with a cheap foam pad instead of one of those smoother applicators. Have to use a *really* light hand or it cakes and looks patchy. Takes a bit of practice to apply smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay, because I treated it as another substitute for Clown make up... But I am a tan native and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me. But it does last a long time and is very convenient for quick white out!</li>
            <li> Just enough white color to look like a vampire and not a clown. You can control how much white color you want to put on by how much you apply or wether you apply it wet or dry. I used the manic panic dreamtone foundation under it. It&#x27;s not a foundation but more like a primer which acts to get the red tones out of your skin. Then this powder sets the look. Perfect when paired together.</li>
