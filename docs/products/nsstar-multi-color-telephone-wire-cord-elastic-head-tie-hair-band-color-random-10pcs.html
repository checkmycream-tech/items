            <li>They are nice</li>
            <li>loved my hair bands, very unique and they don&#x27;t leave crease mark.</li>
            <li>It stretch out too easily, but price is good.</li>
            <li>They are good but not as strong as one i have at home.</li>
            <li>and these hold ALL of my hair up in a bun for many hours before it starts to loosen.</li>
            <li>But they did the job of satisfying my daughter</li>
            <li>I have used better at a better price.</li>
            <li>I just love how easy they feel in the hair, no pulling or tangling.</li>
            <li>and it is easy...</li>
            <li>HUGE HIT.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy more in tje future</li>
            <li>they stay stretched out, the one I have from Bath and Body was much more $$</li>
            <li>Stretch out too much after one use.  </li>
            <li>I have other brands that work MUCH BETTER,</li>
            <li>After stretching out they revert back to their original size (not immediately, but eventually)</li>
            <li>The elasticity is ok its not as tight as I want it to be</li>
            <li>However, I have an extremely voluminous hair, so that is only one kind of head tie that it works for me.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t damage her hair, are colorful, and she can&#x27;t find them in the stores locally.</li>
            <li>These hair ties are my new obsession.  </li>

            <li> No tangles! No ripping out my hair! I have long hair that goes well past my waist and these hold ALL of my hair up in a bun for many hours before it starts to loosen. Great hair ties!!!</li>
            <li> they stay stretched out, the one I have from Bath and Body was much more $$ but the quality difference is apparent&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if one of the products didn&#x27;t broke. It snapped it half as I was trying to put it on my hair. The rest of the product are sturdy tho but, how I wish the colors were a lil&#x27; solid.</li>
            <li> Actually a gift for a friend, but she loves them.  They don&#x27;t damage her hair, are colorful, and she can&#x27;t find them in the stores locally.</li>
            <li> It is thinner than I thought, I was expecting a head tie larger than that. However, I have an extremely voluminous hair, so that is only one kind of head tie that it works for me.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are my new obsession.  I just love how easy they feel in the hair, no pulling or tangling.</li>
            <li> This coulorful wire looks cannot tight the hair...but it just perfect for me. like the color and it is easy...</li>
            <li> I love these colors! It works great. Only reason I give out 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last long. It stretch out too easily, but price is good. I will buy again</li>
            <li> They are good but not as strong as one i have at home. But they did the job of satisfying my daughter</li>
            <li> loved my hair bands, very unique and they don&#x27;t leave crease mark. You even forget you have your hair in a ponytail or bun until you go to bed! Loved the assortment I got :)</li>
            <li> I love these!!! I gave some to my Bunny friends. They&lt;br /&gt;were going nuts. HUGE HIT.</li>
            <li> They are nice I just wish they were solid colors so you can use them with outfits.</li>
            <li> It is really beautiful, I love it!</li>
            <li> Good price for the quality. The elasticity is ok its not as tight as I want it to be but it works. I would probably buy more in tje future</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Stretch out too much after one use.  I have other brands that work MUCH BETTER,</li>
            <li> These are not as tight a coil as the ones I already possesses. You have to wrap three times for a tight hold.</li>
            <li> Although I like these hair ditties, they don&#x27;t seem to be tight enough.  They do retain their shape though.  After stretching out they revert back to their original size (not immediately, but eventually)</li>
            <li> Very weak. I have used better at a better price. Not worth it.</li>
