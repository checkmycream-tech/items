            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t plan on switching to a different shampoo or conditioner since my hair responds to these extremely well!</li>
            <li> My scalp is so oily and my hair is so dry.  </li>
            <li> This is for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I never use a brush &amp; I always air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally not at all oily.  </li>
            <li> The bottles have the small flip top with the small hole so you won&#x27;t waste waste product.</li>
            <li> Very dry and course to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Although it takes quite a bit of Shampoo for my long thick hair to get some lather going, the shampoo bottle has lasted quite some time (only wash my hair 2-3 times/week).  </li>
            <li> I switched to Renpure Originals, Brazillian Keratin Re-Hydrating &amp; it weighted my hair down).</li>
            <li> I have very thick (not the average thick, like, so much hair) and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this actually.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very long thick hair and since using this product, not only are there no more tangles, there are no more fights about washing her hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even a few hours after washing it, my hair seems to have a grime to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also notice way less split ends!</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels nice once you put it in, but I just can&#x27;t get past how disgusting the shampoo feels.  </li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker and maybe a few inches past my shoulders...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipino &amp; my hair&#x27;s color treated &amp; a combo of mainly thick strands &amp; less thin ones, down to my waist &amp; a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Just not appealing at all</li>
            <li> The smell just seems terrible - not like a personal preference either - they both smell like they&#x27;re really old</li>
            <li> My hair is so filthy and oily.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I really liked the conditioner but the Shampoo wasn&#x27;t so great.  It took a lot to get some suds going and for me to feel like I was washing all of my hair.  My hair is thicker and maybe a few inches past my shoulders...  I ran out of shampoo well before the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Although it takes quite a bit of Shampoo for my long thick hair to get some lather going, the shampoo bottle has lasted quite some time (only wash my hair 2-3 times/week).  I love the way my hair feels after using the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair smells good for several days, and since using Alba botanica, my scalp has stopped itching.</li>
            <li> Love how it smell and it cleans my hair without damaging it. The conditioner is amazing, I dont rinse everything, I leave a little and let my naturally curly hair dry on its own. Love the natural and hidrated curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo buuuuuttttt leaves a lot of buildup and makes me feel dirty ðŸ˜©</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find that perfect natural shampoo.  This isn&#x27;t it.  I really wanted to like it.  It smells great, is natural, and seems healthy for your hair.  The first time I washed my hair, it was great.  My hair was so soft!  As I kept using it, it seemed to lose it&#x27;s cleaning power.  My hair is so filthy and oily.  Even a few hours after washing it, my hair seems to have a grime to it.  My scalp is so oily and my hair is so dry.  I&#x27;ve also never struggled with dandruff before, but all of a sudden I do!  My hair is naturally oily, so perhaps this shampoo is best for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have very thick (not the average thick, like, so much hair) and curly hair.  It&#x27;s wavy in the front and kinky curly in the back.  I am Caucasian.  The shampoo isn&#x27;t that great.  It made my hair feel like I just got out of chlorinated water.  Very dry and course to the touch.  The conditioner feels nice once you put it in, but I just can&#x27;t get past how disgusting the shampoo feels.  My boyfriend also hates the smell.  It smells like coconut, but, honestly, Suave shampoo smells better than this stuff.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  If you do have curly hair that doesn&#x27;t get greasy, I&#x27;d recommend DivaCurl.  I used the no-poo and the daily conditioner.  You need a clarifying shampoo if you use products, and once a week.  I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, you need the clarifying shampoo.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll have dandruff or grease or product build.  KMS more moisture has also worked well in my hair in the past.  But, if you have damaged hair I really recommend the DivaCurl.  I&#x27;m trying Amika products now.  We&#x27;ll see how that goes once I get them.</li>
            <li> Decided to buy this product after my daughter got her hair so knotted up that I needed to take her to the salon to untangle it. Guy at work recommended this product saying it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t tangle his daughters hair. He was right! My daughter has very long thick hair and since using this product, not only are there no more tangles, there are no more fights about washing her hair.</li>
            <li> for my daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Alba&#x27;s products. Once again, I am very satisfied with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I looooooove this product very much. My hair feels much healthier now than it did before.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this shampoo and conditioner.  I like the way it makes my hair smell.  I just wish the smell was less sweet.</li>
            <li> I love every product I&#x27;ve ever used by this company.  I love the fragrance and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it had pretty good reviews but i gotta say its just OK...It was good for a one tiime buy but i will not order it again.The shampoo is to runny and takes a lot to cover my head but the conditioner works ok untill you have to brush your hair. If your hair tangles easy you might not want to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. The shampoo didn&#x27;t really lather up much and the conditioner left my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite Alba product.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t create a very nice lather which would be okay if it still washed my hair well.  I found that after using it for a couple weeks my hair had build up and was greasy.  My hair is normally not at all oily.  The smell is nice but overall effectiveness of the product is not good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! This smells amazing and leaves my fine hair soft and not weighed down ! I highly recommend this product! !!</li>
            <li> This is for dry hair. If you have normal to oily hsir it makes your hair greasy and it never really feels clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipino &amp; my hair&#x27;s color treated &amp; a combo of mainly thick strands &amp; less thin ones, down to my waist &amp; a lot of it. I started out using Organic Paraben free shampoo a yr or two ago. The 1st Organic shampoo/cond. was (Renpure Originals Argan Oil which made my hair really staticky, especially during the summer. I switched to Renpure Originals, Brazillian Keratin Re-Hydrating &amp; it weighted my hair down). This is my 3rd Organic Shampoo set ever. This is the only Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I have ever used, that makes the lower half feel just like the top of my hair. The bottles have the small flip top with the small hole so you won&#x27;t waste waste product. The shampoo is a clear liquid &amp; lathers like (Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Awapuhi) if you&#x27;re familiar with it. I have to shampoo twice the get a rich lather. The conditioner is thick &amp; a little goes a long way. I use close about a tsp conditioner let it sit for 2 min. I use about a tbs shampoo. The conditioner is what I&#x27;m really in love with, it&#x27;s like silky &amp; evenly distributes evenly. I like the scent but the results are what really impresses me. My hair is super silky, soft, not weighted down, no static &amp; easier to comb. I never use a brush &amp; I always air dry. I&#x27;ve also notice way less split ends!, my hair used to be coarse like a horse tail before I started using regular pruducts. I will say that Paraben free organic shampoo/cond. have improved the texture of my hair in general. Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft which helps a lot in the texture.     I definitely don&#x27;t plan on switching to a different shampoo or conditioner since my hair responds to these extremely well!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is amazing as others have already said, it is thick and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of it to do the job. The shampoo is good as well. However, if you have never used natural shampoo, you need to remember it is not going to be as sudsy as regular shampoo. It can feel like you aren&#x27;t really cleaning your hair in the beginning when you first start using natural shampoo because of the difference. It just takes some adjustment on your part.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but the shampoo does not lather as much as I&#x27;d hoped. It still gets my hair clean and looking great!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this actually.  The smell just seems terrible - not like a personal preference either - they both smell like they&#x27;re really old are the formula wasn&#x27;t done correctly.  Just not appealing at all and the odor is pretty strong so I don&#x27;t want to be breathing it in in case there&#x27;s something in it that shouldn&#x27;t be. Very odd.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
