            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>trust me its great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I tried Peter Thomas Cooling Sulfur Masque and loved it.</li>
            <li>and I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>Love how the mask draws out impurities from my pores.</li>
            <li>After trying countless acne treatment options, both allopathic and naturopathic, I decided to give this a try after reading the impressive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love using this product to keep my breakouts under control.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it diligently every week.</li>
            <li>The mask goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I soak a wash cloth in warm water and gently remove the mask.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, only takes 5-10 minutes, washes off clean and leaves face softer and pores minimized.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve seen clear skin in months I&#x27;m so happy and</li>
            <li>Those with dry skin may find this a bit too drying, so just be sure to use a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have tried this as a mask a few times and it makes my skin nice and smooth but don&#x27;t think its really amazing.</li>
            <li>loved this mask so much that I bought one for my sister who is battling adult acne and discoloration</li>
            <li>Also helps tremendously with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Skin is left so smooth that makeup adheres to the skin better.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone willing to listen.</li>
            <li>I have deep scars from acne as a teenager and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I find that it really helps calm down inflammation, absorb excess oil, and leaves the skin feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The sulfur smell lingers a little bit after rinsing, so if you decide to use it in the morning, make sure you shower afterwards!</li>
            <li>Huge container, will last forever.</li>
            <li>It really helps with excess oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this sulfur mask.</li>
            <li>I originally bought mine from Ulta, which gives a 60 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says it will do: provide a deep pore clean, reduce acne and fade blemishes which is what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>For me, this is amazing for my rosacea and after using it a few days, I noticed my skin considerably calmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s worth a try though, because everyone is different and sulfur seems very beneficial for some people.  </li>
            <li>used to use Prosacea, which has Sulfur as a main ingredient.</li>
            <li>Not only does it suck up the oil and sebum but it provides a deep clean feeling and skin is left smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and it takes a pimple from the beginning bump to white head and gone so much faster.</li>
            <li>not dry your skin out too much.</li>
            <li>This may work well for milder acne, but for relentless hormonal cystic acne, it seems to be completely ineffective in my case.</li>
            <li>It did clear up one massive cyst on my chin in a few days using it like a spot treatment though:)</li>
            <li>reason for the 4 stars is that I felt my pimple didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li>have not yet developed a &amp;#34;head.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have small blemishes nothing huge</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It helped a lot, but it would dry out my skin, causing it to be much oilier.</li>
            <li>I could tell a major difference after just one week of three times/ week.</li>
            <li>you only need a little to cover your whole face.</li>

            <li> My skin is DRY</li>
            <li> It has dried out some of my bigger breakouts within 2-3 uses of this (every other day).</li>
            <li> But it definitely toned down the inflammation and redness within a few days.</li>
            <li> I apply three times a week and after one month my skin improved a lot (I&#x27;ve been using other PTR products in addition too).</li>

            <li> I use this every other day and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Bad product in comparison to Acne Free Sulfur Mask.</li>
            <li> and they are gone like literally gone in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I seriously can not brag enough.</li>
            <li> I used to use Proactiv&#x27;s sulfur mask, but I find this one a little bit less drying.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after using it four days a week for nearly 2 months, I haven&#x27;t had any improvement at all in my skin condition.  </li>
            <li> and I mean DRY!!</li>
            <li> im a person who suffers with genetic acne and this helped clear my skin and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a week for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li> So, no money lost and at least now I know whether or not it&#x27;s helpful for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive, but at least you get a generous 5 ounces.</li>
            <li> It works but it is expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone willing to listen. This stuff does wonders!!&#x27; First time I&#x27;ve seen clear skin in months I&#x27;m so happy and people even notice the difference!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It really helps with excess oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve oil skin, prone to blemish and I liked this product a lot. I apply three times a week and after one month my skin improved a lot (I&#x27;ve been using other PTR products in addition too).</li>
            <li> Love how the mask draws out impurities from my pores.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS which has caused me to develop severe cystic acne.  After trying countless acne treatment options, both allopathic and naturopathic, I decided to give this a try after reading the impressive reviews.  Sadly, after using it four days a week for nearly 2 months, I haven&#x27;t had any improvement at all in my skin condition.  This may work well for milder acne, but for relentless hormonal cystic acne, it seems to be completely ineffective in my case. I will say it&#x27;s worth a try though, because everyone is different and sulfur seems very beneficial for some people.  I originally bought mine from Ulta, which gives a 60 day money back guarantee.  So, no money lost and at least now I know whether or not it&#x27;s helpful for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have been getting some cystic acne spots for a while now....think its stress related as I never used to get them. I have tried this as a mask a few times and it makes my skin nice and smooth but don&#x27;t think its really amazing. It did clear up one massive cyst on my chin in a few days using it like a spot treatment though:)</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry your skin out too much. I use it as a spot treatment as well as a masque.&lt;br /&gt;Great for problem skin.</li>
            <li> Bad product in comparison to Acne Free Sulfur Mask. This product showed no difference in acne. will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from rosacea, this mask may help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Prosacea, which has Sulfur as a main ingredient. It helped a lot, but it would dry out my skin, causing it to be much oilier. I found this mask and noticed a lot of people mentioning how well it worked for their acne. For me, this is amazing for my rosacea and after using it a few days, I noticed my skin considerably calmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely give this mask a try.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to keep my breakouts under control. It has dried out some of my bigger breakouts within 2-3 uses of this (every other day). Keep in mind, this wasn&#x27;t the only product I used. I used a spot treatment by Clinique and Dr Dennis Gross at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars is that I felt my pimple didn&#x27;t completely go away. It did dry out, but it was still noticeably there, even after 2 weeks. But it definitely toned down the inflammation and redness within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with extremely oily/acne prone skin.  I tried Peter Thomas Cooling Sulfur Masque and loved it. However, I decided to try the Therapeutic Masque since it is especially formulated for acne treatment. The mask goes on smoothly. I use less than a generous amount but more than a thin layer.  I leave it on for 30 minutes while I do chores. I soak a wash cloth in warm water and gently remove the mask. Not only does it suck up the oil and sebum but it provides a deep clean feeling and skin is left smooth and refreshed. Skin is left so smooth that makeup adheres to the skin better. I&#x27;ve notice that after using the mask, the pimples and black heads dry up quickly - to the extent that extracting black heads is painless since it does not irritate the skin thus reducing blemishes. With regular use it fades blemishes left by acne.  I use my mask 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this mask so much that I bought one for my sister who is battling adult acne and discoloration (she had dark patches near her lips and nose).  After using this product for a month it looked like she was wearing make up.  Her acne and her discoloration were gone! I know this product is not marketed for discoloration but those who suffer from it may benefit from this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had oily/acne prone skin since puberty so I am not expecting this product to change my skin. It does what it says it will do: provide a deep pore clean, reduce acne and fade blemishes which is what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I have deep scars from acne as a teenager and my skin has never looked better. I could tell a major difference after just one week of three times/ week. I love it and use it diligently every week.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, only takes 5-10 minutes, washes off clean and leaves face softer and pores minimized. Also helps tremendously with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this sulfur mask. I used to use Proactiv&#x27;s sulfur mask, but I find this one a little bit less drying. I have oily, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a week for the past couple of months. I find that it really helps calm down inflammation, absorb excess oil, and leaves the skin feeling very clean and fresh. I&#x27;ve also used it as a spot-treatment on zits that are just emerging/have not yet developed a &amp;#34;head.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s no instant overnight fix, but it does help reduce inflammation. Those with dry skin may find this a bit too drying, so just be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sulfur-based so it has that not-so-nice smell. The sulfur smell lingers a little bit after rinsing, so if you decide to use it in the morning, make sure you shower afterwards! It&#x27;s quite expensive, but at least you get a generous 5 ounces. I bought it when the price was a lot lower on Amazon... it seems to have gone all the way back up since my purchase. If I can continue to find this at a discount, I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32, I have combination skin and hormonal breakouts. I use this a couple of times a month and as a spot treatment and it is a miracle. My skin is much clearer and it takes a pimple from the beginning bump to white head and gone so much faster. Huge container, will last forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Ya it smells but IT WORKS!!! I have small blemishes nothing huge and they are gone like literally gone in less than a week. My husband gets cystic acne and happened to have one on his neck so he used this as a spot treatment and the next morning it was a quarter of the size it was before redness was gone and it didn&#x27;t dry his skin. My skin is DRY and I mean DRY!! I use this every other day and have had no issues. I use a daily moisturizer and night cream though. I seriously can not brag enough. Buy this! 40$ is a little high but the jar will last FOREVER you only need a little to cover your whole face. if your on the fence BUY IT you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Was using similar product for years and this meets the same standards.</li>
            <li> im a person who suffers with genetic acne and this helped clear my skin and acne scars. trust me its great!</li>
