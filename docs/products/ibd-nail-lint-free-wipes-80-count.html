            <li>These are great for removing nail polish.</li>

            <li>These lint free wipes work great to cleanse the nail when you do gel nails!</li>
            <li>These are perfect for removing the tacky layer from my Shellac and for applying Scrub Fresh...basically for anything that requires a couple quick swipes on each nail.</li>
            <li>I love this and will order more when I run out!!</li>
            <li>I use these to do my nails and love them!</li>
            <li>First of all they are perfect for using with polish remover.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>SO YOU WILL NEED TO BUY YOUR OWN ACETONE OR ALCOHOL TO ADD TO THEM.  </li>
            <li>and they will do an equally good job cleaning the tackiness from shellac top coat.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had too much experience with nail wipes, but these ones are great!</li>
            <li>I expect either will be as good or better.  </li>
            <li>Good to cleanse nails as well as remove gel nail top coat residue.</li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>They clean the nails great</li>
            <li>I saw a video on youtube showing a Shellac how-to and noticed the girl removing the tacky layer from the Shellac top coat with these wipes.  </li>
            <li>Now that I blow up the photo of the box in the product, I can see that the product actually is more of a hexagon-shaped foam pad than the cosmetic rounds</li>
            <li>I used with my gelish products and am really satisfied with the lerformance</li>
            <li>I love them when working with the gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>if you use one pad on more than two or three nails it will start to rip, but still wont leave any lint.</li>
            <li>Im not quite sure how to use it yet, so its just sitting there..</li>
            <li>Love this product, so much better than cotton or cotton squares as you don&#x27;t need to re-soak.</li>
            <li>and you have to use more than one for each finger</li>
            <li>Ok, so I just learned that these aren&#x27;t for removing polish but for preping your nail.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be a more dense sponge</li>
            <li>The work ok.</li>
            <li>but they fall apart and you have to go through too many to consider them functional.  </li>
            <li>I love these instead of using cotton balls.</li>
            <li>Ok can be used for sponge art.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than cotton pads.</li>
            <li>I use them to remove the tacky/sticky layer that forms on my nails once I finish using the CND Shellac Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I wish it have more description of this product.</li>
            <li>I love these they are perfect because you dont have to worry about wasting a larger lint fee wipe.</li>
            <li>I have applied it both ways and the gelish stays on for two weeks or more for my clients who take care of their nails.  </li>
            <li>I love them, and I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li>but these work much, much better.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews more closely.  </li>
            <li>For polish removal, I prefer the Ultra Cosmetic pads, which are thicker and allow for more saturation.</li>
            <li>Love these pads.</li>
            <li>The best part is there is no debris left on the nails even if they haven&#x27;t cured all the way before you wipe.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on :)</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT FOR MY WIFE AND CLEANS OUT FAST.</li>
            <li>These wipes are a great product especially for doing your own gel nails.</li>
            <li>I received on time, good condition and used them for my daughters wedding welcome bag along with other after party remedies.</li>
            <li>I like these much better than the first kind I had and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfect nail wipes for gel polish, clean and lint free, only need one for both hands.</li>
            <li>They are well-perforated so they come off easily.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t have any lint, but I took off a star because they tear easily.</li>
            <li>Also had to carry them out of the country as they were easily packed in suitcase.</li>
            <li>I think it was fine.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super durable, but I don&#x27;t need them to be!</li>
            <li>These wipes are perfect for manicures because they don&#x27;t leave the traces of lint that mess up your polish.  </li>
            <li>They last forever and are great.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that these nail wipes are lint free, unlike cotton balls or cotton pads.</li>
            <li>The IBD nail Wipes are definately lint free.</li>
            <li>I bought these because everyone said you need lint free wipes for the Shellac/Gelish manicures.</li>
            <li>I have used so-called lint free wipes, pre-moistened wipes and cotton balls however they cannot compare to the work that these IBD wipes do.</li>
            <li>Use these lint free wipes instead of cotton balls to remove polish or apply scrubfresh, keep the amount of fuzzys out of your polish.</li>
            <li>This wipe is truly lint free.  </li>
            <li>rounds\\&quot; or whatever else is available on the market.  </li>
            <li>These are worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It is a neat, clean solution.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d rather remove my nail polish with a cotton ball and then use these to clean of the excess cotton from my clean nail</li>
            <li>I use cotton squares for the post-painting clean off without issue.</li>
            <li>these are excellent for removing polish, just enough remover on each pad to last for three nails.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely lint free, holds the Nail Cleansing solution with no drips.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product a few times and it works great.</li>
            <li>Four stars only because I thought they would be some kind of cotton.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the money and work well.</li>
            <li>The lint free wipes actually ruined the finish of the top coat</li>
            <li>, the box came crushed so the presentation wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>When doing French tips, these work nicely in the cap of my acetone for cleaning excess gel off my brush.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be more like a cleansing pad (those round pads you buy at the store), but its more like spunge/foam material.</li>
            <li>Amazon does a great job in having items that are hard to find @</li>
            <li>So you only should have to use one or two at most.</li>
            <li>Not worth returning (and it seems as though these foam blocks are, indeed, a \\&quot;lint free nail wipe\\&quot;) but save yourself some time and money and just go to the store and buy foam makeup wedges and cut them up because that would give you better quality foam wipes than these were.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a savings of $1.55; your savings will be even greater if you purchase the swabs at your local drug store and save the shipping cost, not to mention they are already saturated with alcohol saving you the additional cost of purchasing the rubbing alcohol  separately.  </li>
            <li>Completely lint free as well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what they look like.</li>
            <li>This product is great, there can&#x27;t be a complaint with a nail wipe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is totally lint free and works very well!</li>
            <li>I really do like these.  </li>
            <li>They are very durable plus they remove almost anything.</li>
            <li>I also find they remove glitter much easier</li>
            <li>These wipes have made my polishing so much easier and neater.</li>
            <li>Really do the job of getting polish off nails without getting lint on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for prepping and finishing gel nails.</li>
            <li>These nail wipes hold up very well and help in the removal of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Its great and doesn&#x27;t leave behind the stuff that cotton balls would.</li>
            <li>and I really swear by these guys to get the job done without getting chunks of dust or lint all over my nails.</li>
            <li>Very ecnomical.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Fast in shipping.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold much liquid, but are lint-free as advertised.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is really a&lt;br /&gt;lint-free product.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>its a nice small size</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using them.  </li>
            <li>These are worth buying because for your money they actually do work as advertised!</li>
            <li>The alcohol swabs are also lint free and you only need one for all ten nails, so they are also comparable in that respect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of nail wipes claim to be lint free, but these are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that actually are.</li>
            <li>They also clean off several nails with just a tiny amount of polish remover.</li>
            <li>No little cotton blobs or lint stuck to your nails afterwards!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I suppose they will last longer, but wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>If you have nail polish that is sort of thick on your nail, you&#x27;ll need to use more that five for one hand&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure if they are worth sending them back because I am in Afghanistan and the trouble with finding time to go to the Post Office is not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>A little rubbing alcohol to prep my nails should either evaporate for subsequent uses and/or come out easily in the wash.  </li>
            <li>They are lint free and allow you to use a small amount of remover.</li>
            <li>love not having to pick little bits of lint/strings of cotton out of my carefully manicured nails, ruining them in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use them on my natural nails with regular (not gel/shellac) polish.</li>
            <li>They are very thinh and not very dense at all.</li>
            <li>I get better results with a cotton ball &amp; alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t leave any cotton bits or lint behind.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but these lint free wipes are in reality little sponges.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to wipe without leaving any residue behind or marks.</li>

            <li> I have used so-called lint free wipes, pre-moistened wipes and cotton balls however they cannot compare to the work that these IBD wipes do.</li>
            <li> Use these lint free wipes instead of cotton balls to remove polish or apply scrubfresh, keep the amount of fuzzys out of your polish.</li>
            <li> This wipe is truly lint free.  </li>
            <li> rounds\\&quot; or whatever else is available on the market.  </li>
            <li> These are worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It is a neat, clean solution.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d rather remove my nail polish with a cotton ball and then use these to clean of the excess cotton from my clean nail</li>
            <li> I use cotton squares for the post-painting clean off without issue.</li>
            <li> these are excellent for removing polish, just enough remover on each pad to last for three nails.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely lint free, holds the Nail Cleansing solution with no drips.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few times and it works great.</li>
            <li> Four stars only because I thought they would be some kind of cotton.  </li>
            <li> They are worth the money and work well.</li>
            <li> The lint free wipes actually ruined the finish of the top coat</li>
            <li> , the box came crushed so the presentation wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> When doing French tips, these work nicely in the cap of my acetone for cleaning excess gel off my brush.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be more like a cleansing pad (those round pads you buy at the store), but its more like spunge/foam material.</li>
            <li> Amazon does a great job in having items that are hard to find @</li>
            <li> So you only should have to use one or two at most.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning (and it seems as though these foam blocks are, indeed, a \\&quot;lint free nail wipe\\&quot;) but save yourself some time and money and just go to the store and buy foam makeup wedges and cut them up because that would give you better quality foam wipes than these were.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a savings of $1.55; your savings will be even greater if you purchase the swabs at your local drug store and save the shipping cost, not to mention they are already saturated with alcohol saving you the additional cost of purchasing the rubbing alcohol  separately.  </li>
            <li> Completely lint free as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what they look like.</li>
            <li> This product is great, there can&#x27;t be a complaint with a nail wipe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is totally lint free and works very well!</li>
            <li> I really do like these.  </li>
            <li> They are very durable plus they remove almost anything.</li>
            <li> I also find they remove glitter much easier</li>
            <li> These wipes have made my polishing so much easier and neater.</li>
            <li> Really do the job of getting polish off nails without getting lint on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for prepping and finishing gel nails.</li>
            <li> These nail wipes hold up very well and help in the removal of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Its great and doesn&#x27;t leave behind the stuff that cotton balls would.</li>
            <li> and I really swear by these guys to get the job done without getting chunks of dust or lint all over my nails.</li>
            <li> Very ecnomical.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> Fast in shipping.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold much liquid, but are lint-free as advertised.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is really a&lt;br /&gt;lint-free product.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> its a nice small size</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using them.  </li>
            <li> These are worth buying because for your money they actually do work as advertised!</li>
            <li> The alcohol swabs are also lint free and you only need one for all ten nails, so they are also comparable in that respect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of nail wipes claim to be lint free, but these are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that actually are.</li>
            <li> They also clean off several nails with just a tiny amount of polish remover.</li>
            <li> No little cotton blobs or lint stuck to your nails afterwards!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I suppose they will last longer, but wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> If you have nail polish that is sort of thick on your nail, you&#x27;ll need to use more that five for one hand&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am not even sure if they are worth sending them back because I am in Afghanistan and the trouble with finding time to go to the Post Office is not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> A little rubbing alcohol to prep my nails should either evaporate for subsequent uses and/or come out easily in the wash.  </li>
            <li> They are lint free and allow you to use a small amount of remover.</li>
            <li> love not having to pick little bits of lint/strings of cotton out of my carefully manicured nails, ruining them in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them on my natural nails with regular (not gel/shellac) polish.</li>
            <li> They are very thinh and not very dense at all.</li>
            <li> I get better results with a cotton ball &amp; alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t leave any cotton bits or lint behind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but these lint free wipes are in reality little sponges.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to wipe without leaving any residue behind or marks.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a flat cloth type wipe</li>
            <li> Really, picture on box is deceiving, they are MUCH smaller, and hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> They seem to be just little sponges, so you could probably manage cheaper by just cutting your own.  </li>
            <li> I use them to dry wipe the nail after the foundation gel is applied.</li>
            <li> The lint-free factor is pretty sweet and they hold up well even under the stress of my stupid</li>
            <li> I would prefer them to be a little bit larger, but they work extremely well just the same.</li>
            <li> These are dry sponges which I have absolutely no use for.  </li>
            <li> it ripped apart and left little pieces of lint stuck to the nail.</li>
            <li> My bad I guess for not reading the description more carefully</li>
            <li> Purchased this item expecting to receive a box like the one shown in the photo, and in the box I expected to find lint-free cosmetic rounds.</li>
            <li> this is not what i expected to get.  </li>
            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> These were not what I expected but that was my fault.</li>
            <li> No lint left over from the cotton that you would typically use!</li>
            <li> Just Purchased this as a gift, when it came the box was all crushed but other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> They start to break down and dissolve in time.</li>
            <li> ; kept removing the mess, rinsed it out &amp; used it again for rest of the mess, then I just disposed of it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, these are small sponges, they are alright, I will also be using them for nail art work.</li>
            <li> These are little octogon sponges NOT wipes.</li>
            <li> Little foam hexagons.</li>
            <li> The are just little sponges.</li>
            <li> These are little sponges.  </li>
            <li> but they are actually little mini sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical because they are so small and they look very porous, and I think they will drip acetone heavily as soon as they are pushed against the nail.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these is they don&#x27;t sell them in bulk!</li>
            <li> I was using little round cotton pads to use with Alcohol to wipe my gel polish after they came out of the UV lamp.</li>
            <li> waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> , so I used these things and they are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I pulled out what appeared to be a small, trashbag material black bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting when I bought them, but they are little sextagon(sp?) shaped sponges.</li>
            <li> The nail wipes I have used in the past were a fiber material.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH better than the horrible \\&quot;cotton</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these little sponges.  </li>
            <li> They do not leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> Not great for wiping your brush on them.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why others have rated these wipes poorly or think that they came saturated in alcohol.</li>
            <li> These were totally useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers suggested buying pre-moistened alcohol wipes at the drug store or cutting up make up sponges.  </li>
            <li> They work well without leaving those annoying bits of cotton behind from the pads I was using before.</li>
            <li> I had a bad cut on my finger, put alcolol on one of these &amp;#34;Lil&#x27; BAD BOYS&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am so sick of cotton getting into my polish after I prep my nails.</li>
            <li> I hated using cotton swabs or cotton pads.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really do like these.  I&#x27;d never used them before &amp; must say &amp;#34;I&#x27;M SOLD&amp;#34;.  They are very durable plus they remove almost anything. I had a bad cut on my finger, put alcolol on one of these &amp;#34;Lil&#x27; BAD BOYS&amp;#34; kept removing the mess, rinsed it out &amp; used it again for rest of the mess, then I just disposed of it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, these are small sponges, they are alright, I will also be using them for nail art work.</li>
            <li> Lov e these wipes they are like tiny sponges removes my polish faster than cotton rounds without the lint. I also find they remove glitter much easier</li>
            <li> Perfect if you want to use with Shellac</li>
            <li> works great with the gelish nail system</li>
            <li> These work great for removing nail polish. They do not leave any lint behind. These are little octogon sponges NOT wipes. So you only should have to use one or two at most. The diameter of each is about the size of a quarter. I hated using cotton swabs or cotton pads. These are worth buying because for your money they actually do work as advertised!</li>
            <li> I am so sick of cotton getting into my polish after I prep my nails. These wipes have made my polishing so much easier and neater.</li>
            <li> I was using little round cotton pads to use with Alcohol to wipe my gel polish after they came out of the UV lamp. I bought a kit that contained these wipes in it and they are SO flipping much better then the cotton pads!! I will NEVER buy another cotton pad, ever!! You put your alcohol on the wipe and one wipe will do every nail! No little cotton blobs or lint stuck to your nails afterwards! I LOVE THESE THINGS!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a video on youtube showing a Shellac how-to and noticed the girl removing the tacky layer from the Shellac top coat with these wipes.  THEY ARE NOT SATURATED WITH ANYTHING SO YOU WILL NEED TO BUY YOUR OWN ACETONE OR ALCOHOL TO ADD TO THEM.  I only needed to use one for all 10 nails! They are made from a foam type of material not from cotton like traditional wipes.  These will last for ages since you only need one each time you do your nails.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item expecting to receive a box like the one shown in the photo, and in the box I expected to find lint-free cosmetic rounds. Instead I received a cellophane bag with sheets of hexagon-shaped foam squares that were yellowed with age. Now that I blow up the photo of the box in the product, I can see that the product actually is more of a hexagon-shaped foam pad than the cosmetic rounds I thought they were, but still - doesn&#x27;t explain the age-yellowed junk I received. Not worth returning (and it seems as though these foam blocks are, indeed, a \\&quot;lint free nail wipe\\&quot;) but save yourself some time and money and just go to the store and buy foam makeup wedges and cut them up because that would give you better quality foam wipes than these were.</li>
            <li> Great to use for wiping off the inhibition layer on nails after using gel or gel polish. Not great for wiping your brush on them. They start to break down and dissolve in time. Other than that it&#x27;s as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> You can purchase 100 individually packaged alcohol swabs (as opposed to 80 foam pads) for $1.99 (with $2.69 shipping) here on Amazon.com and they will do an equally good job cleaning the tackiness from shellac top coat.  That&#x27;s a savings of $1.55; your savings will be even greater if you purchase the swabs at your local drug store and save the shipping cost, not to mention they are already saturated with alcohol saving you the additional cost of purchasing the rubbing alcohol  separately.  The alcohol swabs are also lint free and you only need one for all ten nails, so they are also comparable in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy alcohol swabs.</li>
            <li> Loved these wipes.  Really do the job of getting polish off nails without getting lint on the nails.  I will purchase again when I run out of them.  Amazon does a great job in having items that are hard to find @ retail stores or getting you a good/great price!  I also use Amazon to read reviews on items that I might purchase @ a retail store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but these lint free wipes are in reality little sponges. They are in a sheet, and you just tear one off. They are well-perforated so they come off easily. It is a neat, clean solution. Four stars only because I thought they would be some kind of cotton.  Will definitely purchase them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> These wipes are perfect for manicures because they don&#x27;t leave the traces of lint that mess up your polish.  I highly recommend using them.  I use them to remove the tacky layer from my gel polish and it works great</li>
            <li> Works very well for prepping and finishing gel nails. I used with my gelish products and am really satisfied with the lerformance</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge wipe. Works well for ombre polish design.</li>
            <li> Little foam hexagons. I didn&#x27;t realize they were going to be foam. They last forever and are great.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that these nail wipes are lint free, unlike cotton balls or cotton pads. They also clean off several nails with just a tiny amount of polish remover. I use them on my natural nails with regular (not gel/shellac) polish.</li>
            <li> Absolutely necessary for gelish nails or gel type nails. I love this and will order more when I run out!!</li>
            <li> These nail wipes hold up very well and help in the removal of nail polish.  I would prefer them to be a little bit larger, but they work extremely well just the same.</li>
            <li> These work great!  I love them when working with the gelish polish.  They are lint free and allow you to use a small amount of remover.</li>
            <li> Theres no lint. its a nice small size so u don&#x27;t waste too much product. if you use one pad on more than two or three nails it will start to rip, but still wont leave any lint.</li>
            <li> Lots of wipes for the money... I&#x27;m doing the at-home Gelish manicures and I only use 1-2 wipes per manicure.</li>
            <li> this is not what i expected to get.  i thought it would be more like a cleansing pad (those round pads you buy at the store), but its more like spunge/foam material. Im not quite sure how to use it yet, so its just sitting there..</li>
            <li> I use this when Im painting my nails with the gelish kit. I use 2 pieces, 1 for taking my nail polish off and 1 for taking off the tacky afterwards. Its great and doesn&#x27;t leave behind the stuff that cotton balls would.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lint free, holds the Nail Cleansing solution with no drips. I use these to wipe my gel polish once completed with curing along with the Harmony gel cleanser.  Love this product, so much better than cotton or cotton squares as you don&#x27;t need to re-soak. Completely lint free as well.</li>
            <li> These wipes are a great product especially for doing your own gel nails. They are worth the money and work well.</li>
            <li> Of course they are lint free, their made of a type of plastic material that has no fibers in it!!! Really, picture on box is deceiving, they are MUCH smaller, and hard as a rock. Can&#x27;t tell me they wouldn&#x27;t damage a finished nail. These were totally useless.</li>
            <li> These nail wipes work great, they don&#x27;t have any lint, but I took off a star because they tear easily.</li>
            <li> In theory these should have been awesome but instead they&#x27;re just mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The size is perfect for a nail and for one to hold&lt;br /&gt;2. There are a lot that come in the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. They start to rip and seem to dissolve in under a minute&lt;br /&gt;2. If you have nail polish that is sort of thick on your nail, you&#x27;ll need to use more that five for one hand&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems like there is a lote in the box until they start breaking apart and you have to use more than one for each finger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering these again, I&#x27;d rather remove my nail polish with a cotton ball and then use these to clean of the excess cotton from my clean nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This only got 2 stars because I could probably use this on a think layer of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/23/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to update but just remembered because someone commente on my post. Ok, so I just learned that these aren&#x27;t for removing polish but for preping your nail. So on that note, I guess I&#x27;ll change my rating, so this is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;I use these after I remove all of my polish and before I do my mani, basically I use these to remove the excess cotton and to prep my nails before polish.</li>
            <li> These wipes work perfect with the Gelish system. I use them to dry wipe the nail after the foundation gel is applied. Works great!</li>
            <li> A lot of nail wipes claim to be lint free, but these are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that actually are. I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year to do my home gel manicures and I really swear by these guys to get the job done without getting chunks of dust or lint all over my nails.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a more dense sponge but they are not. They are very thinh and not very dense at all. The work ok. Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but they fall apart and you have to go through too many to consider them functional.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use them to remove the sticky residue with the gelish gel cleanser and sometimes even to remove the nail polish itself.  Great for soaking off the gelish polish.  Seller is great and i&#x27;ll definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li> I love these instead of using cotton balls. Keeps the fuzz off your nails, no fuzz when you polish.</li>
            <li> I use these to do my nails and love them! They aren&#x27;t super durable, but I don&#x27;t need them to be! They do the job great!</li>
            <li> Love love love!! You will never go back to cotton balls!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on another review for removing nail polish. These Are Not for removing nail polish. I had not seen them before and thought I would give them a try. As a nail tech I know now that these are for removing at best the acrylic dust from doing acrylic nails -nothing else and especially not for removing nail polish.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. Arrived on time. Very ecnomical. I like the product. It is a great price for what u get</li>
            <li> Ok can be used for sponge art.</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and use this for Gelish prep and finish.&lt;br /&gt;It is totally lint free and works very well!</li>
            <li> Perfect nail wipes for gel polish, clean and lint free, only need one for both hands. Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are a must have for gel or shellac nail polish applications. MUCH better than cotton pads. I use only 1 pad for the nail prep as well as wiping off the tacky stuff at the end of the application process.</li>
            <li> The IBD nail Wipes are definately lint free. I use them to remove the tacky/sticky layer that forms on my nails once I finish using the CND Shellac Top Coat. They work very well.</li>
            <li> these are the only wipes to use for gel nails products!</li>
            <li> I bought these because everyone said you need lint free wipes for the Shellac/Gelish manicures. Stop! Don&#x27;t waste your money. I get better results with a cotton ball &amp; alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t leave any cotton bits or lint behind. The lint free wipes actually ruined the finish of the top coat and I had to re-do it.</li>
            <li> It is a sponge cut in honey comb.  I haven&#x27;t try this product yet, I will test it later this weeken.  I wish it have more description of this product. Fast in shipping.</li>
            <li> These work great for wiping nails and preventing lint from getting on nails.  They seem to be just little sponges, so you could probably manage cheaper by just cutting your own.  But for the sake of convenience, these work well.  I reuse mine until they fall apart.</li>
            <li> I thought these were wipes with nail polish remover.  The are just little sponges. Ended up giving them to my kids for arts and crafts.</li>
            <li> I love these they are perfect because you dont have to worry about wasting a larger lint fee wipe. Also they can be use over and over again before you will need to replace one. Great for saving money when you are doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li> I got these because the Gelish demonstrator said to wipe the foundation layer after it cures.  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference.  I have applied it both ways and the gelish stays on for two weeks or more for my clients who take care of their nails.  It is lint free!!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why others have rated these wipes poorly or think that they came saturated in alcohol. First of all they are perfect for using with polish remover. I have used so-called lint free wipes, pre-moistened wipes and cotton balls however they cannot compare to the work that these IBD wipes do. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of remover to get the job done and I used only one to remove the nail polish from one hand. It even got into the corners and along the cuticle perfectly. These are worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Just Purchased this as a gift, when it came the box was all crushed but other than that I think it was fine.</li>
            <li> The nail wipes I have used in the past were a fiber material.  These are little sponges.  I suppose they will last longer, but wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These wipes were not at all what I thought they were but they work great! I thought they would be a flat cloth type wipe but they are actually little mini sponges. My bad I guess for not reading the description more carefully but they work as needed.</li>
            <li> Nail wipes they work just great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had too much experience with nail wipes, but these ones are great! I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting when I bought them, but they are little sextagon(sp?) shaped sponges. I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what they look like. I love them, and I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> These lint free wipes work great to cleanse the nail when you do gel nails! No lint left over from the cotton that you would typically use! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I use these for the last step in gel manicures with alcohol to remove the sticky gunk from the nail. They work well without leaving those annoying bits of cotton behind from the pads I was using before. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> This works well with my Gelish nail colors.  Makes it easy to wipe without leaving any residue behind or marks.</li>
            <li> With the IBD system, these are a must have.  I tried using papertowel, etc. but these work much, much better.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews more closely.  Impulse purchase to get lint-free \\&quot;wipes\\&quot;.  These are sponges.  Not what I was expecting at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers suggested buying pre-moistened alcohol wipes at the drug store or cutting up make up sponges.  I expect either will be as good or better.  I&#x27;m also thinking about trying one of those eye glass cleaning cloths.  A little rubbing alcohol to prep my nails should either evaporate for subsequent uses and/or come out easily in the wash.  I use cotton squares for the post-painting clean off without issue.</li>
            <li> I received on time, good condition and used them for my daughters wedding welcome bag along with other after party remedies. Also had to carry them out of the country as they were easily packed in suitcase. definetly recomend it</li>
            <li> Use these lint free wipes instead of cotton balls to remove polish or apply scrubfresh, keep the amount of fuzzys out of your polish.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for removing the tacky layer from my Shellac and for applying Scrub Fresh...basically for anything that requires a couple quick swipes on each nail. They don&#x27;t hold much liquid, but are lint-free as advertised. For polish removal, I prefer the Ultra Cosmetic pads, which are thicker and allow for more saturation.</li>
            <li> Love these pads. Doesn&#x27;t leave lint or fiber on nail plate.&lt;br /&gt;Will never us cotton balls for nails again.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome pads.</li>
            <li> This product is great, there can&#x27;t be a complaint with a nail wipe.It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, wipe excess gel off gel nails. The best part is there is no debris left on the nails even if they haven&#x27;t cured all the way before you wipe.</li>
            <li> These were not what I expected but that was my fault. I just assumed I was getting the cleaning pads for gel nails.  I purchased the rubbing alcohol and will use these as the cleaning pad rather tha cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Great for gel nails! I only have to use one each time I do my entire set of nails. They work perfect and I would recommend them to everyone doing their own gel nails at home and salons.</li>
            <li> these nail wipes are perfect... they do not leave lint on your nails when you use them. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This wipe is truly lint free.  If you need a nail wipe that doesn&#x27;t leave stray fibers - this is the one. Good to cleanse nails as well as remove gel nail top coat residue.</li>
            <li> these are excellent for removing polish, just enough remover on each pad to last for three nails.  would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!  SO MUCH better than the horrible \\&quot;cotton rounds\\&quot; or whatever else is available on the market.  The lint-free factor is pretty sweet and they hold up well even under the stress of my stupid toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not having to pick little bits of lint/strings of cotton out of my carefully manicured nails, ruining them in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the BEST for doing gels!! I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on :)</li>
            <li> So I got this package today and I&#x27;m giving an initial impression review. I will update it once I&#x27;ve used the product this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the box came crushed so the presentation wasn&#x27;t good. When I opened the box (the rest of the way) I pulled out what appeared to be a small, trashbag material black bag. Inside of that bag were 4 pull apart foam sheets that had 1\\&quot;x1\\&quot; octagons fitted together like a puzzle. You are to pull an octagon off as needed. It is literally foam/sponge material. I&#x27;m skeptical because they are so small and they look very porous, and I think they will drip acetone heavily as soon as they are pushed against the nail. At this time, I gave it a 3 with my initial impression. We shall see...&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I used these things and they are a waste of money. I use gelish gel polish and nail cleaner. As soon as I put some of the cleanser on and started rubbing on my nails, it fell apart. Then I decided not to use it for liquid and to only use it to rub the foundation stickiness off...it ripped apart and left little pieces of lint stuck to the nail. For this matter, I could have used a product that wasn&#x27;t considered as \\&quot;lint free\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. I changed my rating to a 1..it wouldn&#x27;t have given any stars if I was allowed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few times and it works great. This is really a&lt;br /&gt;lint-free product. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, no problems.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these is they don&#x27;t sell them in bulk! lol  I&#x27;m addicted to these little sponges.  When doing French tips, these work nicely in the cap of my acetone for cleaning excess gel off my brush.</li>
            <li> I put in a search for nail polish remover pads and these came up so I assumed they were the pads with the remover in them which is what I need.  THESE ARE NOT.  These are dry sponges which I have absolutely no use for.  I am not even sure if they are worth sending them back because I am in Afghanistan and the trouble with finding time to go to the Post Office is not worth the effort.  These should not come up when a search for \\&quot;Nail polish remover pads\\&quot; is entered because by themselves, they remove nothing.</li>
            <li> These are great for removing nail polish. They do not get stringy and fall apart. They clean the nails great</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR MY WIFE AND CLEANS OUT FAST.</li>
            <li> I purchased these and they finally came three days after the promised date, July 2nd, after being ordered on July 18th.  I wrote to them twice to find out what was going on and no answer.  When it arrived the box was all smashed and open (it didn&#x27;t hurt the product though).  All this is is packaging material cut into octagons.  Really?</li>
            <li> The item was as described. I do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of using these wipes.  I like these much better than the first kind I had and so easy to use.</li>
