            <li>WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>The seller pleasantly obliged and assured me stock would be checked for the defect.     </li>
            <li>this makes it look good.  </li>
            <li>Sprayer is very good (the can I got works fine).</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon two weeks ago and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>They did a fabulous job, and the product which I just used works great</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I had this product for a while before someone told me the best way to use it, now I use it constantly.  </li>
            <li>I found that I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the product as it really dulled the look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I was actually able to spray it onto my hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more importantly I use silicone based styling products and a hair wax paste to piece out my hair.</li>
            <li>This product worked fine the one time I got to use it.</li>
            <li>Perfectly fine spray seems to disappear.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo easily gets hair looking good through another day or two!</li>
            <li>One of the best things about this product is that it works with no stickiness, and actually gave my hair more body than it ever has normally.</li>
            <li>So far so good, it looked fine.</li>
            <li>--well worth the price!</li>
            <li>The dry shampoo itself worked great the two times</li>
            <li>I think I got two good uses out of the bottle, and that lasted almost a week because it actually kept my hair clean longer than shampooing it does.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this product for the first time after hearing great things about it.</li>
            <li>With this product I was able to go two days without shampooing (unheard of for me) and maintain a clean professional appearance.</li>
            <li>Because of the cost, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it--you can duplicate the effect probably by blowdrying and hairspraying.      </li>
            <li>, it looks like i just blow dried my hair, though my hair feels dirty, it looks great and smells great :)!</li>
            <li>I think that the dry shampoo sticks to these products so that it doesn&#x27;t effectively brush out.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product I tried a bit on my bangs just to see how it worked.</li>
            <li>It worked better then another product I had used but after only using the product twice it would not spray anymore.   </li>
            <li>Plus, after the use it felt like I dumped a good handful of baby powder in my hair, even  with  just a few sprays</li>
            <li>I had to take away a star because there isn&#x27;t enough of this product to last very long, but otherwise it is a great product!</li>
            <li>I used to prefer the Biondi dry shampoo, but after using the Klorane, I realized how much better the super-fine consistency of the Klorane spray is</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo helps you stretch your hairstyle one more day</li>
            <li>I lasted exactly  three uses,I really expected more use out of it.   </li>
            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>A week of sitting on the shelf in my bathroom cabinet was too much to ask, I guess.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of spray shampoo that were rated well, and Klorane was noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>This product allows me to make my hair look &amp; FEEL clean instantly without ANY residue.</li>
            <li>, has a very simple, pleasant scent (almost unscented, but nicer) and, unlike the Bumble &amp; Bumble dry shampoo, you can actually touch your roots afterward without getting the pigment underneath your fingernails and all over your hands.     </li>
            <li>Other than my own set of 5 stars from 2 years of personal experience, do I need to say anymore?</li>
            <li>hitting most of your scalp, let it sit for a few minutes and then brush it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to comment on the cost of Klorane dry shampoo, except to say that if you want cheap, use water and regular shampoo.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the old stuff from Walgreen&#x27;s</li>
            <li>You part your hair, and spray near the roots,</li>
            <li>I have grey hair and it blends in very well.</li>
            <li>The Klorane is well worth the money if you&#x27;re active!</li>
            <li>One issue to be aware of is that the part of the product that cleans your hair is gone long before the aerosol is gone, so if you don&#x27;t see a white residue when you spray it on, it isn&#x27;t going to have any effect on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I know I didn&#x27;t use all of the product the first time because I only sprayed two short sprays and it felt like there was plenty left in the can.</li>
            <li>But, if you hold the bottle far enough away during use, this is not at all a problem.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, however it only works a few times then seemed to have no more product in it.</li>
            <li>so I decided to use my new dry shampoo.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using baby powder to dull the shine, but it never quite looked right.  </li>

            <li> I may try purchasing a 3rd bottle of the Klorane in a few months.</li>
            <li> Like others here, the product worked and smelled good--BUT one of the cans stopped spraying after one use and the other either had nothing in it or evaporated.</li>

            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>

            <li> Klorane dry shamboo was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> no more slick, yucky unwashed look.</li>
            <li> That being said, it does take awhile to get the hang of the shampoo, and (if you are a dark brunette like me, at least) unless you hold the bottle at least a foot away from your hair, there will be a whitish residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> The next time I needed it, all of the air had leaked out of the can and it was useless--so frustrating!</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my hair every day.    </li>
            <li> About a week later, my hair was a little dirty</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> It never looks or smells dirty.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sincerely disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently ordered the product and before I could even use it, the can was emptied and was damaged when shipped to me. I contacted the manufacturer ASAP and they sent me one out in the mail the next day they could get it here.  They did a fabulous job, and the product which I just used works great, it looks like i just blow dried my hair, though my hair feels dirty, it looks great and smells great :)!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Sephora dry shampoo but was looking for a bigger can.  Klorane dry shamboo was a big disappointment.  It didn&#x27;t absorb the oil like Sephora and even further flattened my hair.  It also made my hair gummy feeling. The search goes on!</li>
            <li> I had to take away a star because there isn&#x27;t enough of this product to last very long, but otherwise it is a great product! I have really long hair &amp; it takes a lot of time to get ready, plus it can be extremely damageing to wash &amp; dry it everyday...This product allows me to make my hair look &amp; FEEL clean instantly without ANY residue. As a result I can just pull my hair up, jump in the bath, get out &amp; spray it &amp; I&#x27;m done! I only have to wash my hair every three days! When you have really long hair like I do, this stuff is a godsend!</li>
            <li> I used to prefer the Biondi dry shampoo, but after using the Klorane, I realized how much better the super-fine consistency of the Klorane spray is (it makes the Biondi product feel endlessly gritty and with a lot of stuff that falls out all the time).  Smells nice. Sprayer is very good (the can I got works fine). Works fast. Leaves your hair slightly dull, but that&#x27;s true for any dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had this product for a while before someone told me the best way to use it, now I use it constantly.  You have to spray on a moderate amount on the greasy parts of your hair (like your hairline, where your part is, etc). Leave it on for 3-4 minutes, rub it in with your fingers and then brush it through.  It makes a big difference...no more slick, yucky unwashed look. With this product I can get by washing 2xs per week. It never looks or smells dirty.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s not convenient to shampoo my hair this makes it look good.  I have grey hair and it blends in very well.</li>
            <li> It is summertime, and it is a pain (not to mention damaging) to wash your hair every day. This dry shampoo helps you stretch your hairstyle one more day, has a very simple, pleasant scent (almost unscented, but nicer) and, unlike the Bumble &amp; Bumble dry shampoo, you can actually touch your roots afterward without getting the pigment underneath your fingernails and all over your hands.     That being said, it does take awhile to get the hang of the shampoo, and (if you are a dark brunette like me, at least) unless you hold the bottle at least a foot away from your hair, there will be a whitish residue on your hair. But, if you hold the bottle far enough away during use, this is not at all a problem.</li>
            <li> Like others here, the product worked and smelled good--BUT one of the cans stopped spraying after one use and the other either had nothing in it or evaporated. I got 1/2 use from it. For this price ------- never again.</li>
            <li> I found that I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the product as it really dulled the look of my hair. I think this is exacerbated by two things: 1) I am brunette. 2) Perhaps more importantly I use silicone based styling products and a hair wax paste to piece out my hair. I think that the dry shampoo sticks to these products so that it doesn&#x27;t effectively brush out. So you may want to take these things into consideration before deciding if this product will work for you, as it did not for me.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for the first time after hearing great things about it. I am so disappointed! It was a waste of money. When I first received the product I tried a bit on my bangs just to see how it worked. So far so good, it looked fine. About a week later, my hair was a little dirty so I decided to use my new dry shampoo. Imagine my surprise to find out the can was empty. I am convinced that there is still product in there, but the can has been de-pressurized so there is no spray. A week of sitting on the shelf in my bathroom cabinet was too much to ask, I guess. So, I just paid $12 for a patch test for my bangs. I would consider buying this type of product again, but never from Klorane. The packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, however it only works a few times then seemed to have no more product in it. It&#x27;s too pricey for just a few uses. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I keep a can in my gym bag and use it to clean sweaty hair - no need to shampoo and waste a half hour!  I&#x27;ve also tried the old stuff from Walgreen&#x27;s (I think it&#x27;s called Pssst!) and that smells like chemicals.  The Klorane is well worth the money if you&#x27;re active!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion and once I tested it out, the bottle leaked all air out within 24 hours. I called the seller and was immediately sent a replacement, no questions asked. After the second bottle arrived, the same thing happened. The dry shampoo itself worked great the two times I was actually able to spray it onto my hair. I think these bottles might have defective spray nozzles so I got a refund after the second time. The seller pleasantly obliged and assured me stock would be checked for the defect.     I recently bought the Algemarin Dry Shampoo and that does not work as well as the Klorane. I may try purchasing a 3rd bottle of the Klorane in a few months.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine the one time I got to use it. The next time I needed it, all of the air had leaked out of the can and it was useless--so frustrating! I know I didn&#x27;t use all of the product the first time because I only sprayed two short sprays and it felt like there was plenty left in the can. I will never buy this product again; I just don&#x27;t want to risk wasting the money on another faulty can.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what the other reviewers say...I bought this on Amazon two weeks ago and absolutely love it! If I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair every day my roots get greasy and lank looking (think Professor Snape from Harry Potter). I&#x27;ve tried using baby powder to dull the shine, but it never quite looked right.  With this product I was able to go two days without shampooing (unheard of for me) and maintain a clean professional appearance. Hooray for Klorane! I wish they made a family size!</li>
            <li> Per google, 4.5 out of a pool of 3,376 reviewers.  Other than my own set of 5 stars from 2 years of personal experience, do I need to say anymore?</li>
            <li> I only received one use of this dry shampoo because the canister was practically empty and only had enough spray for one use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POOR QUALITY CONTROL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sincerely disappointed with this product. I lasted exactly  three uses,I really expected more use out of it.   Plus, after the use it felt like I dumped a good handful of baby powder in my hair, even  with  just a few sprays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to comment on the cost of Klorane dry shampoo, except to say that if you want cheap, use water and regular shampoo.      This is a great product.  You part your hair, and spray near the roots, hitting most of your scalp, let it sit for a few minutes and then brush it out.  I have dark brown hair, and the spray is white when initially applied.  I found that it did brush out.      One of the best things about this product is that it works with no stickiness, and actually gave my hair more body than it ever has normally. Apart from cost, I would use this product just for that.  Because of the cost, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it--you can duplicate the effect probably by blowdrying and hairspraying.      The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;extra body\\&quot; effect for me lasted about a day and a half.  One issue to be aware of is that the part of the product that cleans your hair is gone long before the aerosol is gone, so if you don&#x27;t see a white residue when you spray it on, it isn&#x27;t going to have any effect on your hair.  It is possible that I just didn&#x27;t remember to shake it up but I doubt it.  I think I got two good uses out of the bottle, and that lasted almost a week because it actually kept my hair clean longer than shampooing it does.  I usually have to wash my hair every day.    I have tried other brands of spray shampoo that were rated well, and Klorane was noticeably better.  This is the brand I&#x27;ll buy next time.</li>
            <li> dry shampoo EVER!  And I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Perfectly fine spray seems to disappear.  After brushing, there is NO residue. This dry shampoo easily gets hair looking good through another day or two! WONDERFUL--well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I used this product after surgery and could not wash/style my hair.   It worked better then another product I had used but after only using the product twice it would not spray anymore.   The can did not appear to be clogged but it still would not work.</li>
