            <li>do have oily and loose  curly hair and this product is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li>First of all this stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and some cleansing conditioners make my hair unmanageable.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean</li>
            <li>First, the price is much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time using it and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I felt it was too soft, so I tried the melon scented that is for oily hair, which is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>I am getting great results and my color is staying longer than usual.</li>

            <li>Anyway, I really like the smell, which stays in the hair, but the amount of volume this shampoo gives me is the reason I keep buying it!</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Arrived quick, just as expected, glad to know</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>color my hair dark red, so this is going to be a great in between washes conditioner to prevent the color from stripping so fast.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, straight, naturally blonde hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li>It seemed like this kind of dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>I used to have a problem with my scalp and hair becoming greasy if I didn&#x27;t wash it every single day.</li>
            <li>My hair is absolutely clean, it even survived 48 hours without looking flat and oily.</li>

            <li>It left my hair so soft and clean</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and has body!</li>
            <li>With this stuff, even though my styling goes flat after a day (which is normal especially after sleeping on it), my scalp will actually feel clean for two to three days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And because I have long hair, I went through a bottle in very little time, plus, I was never really ever satisfied that my hair was fully clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and becomes greasy very easily with normal hair products.  </li>
            <li>It did not weigh my hair down whatsoever, and left it clean, shiny, soft, and did not feel tacky or feeling that residue was left on the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a little past my shoulders, and because it doesn&#x27;t lather, I find myself using quiet a bit to make sure I get all areas of my hair, especially my scalp, and I do have to comb through the tangles while it&#x27;s in my hair, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the Salon Grafix product in general, so when I saw this I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it dried out my hair the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try the WEN product but after trying many expensive treatments I was a little</li>

            <li> My hair is very thin and becomes greasy very easily with normal hair products.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a shampoo/conditioner that could make my hair last the entire day without splitting and looking oily.  This item didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, in fact it made it look and feel even more oily and greasy.  I used it once and then got rid of it.  Was highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year now (just ordered a couple more bottles) and I love it. I used to have a problem with my scalp and hair becoming greasy if I didn&#x27;t wash it every single day. With this stuff, even though my styling goes flat after a day (which is normal especially after sleeping on it), my scalp will actually feel clean for two to three days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product is hard to find in stores, so there have been a few times when I ran out of it, and have been forced to use regular shampoo and conditioner again; they make my hair, which normally feels extremely soft (according to friends and despite my blow-drying it at least every other day), feel like dry brittle straw in comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I have never been able to go without washing my hair daily b/c it feels so dirty and oily, but I can with this! My hair is a little past my shoulders, and because it doesn&#x27;t lather, I find myself using quiet a bit to make sure I get all areas of my hair, especially my scalp, and I do have to comb through the tangles while it&#x27;s in my hair, but it is worth it. My hair feels so clean and IT SMELLS AMAZING! I can go two days without washing my hair and it still smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very long, thick hair and she is too lazy to work through the tangles, so she uses her regular conditioner and adds this for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Had to return. Did not make it in travel. Bottle exploded.</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean but not dried out.  Nice alternative to shampoo.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this product after others had talked about similar products. I have fine hair and some cleansing conditioners make my hair unmanageable. Not this one. I am getting great results and my color is staying longer than usual. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This Is Great Stuff!!!! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like wen does...and adds a good amount of volume to my FINE  hair</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time getting shampoo to wash out of my hair. I would have to use 3 different conditioners; it was such a hassle. I tried Wen, but it left my hair flat. I tried Ren, but it felt like a waxy residue was left behind. So I tried the citrus scented version of this from Salon Grafix. It left my hair so soft and clean it actually squeaked! After a few weeks, I felt it was too soft, so I tried the melon scented that is for oily hair, which is perfect for me! My hair is bouncy and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sudsy stuff, because there isn&#x27;t any in it. I couldn&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! As intrigued as I was by the Wen by Chaz Dean product, I was unwilling to get locked into some scammy repeat-delivery thing. (Guthy-Renker has a terrible reputation for that.) I like the Salon Grafix product in general, so when I saw this I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nice surprise! I have oily hair, skin - everything. Even with a fresh clean head of hair, by midday the crown of my head begins to show the heavy, icky looking oil slick. By the end of the day it&#x27;s usually up because it looks yucky. But day one of using this product, and my hair still looked great at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair dark red, so this is going to be a great in between washes conditioner to prevent the color from stripping so fast. The price is right and so is the product.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT&#x27;S NOTHING LIKE WEN! DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN YOUR HAIR! SO DISAPPOINTED!!!! I WAS LEFT WITH AN OILY, GREASY MESS. MY HAIR FELT BETTER BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO WASH!</li>
            <li> First of all this stuff smells amazing I found it at grocery outlet for 3 dollars it is a bit pricey here. For me it dried out my hair the first time I used it. This is my second time using it and my hair feels amazing. I used quite a bit of the product worked it into my hair and let it sit. Rinsed it off and I cannot complain. Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Hard to find anymore.  Great, fast service!!</li>
            <li> I like to rotate my shampoos and usually stick with Ojon and Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi line.  I have tried Wen but just cannot justify the price.  And because I have long hair, I went through a bottle in very little time, plus, I was never really ever satisfied that my hair was fully clean.  It would feel somewhat tacky after \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot;.  I appreciate what Chaz has done for the world of shampooing with sulfates, but I would never be a regular Wen user.  I have found a very different experience with this cleansing conditioner.  First, the price is much more reasonable.  I have oily hair and found this to be a great product.  It did not weigh my hair down whatsoever, and left it clean, shiny, soft, and did not feel tacky or feeling that residue was left on the hair shaft.  I did leave it on for a good five minutes, which is probably important.  I did use a leave-in conditioner as well.  I got this on sale at the grocery store but I wanted to rate this here at Amazon just in case a potential buyer came along and wanted to try it.  I find it to be an excellent product and better than Wen&#x27;s line (for me as someone with long hair and an oily scalp).</li>
            <li> This is my go to shampoo! I have baby fine, straight, naturally blonde hair. This shampoo gives my hair so much body! I still wash my hair daily though, even though this is specifically for oily hair. My hair is so blonde that if not washed daily it looks gross and dirty to me. Anyway, I really like the smell, which stays in the hair, but the amount of volume this shampoo gives me is the reason I keep buying it! I have used the expensive salon shampoos, and always go back to this!</li>
            <li> Got it at Harmon Face Value for $5.99!! Love this stuff</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so greasy. It was total waste of money. It&#x27;s so bad that I wondered if the qualifier &amp;#34;for oily or flat hair&amp;#34; meant that it was designed to make your hair look oily and flat. Awful!</li>
            <li> Arrived quick, just as expected, glad to know it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li> It seemed like this kind of dried my hair out. Other than that it was good and smelled great!</li>
            <li> Watery, NOT IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> Finally !!! I found a replacement for WEN . Thank you Grafix..&lt;br /&gt;I do have oily and loose  curly hair and this product is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that my hair is curly, oily at the scalp with very dry ends. I have stayed away from conditioners for years because they usually made my hair really greasy. Lately I have been dealing with a lot of build-up and I&#x27;ve tried it all, including going without shampoo (apple cider vinegar/baking soda method) and I just have not felt any difference. I really wanted to try the WEN product but after trying many expensive treatments I was a little disheartened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week as I browsed the hair product isle at the grocery store, I found this product and the promise of replacing all hair care products totally got me. This bottle came with a free-risk trial tag for a mail-in rebate, so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 days now and I have seen a miracle. My hair is absolutely clean, it even survived 48 hours without looking flat and oily. The product smells good and while it doesn&#x27;t bubble up, it does an amazing job cleaning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product that I don&#x27;t even care about the mail-in rebate. I&#x27;m going back to the store and I am going to buy the other 5 bottles I saw on the shelf.</li>
            <li> This is a gift, but I do have some and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and will order again. Detangles my long fine hair easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. My hair is soft and has body!</li>
