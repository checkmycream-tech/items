            <li>This is a much better way to purchase them as well.  </li>
            <li>I love my emjoi  micro pedi that I purchased after Christmas .  </li>
            <li>i am happy with emjoi products and with my delivery from amazon  fast and easy.thank you</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>I go barefooted most of the time</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Love being able to get refills.  </li>
            <li>Better than using the Pedi egg.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>So easy to use -- I love it.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used other types of rollers but these work great.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>JUST WHAT I ORDERED AND RECEIVED JUST FINE.</li>
            <li>These were fine for smoothing the sides of my feet, but forget it when it came to the callouses on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li>but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This fit the shaver perfectly, yet cost much less than the name-brand refills that are made for it.</li>
            <li>It filled alll my desires</li>
            <li>smooth.</li>
            <li>After I use it my heels are baby smooth.</li>
            <li>They last a while and are great.</li>
            <li>Emjoi refill rollers are the best ,they really do remove the dry skin from your feet well.</li>
            <li>Probably not &amp;#34;as good&amp;#34; as original but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I find it comparable to the original ones.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original ones that came with the product.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be stronger than the original rollers</li>
            <li>JUST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL AND SUCH A FANTASTIC PRICE.  </li>
            <li>Very effective at removing dry skin and callouses.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more thanks julie</li>
            <li>Love this item, really works.</li>
            <li>they work and the price is super</li>
            <li>I find the Extra Coarse works best for me</li>
            <li>No worry, Amazon came through quickly.</li>
            <li>The Micro-pedi is a great little machine, but it would be nothing without the refill rollers.  </li>
            <li>They last longer than I expected and are as wonderful as the Emjoi machine.  </li>
            <li>This works better than creams or hand-held scrapers, but I need an even stronger roller.</li>
            <li>But probably would go up to the next  more course option.</li>
            <li>Love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi machine and will always have an extra roller around.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This keeps them smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The roller last for many uses.</li>
            <li>I ordered the extra-extra coarse as well and was pleased with those.</li>
            <li>I would like to try a coarser roller for my husbands feet, but these are good for everyday use for me.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>It takes very little time to use, the roller and batteries are still going strong, and it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this little machine and liked it so much I ordered refill rollers fearing I would wear them out soon.  </li>
            <li>I can get my feet smooth enough after all these years of calluses</li>
            <li>these work very well</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than ordering from Emjoi.</li>
            <li>For years she used a hand file so having an electric file makes it much easier for her.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>good but didn&#x27;t last as expected</li>
            <li>I like the Emjoi machine that these fit very much, but these rollers are not really &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily with dry toothbrush for extended use.</li>
            <li>Decent replacement for Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li>Can be a little overwhelming...</li>
            <li>Just wish the refill rollers worked a little bit better at removing the calluses.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the &#x27;rough factor&#x27; is consistent with the generics and by going up one level, I can find the right thing.</li>
            <li>, they also make a finer coarse and an Extra Strong coarse.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep my feet very smooth and I only have to use it twice a week for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>if doesn&#x27;t last as long, still worth the money.</li>
            <li>They help remove the dead skin, but I wish they were even more coarse, since they don&#x27;t remove all that is needed, even after going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not cheap but they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because they seem to either be less coarse than the originals or the coating wears off of them really quickly.</li>

            <li> These should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially my heels -</li>
            <li> I love the sanding effect which is much nicer than the cutting wheel on other other dead skin removers.</li>
            <li> so I am prone to dry heals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess it to be that they are just less coarse to begin with.</li>
            <li> sometimes a little too coarse.</li>
            <li> These rollers do a great job to help get rid of those nasty calluses.</li>
            <li> I ordered them and received them in the time I expected them.  </li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> For those of you with REALLY tough calluses, I&#x27;d skip these entirely and go for the next level (or two).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really tough calluses to buff off, so would not normally need to order the extra-coarse versions.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do</li>
            <li> I have really bad dry skin on my heels, and other methods of removing it have been unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> They are just like the Emjoi brand, just less expensive.</li>
            <li> My calluses aren&#x27;t thick but are tough.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love these refills. One roller lasts me with bi-daily use about 2-3 month</li>
            <li> They do wear out with use. These are a bargain.</li>
            <li> Emjoi refill rollers are the best ,they really do remove the dry skin from your feet well.Without any pain and&lt;br /&gt;very smooth. i would recommend this prouduct to anyone who like to have nice feet for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;You have to have one.</li>
            <li> These were good, not QUITE like the authentic  ones, but still do the job. Just takes a bit longer. I would buy again. But probably would go up to the next  more course option.</li>
            <li> Just Love my Pedi and the refill rollers!!  Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> I bought the micro pedi that uses these rollers. I love the sanding effect which is much nicer than the cutting wheel on other other dead skin removers.</li>
            <li> Probably not &amp;#34;as good&amp;#34; as original but gets the job done. I also do my elbows and knees. Do love the Emjoi and will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> The Micro-pedi is a great little machine, but it would be nothing without the refill rollers.  I ordered them and received them in the time I expected them.  They fit my Micro-pedi, and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Just Love my Emjoi Pedi refill rollers! Will come back for more, great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Can be a little overwhelming...sometimes a little too coarse.</li>
            <li> These were fine for smoothing the sides of my feet, but forget it when it came to the callouses on the bottom of my feet. &amp;#34;Extra-coarse&amp;#34; is not how I would describe these.</li>
            <li> These rollers do a great job to help get rid of those nasty calluses. So easy to use -- I love it.</li>
            <li> These replacement rollers work great.  This is a much better way to purchase them as well.  It saves you money.</li>
            <li> These rollers have given me back my sandal feet!  Very effective at removing dry skin and callouses.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product it is addicting  I can get my feet smooth enough after all these years of calluses but I&#x27;m almost there  you have got a customer for life. just bought one for my best friend she loves it too. I will be buying more thanks julie</li>
            <li> Decent replacement for Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  Emjoi Rollers are 3-4 times more expensive so&lt;br /&gt;even if doesn&#x27;t last as long, still worth the money.</li>
            <li> These fit my Micro-Pedi great. They are just like the Emjoi brand, just less expensive. I would like to try a coarser roller for my husbands feet, but these are good for everyday use for me.</li>
            <li> This fit the shaver perfectly, yet cost much less than the name-brand refills that are made for it. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because they seem to either be less coarse than the originals or the coating wears off of them really quickly. I&#x27;d guess it to be that they are just less coarse to begin with. I don&#x27;t have really tough calluses to buff off, so would not normally need to order the extra-coarse versions. But I&#x27;m considering doing so for these &#x27;generic&#x27; brands and crossing my fingers they aren&#x27;t taking my tender skin off in the process. Hopefully, the &#x27;rough factor&#x27; is consistent with the generics and by going up one level, I can find the right thing. For those of you with REALLY tough calluses, I&#x27;d skip these entirely and go for the next level (or two). They do fit perfectly though, so no worries there. And the price is great!</li>
            <li> Emjoi is the best exfoliator for my feet. After I use it my heels are baby smooth. The refills last for me because I rinse them off after use. Not sure if that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> they work and the price is super</li>
            <li> Works great.  I find it comparable to the original ones.</li>
            <li> Been using my Micro-Pedi about a month and haven&#x27;t had to replace my roller yet. These should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love my emjoi  micro pedi that I purchased after Christmas .  I ordered replacement rollers for my micro pedi.  I used one roller( the one it came with) all winter .  I am going to use the replacement rollers next fall.  They last a while and are great.</li>
            <li> i am happy with emjoi products and with my delivery from amazon  fast and easy.thank you</li>
            <li> Works just like the one that came with the unit.  Love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi machine and will always have an extra roller around.</li>
            <li> Received and and works as promised and described!</li>
            <li> Emjoi compatible, just as described, works perfect!</li>
            <li> Good refills, shared with my son-in-law and family.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE SAME ROLLERS SOLD ON THE TV SHOPPING CHANNEL WE ALLL LOVE !  BUT THESE PRICES ARE SO MUCH BETTER  !!</li>
            <li> Really great product. I assume if you are buying the refills, you know how good it is.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Prudocte &amp; the Delivery.</li>
            <li> As good as the original emoji rollers. Will purchase again. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially my heels - these work very well, they also make a finer coarse and an Extra Strong coarse.  I find the Extra Coarse works best for me</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps keep my feet very smooth and I only have to use it twice a week for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original ones that came with the product. Much cheaper than ordering from Emjoi.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. For years she used a hand file so having an electric file makes it much easier for her.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again. It is a great product and it works well. It is well priced too!!</li>
            <li> I love this system. It is easy to use and gets the job done.  I plan on using until it dies.</li>
            <li> Always fine a great deal on amazon.... Will come back for more emjoi micro pedi refills!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying my Micro pedi and this roller works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this item, really works.</li>
            <li> My emjoi micro pedi worked wonderfully.  thanks.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Cleans easily with dry toothbrush for extended use.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing dead skin.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I go barefooted most of the time so I am prone to dry heals.  This keeps them smooth and soft.  The roller last for many uses.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  JUST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL AND SUCH A FANTASTIC PRICE.  WORKS GREAT!!!!!  WILL DEFINITELY BUY  AGAIN.</li>
            <li> good but didn&#x27;t last as expected</li>
            <li> They do an extremely good job at keeping my feet smooth.  I am quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Thought this would be stronger than the original rollers but it turned out to be the same.</li>
            <li> Love being able to get refills.  Great!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Just wish the refill rollers worked a little bit better at removing the calluses.</li>
            <li> Better than using the Pedi egg. It makes my feet feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the ones that came with the Emjoi.  I ordered the extra-extra coarse as well and was pleased with those.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Like the product &amp; was worried about replacements.  No worry, Amazon came through quickly.</li>
