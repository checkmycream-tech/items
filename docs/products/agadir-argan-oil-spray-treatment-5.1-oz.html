            <li> Love it...I swear by it. My hair dresser even said she likes it</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been using it for almost a year and I get many compliments on my hair.  Definitely buy it by this seller because of their prices.  This item is more than 2 times the price at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. It is easier to apply to my longer curly hair with the spray bottle. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Always keeps hair shiny.</li>
            <li> what a rip off I. only got one bottle!</li>
            <li> They posted 2 pack product and charged me for two but when the product arrived it was only one.</li>
            <li> I have fine &amp; thin hair, this product is awesome as a detangler and allows me to brush my hair later on after it&#x27;s dry with no drama, no snags, no issues.  The scent is divine, very musky, not perfumey.  It helps my hair dry so much faster, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down AT ALL no matter how much I use!  I&#x27;ve tried store-bought versions but they do not compare to this spray!</li>
            <li> I first leaned about this product from my hair dresser...It makes my hair shine, tangle free and smells wonderful. Since I have started using this, I have turned on several ladies on to this product. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> strong smell that sometimes is hard to deal with as very sensitive to smell.  My daughter cannot use it on her hair or my granddaughters due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my hair. the picture had 2 bottles for a great price when I  got the package it was only one bottle. I called customer care and they REFUNDED me half my money back for error. I would order again. Package came before date.</li>
            <li> Frequent buyer from this seller and product. I love the way it tames my frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair texture changed after the birth of my child.  This makes my hair shiny and smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps hair moist and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, super fast delivery and a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> This product is not too oily to use on my baby fine hair after shampoos and drying.  My hair is long and with this product, I am able to comb it out easily with minimal breakage.</li>
            <li> The best argan oil. The fact that it is in spray makes all the difference. I wish they would have a smaller one for the handbag or travelling.</li>
            <li> Love this product, light not greasy, has a nice smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and love it.  It smells great too and is really good for your hair.</li>
