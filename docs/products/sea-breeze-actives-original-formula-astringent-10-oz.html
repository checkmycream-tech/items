            <li>; I&#x27;m also a pushover for attractive packaging, which is the reason I bought it the very first time.</li>
            <li>A friend introduced me to this in my teens, I&#x27;ve used it for over 40 years and really love it.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied :</li>

            <li>When I packed my hospital bag for delivering my son I made sure I had a travel bottle of sea breeze.</li>
            <li>Cosmetology College many, many years ago...</li>
            <li>so I am so glad they sell it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I sure wish the seller would do something about the loss.</li>
            <li>The price is right, it is a good product</li>
            <li>It is perfect for cleaning and refreshing your face after a long day.</li>
            <li>all my pimples disappeared leaving my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I use this product and its sister product (Sea Breeze Actives which is excellent for the skin as well as for minor</li>
            <li>Skin feels refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li>The original and best facial astringent.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer just ignores customers who have faithfully bought Sea Breeze original most of their lives.  </li>
            <li>I love this Sea Breeze Original product.  </li>
            <li>Love the Original formula.  </li>
            <li>Cool stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love the ORIGINAL Sea Breeze.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have this old standby product available again.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strong smell of camphor, and this version doesn&#x27;t give the skin tingle that it used to.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I immediately felt a cool and refreshing sensation, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that it&#x27;s back</li>
            <li>They could keep making it but for whatever bizarre reason they stop.  </li>
            <li>My forehead went from smooth to bumpy.</li>
            <li>Good product to use in pregnancy, no harsh chemicals in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This original formulation I use for shaving.</li>
            <li>Original Formula.</li>
            <li>It never makes sense to me, though - a company has an original product which made a NAME for the brand.  </li>
            <li>But why does ANY of them abandon the original version?  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, try this Original Formula (which they don&#x27;t frickin make anymore)</li>
            <li>Yes, this is the original.  </li>
            <li>how well I wash my face first, Sea Breeze gets more dirt and makeup off.  </li>
            <li>I introduced it to my husband , and now my son uses it to fight teen skin problems with great success.   </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the cost: it helps fight pimples, keeps my face toned, and gives me a great tingling feeling after applying it (so it obviously works).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean</li>
            <li>Gives your face a clean feeling though.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel clean and refreshed, and your pimples shrink like you&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>I figured a toner, such as this one, would do my face some good and perhaps help control the oil.</li>
            <li>This newer version of the original Sea Breeze seems to be more moisturizing than the Old Original brand.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes my face feel clean and fresh like Sea Breeze does.</li>
            <li>When we heard the news, we quickly stocked up.  </li>
            <li>Strong, but does not leave much of a scent</li>
            <li>Far superior to the new Sea Breeze products</li>
            <li>We have tried the other varieties of Sea Breeze Astringent , but for our household the ORIGINAL FORMULA is #1 !!!</li>
            <li>Even though I am now 55, and have to get it at Amazon, its worth any penny I spend.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh .</li>
            <li>Bottle was maybe half full and still dripping.&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy about losing that much Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li>original astringent with its clear light golden tint and eucalyptus hint since I first discovered it close to a decade ago</li>
            <li>Then they decide to introduce new versions, which is fine and dandy.  </li>
            <li>Manufacturer: please reconsider your decision to discontinue the ORIGINAL --- it&#x27;s a non-greasy classic.</li>
            <li>The ad should certainly contain a warning to the allergen!</li>
            <li>I have been using it since it first came on the market and there is no satisfactory substitute that I have found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Once I can&#x27;t find it at all, I will NOT buy the other versions, guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to good old witch hazel.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonable substitute, but it is not as powerful and has the somewhat &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling of the new formula.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely blessed with clear skin in high school, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m not aware of my good fortune.</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed to find they had quite making it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice an improvement in my skin, been using for about a month.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Tho&#x27; the ingredients are the same and in the same order as the genuine Original</li>
            <li>I actually buy the Actives about 2 to 1 to the Original).</li>
            <li>Sea Breeze Original is the only astringent my family uses.  </li>
            <li>as with all the other reviews I have been using this for more years than I care to admitt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various astringents in during my adolescence, but NONE have given my skin the tingle I feel like Sea Breeze Astringent Original Formula.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an astringent- look no further than Sea Breeze original formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong medicine; so, use it carefully, but it can be very helpful for certain situations.  </li>
            <li>I try to stock up on as many bottles as I can because I use it daily and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend this-</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and have used the original formula daily since age 12.  </li>
            <li>If you want your face to look clean minus all of the zits then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Recently my face has gone from being normal to combination, where my forehead gets pretty oily</li>
            <li>I believe they&#x27;re using very little peppermint, clove or eucalyptus and those are the things that make Sea Breeze so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out it needs to be Sea Breeze original; Actives doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t compare my old bottle to the new.</li>
            <li>No store near me carries it anymore, I&#x27;ve checked and called, nobody carries it now.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sold near here.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I like to mix a small amount of Sea Breeze with a good skin lotion for use on minor irritations, especially the ones that itch.  </li>
            <li>When the box arrived it was pretty wet.</li>
            <li>I usually buy a generic lotion with pump, pour in a little Sea Breeze, and keep the mixture sitting right on my lavatory cabinet top.</li>
            <li>I have no reason to doubt them, I just don&#x27;t remember back that far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the original formula is hard to find.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the original formula is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sea Breeze for a long, long time every since I graduated from</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the orginal product for a long time.</li>
            <li> but my chin and cheek are ashy and dry.</li>
            <li> Your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using this newer formula.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> occasionally though theres one or two little zits, but it eventually goes away.</li>
            <li> It keeps getting harder and harder to find in the stores</li>
            <li> To tame a sunburn or insect bite, to soothe skin after shaving, to help get deeply embedded garden dirt out of your skin, there&#x27;s nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Contains aspirin, so BE CAREFUL if allergic!</li>
            <li> For those in the know, it&#x27;s not the original formula which I&#x27;ve been unable to find lately.  </li>
            <li> It is just sad that the price is so high.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it was a little too harsh on my skin because of the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but they did, and since the package is heavy</li>
            <li> I used it once-a-day everyday for about a week and during that time, I noticed that it made me break out, specifically on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from using it everyday to about once or twice a week, but still, these bumps persisted and didn&#x27;t go away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this product and its sister product (Sea Breeze Actives which is excellent for the skin as well as for minor itches-- I actually buy the Actives about 2 to 1 to the Original). This original formulation I use for shaving. Whether I use foam, a blade or an electric razor, my facial skin will itch and burn after a shave-- unless I use this product. In fact, I put Noxema on my hand, sprinkle in Sea Breeze, and shave with a disposable razor. When I am finished, I wipe (not wash) it away and use the Sea Breeze as an after shave-- never a problem.</li>
            <li> Sea Breeze Original is the only astringent my family uses.  As a child my mom would use this product to soothe a mosquito bite, as I entered my teen years my sisters said to use it to cleanse my face and so the story goes.  I introduced it to my husband , and now my son uses it to fight teen skin problems with great success.   We have tried the other varieties of Sea Breeze Astringent , but for our household the ORIGINAL FORMULA is #1 !!!</li>
            <li> The original and best facial astringent.  Far superior to the new Sea Breeze products</li>
            <li> oh my goodness, nothing compare to the orginal formula. as with all the other reviews I have been using this for more years than I care to admitt. I can not believe that after reading a review here at amazon.com that I found the orginal formula at my local walmart. I am so happy that it&#x27;s back and I dont have to order on line now.</li>
            <li> Original Formula. Best Seabreeze formula. Ever. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer just ignores customers who have faithfully bought Sea Breeze original most of their lives.  A friend introduced me to this in my teens, I&#x27;ve used it for over 40 years and really love it.  No store near me carries it anymore, I&#x27;ve checked and called, nobody carries it now.  I agree the other versions are awful, even the scent of all of them is awful, but none of them is anywhere near the same, I will not buy them.  I also bought some \\&quot;original\\&quot; on Amazon, but it&#x27;s a case of \\&quot;gotcha\\&quot; (I&#x27;ve experienced that a number of times online), the sellers know it&#x27;s impossible to find, how THEY bought up tons of it I don&#x27;t know, but they did, and since the package is heavy it&#x27;s now a very expensive item including shipping; sometimes the price alone is outrageous, too.  It never makes sense to me, though - a company has an original product which made a NAME for the brand.  Then they decide to introduce new versions, which is fine and dandy.  But why does ANY of them abandon the original version?  They could keep making it but for whatever bizarre reason they stop.  Talk about a lack of loyalty to customers, there it is.  Once I can&#x27;t find it at all, I will NOT buy the other versions, guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to good old witch hazel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest. I don&#x27;t know why Sea-breeze is so stupid to quit making this product.</li>
            <li> The same Sea Breeze that was a cure all from my childhood. Can be used for insect bites, as an astringent, or aromatherapy for a tingly head massage!</li>
            <li> The product is just a promised and arrived in well-protected packaging. Satisfied :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am so angry with Clairol for discontinuing this product! I have been using it since it first came on the market and there is no satisfactory substitute that I have found.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to be able to find this product.  I was so sad when they quit selling it and have hunted and hunted to find it.  It is just sad that the price is so high.  But I shall keep getting it as there is no where else to go.</li>
            <li> I love this Sea Breeze Original product.  I have used it for over 10 years.  I don&#x27;t understand why the original formula is hard to find.  It is perfect for cleaning and refreshing your face after a long day.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed. Tho&#x27; the ingredients are the same and in the same order as the genuine Original this is NOT the same. There&#x27;s a strong smell of camphor, and this version doesn&#x27;t give the skin tingle that it used to. I believe they&#x27;re using very little peppermint, clove or eucalyptus and those are the things that make Sea Breeze so refreshing. I tried to email the company that makes it now using the address from their site, but it kept coming back as undeliverable. Seems they don&#x27;t care for feedback.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> To day I received what I thought was Sea Breeze Orginal but it was not, even though it says on the bottle Orginal Formula it is NOT.  VERY DISAPPOINTED .  Will return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various astringents in during my adolescence, but NONE have given my skin the tingle I feel like Sea Breeze Astringent Original Formula. This product is definitely worth the cost: it helps fight pimples, keeps my face toned, and gives me a great tingling feeling after applying it (so it obviously works). If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, try this Original Formula (which they don&#x27;t frickin make anymore)</li>
            <li> this is amazing. im 18 and have a horrendous case of bad acne all over my face + very oily skin. used numerous acne products that never worked but i have been using this daily for about 2 months and BAM! all my pimples disappeared leaving my skin feeling very clean. occasionally though theres one or two little zits, but it eventually goes away. highly reccomend this-it&#x27;s good for mosquito bites &amp; rashes too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 25 years. I was really dissapointed to find they had quite making it.  I know, my wife thinks I&#x27;m nuts, too, but check online.  There are tons of people dedicated to this stuff.  In recents years I&#x27;ve had to purchase it online, including a recent purchase of a supply from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve written letters, called the manufacturer, spoken to WalMart buyers. . .NOTHING.  Then. . . last week I noticed my local WalMart has started carrying it (In IL), replacing the Actives line.  Happy Day!  This stuff is the best facial cleaner ever produced.  I hope they keep it around.  I&#x27;d considering buying the patent if they&#x27;d let me.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice an improvement in my skin, been using for about a month. Gives your face a clean feeling though.</li>
            <li> Always keep it on hand.  Great to use as an astringent and always use to sanitize cuts.</li>
            <li> Love the Original formula.  No filmy residue like the replacement formula.  Skin feels refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li> When we heard the news, we quickly stocked up.  I am 57 years old and have used the original formula daily since age 12.  Manufacturer: please reconsider your decision to discontinue the ORIGINAL --- it&#x27;s a non-greasy classic.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blessed with clear skin in high school, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m not aware of my good fortune. That was going on 40 years ago now, and I recall having had somewhat oily skin in the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone, and some blackheads there, too. I think it was a cousin who taught me about Sea Breeze. I used it probably a couple of times a week, and it kept the oil away without drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed reviewers mention that this is not the same formula or scent they remember. I have no reason to doubt them, I just don&#x27;t remember back that far. I bought this for my husband who is having some breakouts, and he is very pleased with it. I will buy this again. The price is right, it is a good product and it still smells nice.</li>
            <li> If you want your face to look clean minus all of the zits then this is the product for you. Strong, but does not leave much of a scent so it is perfect for men or women.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 16 years old. Nothing makes my face feel clean and fresh like Sea Breeze does. Even though I am now 55, and have to get it at Amazon, its worth any penny I spend.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for getting dirt out of the pours of the skin. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Recently my face has gone from being normal to combination, where my forehead gets pretty oily but my chin and cheek are ashy and dry. I figured a toner, such as this one, would do my face some good and perhaps help control the oil. When I first applied it, I immediately felt a cool and refreshing sensation, which I liked. I used it once-a-day everyday for about a week and during that time, I noticed that it made me break out, specifically on my forehead. My forehead went from smooth to bumpy. I decided to switch from using it everyday to about once or twice a week, but still, these bumps persisted and didn&#x27;t go away. Perhaps it was a little too harsh on my skin because of the alcohol in it. I&#x27;m going to try an alcohol-free toner and see if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li> This is the wonder tonic you&#x27;ve been looking for. Your face will feel clean and refreshed, and your pimples shrink like you&#x27;ve never seen before. Seriously. I use this daily and have used it for 17 years. When I packed my hospital bag for delivering my son I made sure I had a travel bottle of sea breeze. I use it every single day. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sea Breeze for a long, long time every since I graduated from Cosmetology College many, many years ago... This newer version of the original Sea Breeze seems to be more moisturizing than the Old Original brand. Your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using this newer formula. I found it to be very good!</li>
            <li> My fault. I didn&#x27;t compare my old bottle to the new. This is a ten ounce, not the 16 ounce bottle. I paid nearly double my Walmart price when considering shipping. I feel stupid. I&#x27;ve come to think that Amazon pricers are always competitive. In this case check before you buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving and using Sea Breeze original astringent with its clear light golden tint and eucalyptus hint since I first discovered it close to a decade ago; I&#x27;m also a pushover for attractive packaging, which is the reason I bought it the very first time. To tame a sunburn or insect bite, to soothe skin after shaving, to help get deeply embedded garden dirt out of your skin, there&#x27;s nothing like it. I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out it needs to be Sea Breeze original; Actives doesn&#x27;t cut it. My local Big Box store has started stocking this product on a regular basis again, and I&#x27;ve heartened to know I can order it on Amazon in case there&#x27;s a lull in its presence on retail shelves.</li>
            <li> Good product to use in pregnancy, no harsh chemicals in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the orginal product for a long time. It isn&#x27;t sold near here.  The product is excellent as it was years ago..  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that actually works! I try to stock up on as many bottles as I can because I use it daily and will continue to use it daily. It keeps my skin feeling and looking amazing. I never get acne when using this product and it helps keep my oily skin in check. It keeps getting harder and harder to find in the stores so I am so glad they sell it on Amazon. The original formula is the best. I hate the sensitive skin formula. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. If you are looking for an astringent- look no further than Sea Breeze original formula. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Contains aspirin, so BE CAREFUL if allergic! The ad should certainly contain a warning to the allergen!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the original.  I love it.  I use it on my face as an astringent before my night cream.  No matter how well I wash my face first, Sea Breeze gets more dirt and makeup off.  It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have this old standby product available again.  It&#x27;s strong medicine; so, use it carefully, but it can be very helpful for certain situations.  I like to mix a small amount of Sea Breeze with a good skin lotion for use on minor irritations, especially the ones that itch.  I usually buy a generic lotion with pump, pour in a little Sea Breeze, and keep the mixture sitting right on my lavatory cabinet top.</li>
            <li> For those in the know, it&#x27;s not the original formula which I&#x27;ve been unable to find lately.  This is a reasonable substitute, but it is not as powerful and has the somewhat &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling of the new formula.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product the cleanses the skin like Sea Breeze does.  It digs deep into your pores and strips out every spec of dirt possible.  Cool stuff!  Happy shopping!  :)</li>
            <li> When the box arrived it was pretty wet. Upon opening i saw that the cap was taped.&lt;br /&gt;Scotch tape wrapped all over the place. Bottle was maybe half full and still dripping.&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy about losing that much Sea Breeze. I sure wish the seller would do something about the loss.</li>
            <li> Brought back memories I had growing up. My grandpa always used it on our bug bites.</li>
            <li> I love the ORIGINAL Sea Breeze.  I am so happy to be able to order it on line since it can not be found in the stores.</li>
            <li> The only liquid I use for an after shave for 40 years. Smells fresh . Doesn&#x27;t leave a sickening after odor.</li>
