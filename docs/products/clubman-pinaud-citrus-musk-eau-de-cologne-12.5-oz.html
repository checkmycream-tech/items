    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent shipping time.</li>
            <li>Pinaud Citrus and Lime are the best deal in town.  </li>
            <li>Excellent summber time cologne.  </li>
            <li>One of the greatest summer scents ever created!</li>
            <li>Awesome purchase on my part and WILL purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>The Clubman products are very good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Clubman has yet another great scent..</li>
            <li>Happy with product &amp; delivery</li>
            <li>Smells great...</li>
            <li>Feels great.  </li>
            <li>Osage Rub is another great product too.</li>
            <li>great price and nice aroma!</li>
            <li>Good smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love it, great stuff AAA+++</li>
            <li>Then proceed with having an amazing day.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>And it is nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect to splash on all summer long.</li>
            <li>I personaly feel that this cologne is excellent, though not as good as the classic, or the their bay rum, but those are aftershaves, so I think that maybe you can not really compare them to this cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came as requested and very quickly.</li>
            <li>I think it is too strong...</li>
            <li>They have a light sent that is invigorating and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I enjoy the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve tried in years, the other great one being Pinaud Lime Sec.</li>
            <li>Price is much better than much higher priced, overpowering, products.</li>
            <li>, I just feel that this is more first time friendly, as the lime is not so</li>
            <li>Reminds me of clean sheets.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing scent, cool on the face, I will buy more, this a new favorite now!</li>
            <li>It burns a little, and then feels great.  </li>
            <li>Personally I love this and the Lime Sec that Pinaud do.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh and invigorating, without being sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Got it fast, fast, fast.</li>
            <li>but then it may be that my husband uses too much.</li>
            <li>I love this product along with the lime sec version.</li>
            <li>To instantly feel amazing, shave your face and/or head, rinse with hot water, pat dry, then apply citrus musk.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong citrus scent at first then tapers down after a bit.</li>
            <li>The CLUBMAN LIME MUSK after shave has a bitter lime scent that is just fine in the AM for a splash of scent.  </li>
            <li>Pinaud is very old line of fragrances that were used in barbershops since before you were born.</li>
            <li>When I have to buy again I&#x27;d even go so far to see what else this vendor has to sell.</li>
            <li>After the initial application the fragrance becomes much milder.</li>
            <li>This is a slightly lime scented somewhat sweet fragrance but it is not over powering.</li>
            <li>I would try this before the Lime Sec, though I do enjoy the Lime Sec</li>
            <li>far as the citrus musk goes, it has the same lime sent as the Lime sec, but not nearly as strong, and there are so many other citrus scents in there as well.  </li>

            <li> My husband likes this fragrance and uses it as an after shave. I think it is too strong...but then it may be that my husband uses too much.</li>
            <li> great price and nice aroma!</li>
            <li> Clubman has yet another great scent..manly..crisp</li>
            <li> The CLUBMAN LIME MUSK after shave has a bitter lime scent that is just fine in the AM for a splash of scent.  Only lasts about two hours or so but this isn&#x27;t a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though,  I ordered the LIME MUSK but they sent me the regular MUSK which has a reddish color instead.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve tried in years, the other great one being Pinaud Lime Sec. Perfect to splash on all summer long. The only small issue is like 4711 it only lasts about an hour, but at this price keep putting it on!</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a couple others from the Clubman line.  This one I like to use as an aftershave.  It burns a little, and then feels great.  To instantly feel amazing, shave your face and/or head, rinse with hot water, pat dry, then apply citrus musk.  Then proceed with having an amazing day.</li>
            <li> Personally I love this and the Lime Sec that Pinaud do.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh and invigorating, without being sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Wanted something with a muskier scent. Way too citrussy. Excellent shipping time.</li>
            <li> Pinaud Citrus and Lime are the best deal in town.  They have a light sent that is invigorating and not overpowering.  Price is much better than much higher priced, overpowering, products.</li>
            <li> I love it, great stuff AAA+++</li>
            <li> Excellent summber time cologne.  I personaly feel that this cologne is excellent, though not as good as the classic, or the their bay rum, but those are aftershaves, so I think that maybe you can not really compare them to this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the citrus musk goes, it has the same lime sent as the Lime sec, but not nearly as strong, and there are so many other citrus scents in there as well.  It does grow slightly powdery  with time, but remains citrus..cy? and limey.  I would try this before the Lime Sec, though I do enjoy the Lime Sec, I just feel that this is more first time friendly, as the lime is not so intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me, or still have your doubts buy it, its only ten bucks, and if you end up not being a fan then just use it as your junk/mucking around cologne.</li>
            <li> Happy with product &amp; delivery</li>
            <li> One of the greatest summer scents ever created!</li>
            <li> It has a strong citrus scent at first then tapers down after a bit. Very pleasing scent, cool on the face, I will buy more, this a new favorite now!</li>
            <li> Smells great...Feels great.  Got it fast, fast, fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product along with the lime sec version. I&#x27;ve never had a customer utter a negative word against this stuff. Good smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The Clubman products are very good for the price.  This size bottle will last you a while. This scent compliments any &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; type of shaving soaps especially if you like the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; old-fashioned scents that you may remember. The scent is not overpowering.  All in all, I enjoy the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> Came as requested and very quickly. Awesome purchase on my part and WILL purchase from this vendor again. When I have to buy again I&#x27;d even go so far to see what else this vendor has to sell.</li>
            <li> Added this to my arsenal of shaving goods. Nice scent that stays with you all day. Reminds me of clean sheets. Osage Rub is another great product too.</li>
            <li> Pinaud is very old line of fragrances that were used in barbershops since before you were born. This is a slightly lime scented somewhat sweet fragrance but it is not over powering. After the initial application the fragrance becomes much milder. Someone has to be quite close to catch it. And it is nice.</li>
