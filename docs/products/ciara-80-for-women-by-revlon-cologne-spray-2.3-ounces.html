            <li>Many times it is my Tom Ford or Angel, but</li>
            <li>just as many times it is Ciara.  </li>
            <li>She loved the scent and the price was just amazing; much cheaper than we could find it at any store.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing a lot more.  </li>

            <li>Nice, smooth smell.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cologne a lot.</li>
            <li>It is very clean, meaning it does not give a headache from smelling it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, and am glad to be able to purchase it inline.</li>
            <li>There is no other cologne out there like it; its uniquely beautiful.  </li>
            <li>And wow, it is so much cheaper than what I paid 25 years ago, and smells just as wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But it still is a very good smell, deep, warm, with  bitter-spicy main notes.  </li>
            <li>This is her absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>Even with Free shipping, I received the item in 3 days.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
            <li>(Available on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Dove-Bar-Soap-Rebalance-Count/dp/B00AE07IEM/ref&#x3D;lh_ni_t?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER)</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 bottles of Ciara and felt the value was great and the product is the same; would order again.</li>
            <li>this product is wonderful, the strength is just right, not to heavy or light</li>
            <li>Nice soft fragrance with a hint of cedar.</li>
            <li>Ciara is a magnificent fragrance; rich yet subtle.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I discovered this fragrance many many years ago ,as the wife of his former employer wore this .</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just as stated, no problems, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Classic, warm, soft yet strong.  </li>
            <li>I clearly detect leather on top.</li>
            <li>it s worth</li>
            <li>it smile</li>
            <li>THE SCENT REMAINS WITH YOU, WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>SiGh!Oh well charged to experience.throw it in the trash right away.</li>
            <li>and it came so highly recommended; yet, it smelled cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;No nuance.</li>
            <li>For being absolutely dirt cheap, do not discount this scent as cheap, or dated or old.  </li>
            <li>The ciara 80% is a nice light scent without being overpowering or harsh.</li>
            <li>Even though I am not a fan of classical and strict aromas - i usually go for more \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; kind, I admit that a couple of times I bought something similar to Ciara in the past, for winter - so i feel happy with my purchase and plan to put it to good use when it gets colder.</li>
            <li>I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne for years now, and still like it very much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for that special lady in your life, and this vendor.</li>
            <li>This is most definitely one of my favorites</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I am startled by total strangers asking me what I am wearing!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and I can get it cheaper than buying it locally anywhere.</li>
            <li>She loves it. ; )</li>
            <li>(Thanks Amazon!)  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and it&#x27;s getting really hard to find where I live, so ordering on line and from this seller was simple and it arrived quickly and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>I was unable to find this product in stores in my area so was thrilled when I found them on Amazon -- and at such a good price!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to wear, very affordable, subtly spiced, sweet &amp; rich oriental.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand certain colognes because they make my eyes water, but Ciara 80 strength never does.</li>
            <li>It is a very pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li>For a cheaper cologne, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is really a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years and will continue to do so, thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love Ciara, hard to find local, so glad you have it.</li>
            <li>Classic cologne</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law uses this perfume and it was wonderful to find it again online for her because she was running low and unable to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>It is a classic and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and kinda sexy to the nose.  </li>
            <li>and I have a few more dollars in my pocket.  </li>
            <li>Well for several years I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because of that, but I finally gave in and now I don&#x27;t really like very many other scents.</li>
            <li>found my new supplier.</li>
            <li>It has such a soft pretty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the price is less than half what you would pay in dept. store.</li>
            <li>Ciara, while marketed &amp; made for women, can work really well for us guys IF you wear it very sparingly (like one small spray on your chest, and maybe even a smaller squirt on the back of your neck...</li>
            <li>This is every bit the exact same item you get in the stores for considerably less.  </li>

            <li> Smells classy and strict, at the same time makes you think of a cozy winter evening in front of a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It has an expensive smell, lasts all day, yet the cost is minimal compared to the scent I wear for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the 100, because you use less, and it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> One of the few scents made that smell the same all day long on me.  </li>
            <li> (This is the tall, larger bottle, not the little one).</li>
            <li> The only downside - it&#x27;s just a tad harsh to my nose.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and was curious if this one would be as fragrant ..</li>
            <li> It has been hard to find locally</li>
            <li> THIS WAS 30% LESS THAN IN STORE AND NO</li>
            <li> Ciara hits all the right bells for me, including a deep &amp; luscious base with an ever so slight wisp of powder in the heart.</li>
            <li> It is the only cologne that I wear, that isn&#x27;t expensive, designer cologne.</li>
            <li> I know what they mean for</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this order.</li>
            <li> on.as soon as i put it on been sneezing badly and after few minutes got headache.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as delicious a scent as my Rebalance Dove soap with Sakura Blossom and Plum.</li>

            <li> Just like I remember!  And wow, it is so much cheaper than what I paid 25 years ago, and smells just as wonderful.  (This is the tall, larger bottle, not the little one). So glad to have found it again as it has always been my favorite.  Hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> It is what was advertised -no problems, happy customer.  My wife has been using this for years.  Etc Etc Etc Etc/</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent for everyday.  It has an expensive smell, lasts all day, yet the cost is minimal compared to the scent I wear for special occasions.  Also, my husband likes it, so that makes it a winner for me!</li>
            <li> Just got this crap today.Ordered this based on the good reviews so excited and tried it on.as soon as i put it on been sneezing badly and after few minutes got headache.And when hubby smells it he said that it makes him nauseous.SiGh!Oh well charged to experience.throw it in the trash right away.So i think this smell is not for me.but not everybody have same taste but i just want to say what i want to say.</li>
            <li> Even with Free shipping, I received the item in 3 days. They have the best price anywhere.</li>
            <li> I smells really good and was shipped to me in a timely manner&lt;br /&gt;and the price you can not beat</li>
            <li> Beautiful Cologne-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always loved wearing this cologne.  It has such a soft pretty fragrance.  It is very light not too over powering.  I have worn this cologne, for many, many years.  Just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Farrell E. Manuel</li>
            <li> Ciara for women this is a perfume I have wore for quite some time. I love this perfume and it&#x27;s getting really hard to find where I live, so ordering on line and from this seller was simple and it arrived quickly and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom. Package was damaged.</li>
            <li> Love Ciara, hard to find local, so glad you have it. A Looong time ago, my dh came home telling me about this cologne, saying one of the girls at the office was wearing this and he really liked it. Well for several years I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because of that, but I finally gave in and now I don&#x27;t really like very many other scents.</li>
            <li> This is every bit the exact same item you get in the stores for considerably less.  I saw some reviews that it wasn&#x27;t the same perfume, but trust me... it is!  Just wanted to be sure to let others know!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Very easy to wear, very affordable, subtly spiced, sweet &amp; rich oriental. Ciara hits all the right bells for me, including a deep &amp; luscious base with an ever so slight wisp of powder in the heart. The ylang-ylang, opopanax and resins are joyous on my skin. I clearly detect leather on top. The only downside - it&#x27;s just a tad harsh to my nose.</li>
            <li> If it is six stars for her it is six stars for me.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on women.  It is a very pleasing scent.  I purchased this product for my wife and love the way it smells on her.  Highly recommend for that special lady in your life, and this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have used Ciara for many years and still get weekly compliments. The ciara 80% is a nice light scent without being overpowering or harsh. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> this came perfectly packed and was a great price, was very pleased and will buy again...also shipped in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I have used Ciara for over 25 years. I prefer the 100, because you use less, and it seems to last longer. I think the scent is timeless. For a cheaper cologne, I really like it. it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. It is the only cologne that I wear, that isn&#x27;t expensive, designer cologne.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, hard to find, great value!</li>
            <li> Love Ciara. Only perfume to wear. Your prices and shipping are terrific.</li>
            <li> Love it! My husband and I discovered this fragrance many many years ago ,as the wife of his former employer wore this .</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for many years and I receive many compliments on how nice and inoffensive it is.  I know what they mean for I can&#x27;t stand certain colognes because they make my eyes water, but Ciara 80 strength never does. I love it.</li>
            <li> It has a very attractive price &amp; good reviews!  It was delivered quickly.  I had never used Ciara by Revlon before, so i was not sure how exactly it smells.  Basing on reviews I decided to try. I guess the style and color of the box/bottle on the picture led me to think that the smell is lighter and sweeter then it turned out to be. But it still is a very good smell, deep, warm, with  bitter-spicy main notes.  Smells classy and strict, at the same time makes you think of a cozy winter evening in front of a Christmas tree. Even though I am not a fan of classical and strict aromas - i usually go for more \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; kind, I admit that a couple of times I bought something similar to Ciara in the past, for winter - so i feel happy with my purchase and plan to put it to good use when it gets colder.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the price is less than half what you would pay in dept. store.</li>
            <li> I was using Avon Timeless, but didn&#x27;t want to get involved with having an Avon Rep constantly calling on me just to get cologne, so after reading online that this is similar, I decided to try it. I do like it very much. Nice soft fragrance with a hint of cedar. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Just as stated, no problems, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this fragrance for years and just discovered it is a much better deal here. found my new supplier.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that I can only define as a perfectly balanced mix of essences that creates an alluring yet demure scent.  Lasts for hours.  This is most definitely one of my favorites and I consider it my signature scent.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful, the strength is just right, not to heavy or light it&#x27;s a great scent for me</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, stays with you but not overpowering.  Classic cologne</li>
            <li> i happen brought it for my mom s gift of xmas last year and  it did smell good so  i recommand u buy it for your mom or sister or grandma or anybody it s worth it smile</li>
            <li> Ciara is a magnificent fragrance; rich yet subtle.  There is no other cologne out there like it; its uniquely beautiful.  A very lovely; timeless cologne by Revlon.</li>
            <li> My mother loved ciara perfumes since the 80&#x27;s so I ordered this for her! she is thrilled with it and so am I.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance and mine. She was wearing this when we met. I dare say she smelled very nice!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this cologne for years, absolutely love it. Getting it a this price makes me love it even more.</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my favorites. I have used it for years. I am very happy with it. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Drugstore cologne and smells like it. I tried to like this because it is a great bargain and it came so highly recommended; yet, it smelled cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;No nuance. Not nearly as delicious a scent as my Rebalance Dove soap with Sakura Blossom and Plum. (Available on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Dove-Bar-Soap-Rebalance-Count/dp/B00AE07IEM/ref&#x3D;lh_ni_t?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER)</li>
            <li> One of the few scents made that smell the same all day long on me.  It does not fade away.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, thanks for supplying it at a great cost!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years.  Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this calogne, am always complimented on how good it smells; not over powering, light vanilla/musk notes.  Fragrance also lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Classic, warm, soft yet strong.  I am a guy, who prefers &amp;#34;Oriental&amp;#34; scents.  I almost always wear Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille or Thierry Mugler Angel.  Ciara, while marketed &amp; made for women, can work really well for us guys IF you wear it very sparingly (like one small spray on your chest, and maybe even a smaller squirt on the back of your neck...THAT&#x27;s it)!!  It is really a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; scent.  People are always asking me what cologne I am wearing....at work, grocery store, car wash, hardware store, restaurants, etc.  Many times it is my Tom Ford or Angel, but just as many times it is Ciara.  For being absolutely dirt cheap, do not discount this scent as cheap, or dated or old.  Again, when worn very carefully, it is kind of awesome actually!!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET HER PERFUME AGAIN. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRICE. THIS WAS 30% LESS THAN IN STORE AND NO TAX OR STANDING IN LINE IS ALWAYS A BONUS.</li>
            <li> I ordered Ciara 80 and received Ciara 100. Didnt notice until after I opened the box and thru it away... I was not happy with this order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years now, and still like it very much. It is very clean, meaning it does not give a headache from smelling it. And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> will reorder when needed</li>
            <li> ALWAYS A GOOD COLOGNE</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this product in stores in my area so was thrilled when I found them on Amazon -- and at such a good price!  I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years and will continue to do so, thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles of Ciara and felt the value was great and the product is the same; would order again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my future mother-in-law. She loved the scent and the price was just amazing; much cheaper than we could find it at any store.</li>
            <li> The order was handled with promptness and accuracy.  I really enjoy this product, and am glad to be able to purchase it inline.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and was curious if this one would be as fragrant ..To my surprise it was! And what a savings</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING CIARA FOR YEARS.  ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS WHEN WEARING.  THE SCENT REMAINS WITH YOU, WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> UMMMM - the aroma is so nice.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law uses this perfume and it was wonderful to find it again online for her because she was running low and unable to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my signature signature scent. My children won&#x27;t allow me to wear anything else. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I am startled by total strangers asking me what I am wearing! That it is wonderful. It is a classic and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and I can get it cheaper than buying it locally anywhere.</li>
            <li> wife just loves this stuff  i found it very sexy and pleasant  Will be purchasing a lot more.  1/2 the price of retail stores</li>
            <li> Excellent price...better than the local department stores. Good value! I would recommend Amozon to any one looking for a great deal!</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth smell.  Long lasting and kinda sexy to the nose.  Love it. I have both the 80% and 100% Ciara.</li>
            <li> Bought for Mother. She loves it. ; )</li>
            <li> We bought this cologne for my mom for Christmas. This is her absolute favorite!  She was complaining about the price of the cologne, so I checked Amazon and I found it $3.00 cheaper!  (Thanks Amazon!)  So she&#x27;s a happy camper and I have a few more dollars in my pocket.  I love the smell of the cologne a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used Ciara for years and have always loved it.  It has been hard to find locally so I was very happy to find it at AMAZON, and the price was great.</li>
