            <li>and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>All-in-all very happy with this headband!!</li>
            <li>Great if you have straight,shiny,or fine-ish hair that headbands just keep off your face.</li>
            <li>Great product but not a color I will wear.</li>
            <li>Great headband and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head.</li>
            <li>This is the best headband, no headaches after wearing all day, it would be great if there were more color</li>
            <li>Best headband ever I bought 2 going to purchase more colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and makes for a great acessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I wear this headband often and love the way it looks, feels, and keeps my hair out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I personally love the design</li>
            <li>I finally found the best headband ever !</li>
            <li>And what i like the most about them is a silicone lines on the bottom side</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what color I would get</li>
            <li>This is the most  comfortable headband I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Always the best fit and durable for long term use.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one so much, I ordered two more immediately.</li>
            <li>I actually had to search for this online,as I had one that broke (after over a year or so)and was so happy to find them again.</li>
            <li>the most comfortable I have had but good quality non the less.</li>
            <li>I really, really wish this came in more colors.</li>
            <li>Good headband, wide, and strong.</li>
            <li>and this looks great but the headband is a bit too tight to keep it on all day.  </li>
            <li>Love the wide width and the little grippy teeth hold perfectly and don&#x27;t bite into my scalp AND is doesn&#x27;t slide!!!.</li>
            <li>the low price, it is the widest, most comfortable headband I could find.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work for a child in elementary school.</li>
            <li>my child has thick hair and needs a strong headband with good teeth  to grip her hair.</li>
            <li>But, the gripper teeth at the top are not very long, are of a soft material like a synthetic rubber and are too small/short for gripping into my thicker, fuller, longer curly hair, so it does not stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>Cute for a puffy updo on the back of my kid&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>This appeared to be exactly that.</li>
            <li>I wore it to a party at night, didn&#x27;t think it was too hot, but I did sweat a bit.</li>
            <li>Well, it doesnt hurts my head like others headband but the ones with elastic on the back, hold my hair better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute but not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>so so comfortable and the right width it holds your hair in place it would be wonderfull if they came in different colours too and desighns like animal print as there used to be a tortishell style shame</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s still far more comfortable and stationary than just about any other headband I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so they really hold hair in place.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a comfortable headband and especially a no slip one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fairly comfortable for a large, wide headband.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it, and why I knocked out one star, is that the &#x27;teeth&#x27; that keeps the band from moving back and forth on your head is made out of some really cheap rubber.</li>
            <li>only dislikes i have is that they break or stretch after a while &amp; that I can no longer buy them in Australia, but I wear them all day &amp; don&#x27;t really look after them, if you were careful they would be fine for along time.</li>
            <li>That is, it always seems like it&#x27;s tilted too far forward or back, and only one side (the front or the back) of the band is ever touching my skull.</li>
            <li>I usually get headaches from headbands, but I&#x27;ve been fine with these.</li>
            <li>But keep in mind, they re super wide, not what you would regularly buy at pharmacies.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and is curved/shaped to fit your round, curved head properly.</li>
            <li>I like this in general, as for the price, it is the widest</li>
            <li>This feels odd enough that I&#x27;m aware of it, but I suppose I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>So, one is comfortable right above/behind my ears where the &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; terminate,&amp;#34; and the other digs in just a little too hard.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip inside this band really &#x27;plumps&#x27; your hair up,and with a little spray,it lasts all day.</li>

            <li> Instead it&#x27;s an almost cheetah-like black and clear pattern.</li>
            <li> and so far no headaches for being too tight.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a headband larger than one inch (which was harder than I&#x27;d like to admit)</li>
            <li> The band itself is too wide (or my skull is too short).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who plays volleyball and the wide band  kept her bangs back and did not slip.</li>
            <li> I  have a pretty small head and this was too tight and gave me an excruciating headache by the end of the work day.</li>
            <li> main complaint is that you cannot select the color.</li>
            <li> Despite the product description saying it is solid black, I have gotten two black/white leopard-print pattern headbands.</li>
            <li> I received a black and white spotted blotchy colored headband.</li>
            <li> but it ended up being a solid matte black.</li>
            <li> It does the trick if you&#x27;re looking for a wide headband.</li>
            <li> keeps slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> The headband doesn&#x27;t slip but its way too wide for my head</li>
            <li> Two bands came with my purchase, and one has a tighter diameter than the other.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the little teeth on the underside keep it from slipping or moving.</li>
            <li> I assumed it would at least be a solid color.</li>
            <li> As I write this review, it&#x27;s been a year since I bought this item, and I still use it after all this time despite the rubbery mess.</li>
            <li> I purchased the headband for my motor cycle rids, the teeth on the headband slips and has little grip to hold air in place..</li>
            <li> In the title it says colors may vary, but in the description it says plain black.</li>
            <li> Wide headbands are hard to find, so I decided to take a chance on this.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> And, I usually prefer leather or fabric headbands in this width--rather than the shiny plastic this is made</li>
            <li> This is very frustrating when all I want is a wide, plain black headband.</li>
            <li> These headbands had been discontinued by the maker, so they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> the headband gets a little uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing.  </li>
            <li> I need one like this to hold my thick curly hair out of my face.</li>
            <li> The little rubber teeth make all the difference and holds to my head firmly without being painful.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stab or pinch your skin behind your ears.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no headaches or need to remove it because it was irritating.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves this hair band.</li>
            <li> the headband gets a little uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing.  It starts pinching the side of my ear/head.&lt;br /&gt;Not the most comfortable I have had but good quality non the less.</li>
            <li> This is the best headband, no headaches after wearing all day, it would be great if there were more color choices.&lt;br /&gt;The only dislikes i have is that they break or stretch after a while &amp; that I can no longer buy them in Australia, but I wear them all day &amp; don&#x27;t really look after them, if you were careful they would be fine for along time.</li>
            <li> This is your basic headband. It does the trick if you&#x27;re looking for a wide headband. It doesn&#x27;t stab or pinch your skin behind your ears. It doesn&#x27;t slip. It&#x27;s cute and makes for a great acessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that you cannot select the color. Despite the product description saying it is solid black, I have gotten two black/white leopard-print pattern headbands. This is very frustrating when all I want is a wide, plain black headband.</li>
            <li> Good headband, wide, and strong. Essential for growing out bangs. Fits both my 8 y.o. and me.  Cute for a puffy updo on the back of my kid&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> I like this in general, as for the price, it is the widest I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly comfortable for a large, wide headband. It is lightweight and is curved/shaped to fit your round, curved head properly. But, the gripper teeth at the top are not very long, are of a soft material like a synthetic rubber and are too small/short for gripping into my thicker, fuller, longer curly hair, so it does not stay in place very well. If I bend over to pull weeds while gardening, for example, it slips forward or falls backward on my head. And, I usually prefer leather or fabric headbands in this width--rather than the shiny plastic this is made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the low price, it is the widest, most comfortable headband I could find. Amazon always has these in stock and since my local stores do not carry them in this larger width on a regular basis anymore, I order them here.</li>
            <li> I wear this headband often and love the way it looks, feels, and keeps my hair out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Most headbands tend to slip off my head or give me headaches but this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the most  comfortable headband I have ever owned. Love the wide width and the little grippy teeth hold perfectly and don&#x27;t bite into my scalp AND is doesn&#x27;t slide!!!. I loved the first one so much, I ordered two more immediately. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I actually had to search for this online,as I had one that broke (after over a year or so)and was so happy to find them again.Great if you have straight,shiny,or fine-ish hair that headbands just keep off your face.The rubber grip inside this band really &#x27;plumps&#x27; your hair up,and with a little spray,it lasts all day.Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> In the title it says colors may vary, but in the description it says plain black. I took my chances. I received a black and white spotted blotchy colored headband. I assumed it would at least be a solid color. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the little teeth on the underside keep it from slipping or moving.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a headband larger than one inch (which was harder than I&#x27;d like to admit) but I finally found one and it&#x27;s great! The little rubber teeth make all the difference and holds to my head firmly without being painful. I&#x27;ve worn it for some hours and I&#x27;ve had no headaches or need to remove it because it was irritating. WARNING: The band I received was NOT the one pictured. Instead it&#x27;s an almost cheetah-like black and clear pattern. I personally love the design but I&#x27;m covering it up anyways for a costume so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. All-in-all very happy with this headband!!</li>
            <li> The inside teeth are made of a rubbery substance, so it doesn&#x27;t bite into my skull and it stays put. The band itself is too wide (or my skull is too short). It doesn&#x27;t sit flush on my head across the width of the band. That is, it always seems like it&#x27;s tilted too far forward or back, and only one side (the front or the back) of the band is ever touching my skull. This feels odd enough that I&#x27;m aware of it, but I suppose I&#x27;ll get used to it. Two bands came with my purchase, and one has a tighter diameter than the other. So, one is comfortable right above/behind my ears where the &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; terminate,&amp;#34; and the other digs in just a little too hard. That said, it&#x27;s still far more comfortable and stationary than just about any other headband I&#x27;ve owned. I usually get headaches from headbands, but I&#x27;ve been fine with these.</li>
            <li> I finally found the best headband ever ! so so comfortable and the right width it holds your hair in place it would be wonderfull if they came in different colours too and desighns like animal print as there used to be a tortishell style shame i cant get them anymore in the uk so having to ask a friend of a friend to recieve and post them to me in the uk.</li>
            <li> Great product but not a color I will wear. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These headbands had been discontinued by the maker, so they are hard to find. And what i like the most about them is a silicone lines on the bottom side so they really hold hair in place. But keep in mind, they re super wide, not what you would regularly buy at pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Always the best fit and durable for long term use.</li>
            <li> I really, really wish this came in more colors. I need one like this to hold my thick curly hair out of my face. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the headband for my motor cycle rids, the teeth on the headband slips and has little grip to hold air in place..</li>

            <li> I  have a pretty small head and this was too tight and gave me an excruciating headache by the end of the work day. Perhaps it would work for a child in elementary school.</li>
            <li> Wide headbands are hard to find, so I decided to take a chance on this.  It&#x27;s very cute but not very comfortable.  I like to wear my hair a bit retro a la 1960&#x27;s-70&#x27;s and this looks great but the headband is a bit too tight to keep it on all day.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what color I would get but it ended up being a solid matte black.</li>
            <li> keeps slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> my child has thick hair and needs a strong headband with good teeth  to grip her hair. This appeared to be exactly that. But it isn&#x27;t. The teeth are flat and don&#x27;t hold her hair back.We have been looking for a band like the one hairband she owns but have not yet found it. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a comfortable headband and especially a no slip one.  The headband doesn&#x27;t slip but its way too wide for my head and so far no headaches for being too tight.</li>
            <li> Great headband and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head. The only issue I have with it, and why I knocked out one star, is that the &#x27;teeth&#x27; that keeps the band from moving back and forth on your head is made out of some really cheap rubber. I wore it to a party at night, didn&#x27;t think it was too hot, but I did sweat a bit. The rubber melted and turned into stringy rubber after that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headband is still usable. I just had to pull off the stringy parts that came out from under the band. As I write this review, it&#x27;s been a year since I bought this item, and I still use it after all this time despite the rubbery mess.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesnt hurts my head like others headband but the ones with elastic on the back, hold my hair better.</li>
