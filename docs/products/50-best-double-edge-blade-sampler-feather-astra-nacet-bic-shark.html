            <li>I&#x27;m already happy with what I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipping was great from this company too.</li>
            <li>Great pack.</li>
            <li>Still the chance to sample from these 10 packs is a great idea.</li>
            <li>Happy testing.</li>
            <li>but all of them are great choices.</li>
            <li>Great selection of blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor variety.  </li>
            <li>The packages came in a zip-top bag that makes storage in my vanity convenient, all of the packaging was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>And some blades out there were way cheaper than the Feathers -- some with good reviews.  </li>
            <li>so choosing this variety pack was a good</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t gone thru them all yet but its a good way to see the differences</li>
            <li>you shave with blades not made with good quality or</li>
            <li>once you found what works and don&#x27;t.. look to buy the good ones in bulk and you&#x27;ll be all set.  </li>
            <li>Good selection.  </li>
            <li>This was a good learning experience.</li>
            <li>One tip I can give is buy yourself some Proraso shaving cream and a good brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to find out which blade is suitable for you.</li>
            <li>I thought undle would be  an excellent opportunity to evaluate different products and find the one best for me.</li>
            <li>Great starter collection of blades for newbies to try out and see which brand is their favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice price, good variety of blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This sampler pack contains a good selection of popular brands.</li>
            <li>This was a great overall sample of some of the best known blades on the market and at a good price</li>
            <li>While I noticed with the feather and derby brand I got an amazing shave</li>
            <li>This is a nice sampler for trying to decide what DE blades you would like.</li>
            <li>Bottom line....be a man and do your own hunting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I picked up this sampler to give myself some blade options in finding out which will work best on my face and</li>
            <li>Best and cheap and worth every penny</li>
            <li>A good purchase for somebody starting out with Safety Razors and are unsure of which blade will work best for them.</li>
            <li>You get twenty of the most popular blades in the world, most in 5-blade boxes, the Lord Super-Chrome is a 10-blade box.  </li>
            <li>Great selection to discover first hand which blades cut closer and which cut smooth, great for first time safety razor users to find which blade works for you</li>
            <li>That gives you enough blades to make plenty of side by side comparisons, and find the blade that best matches your razor and technique.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the variety and ability to try more than one blade of each kind.</li>
            <li>Many to choose from, you are sure to find one that suits you and your razor.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a great value for the razors themselves, but what you are paying for is the selection in reasonable sizes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Along the way I have discovered two things:  As others have already said, each face is different and the best blade for you is something you have to find out for yourself (which is the reason I&#x27;m not bothering you with which blades butchered and which ones babied me).  </li>
            <li>and the shaves were excellent even upto the third week.  </li>
            <li>my opinion the best were Gillette Silver Blue and Feather.</li>
            <li>He also used different shaving soaps, he found the GEL soap the best out of all.</li>
            <li>Some razors are better then others..  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say that this is really an excellent value in terms of price/razor, since several of the ones included here aren&#x27;t considered top notch</li>
            <li>, I would consider it an excellent price for a sample pack every DE shaver should start with (if only to find out everyone probably ends up using Feathers anyways...</li>
            <li>So a blade I love may not work well for you at all and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the more reason to try a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li>As I have started to become more proficient, I will run through the blades again in a month or two after my technique is better to make sure I like the blade</li>
            <li>Love the 7&#x27;O Clock and the Astra&#x27;s but the Feather blades that everyone raves about caused claret to be spilt.</li>
            <li>As your technique changes some blades that you didn&#x27;t like before may work better for you this time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to dislike something that everyone else loves (or like something everyone else hates).</li>
            <li>This pack is a great way to find the blades that work for your particular face.  </li>
            <li>Very good for narrowing down what razor blade is best for your face if you are new to DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I ended up settling on the Astra Superior Platinum and the Gillette Silver Blue, but this sampler allowed me to make sure they were the best type by trying blades which were sufficiently different.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for those who are getting into shaving with safety razors.</li>
            <li>He said the Gillette were hands down the best.</li>
            <li>For example, just because most people love feather blades doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li>This is a win/win for those just starting out because you get a great variety.</li>
            <li>Great way to try different blades.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the variety of blades.  </li>
            <li>Nice selection, and you really need the 5-blade packs to make somewhat of a judgement on whether or not you like a blade or not.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say which is my favorit as each person really needs to sample their own.  </li>
            <li>But I also found two models that were as good as my Feathers (oddly, I&#x27;d never heard of either -- and they are inexpensive blades --</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Shark Super Chrome\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Astra Super Platinum\\&quot; were ok</li>
            <li>and it was smooth and lasted me a full weeks worth of use..  :)</li>
            <li>At this price, when I get through trying each pack, I will finish up the packs I liked, buy the one I liked most in bulk, and save the ones I didn&#x27;t like as emergency spares and not blink an eye if I wind up shelving half the blades in this set.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with 3 of them so far.  </li>
            <li>So far, while Astra and Derby have been some of my favorite, the surprise favorite are the Bics.</li>
            <li>Too much money for 15 good blades...way too much.</li>
            <li>but the blades cute very easily and caused me to break out when I used them daily.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re excellent for shaving tour body and genitals because they&#x27;re somewhat dull</li>
            <li>This pack seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck considering the variety and the quality brands and lack of near duplicates</li>
            <li>Good way try different blades</li>
            <li>LISTED fro BEST to least favorable.</li>
            <li>This sampler seems to have a good variety of different types of blades.  </li>
            <li>so I plan to save 1-2 blades per brand and try them again in 4-6 months once I get better at safety razor shaving (and straight razor shaving for that matter, as I&#x27;m alternating between them).  </li>
            <li>Ben Super Stainless\\&quot; are only good for 1 shave per blade</li>
            <li>Nice starter pack of blades, although I must not shave all that often because I really can&#x27;t tell much difference between the brands of blades.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Which blade shaves best is a personal thing, and can only be discerned by trial and error.  </li>
            <li>As your technique gets better, you will probably want to make a second pass through the assortment, to see if your taste in blades changes as your technique gets better.  </li>
            <li>They blades came very fast and just as described!  </li>
            <li>In this pack I found two models that hamburgered my face on the very first shave.  </li>
            <li>That is essential so that you can figure out which type will meet your own unique needs.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find not only e best blade for your skin but also the extra values like blades that come in a cardboard box vs plastic box, HUGE difference, dispose of your used blades in the back of the plastic box and a safe way to dispose of used blades.</li>
            <li>Hoping they&#x27;re fine as they&#x27;re stainless, I&#x27;ll update once I get to them in my rotation.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Some seem to fall into the cheap category like the BIC and the Nacet Stainless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process right now and it has been fun.</li>
            <li>that the blade you&#x27;re using right now.  </li>
            <li>After developing the right technique some of the ones</li>
            <li>Although you may think sharper is better or more expensive is better with razors</li>
            <li>how ever they do the job much better and faster that traditional razors.  </li>
            <li>So, I recently received this sample pack and to my dismay there were many blades that I saw as filler blades...</li>
            <li>I have yet to figure out if this exact sample pack has the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for my face and my razor, but it was a place to start.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to get twice the number of the blades I want for about the same price as this sampler.  </li>
            <li>But last time I went looking to buy more Feathers</li>
            <li>I though were just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; now may perform better when not in the hands of such a novice...</li>
            <li>I received the exact blades/brands pictured.</li>
            <li>In all, a great way to discover the joys of traditional wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Having a new blade to try all the time made it  fun to shave again.</li>
            <li>instead of purchasing large quantities of each product.</li>
            <li>Maybe by spending a bit extra now, you&#x27;ll realize that the cheapest in the lot suits you jsut fine</li>
            <li>I had heard all about the &amp;#34;magical cutting power&amp;#34; of the Feather blades, but at this point think the Gillette Silvers are the best.....</li>
            <li>The Nacet Platinum are not included, you get two of the Gillette Nacet Stainless.    </li>
            <li>While they all fit all Gillette style double-edged razors; they all shave slightly differently.  </li>
            <li>do wish that the blades I&#x27;ve found that I really like came in boxes with disposal slots.  </li>
            <li>So really.. pick up a sample pack like this and give them a go..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and found 2 that I really like and a couple I didn&#x27;t care for much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this one personally; although I wish it had included the Gillette 7 o&#x27;Clock (Yellow).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten to the other brands yet but more to follow...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got about 7 other packs to try, which as a newbie to DE shaving I find interesting.</li>
            <li>BTW, I only shave every other day or so, but most blades in general seem more affected by time than by # of shaves.  </li>
            <li>Most everything you read will tell you to try a sampler pack if you are new to wet shaving like me.  </li>
            <li>The feathers, Nacets, and Astras were great, the sharks were ok, but the Derbys, bics, and 7 o&#x27;clocks were plain disappointing, my face was quickly irritated and cut up from those blades after never having a problem with the first three.</li>
            <li>Most of these blades are in little cardboard boxes.  </li>
            <li>Fun to try all the different blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the exact assortment shown in the picture (Derby, Shark, Bluebird, Feather, Gilette 7 O&#x27;Clock, Gilette Silver Blue, Bic Chrome Platinum, Astra, Nacet Platinum, and Gilette Nacet Stainless).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to DE razors I highly recommend a sampler pack to get started.</li>
            <li>Others seem to be right up my alley like the gillette silver blue and the bluebird.  </li>
            <li>Being new to DE shaving, I will add to the others who recommended this sampler pack to beginners.</li>
            <li>This is a must-buy for a new user of a double-edged razor.  </li>
            <li>I said I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li>Not a bad sampler pack but a few things to be aware of:    </li>
            <li>This sampler contained all of those, based on this sampler pack I have chosen my first 100 pack of blades and purchased it from the same seller.</li>
            <li>All are new and no rust seen on any so far when opening packages.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably find the perfect blade for your face and it could be less expensive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know all the different brands of razors, but being a novice, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried 4</li>
            <li>Most of the boxes contain 5 blades, a few contain 10; this is more than enough to try each a few times and find out what you do or don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two pieces of advice to anyone new to wet shaving:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>and they last for a decent amount of shaves</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep in mind that each blade is slightly different, coupled with the vast array of slight variations in angles and exposures provided by all the different razors out there, as well as the fact that our faces/beards are all different, your experience will be based on all these variable (not to mention your individual technique, preparation, shaving cream, etc.!).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shark blades simply were bad for my skin type in every way possible,  that being said they may be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have a review of any of the individual blades so far, as I&#x27;m still on me first few DE shaves, and am still learning the techniques.</li>
            <li>I liked the Astras and feathers, but all the others seemed similar and poor quality.</li>
            <li>but I found most of them very dull and they pulled quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Contacted seller and he was prompt to reply, and sent several packages of bluebirds along with the one that was missed with the original package as an apology for missing it.  </li>
            <li>Never expected it.</li>
            <li>He recommends using GEL shaving soap in a can instead of using shaving soap if you have a sensitive skin to moderate.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used 3 of the different types of blades.  </li>
            <li>The blades are cheep enough that when you find one you don&#x27;t like, you can toss it, and skip on to the next blade early.  </li>
            <li>what I ordered was exactly what I received, and that the variety includes both &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; blades such as the Derby, as well as aggressive and ultra sharp blades such as Feather, as well as a variety of in-between blades like Bic, Gillete, Shark, etc.</li>
            <li>It turns out that sometimes a blade that seemed disappointing with the first shave got better with the second and later shaves, apparently because my face needed to adjust to the different brand</li>
            <li>other thing I learned and that really applies with a variety pack is that my face needs to adjust to different blades.  </li>

            <li> my opinion the best were Gillette Silver Blue and Feather.</li>
            <li> He also used different shaving soaps, he found the GEL soap the best out of all.</li>
            <li> Some razors are better then others..  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say that this is really an excellent value in terms of price/razor, since several of the ones included here aren&#x27;t considered top notch</li>
            <li> , I would consider it an excellent price for a sample pack every DE shaver should start with (if only to find out everyone probably ends up using Feathers anyways...</li>
            <li> So a blade I love may not work well for you at all and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the more reason to try a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li> As I have started to become more proficient, I will run through the blades again in a month or two after my technique is better to make sure I like the blade</li>
            <li> Love the 7&#x27;O Clock and the Astra&#x27;s but the Feather blades that everyone raves about caused claret to be spilt.</li>
            <li> As your technique changes some blades that you didn&#x27;t like before may work better for you this time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to dislike something that everyone else loves (or like something everyone else hates).</li>
            <li> This pack is a great way to find the blades that work for your particular face.  </li>
            <li> Very good for narrowing down what razor blade is best for your face if you are new to DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I ended up settling on the Astra Superior Platinum and the Gillette Silver Blue, but this sampler allowed me to make sure they were the best type by trying blades which were sufficiently different.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for those who are getting into shaving with safety razors.</li>
            <li> He said the Gillette were hands down the best.</li>
            <li> For example, just because most people love feather blades doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li> This is a win/win for those just starting out because you get a great variety.</li>
            <li> Great way to try different blades.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the variety of blades.  </li>
            <li> Nice selection, and you really need the 5-blade packs to make somewhat of a judgement on whether or not you like a blade or not.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say which is my favorit as each person really needs to sample their own.  </li>
            <li> But I also found two models that were as good as my Feathers (oddly, I&#x27;d never heard of either -- and they are inexpensive blades --</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Shark Super Chrome\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Astra Super Platinum\\&quot; were ok</li>
            <li> and it was smooth and lasted me a full weeks worth of use..  :)</li>
            <li> At this price, when I get through trying each pack, I will finish up the packs I liked, buy the one I liked most in bulk, and save the ones I didn&#x27;t like as emergency spares and not blink an eye if I wind up shelving half the blades in this set.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with 3 of them so far.  </li>
            <li> So far, while Astra and Derby have been some of my favorite, the surprise favorite are the Bics.</li>
            <li> Too much money for 15 good blades...way too much.</li>
            <li> but the blades cute very easily and caused me to break out when I used them daily.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re excellent for shaving tour body and genitals because they&#x27;re somewhat dull</li>
            <li> This pack seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck considering the variety and the quality brands and lack of near duplicates</li>
            <li> Good way try different blades</li>
            <li> LISTED fro BEST to least favorable.</li>
            <li> This sampler seems to have a good variety of different types of blades.  </li>
            <li> so I plan to save 1-2 blades per brand and try them again in 4-6 months once I get better at safety razor shaving (and straight razor shaving for that matter, as I&#x27;m alternating between them).  </li>
            <li> Ben Super Stainless\\&quot; are only good for 1 shave per blade</li>
            <li> Nice starter pack of blades, although I must not shave all that often because I really can&#x27;t tell much difference between the brands of blades.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Which blade shaves best is a personal thing, and can only be discerned by trial and error.  </li>
            <li> As your technique gets better, you will probably want to make a second pass through the assortment, to see if your taste in blades changes as your technique gets better.  </li>
            <li> They blades came very fast and just as described!  </li>
            <li> In this pack I found two models that hamburgered my face on the very first shave.  </li>
            <li> That is essential so that you can figure out which type will meet your own unique needs.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find not only e best blade for your skin but also the extra values like blades that come in a cardboard box vs plastic box, HUGE difference, dispose of your used blades in the back of the plastic box and a safe way to dispose of used blades.</li>
            <li> Hoping they&#x27;re fine as they&#x27;re stainless, I&#x27;ll update once I get to them in my rotation.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Some seem to fall into the cheap category like the BIC and the Nacet Stainless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process right now and it has been fun.</li>
            <li> that the blade you&#x27;re using right now.  </li>
            <li> After developing the right technique some of the ones</li>
            <li> Although you may think sharper is better or more expensive is better with razors</li>
            <li> how ever they do the job much better and faster that traditional razors.  </li>
            <li> So, I recently received this sample pack and to my dismay there were many blades that I saw as filler blades...</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out if this exact sample pack has the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for my face and my razor, but it was a place to start.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to get twice the number of the blades I want for about the same price as this sampler.  </li>
            <li> But last time I went looking to buy more Feathers</li>
            <li> I though were just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; now may perform better when not in the hands of such a novice...</li>
            <li> I received the exact blades/brands pictured.</li>
            <li> In all, a great way to discover the joys of traditional wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Having a new blade to try all the time made it  fun to shave again.</li>
            <li> instead of purchasing large quantities of each product.</li>
            <li> Maybe by spending a bit extra now, you&#x27;ll realize that the cheapest in the lot suits you jsut fine</li>
            <li> I had heard all about the &amp;#34;magical cutting power&amp;#34; of the Feather blades, but at this point think the Gillette Silvers are the best.....</li>
            <li> The Nacet Platinum are not included, you get two of the Gillette Nacet Stainless.    </li>
            <li> While they all fit all Gillette style double-edged razors; they all shave slightly differently.  </li>
            <li> do wish that the blades I&#x27;ve found that I really like came in boxes with disposal slots.  </li>
            <li> So really.. pick up a sample pack like this and give them a go..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and found 2 that I really like and a couple I didn&#x27;t care for much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this one personally; although I wish it had included the Gillette 7 o&#x27;Clock (Yellow).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to the other brands yet but more to follow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got about 7 other packs to try, which as a newbie to DE shaving I find interesting.</li>
            <li> BTW, I only shave every other day or so, but most blades in general seem more affected by time than by # of shaves.  </li>
            <li> Most everything you read will tell you to try a sampler pack if you are new to wet shaving like me.  </li>
            <li> The feathers, Nacets, and Astras were great, the sharks were ok, but the Derbys, bics, and 7 o&#x27;clocks were plain disappointing, my face was quickly irritated and cut up from those blades after never having a problem with the first three.</li>
            <li> Most of these blades are in little cardboard boxes.  </li>
            <li> Fun to try all the different blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the exact assortment shown in the picture (Derby, Shark, Bluebird, Feather, Gilette 7 O&#x27;Clock, Gilette Silver Blue, Bic Chrome Platinum, Astra, Nacet Platinum, and Gilette Nacet Stainless).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE razors I highly recommend a sampler pack to get started.</li>
            <li> Others seem to be right up my alley like the gillette silver blue and the bluebird.  </li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving, I will add to the others who recommended this sampler pack to beginners.</li>
            <li> This is a must-buy for a new user of a double-edged razor.  </li>
            <li> I said I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li> Not a bad sampler pack but a few things to be aware of:    </li>
            <li> This sampler contained all of those, based on this sampler pack I have chosen my first 100 pack of blades and purchased it from the same seller.</li>
            <li> All are new and no rust seen on any so far when opening packages.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably find the perfect blade for your face and it could be less expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know all the different brands of razors, but being a novice, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried 4</li>
            <li> Most of the boxes contain 5 blades, a few contain 10; this is more than enough to try each a few times and find out what you do or don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two pieces of advice to anyone new to wet shaving:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> and they last for a decent amount of shaves</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep in mind that each blade is slightly different, coupled with the vast array of slight variations in angles and exposures provided by all the different razors out there, as well as the fact that our faces/beards are all different, your experience will be based on all these variable (not to mention your individual technique, preparation, shaving cream, etc.!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shark blades simply were bad for my skin type in every way possible,  that being said they may be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have a review of any of the individual blades so far, as I&#x27;m still on me first few DE shaves, and am still learning the techniques.</li>
            <li> I liked the Astras and feathers, but all the others seemed similar and poor quality.</li>
            <li> but I found most of them very dull and they pulled quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Contacted seller and he was prompt to reply, and sent several packages of bluebirds along with the one that was missed with the original package as an apology for missing it.  </li>
            <li> Never expected it.</li>
            <li> He recommends using GEL shaving soap in a can instead of using shaving soap if you have a sensitive skin to moderate.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used 3 of the different types of blades.  </li>
            <li> The blades are cheep enough that when you find one you don&#x27;t like, you can toss it, and skip on to the next blade early.  </li>
            <li> what I ordered was exactly what I received, and that the variety includes both &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; blades such as the Derby, as well as aggressive and ultra sharp blades such as Feather, as well as a variety of in-between blades like Bic, Gillete, Shark, etc.</li>
            <li> It turns out that sometimes a blade that seemed disappointing with the first shave got better with the second and later shaves, apparently because my face needed to adjust to the different brand</li>
            <li> other thing I learned and that really applies with a variety pack is that my face needs to adjust to different blades.  </li>
            <li> As long as they shave well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I know how long each blade lasts.  </li>
            <li> If I wind up going with one of those it the long run, I guess I&#x27;ll also have to buy one of those 100-blade disposal boxes.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack since I&#x27;m just starting wet shaving.</li>
            <li> With 10 choices it wasn&#x27;t long b4 I found a blade that works well for me.</li>
            <li> Every new to DE shaving needs to get a sampler pack that includes at least (in alpha order), Astra SP, Bic, BlueBird, Feather, Gillette Silver Blue.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can come back and edit this as I try the other blades.</li>
            <li> I will not need to buy another blade for my razor for a long time!</li>
            <li> just realized I didn&#x27;t get any Blue Birds in my package when I went through and opened all the little packages last night.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face and hair is different and what works great for one person may be terrible for another.</li>
            <li> The Shark blades arrive loose, they&#x27;re wrapped but not in a dispenser as per the picture.    </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double-edge razor, which blades to buy can be confusing.  </li>
            <li> it was too rough.</li>
            <li> He said they really rough, NOT sharp,enough.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Come back to the sampler pack after a few months of shaving and try each blade again.</li>
            <li> pack is going to last me over a year if I choose to use them all up, so it&#x27;s still far less expensive than mach 3 cartridges.  </li>
            <li> For the second such blade I just switched it out after the three weeks because three weeks seemed crazy long, but it might have lasted even longer.  </li>
            <li> The price per blade isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s much less expensive than buying the boxes of each blade separately and still less expensive than any of the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each is a five-pack of blades, and they come packed in a heavy Ziploc bag.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how the blades stood up to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 7 of the razors over the past 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if you can&#x27;t use a few of the packs you still have a ton of blades!</li>
            <li> The Bic and Gillette brand were kinda dull</li>
            <li> have tried at least two blades each of eight of the varieties in this set</li>
            <li> I have found one pack where the blade lasts at least three weeks.  </li>
            <li> but it worked for at least two of the blades from that pack</li>
            <li> get this variety pack, try at least two blades in a row from each pack, and keep a log if you can.  </li>
            <li> There are still at least another dozen blades from around the world I will still have to sample.</li>
            <li> The blades now a days are not as thick as when Dad and Grandpa shaved with a double-edge blade, so they wear quicker especially on a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Not a great value.  </li>
            <li> not sharp enough it will give a bad shave and a nasty razor burn.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t cutting me all the time</li>
            <li> No matter how bad they were.</li>
            <li> (That seems insane</li>
            <li> Nacet were horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started shaving &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; and was trying to decide what blades I should use.  This pack is a great way to find the blades that work for your particular face.  I had heard all about the &amp;#34;magical cutting power&amp;#34; of the Feather blades, but at this point think the Gillette Silvers are the best..... for my face.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used 3 of the different types of blades.  The \\&quot;Shark Super Chrome\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Astra Super Platinum\\&quot; were ok and I would give them each four stars.  The \\&quot;Big Ben Super Stainless\\&quot; are only good for 1 shave per blade and I would only give them 1 star.  Hopefully I can come back and edit this as I try the other blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor variety.  Although you may think sharper is better or more expensive is better with razors but that&#x27;s not the case it all depends on your skin type.  While I noticed with the feather and derby brand I got an amazing shave but the blades cute very easily and caused me to break out when I used them daily.  They were perfect for geting rid of a weekend beard but I couldn&#x27;t shave through the week with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shark blades simply were bad for my skin type in every way possible,  that being said they may be perfect for you.  The derby seemed like the best of both worlds I got a good shave and it wasn&#x27;t cutting me all the time and they last for a decent amount of shaves how ever I was still having break outs from daily shaving.  The Bic and Gillette brand were kinda dull but they never cut me and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out with them and they&#x27;re excellent for shaving tour body and genitals because they&#x27;re somewhat dull how ever they do the job much better and faster that traditional razors.  I haven&#x27;t gotten to the other brands yet but more to follow...</li>
            <li> So, I recently received this sample pack and to my dismay there were many blades that I saw as filler blades...some that were throw away blades meant to meet a quota of 50 per pack. The feathers, Nacets, and Astras were great, the sharks were ok, but the Derbys, bics, and 7 o&#x27;clocks were plain disappointing, my face was quickly irritated and cut up from those blades after never having a problem with the first three. Too much money for 15 good blades...way too much.</li>
            <li> Great selection to discover first hand which blades cut closer and which cut smooth, great for first time safety razor users to find which blade works for you</li>
            <li> Nice starter pack of blades, although I must not shave all that often because I really can&#x27;t tell much difference between the brands of blades.</li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving, I will add to the others who recommended this sampler pack to beginners. This is a win/win for those just starting out because you get a great variety. I don&#x27;t know all the different brands of razors, but being a novice, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. You have to start somewhere. I will definitely buy this pack again once my technique improves.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great variety of blades/brands. Superb value! Strongly recommended for those who are getting into shaving with safety razors.</li>
            <li> Product As described. Good way try different blades</li>
            <li> Not a bad sampler pack but a few things to be aware of:    The Shark blades arrive loose, they&#x27;re wrapped but not in a dispenser as per the picture.    The Nacet Platinum are not included, you get two of the Gillette Nacet Stainless.    Some of the cardboard dispensers looks like they suffered some water damage, I haven&#x27;t opened them all so I&#x27;m not sure how the blades stood up to it. Hoping they&#x27;re fine as they&#x27;re stainless, I&#x27;ll update once I get to them in my rotation.    I ordered from FGP.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double-edge razor, which blades to buy can be confusing.  While they all fit all Gillette style double-edged razors; they all shave slightly differently.  There is just enough variance between one make of blade and another that they will shave differently.  Which blade shaves best is a personal thing, and can only be discerned by trial and error.  This is why you want to buy this assortment.  You get twenty of the most popular blades in the world, most in 5-blade boxes, the Lord Super-Chrome is a 10-blade box.  That gives you enough blades to make plenty of side by side comparisons, and find the blade that best matches your razor and technique.  As your technique gets better, you will probably want to make a second pass through the assortment, to see if your taste in blades changes as your technique gets better.  The blades are cheep enough that when you find one you don&#x27;t like, you can toss it, and skip on to the next blade early.  In all, a great way to discover the joys of traditional wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is a must-buy for a new user of a double-edged razor.  The packages came in a zip-top bag that makes storage in my vanity convenient, all of the packaging was in good condition.  I have yet to figure out if this exact sample pack has the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for my face and my razor, but it was a place to start.</li>
            <li> In the midst of trying all these guys, one at a time. Enjoy the variety and ability to try more than one blade of each kind.</li>
            <li> Best and cheap and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great way to try different blades. You&#x27;ll find not only e best blade for your skin but also the extra values like blades that come in a cardboard box vs plastic box, HUGE difference, dispose of your used blades in the back of the plastic box and a safe way to dispose of used blades.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the variety of blades.  A good purchase for somebody starting out with Safety Razors and are unsure of which blade will work best for them.</li>
            <li> Every new to DE shaving needs to get a sampler pack that includes at least (in alpha order), Astra SP, Bic, BlueBird, Feather, Gillette Silver Blue. This sampler contained all of those, based on this sampler pack I have chosen my first 100 pack of blades and purchased it from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this pack for the price. Nice selection, and you really need the 5-blade packs to make somewhat of a judgement on whether or not you like a blade or not. I want to say I got the packs listed in the product image, but there may have been one that was substitued but that was mentioned on item info and no big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Great starter collection of blades for newbies to try out and see which brand is their favorite. So far, while Astra and Derby have been some of my favorite, the surprise favorite are the Bics. Never expected it.</li>
            <li> This was a great overall sample of some of the best known blades on the market and at a good price</li>
            <li> They blades came very fast and just as described!  I will not need to buy another blade for my razor for a long time!</li>
            <li> Tray a sampler to get the feel of different the different blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my husband. Was great to have an assortment to try. He said the Gillette were hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Fun to try all the different blades.  Many to choose from, you are sure to find one that suits you and your razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I picked up this sampler to give myself some blade options in finding out which will work best on my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the exact assortment shown in the picture (Derby, Shark, Bluebird, Feather, Gilette 7 O&#x27;Clock, Gilette Silver Blue, Bic Chrome Platinum, Astra, Nacet Platinum, and Gilette Nacet Stainless).  Each is a five-pack of blades, and they come packed in a heavy Ziploc bag.  I kept the Ziploc bag so the blade boxes aren&#x27;t all scattered through the drawer.  The collection is pricey, but as others have said, you&#x27;re paying for variety.  Once you&#x27;ve figured out which blades you want to go with, those bulk purchases will be a lot cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have a review of any of the individual blades so far, as I&#x27;m still on me first few DE shaves, and am still learning the techniques.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with a merkur 180 that i recently bought as well.  It allowed me to pick try several blades before settling on a brand to buy in bulk (100 pack).  I&#x27;ve tried about 7 of the razors over the past 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some seem to fall into the cheap category like the BIC and the Nacet Stainless.  Others seem to be right up my alley like the gillette silver blue and the bluebird.  This isn&#x27;t a great value for the razors themselves, but what you are paying for is the selection in reasonable sizes.  Maybe by spending a bit extra now, you&#x27;ll realize that the cheapest in the lot suits you jsut fine and you&#x27;ll be saving money the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack is going to last me over a year if I choose to use them all up, so it&#x27;s still far less expensive than mach 3 cartridges.  I think I&#x27;ll be able to get twice the number of the blades I want for about the same price as this sampler.  My recomendation is go for it, figure out what you like, and consider this an investment that will make you happier, and maybe save you money in the future.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I used only Feather blades.  Those were without a doubt the very best blades I&#x27;d ever used.  I&#x27;d buy them in 50- or 100- packs to save money.  But last time I went looking to buy more Feathers I just happened to notice that they are also the most expensive blades.  And some blades out there were way cheaper than the Feathers -- some with good reviews.  I decided maybe I should try a cheaper blade to see if it would do as well and save me some money.  That is why I tried this variety pack.  I&#x27;d never heard of some of these but so what?  As long as they shave well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried at least two blades each of eight of the varieties in this set so I still have two left to try out.  In this pack I found two models that hamburgered my face on the very first shave.  ouch!  But I also found two models that were as good as my Feathers (oddly, I&#x27;d never heard of either -- and they are inexpensive blades -- so choosing this variety pack was a good idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way I have discovered two things:  As others have already said, each face is different and the best blade for you is something you have to find out for yourself (which is the reason I&#x27;m not bothering you with which blades butchered and which ones babied me).  So a variety pack is the best way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I learned and that really applies with a variety pack is that my face needs to adjust to different blades.  That&#x27;s why after trying two kinds I started trying two blades in a row from each pack.  It turns out that sometimes a blade that seemed disappointing with the first shave got better with the second and later shaves, apparently because my face needed to adjust to the different brand first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a log sheet.  I track each shave so I know how long each blade lasts.  I have found one pack where the blade lasts at least three weeks.  (That seems insane but it worked for at least two of the blades from that pack and the shaves were excellent even upto the third week.  For the second such blade I just switched it out after the three weeks because three weeks seemed crazy long, but it might have lasted even longer.  BTW, I only shave every other day or so, but most blades in general seem more affected by time than by # of shaves.  I have to swap the Feathers after 1-2 weeks regardless of the number of shaves.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get this variety pack, try at least two blades in a row from each pack, and keep a log if you can.  You&#x27;ll probably find the perfect blade for your face and it could be less expensive that the blade you&#x27;re using right now.  At this price, when I get through trying each pack, I will finish up the packs I liked, buy the one I liked most in bulk, and save the ones I didn&#x27;t like as emergency spares and not blink an eye if I wind up shelving half the blades in this set.  It&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;m already happy with what I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the blades I&#x27;ve found that I really like came in boxes with disposal slots.  Most of these blades are in little cardboard boxes.  If I wind up going with one of those it the long run, I guess I&#x27;ll also have to buy one of those 100-blade disposal boxes.</li>
            <li> Not a great value.  I didn&#x27;t do my research (my fault) but I found most of them very dull and they pulled quite a bit.  I liked the Astras and feathers, but all the others seemed similar and poor quality.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t gone thru them all yet but its a good way to see the differences</li>
            <li> Very good for narrowing down what razor blade is best for your face if you are new to DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the best were Gillette Silver Blue and Feather. I favor Silver Blue though.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack since I&#x27;m just starting wet shaving. This is a nice sampler for trying to decide what DE blades you would like. I still haven&#x27;t gotten through all of them though.</li>
            <li> Nice price, good variety of blades. Lets you find which blade works best with your face and your razor.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this product to determined which blades he he would like the best. instead of purchasing large quantities of each product. He recommends using GEL shaving soap in a can instead of using shaving soap if you have a sensitive skin to moderate. He listed the blades that the best for him, the sharpest and will give smoothest shave. FOR HIM.  LISTED fro BEST to least favorable. 1-feather  2-gillette silver blue  3-bic chrome platinum  4-gillette 7&#x27;oclock  5-shark  6-blue bird  7-derby extra.  He tried Astra he did not finish shaving with it it was too rough. BOTH Nacet were horrible. he tried to passed on them. He said they really rough, NOT sharp,enough. I f you shave with blades not made with good quality or not sharp enough it will give a bad shave and a nasty razor burn. AGAIN this is what my husband found. He performed shaving tests for several weeks and in different stages of facial hair growth. He tested each blade several times. No matter how bad they were.He also used different shaving soaps, he found the GEL soap the best out of all.</li>
            <li> This sampler seems to have a good variety of different types of blades.  That is essential so that you can figure out which type will meet your own unique needs.  I ended up settling on the Astra Superior Platinum and the Gillette Silver Blue, but this sampler allowed me to make sure they were the best type by trying blades which were sufficiently different.</li>
            <li> Some razors are better then others..  As expected.  I won&#x27;t say which is my favorit as each person really needs to sample their own.  Each face, skin-type, hair-type, soap,.. etc will vary the experience of these blades.  So really.. pick up a sample pack like this and give them a go..  once you found what works and don&#x27;t.. look to buy the good ones in bulk and you&#x27;ll be all set.  I&#x27;ve already found one blade I can get 100 for about $10 and it was smooth and lasted me a full weeks worth of use..  :)</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say that this is really an excellent value in terms of price/razor, since several of the ones included here aren&#x27;t considered top notch, I would consider it an excellent price for a sample pack every DE shaver should start with (if only to find out everyone probably ends up using Feathers anyways...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized I didn&#x27;t get any Blue Birds in my package when I went through and opened all the little packages last night.  Going to have to contact the seller.  Till then, downgrading stars...&lt;br /&gt;______________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Contacted seller and he was prompt to reply, and sent several packages of bluebirds along with the one that was missed with the original package as an apology for missing it.  Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Good selection.  The blades now a days are not as thick as when Dad and Grandpa shaved with a double-edge blade, so they wear quicker especially on a heavy beard.  All are new and no rust seen on any so far when opening packages.  Shipping was great from this company too.</li>
            <li> Most everything you read will tell you to try a sampler pack if you are new to wet shaving like me.  I agree.  This pack seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck considering the variety and the quality brands and lack of near duplicates (50¢ per blade is pricey, but you&#x27;re paying for the variety - go for lowest cost per blade once you find one you like and buy in bulk).  I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and found 2 that I really like and a couple I didn&#x27;t care for much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep in mind that each blade is slightly different, coupled with the vast array of slight variations in angles and exposures provided by all the different razors out there, as well as the fact that our faces/beards are all different, your experience will be based on all these variable (not to mention your individual technique, preparation, shaving cream, etc.!).  So a blade I love may not work well for you at all and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I&#x27;m new to this so I plan to save 1-2 blades per brand and try them again in 4-6 months once I get better at safety razor shaving (and straight razor shaving for that matter, as I&#x27;m alternating between them).  After developing the right technique some of the ones I though were just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; now may perform better when not in the hands of such a novice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the more reason to try a sampler pack.  If not this one then another one out there.  I liked this one personally; although I wish it had included the Gillette 7 o&#x27;Clock (Yellow).  I received the exact blades/brands pictured.</li>
            <li> This was a good learning experience. With 10 choices it wasn&#x27;t long b4 I found a blade that works well for me. There are still at least another dozen blades from around the world I will still have to sample. Bottom line....be a man and do your own hunting. Having a new blade to try all the time made it  fun to shave again.</li>
            <li> I thought undle would be  an excellent opportunity to evaluate different products and find the one best for me. I am in the process right now and it has been fun. One thing I can say is not all blade  are created equal. Some are blades are milimeters longer and of course the edge varies. One tip I can give is buy yourself some Proraso shaving cream and a good brush. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I am learning about each of the different blades, and how my face reacts to them. I like that what I ordered was exactly what I received, and that the variety includes both &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; blades such as the Derby, as well as aggressive and ultra sharp blades such as Feather, as well as a variety of in-between blades like Bic, Gillete, Shark, etc. The value of five of each blade of a variety is it allows people to sample each blade multiple times. As a beginner, I can use each blade several times, and oddly enough take notes. As I have started to become more proficient, I will run through the blades again in a month or two after my technique is better to make sure I like the blade I think I like.</li>
            <li> Great pack. Love the 7&#x27;O Clock and the Astra&#x27;s but the Feather blades that everyone raves about caused claret to be spilt. Still the chance to sample from these 10 packs is a great idea. Happy testing. I&#x27;ve got about 7 other packs to try, which as a newbie to DE shaving I find interesting.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to find out which blade is suitable for you. So far I have tried 4 and I am very pleased with 3 of them so far.  I will eventually use them all</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE razors I highly recommend a sampler pack to get started. Everyone&#x27;s face and hair is different and what works great for one person may be terrible for another. The price per blade isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s much less expensive than buying the boxes of each blade separately and still less expensive than any of the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sampler pack contains a good selection of popular brands. I&#x27;ve noticed that the brands shipped in this sample change occasionally but all of them are great choices. Most of the boxes contain 5 blades, a few contain 10; this is more than enough to try each a few times and find out what you do or don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two pieces of advice to anyone new to wet shaving:&lt;br /&gt;1. Come back to the sampler pack after a few months of shaving and try each blade again. As your technique changes some blades that you didn&#x27;t like before may work better for you this time around.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s ok to dislike something that everyone else loves (or like something everyone else hates). For example, just because most people love feather blades doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li> Great selection of blades. Even if you can&#x27;t use a few of the packs you still have a ton of blades!</li>
