            <li>However, I have been thoroughly impressed with Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shave Cream and Aftershave.  </li>
            <li>The amount of lather you can build up from just a nickel size squirt is incredible.</li>
            <li>great refresher close shave.</li>
            <li>It lathers up great with a badger brush and the scent reminds me of doublemint gum.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, smells good/kind of minty and feels great.  </li>
            <li>The caffeine worked as advertised and my skin felt great afterwards.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, as with all the Pacific Shaving products.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shaving Cream is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>Pleasant tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Its a great alternative and even better for travel!</li>
            <li>He thought this would be good for traveling.</li>
            <li>Product smells good too.  </li>
            <li>Protects skin quite nicely and leaves a great finish.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very refreshing tingling feeling after you shave.</li>
            <li>At first, this looked like a gimmick - but it turned out to be one of the best savings creams I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great smooth shave with this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Tried once and liked it.  </li>
            <li>was offered this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Awesome...I started using shave cream from another company and liked it so thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li>Shaved with it this morning, and liked it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>BUT - THRILLED to learn I could purchase them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>All natural, great feel, great shave, smells nice but not &#x27;smelly&#x27; on the face.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much I decided to get him more for Christmas!!</li>
            <li>This is much better than the Lab Series I&#x27;ve been using, it gives more a lot more viscosity with a cooling mint sensation, plus I&#x27;ve read that caffeine is really good for your skin</li>
            <li>The shave was the best even with my 2 day old beard.  </li>
            <li>great stuff, its worth ordering</li>
            <li>I loved the products from the first time I used them!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I would prefer if it came in a larger size, but otherwise our experience with this shaving cream has been excellent!</li>
            <li>Hope to use it more often.</li>
            <li>Love Pacific Shaving Company products ...</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tried Kheils and Demologica, but loves this stuff even more.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>In all honesty I really like it and the caffeine element was a great conversation starter.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product except the fragrance.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It lathered up very quickly, and I had to add more water than I am used to.</li>
            <li>While this created a good lather and a good shave, the scent smelled very much like moldy oranges which was very disagreeable.</li>
            <li>Unique (and nice) scent, smooth shave, and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about the coffeine part but this shaving cream is smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells too much like my toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Simply fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells minty clean</li>
            <li>I got this at a discounted rate but regardless of the price, it is super cool and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly feel it gives him, the close shave, and the soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It is slick to allow the blade to travel smoothly and the scent on this option is great.</li>
            <li>Great shave, slight peppermint scent, travel size</li>
            <li>Worked as good or better as any creams or gels I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, seems like a lot is left in the bottle even as it starts to come out difficultly near the end.</li>
            <li>With Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shave Cream I get a closer and more comfortable shave than I have ever gotten with any other product.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of this product</li>
            <li>unsure how many shaves this will last my partner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Much better than the regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Washes off with minimal residue and a nice post shave tingle.</li>
            <li>brand is not only great for travel and easy packing, but the texture is thick (not runny) and applies evenly and sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li>We live in SF too, so glad to know you&#x27;re a local company.</li>
            <li>Great shave, low mess.</li>
            <li>but I might have had too much liquid in my brush.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I noticed much of an effect from the caffeine, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the smell and feel of this.</li>
            <li>It really helped with shaving irritation.</li>
            <li>I also received really fast shipping on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the face I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much a difference from the Target off-brand oatmeal shaving cream I buy, but for some reason, the use on the head was a revelation.  </li>
            <li>Not As Advertised, was definitely more watery than expected.</li>
            <li>Does not protect very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks PSC.</li>
            <li>Now I can shave on a daily basis and still have comfortable skin.</li>
            <li>He really like it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much at one time</li>
            <li>I was really bummed when I was getting to the end of the tube -</li>
            <li>Bottle is smaller, a larger size may have been nice;</li>
            <li>Most smaller tube size creams are not this high level of quality, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The cream is neither too thick or thin, a perfect consistency, making blade rinsing easy.</li>
            <li>The overall quality of my shave has definitely improved, and I really enjoy how fresh my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>Using this cream and the aftershave lotion of the same family, my skin feels soft, smooth and refreshed every time.</li>
            <li>By the way, my wife is highly sensitive to smells and therefore doesn&#x27;t ever want me to wear aftershave or cologne, but even she really likes the scent of the aftershave...</li>
            <li>Like the product overall and especially that it has fairly safe and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>There was more than enough lather left over from the first pass to do a second pass and touch</li>
            <li>My only minor quibble is that it has a minty smell, which isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>A bigger tube would be useful.  </li>
            <li>My brother-in-law and sister-in-law (who live in San Francisco)</li>
            <li>Smells good and goes on fluidly with a little water...smooth shave and a definite notice in reduced bumps.</li>
            <li>My husband says he likes it better than his usual shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a person who responds to product surveys.  </li>
            <li>What is also nice is that the cream is not as thick as the regular stuff, making it much easier to spread on my face with a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>Some people with hyper sensitive skin may not</li>
            <li>I think my blades are lasting longer as well for an added bonus, my shave is definitely much closer leaving my skin smoother and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>While I will finish this cream in time, I will probably try and find a cream that does not make my brush smell like old orange peels.</li>
            <li>Absolutely everything I expected from what I&#x27;ve read online about these products.</li>
            <li>I feel that since I save money by using de razors vs. the expensive disposable blades that I can use the savings towards nice shaving cream and related shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very thick and smooth without having to use a lot of the cream.</li>

            <li> Definitely competes with other artisan shaving creams.</li>

            <li> Tried once and liked it.  A little watery for safety razor shaving but I might have had too much liquid in my brush.  Can&#x27;t say I noticed much of an effect from the caffeine, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it makes a difference in my skin.  Like the product overall and especially that it has fairly safe and natural ingredients.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> great refresher close shave.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the smell and feel of this. I just wish it were a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very refreshing tingling feeling after you shave. I love it. Some people with hyper sensitive skin may not</li>
            <li> This is much better than the Lab Series I&#x27;ve been using, it gives more a lot more viscosity with a cooling mint sensation, plus I&#x27;ve read that caffeine is really good for your skin and I can use all the help I can get.  I think my blades are lasting longer as well for an added bonus, my shave is definitely much closer leaving my skin smoother and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shave with this shaving cream. It really helped with shaving irritation. Worked as good or better as any creams or gels I&#x27;ve used in the past. I also received really fast shipping on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> great product! I would buy it again..</li>
            <li> One of the few shaving creams I&#x27;ve used that rinses off completey when I&#x27;m finished.  It lathers up great with a badger brush and the scent reminds me of doublemint gum.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this shaving cream. Just takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shaving cream to my husband and he likes it!  It smells minty clean and I like that it is vegan and not tested on animals.  My husband says he likes it better than his usual shaving cream.  I would prefer if it came in a larger size, but otherwise our experience with this shaving cream has been excellent!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this product and I must say I&#x27;m impressed.  I shave both my face and head (face three times a week, head once.)  On the face I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much a difference from the Target off-brand oatmeal shaving cream I buy, but for some reason, the use on the head was a revelation.  No bumps, nicks, scrapes or burns.  Smoothest head shave ever.  The reviews and magazine write-ups about this product nailed it.  Hope to use it more often.</li>
            <li> At first, this looked like a gimmick - but it turned out to be one of the best savings creams I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> Has a spearmint scent, and quality ingredients without questionable chemicals.  Appeared thick.  Bottle is smaller, a larger size may have been nice; unsure how many shaves this will last my partner.  If you don&#x27;t like spearmint, you will not like this product, otherwise the mint is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and the scent!</li>
            <li> Not As Advertised, was definitely more watery than expected. No better than lesser priced natural products. Does not protect very well. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love Pacific Shaving Company products ... it goes a long way for a 3oz bottle</li>
            <li> I got this at a discounted rate but regardless of the price, it is super cool and invigorating. Definitely competes with other artisan shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly making it very difficult to shave. I have to add shave soap to keep the lather consistency on my skin.</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit thinner (liquid) than past purchases of same.  Probably just a fluke. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I like it. It has a tingling effect. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to lather face and neck. I have purchased a second bottle now, so I like it</li>
            <li> Awesome...I started using shave cream from another company and liked it so thought I would try this.  This stuff is great, smells good/kind of minty and feels great.  The shave was the best even with my 2 day old beard.  Thanks PSC.</li>
            <li> Caffeinated Shaving Cream refreshes with its sent and smoothes my skin. The cream is neither too thick or thin, a perfect consistency, making blade rinsing easy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have become sort of a shaving cream snob now that I have researched and tried different products and left the days of cheap aerosol cans behind. I feel that since I save money by using de razors vs. the expensive disposable blades that I can use the savings towards nice shaving cream and related shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is not only great for travel and easy packing, but the texture is thick (not runny) and applies evenly and sticks to your skin. It is slick to allow the blade to travel smoothly and the scent on this option is great. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth. Most smaller tube size creams are not this high level of quality, I am pleasantly surprised. Its a great alternative and even better for travel!</li>
            <li> Great shave, low mess.</li>
            <li> While I traditionally use soaps I decided to give this a go for travel purposes. This cream takes up a lot less room in my travel bag and is TSA approved which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;As I was travelling I face lathered with an omega boar as I didn&#x27;t want to bring along a lather bowl. It lathered up very quickly, and I had to add more water than I am used to. There was more than enough lather left over from the first pass to do a second pass and touch up.&lt;br /&gt;The lather was a little thicker than what I am accustomed to, but it did not clog my safety razor. The caffeine worked as advertised and my skin felt great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it three stars is because of the smell. It is not a distraction while shaving, but the way my brush smelled afterwards was not good at all. While I will finish this cream in time, I will probably try and find a cream that does not make my brush smell like old orange peels.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, seems like a lot is left in the bottle even as it starts to come out difficultly near the end.</li>
            <li> For those grizzly men out there, buy this!! It opens up the pores on your face and makes shaving so much less of a pain!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.  Bought it as a treat for my boyfriend (who shaves his head).  He&#x27;s tried Kheils and Demologica, but loves this stuff even more.  No nicks, no scrapes, great suds.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Shaved with it this morning, and liked it. Unique (and nice) scent, smooth shave, and left my skin hydrated afterward. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!  All natural, great feel, great shave, smells nice but not &#x27;smelly&#x27; on the face.</li>
            <li> Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shaving Cream is truly amazing! I shave my head and face every other day and have always suffered from shaving rash and dry skin, until I discovered this product. Now I can shave on a daily basis and still have comfortable skin. Using this cream and the aftershave lotion of the same family, my skin feels soft, smooth and refreshed every time.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He really like it. He said it gave him a cleaner shave, and made his skin feel tingly. It smells nice too. We live in SF too, so glad to know you&#x27;re a local company.</li>
            <li> I usually get a lot of razor burn, but after using the shave cream and after shave yesterday, no irritation yet.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great shave, slight peppermint scent, travel size</li>
            <li> Creates a great lather with my brush. Very thick and smooth without having to use a lot of the cream. After rinsing, it leaves a slight tingling sensation on your face like aftershave. Maybe that&#x27;s the caffeine feature. It works great! My only minor quibble is that it has a minty smell, which isn&#x27;t my favorite. Kind of smells too much like my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My son loves your product.</li>
            <li> Won this in a random contest I signed up for (surprise!!) and gave it to my husband. He usually uses the foamy spray from a can stuff from the discount store. He thought this would be good for traveling. He loves it! Love the tingly feel it gives him, the close shave, and the soft smooth skin. He also likes that it is not highly scented. He loved it so much I decided to get him more for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells good and goes on fluidly with a little water...smooth shave and a definite notice in reduced bumps. Wake that ass up and get your day goin!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is awesome.  No razor burn since I started using it (that used to be a big problem for me).  Product smells good too.  I use it in combination with the Pacific Shave Oil and the Face Lotion.</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic product.  Protects skin quite nicely and leaves a great finish.</li>
            <li> While this created a good lather and a good shave, the scent smelled very much like moldy oranges which was very disagreeable.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, as with all the Pacific Shaving products.  A bigger tube would be useful.  As with Pacific&#x27;s other shaving creams, the tube here is not friendly - hard to get the last third of the stuff out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves your face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Gives an excellent shave without redness.</li>
            <li> Much better than the regular shaving cream. As advertised, much less redness when shaving. What is also nice is that the cream is not as thick as the regular stuff, making it much easier to spread on my face with a badger hair brush. I&#x27;ve been using Pacific Shaving for years now, will stay with them for a long time to come...</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Pleasant tingling sensation. Provides plenty of lubrication for a close shave. Secondary benefit of the caffeine is minimize bleeding from any nicks, and reduces redness (though this may be a combination of the caffeine and its lubricating ability). Washes off with minimal residue and a nice post shave tingle. Doesn&#x27;t interfere with post shave sunblock/aftershave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the caffeine part, but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed w/the thickness and the body-weight of the foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a person who responds to product surveys.  However, I have been thoroughly impressed with Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shave Cream and Aftershave.  My brother-in-law and sister-in-law (who live in San Francisco) gave them to me for Christmas 2014.  I loved the products from the first time I used them!  You don&#x27;t use much at one time so they lasted for a quite awhile. I was really bummed when I was getting to the end of the tube - BUT - THRILLED to learn I could purchase them on Amazon. With Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated Shave Cream I get a closer and more comfortable shave than I have ever gotten with any other product. I intend to be a long term consumer of PSC&#x27;s Caffeinated Shave Cream and Aftershave!  By the way, my wife is highly sensitive to smells and therefore doesn&#x27;t ever want me to wear aftershave or cologne, but even she really likes the scent of the aftershave...an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the coffeine part but this shaving cream is smooth and refreshing. In all honesty I really like it and the caffeine element was a great conversation starter.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product except the fragrance. The amount of lather you can build up from just a nickel size squirt is incredible. The overall quality of my shave has definitely improved, and I really enjoy how fresh my face feels afterwards. Unfortunately, the fragrance is unappealing and overpowering.</li>
            <li> great stuff, its worth ordering</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything I expected from what I&#x27;ve read online about these products.</li>
