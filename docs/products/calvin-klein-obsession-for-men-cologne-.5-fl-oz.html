            <li> There is something about Obsession for Men &amp; even the woman&#x27;s version that is so far removed from any other Scent.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> The product was as described and I received it earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to flowery scented for a male.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become obsessed with myself more so than usual with this product!</li>
            <li> It is stupid that I have to use so many words to describe.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my travel bad after NSA has thrown my baggage around so much that the larger bottle had opened and spilled all over my clothes the previous trip.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I expected it to be small</li>
            <li> Since I travel, the little travel bottle works, throw it with my toilet articles, never leave it behind.</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad a small bottle just heads up</li>
            <li> Have used Obsession for some years like it and wanted a small bottle for travel.</li>
            <li> but that is realllllllllly small</li>
            <li> so i went small.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this small Obsession Travel size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But a moment later it smelled weird and cheap and terrible.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly turn around from my reflection when this smell is added to my persona.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This is a very small bottle .5 fl.</li>
            <li> except i hate theses rating surveys</li>

            <li> This has been my scent for about 20 years. This size bottle makes it perfect to take in your carry on during airline travel. Any larger bottle and you risk confiscation by TSA for being over the 3 oz rule.</li>
