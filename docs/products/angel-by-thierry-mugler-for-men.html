            <li>I own many colognes and Thierry Mugler scents are some of the best.</li>
            <li>amazing smell and great price</li>
            <li>Smells delicious spraying it out of the bottle, but once it&#x27;s on the skin it turns into this warm, sexy scent that I just want to wrap myself in.</li>
            <li>this coffee smell is really good.</li>
            <li>good scent,</li>
            <li>This is a Cologne that both my husband and I have used for years and found the price was good.  </li>
            <li>Incredible scent fell completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li>and the price is good me and his daddy</li>
            <li>The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good.</li>
            <li>i had to take my shirt off because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li>it is INCREDIBLY good smelling.</li>
            <li>This smells sooooo good, I purchased the womens fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite smells.</li>
            <li>Always get great deals on this product and my hubby gets so many compliments when he wears it.</li>
            <li>They are top quality with great projection and longevity.  </li>
            <li>This was for a gift, and really liked the aroma is very good, strong but good, the maxima of the stars at the perfume is original, I recommend it to all enterprising men, what I liked most is to have it  :D</li>
            <li>Its ok!</li>
            <li>So I recommend buying this for sure!</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet coffee/chocolate scent, and makes you smell absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>This cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li>this fragrance is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>but then so are most of the good ones.</li>
            <li>My box was all nice and sealed, and the registration code was there</li>
            <li>I thought I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because they were honest about it&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li>This is a hazardous liquid and cannot be returned.  </li>
            <li>Rubber bottle can get kind of smudgy and its not the cleanest look.</li>
            <li>, it makes for a nice grip so the bottle won&#x27;t slip from my hand.</li>
            <li>I cannot see why anyone on the fragrance forums would think otherwise- can&#x27;t imagine anything more sexy than getting a whiff of knee-trembling caramel, coffee, and vanilla spiced up in an intoxicating and remarkable juice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would feel comfortable wearing A*Men any season and for any event, but I suppose the experts say that fall or winter are most appropriate time with evening wear as ideal.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast (3 days), the price is really good and the perfume smells great.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that not a lot of people wear it, so you tend to stick out in a crowd a bit more when you wear it out.</li>
            <li>angel men cologne is by far one of the best colognes i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.</li>
            <li>this website is so awesome, my husband love this new Thierry Mugler Angel Men.</li>
            <li>Lovely and unique eau de toilette !!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000JLAWIA A Men]] is not a typical \\&quot;club\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; cologne, best worn in one-on-one encounters or worn very lightly in office settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now own seven (7) or more of his fragrances and love them all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many colognes and own 1 Million- one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery, one of my all time fave colognes!</li>
            <li>But as with all things, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>this is the authentic scent</li>
            <li>Then I saw that the top shiny part of the box was glued on and peeling</li>
            <li>The product appeared to be retail packaged and shrink wrapped however upon opening it looks like somebody opened it and cut out the registration code under the top of the box and then re-sealed it.</li>
            <li>More for winter cooler weather</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal for colder weather.</li>
            <li>The scent of coffee is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The cologne itself seems to smell authentic, but who knows?</li>
            <li>I love it and use it.  </li>
            <li>This scent is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the Angel for my man :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could be merely a moderately convincing</li>
            <li>Authentic product.</li>
            <li>Love the compliments.</li>
            <li>my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>nothing ever gets more compliments.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I ordered this product, and when I got it, the serial number was scratched off the bottom, BUT the product did smell as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Lovely citrus notes with earthy undertones.....</li>
            <li>changes as he wears it, especially love it the next morning!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is one of his favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>sure you listen constructively...!!ourself</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you shake it before pressing to spray it comes out better.</li>
            <li>I just love Amazon</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Great perfume original although it was worth a fortune</li>
            <li>has a very unique blend of flavors that 2/3 sprays keeps around all day.</li>
            <li>The perfect mix of yin &amp; yang with the sweet caramel, vanilla &amp; chocolate blending with the masculine tar and musk.</li>
            <li>Strong sweet and amazing.</li>
            <li>Really great classy fragrance for men.</li>
            <li>good fragrance and very long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Inside the top box cover it says \\&quot;This code is unique.</li>
            <li>just like the YouTube reviewers said about that strong tarry opening.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with nearly all of my Amazon purchases, but this particular example has kept me guessing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve worn it more, it&#x27;s just got an incredible caramel sort of smell and sugary aroma with toffee and maybe a little bit of coffee or something.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan.  </li>
            <li>Cheap ripoff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a genuine bottle / packaging.</li>
            <li>importantly my man just loves it.</li>
            <li>an godly aroma filled my nose</li>
            <li>The perfume i smell great lasts more than 12 hours, no problem, deputy, careful about application</li>
            <li>I received an old perfume and smells not so good.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this cologne is that it last on your skin, clothes for over 24 hours, over time the smell changes and is just a very pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A pretty good scent, but it really does smell borderline like perfume -- I think a woman could easily wear this.</li>
            <li>A pretty strong patchouli sweetness on top,</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery, and you cannot find a better price for this cologna.</li>
            <li>Thierry Mugler is fast becoming my favorite cologne designer...</li>
            <li>The magic is that it gives me some power for new achievements, inspiring me.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy wearing Angel for special occasions.</li>
            <li>When I received the box via UPS yesterday on 2/1/2012, the cologne arrived wrapped in the box; however, the cologne had been opened and the unique code within the box had been removed.</li>
            <li>However I noticed that the unique code inside the box has been cut off.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was worth it!</li>
            <li>It is truly unique.  </li>
            <li>The bottle designs are unique and &amp;quot;the jury is still out&amp;quot; on whether I like them.  </li>
            <li>The unique product code on the inside of the box has been removed.</li>
            <li>hot (Hot meaning strong and can be overwhelming) with notes of tar, leather, pepper, and chocolate and then settles to a sweeter musk scent that is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>For really special occasions.</li>
            <li>sweet goodness...</li>
            <li>This is the most unusual fragrance I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try, you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t the the top note is as \\&quot;EW\\&quot; as so many others do, but I could see why some would be turned off by</li>
            <li>so be easy on the trigger unless you really want to be noticed.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this cologne on me, and is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li>i think the variants, namely pure havane and pure malt are better.</li>
            <li>and I will admit - coming out of the bottle, most Mugler&#x27;s fragrance are not so appealing - it is the dry down that becomes pleasant.  </li>
            <li>great scent, but it fades after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>When I sprayed the fragrance and tested it against my old bottle, which was purchased from a brick and mortar store, the smell of the amazon product was more of rubbing alcohol with a hint of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Thierry Mugler by far makes my favorite winter colognes.  </li>
            <li>It has great longevity (10 hrs easy), so if you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again since for the price I consider there are many other better options</li>
            <li>Words can not express How sexy and manly you feel with this fragance, there are some that say it smells like the female version, if so, it really feels awesome specially because it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very good and long lasting. .</li>
            <li>very nice perfume long lasting and recommend for purchase for those who love intense fragrances.buy again from amazon,highly recommended.great.love it</li>
            <li>Customer service has made it right yet again.</li>
            <li>And then, faking the rubber flask, and attempting to put cologne or any liquid inside the flask also seems like it would be cumbersome, right?</li>
            <li>sweet, after the intense patchouli start.</li>
            <li>However I called amazon, and they are sending me a new one, free of charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this was just a bad shipment they got at one of their warehouses, and they seem to be doing their best to take care of this QC issue.</li>
            <li>It is dark, warm, but not overly sweet.  </li>
            <li>at first i was a little worried that it wouldnt smell good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Must-buy cologne, but maybe not a blind buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a prime member and this is the first time I&#x27;ve received an item that was not as advertised.  </li>
            <li>As many others have stated on other colognes that they bought, the box was already opened, and the unique code inside was taken out.</li>
            <li>Its better to spend extra $10-$20</li>
            <li>The cologne is a great long lasting man&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The thing is, most people don&#x27;t expect such a scent in a cologne.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas</li>
            <li>I have over 50 colognes and this is in my top ten.</li>
            <li>There is no way to verify that this is not a fake...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my third bottle and never bought it at a better price.</li>
            <li>so many possibilities....seems a bit much for a simple purchase, but this is type of mindf**k one engages in when packages arrive in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really different and very special for me.</li>
            <li>A-Men is a nice dark fragrance.</li>
            <li>The first few times I kind of thought it smelled nondescript and just...</li>
            <li>I do like Pure Havane a lot though,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see the &amp;quot;rubber bottles&amp;quot; and would expect something more fitting -I have the small bottle of A*Men that is clear</li>
            <li>and if you enjoy the fragrance, do not hesitate to spend the extra $20 because you will be guaranteed a freshly packed and brand new cologne.</li>
            <li>The cologne itself appears to be fine, but I&#x27;m still uncertain as to its authenticity, considering someone obviously went out of their way to cut out the code on the box.</li>
            <li>A little old, but still smells good</li>
            <li>I blind bought it and loved it more than I thought I would -- just be sure to wear it a few times before passing judgment on it.</li>
            <li>The code was removed and the bottle was very scratched and marred.</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Reminiscent of LIGHTLY scented patchouli.</li>
            <li>Real man scent.</li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping from the company that I bought it from.</li>
            <li>Found a sample of this scent in a magazine &amp; had to have the real thing.</li>
            <li>Mugler makes unusual fragrances.  </li>
            <li>thanks a lot</li>
            <li>This is a sophisticated candy blend that is not only ostensibly masculine, but may make you and others want to devour any exposed flesh that you spray it on.</li>
            <li>- I love clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/value is a slight deduction - but I am willing to pay more for longer lasting fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Like many other customers, I received a bottle in suspect packaging.  </li>
            <li>Not really bad, it&#x27;s just a different and unique winter/night/clubbing sweet scent which you should try at least once to see if you like it, IMO this is not the best choice for a blind buy, so I suggest you try it on your skin before you buy it ..</li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging are first class and Mugler offers that &amp;quot;above and beyond&amp;quot; customer service with registering your fragrance.  </li>
            <li>well sure enough the UNIQUE code was missing.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, perfume was new just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>There is no problem lasting eight (8) hours on the skin and until the next day on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got many compliments from total female strangers.</li>
            <li>But if you do, I would highly reccommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is ripe for a high &amp;quot;Wow Factor&amp;quot; as I routinely get compliments on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not very certain about any or all of these things, but I am hoping it is the genuine article.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, pay a little more and but from elsewhere.</li>
            <li>scent itself appears genuine, but without the real thing to compare, it&#x27;s difficult to be completely sure.  </li>
            <li>and when I opened the top of the box I saw the authentication code was missing</li>
            <li>Pretty good scent, but as others said, be wary.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne but it does not last long after you put it on.</li>
            <li>my new smell.</li>
            <li>The top note is still a massive amount of patchouli with a whole bunch of I-don&#x27;t-know-what, but it settles down after 30min-1hr.</li>
            <li>Nothing prepared me for the absolute deliciousness of A*men, which is like no other scent on the market.</li>
            <li>Wow; I was surprised by the big box from Frangrancenet, and when I opened it, very happy to find a gift pack in a black Angel Men toiletry bag with the 3.4 Oz EDT, plus a small deoderant stick and shower gel.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Subsequently, I was denied a refund on the first item...happy with the second item...</li>
            <li>I have about 4 bottles of this, 4 of Pure Havane, 2 of Pure Malt, and 1 of every other Thierry Mugler cologne.  </li>
            <li>Registration code was clear and I registered at the website.</li>
            <li>Real amen can almost be smelt a day later</li>
            <li>After wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve decided I actually... love this cologne.</li>
            <li>All are similar to the next, but each offers a different spin that becomes a unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Box came in tight and clean.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and leaves a very recognizable trail</li>
            <li>do a quick dry and spray cologne on then hop back in the shower briefly.</li>
            <li>Also never use this in the summer, way too sweet and strong for hot weather but when it comes to cold weather not much can beat it.</li>
            <li>Go get some Calvin somethin or other..;)</li>
            <li>The silage with this cologne is reasonably heavy but not SUPER heavy with two sprays to the neck, and this has a great longevity.</li>
            <li>when customer service (what a poor description) intervened, the suggested fix was for me to order an item shown here with only different black packaging and await my refund from my perfectly packaged previously ordered item but with some new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i mention it barely lasts an hour?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also never had a problem ordering perfume or cologne directly from Amazon (no 3rd party vendors).  </li>
            <li>Alas, so many questions...and</li>
            <li>I most seriously would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>The code that usually is on the original box was not present on this box ( it was scratched! )</li>
            <li>at least you know you are buying the original product.</li>
            <li>I received the product recently and all I can say is that it&#x27;s a unique fragrance not every man can wear,despite the fact I received an old bottle that has been stored in a confined place,it doesn&#x27;t last long as the one I previously bought from a local macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Perhaps these were old, discounted or grey market items?  </li>
            <li>Pretty heavy silage for about 9 hours,</li>
            <li>and then it slowly morphs into a sweet, gourmond fragrance.</li>
            <li>and then there&#x27;s a subtle, sweet caramel and cocoa smell that lingers for a handful of hours after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not stated in the description this was anything other than a new sealed product.</li>

            <li> amazing smell and great price</li>
            <li> Smells delicious spraying it out of the bottle, but once it&#x27;s on the skin it turns into this warm, sexy scent that I just want to wrap myself in.</li>
            <li> this coffee smell is really good.</li>
            <li> good scent,</li>
            <li> This is a Cologne that both my husband and I have used for years and found the price was good.  </li>
            <li> Incredible scent fell completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li> and the price is good me and his daddy</li>
            <li> The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good.</li>
            <li> i had to take my shirt off because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> it is INCREDIBLY good smelling.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good, I purchased the womens fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite smells.</li>

            <li> They are top quality with great projection and longevity.  </li>
            <li> This was for a gift, and really liked the aroma is very good, strong but good, the maxima of the stars at the perfume is original, I recommend it to all enterprising men, what I liked most is to have it  :D</li>
            <li> Its ok!</li>
            <li> So I recommend buying this for sure!</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet coffee/chocolate scent, and makes you smell absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li> this fragrance is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> but then so are most of the good ones.</li>
            <li> My box was all nice and sealed, and the registration code was there</li>
            <li> I thought I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because they were honest about it&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> This is a hazardous liquid and cannot be returned.  </li>
            <li> Rubber bottle can get kind of smudgy and its not the cleanest look.</li>
            <li> , it makes for a nice grip so the bottle won&#x27;t slip from my hand.</li>
            <li> I cannot see why anyone on the fragrance forums would think otherwise- can&#x27;t imagine anything more sexy than getting a whiff of knee-trembling caramel, coffee, and vanilla spiced up in an intoxicating and remarkable juice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would feel comfortable wearing A*Men any season and for any event, but I suppose the experts say that fall or winter are most appropriate time with evening wear as ideal.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast (3 days), the price is really good and the perfume smells great.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that not a lot of people wear it, so you tend to stick out in a crowd a bit more when you wear it out.</li>
            <li> angel men cologne is by far one of the best colognes i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.</li>
            <li> this website is so awesome, my husband love this new Thierry Mugler Angel Men.</li>
            <li> Lovely and unique eau de toilette !!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000JLAWIA A Men]] is not a typical \\&quot;club\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; cologne, best worn in one-on-one encounters or worn very lightly in office settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now own seven (7) or more of his fragrances and love them all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many colognes and own 1 Million- one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery, one of my all time fave colognes!</li>
            <li> But as with all things, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> this is the authentic scent</li>
            <li> Then I saw that the top shiny part of the box was glued on and peeling</li>
            <li> The product appeared to be retail packaged and shrink wrapped however upon opening it looks like somebody opened it and cut out the registration code under the top of the box and then re-sealed it.</li>
            <li> More for winter cooler weather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s phenomenal for colder weather.</li>
            <li> The scent of coffee is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The cologne itself seems to smell authentic, but who knows?</li>
            <li> I love it and use it.  </li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the Angel for my man :)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could be merely a moderately convincing</li>
            <li> Authentic product.</li>
            <li> Love the compliments.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> nothing ever gets more compliments.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I ordered this product, and when I got it, the serial number was scratched off the bottom, BUT the product did smell as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Lovely citrus notes with earthy undertones.....</li>
            <li> changes as he wears it, especially love it the next morning!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> It is one of his favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> sure you listen constructively...!!ourself</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If you shake it before pressing to spray it comes out better.</li>
            <li> I just love Amazon</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great perfume original although it was worth a fortune</li>
            <li> has a very unique blend of flavors that 2/3 sprays keeps around all day.</li>
            <li> The perfect mix of yin &amp; yang with the sweet caramel, vanilla &amp; chocolate blending with the masculine tar and musk.</li>
            <li> Strong sweet and amazing.</li>
            <li> Really great classy fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> good fragrance and very long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Inside the top box cover it says \\&quot;This code is unique.</li>
            <li> just like the YouTube reviewers said about that strong tarry opening.  </li>
            <li> I have been very happy with nearly all of my Amazon purchases, but this particular example has kept me guessing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve worn it more, it&#x27;s just got an incredible caramel sort of smell and sugary aroma with toffee and maybe a little bit of coffee or something.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> Cheap ripoff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a genuine bottle / packaging.</li>
            <li> importantly my man just loves it.</li>
            <li> an godly aroma filled my nose</li>
            <li> The perfume i smell great lasts more than 12 hours, no problem, deputy, careful about application</li>
            <li> I received an old perfume and smells not so good.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this cologne is that it last on your skin, clothes for over 24 hours, over time the smell changes and is just a very pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A pretty good scent, but it really does smell borderline like perfume -- I think a woman could easily wear this.</li>
            <li> A pretty strong patchouli sweetness on top,</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery, and you cannot find a better price for this cologna.</li>
            <li> Thierry Mugler is fast becoming my favorite cologne designer...</li>
            <li> The magic is that it gives me some power for new achievements, inspiring me.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy wearing Angel for special occasions.</li>
            <li> When I received the box via UPS yesterday on 2/1/2012, the cologne arrived wrapped in the box; however, the cologne had been opened and the unique code within the box had been removed.</li>
            <li> However I noticed that the unique code inside the box has been cut off.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was worth it!</li>
            <li> It is truly unique.  </li>
            <li> The bottle designs are unique and &amp;quot;the jury is still out&amp;quot; on whether I like them.  </li>
            <li> The unique product code on the inside of the box has been removed.</li>
            <li> hot (Hot meaning strong and can be overwhelming) with notes of tar, leather, pepper, and chocolate and then settles to a sweeter musk scent that is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> For really special occasions.</li>
            <li> sweet goodness...</li>
            <li> This is the most unusual fragrance I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a try, you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t the the top note is as \\&quot;EW\\&quot; as so many others do, but I could see why some would be turned off by</li>
            <li> so be easy on the trigger unless you really want to be noticed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne on me, and is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> i think the variants, namely pure havane and pure malt are better.</li>
            <li> and I will admit - coming out of the bottle, most Mugler&#x27;s fragrance are not so appealing - it is the dry down that becomes pleasant.  </li>
            <li> great scent, but it fades after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> When I sprayed the fragrance and tested it against my old bottle, which was purchased from a brick and mortar store, the smell of the amazon product was more of rubbing alcohol with a hint of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Thierry Mugler by far makes my favorite winter colognes.  </li>
            <li> It has great longevity (10 hrs easy), so if you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy it again since for the price I consider there are many other better options</li>
            <li> Words can not express How sexy and manly you feel with this fragance, there are some that say it smells like the female version, if so, it really feels awesome specially because it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very good and long lasting. .</li>
            <li> very nice perfume long lasting and recommend for purchase for those who love intense fragrances.buy again from amazon,highly recommended.great.love it</li>
            <li> Customer service has made it right yet again.</li>
            <li> And then, faking the rubber flask, and attempting to put cologne or any liquid inside the flask also seems like it would be cumbersome, right?</li>
            <li> sweet, after the intense patchouli start.</li>
            <li> However I called amazon, and they are sending me a new one, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this was just a bad shipment they got at one of their warehouses, and they seem to be doing their best to take care of this QC issue.</li>
            <li> It is dark, warm, but not overly sweet.  </li>
            <li> at first i was a little worried that it wouldnt smell good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Must-buy cologne, but maybe not a blind buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a prime member and this is the first time I&#x27;ve received an item that was not as advertised.  </li>
            <li> As many others have stated on other colognes that they bought, the box was already opened, and the unique code inside was taken out.</li>
            <li> Its better to spend extra $10-$20</li>
            <li> The cologne is a great long lasting man&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The thing is, most people don&#x27;t expect such a scent in a cologne.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas</li>
            <li> I have over 50 colognes and this is in my top ten.</li>
            <li> There is no way to verify that this is not a fake...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my third bottle and never bought it at a better price.</li>
            <li> so many possibilities....seems a bit much for a simple purchase, but this is type of mindf**k one engages in when packages arrive in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really different and very special for me.</li>
            <li> A-Men is a nice dark fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first few times I kind of thought it smelled nondescript and just...</li>
            <li> I do like Pure Havane a lot though,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see the &amp;quot;rubber bottles&amp;quot; and would expect something more fitting -I have the small bottle of A*Men that is clear</li>
            <li> and if you enjoy the fragrance, do not hesitate to spend the extra $20 because you will be guaranteed a freshly packed and brand new cologne.</li>
            <li> The cologne itself appears to be fine, but I&#x27;m still uncertain as to its authenticity, considering someone obviously went out of their way to cut out the code on the box.</li>
            <li> A little old, but still smells good</li>
            <li> I blind bought it and loved it more than I thought I would -- just be sure to wear it a few times before passing judgment on it.</li>
            <li> The code was removed and the bottle was very scratched and marred.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Reminiscent of LIGHTLY scented patchouli.</li>
            <li> Real man scent.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping from the company that I bought it from.</li>
            <li> Found a sample of this scent in a magazine &amp; had to have the real thing.</li>
            <li> Mugler makes unusual fragrances.  </li>
            <li> thanks a lot</li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated candy blend that is not only ostensibly masculine, but may make you and others want to devour any exposed flesh that you spray it on.</li>
            <li> - I love clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/value is a slight deduction - but I am willing to pay more for longer lasting fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Like many other customers, I received a bottle in suspect packaging.  </li>
            <li> Not really bad, it&#x27;s just a different and unique winter/night/clubbing sweet scent which you should try at least once to see if you like it, IMO this is not the best choice for a blind buy, so I suggest you try it on your skin before you buy it ..</li>
            <li> The bottle and packaging are first class and Mugler offers that &amp;quot;above and beyond&amp;quot; customer service with registering your fragrance.  </li>
            <li> well sure enough the UNIQUE code was missing.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, perfume was new just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> There is no problem lasting eight (8) hours on the skin and until the next day on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got many compliments from total female strangers.</li>
            <li> But if you do, I would highly reccommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is ripe for a high &amp;quot;Wow Factor&amp;quot; as I routinely get compliments on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not very certain about any or all of these things, but I am hoping it is the genuine article.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, pay a little more and but from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> scent itself appears genuine, but without the real thing to compare, it&#x27;s difficult to be completely sure.  </li>
            <li> and when I opened the top of the box I saw the authentication code was missing</li>
            <li> Pretty good scent, but as others said, be wary.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne but it does not last long after you put it on.</li>
            <li> my new smell.</li>
            <li> The top note is still a massive amount of patchouli with a whole bunch of I-don&#x27;t-know-what, but it settles down after 30min-1hr.</li>
            <li> Nothing prepared me for the absolute deliciousness of A*men, which is like no other scent on the market.</li>
            <li> Wow; I was surprised by the big box from Frangrancenet, and when I opened it, very happy to find a gift pack in a black Angel Men toiletry bag with the 3.4 Oz EDT, plus a small deoderant stick and shower gel.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Subsequently, I was denied a refund on the first item...happy with the second item...</li>
            <li> I have about 4 bottles of this, 4 of Pure Havane, 2 of Pure Malt, and 1 of every other Thierry Mugler cologne.  </li>
            <li> Registration code was clear and I registered at the website.</li>
            <li> Real amen can almost be smelt a day later</li>
            <li> After wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve decided I actually... love this cologne.</li>
            <li> All are similar to the next, but each offers a different spin that becomes a unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Box came in tight and clean.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and leaves a very recognizable trail</li>
            <li> do a quick dry and spray cologne on then hop back in the shower briefly.</li>
            <li> Also never use this in the summer, way too sweet and strong for hot weather but when it comes to cold weather not much can beat it.</li>
            <li> Go get some Calvin somethin or other..;)</li>
            <li> The silage with this cologne is reasonably heavy but not SUPER heavy with two sprays to the neck, and this has a great longevity.</li>
            <li> when customer service (what a poor description) intervened, the suggested fix was for me to order an item shown here with only different black packaging and await my refund from my perfectly packaged previously ordered item but with some new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i mention it barely lasts an hour?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never had a problem ordering perfume or cologne directly from Amazon (no 3rd party vendors).  </li>
            <li> Alas, so many questions...and</li>
            <li> I most seriously would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> The code that usually is on the original box was not present on this box ( it was scratched! )</li>
            <li> at least you know you are buying the original product.</li>
            <li> I received the product recently and all I can say is that it&#x27;s a unique fragrance not every man can wear,despite the fact I received an old bottle that has been stored in a confined place,it doesn&#x27;t last long as the one I previously bought from a local macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Perhaps these were old, discounted or grey market items?  </li>

            <li> and then it slowly morphs into a sweet, gourmond fragrance.</li>
            <li> and then there&#x27;s a subtle, sweet caramel and cocoa smell that lingers for a handful of hours after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not stated in the description this was anything other than a new sealed product.</li>
            <li> It looked dirty, since it&#x27;s a black rubber flask, it had these grayish fingerprints on the bottle and the top spray part of the bottle had formed an indentation that was most likely due to constant use from the previous owner.</li>
            <li> previously ordered Angel with described only new color packaging...found it to be a totally different fragrance...</li>
            <li> When  I opened the package I saw that the clear wrapping around the box was not original, because it was barely stuck together.</li>
            <li> The one I received doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the one I purchased from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but then a fake code would easily be identified once someone attempted to authenticate it.  </li>
            <li> the cologne itself is fine, but the bottle is VERY dusty, as if it was sitting naked in a warehouse for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received a fake bottle of this fragrance just like many of the other customers.</li>
            <li> I am a long time amazon shopper for over 7 years.</li>
            <li> Soo, as long as you order from amazon LLC, they will do everything they can to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> so the cologne lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Dusty bottle, code removed inside packaging, very fishy, likely grey market.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to try at least once.</li>
            <li> But people are ambitious enough to market fake Ipads</li>
            <li> typical reaction from a female coworker:</li>
            <li> Even tried the other Angel versions but nothing stands up to how long this stays with you and</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no doubt</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> a few seconds later.</li>

            <li> for that initial blast and wait (keep telling yourself to wait) for a few minutes for the dry down.  </li>
            <li> , I may use this bottle to experiment and combine it with other scents...</li>
            <li> The bottle was dirty and full of fingerprints and the code was cut from the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t received an altered product contrary to some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> other reaction from my girlfriend:</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that had spoken of this practice, but I had expected that Amazon, being the seller in this case, would have some form of Quality Control that would prevent grey market, old or fake products from being purchased.</li>
            <li> It is a LOT like Axe Dark chocolate.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a promotional code from the inside of the box had been removed / cut off by someone</li>
            <li> This however needs to be used sparingly, no more than 4 sprays generally limited to 3 unless I&#x27;m going to a club.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is less than in the store</li>
            <li> Less than 36 hours</li>
            <li> Its a Rubbish product, smells like the hide of a dead animal.</li>
            <li> Lasts on my husband for 8+ hours and is irresistible year round.</li>
            <li> Defective - Code missing</li>
            <li> every few minutes-</li>
            <li> Lastly, the condition of the actual cologne bottle itself was very unappealing!</li>
            <li> I purchased a NEW Thierry Mugler Angel cologne for men as a Christmas gift for my brother and what I got in the mail was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The package was clearly opened, poorly resealed, and with the circle code poorly excised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually mugler perfumes will stay, so I&#x27;m questioning the authenticity of this one.  </li>
            <li> so what would halt someone from making a spot-on fake of something less technological like a bottle of cologne.  </li>
            <li> The rubber container makes it a little difficult to spray.</li>
            <li> (code on bottom of box also matched code on bottom of cologne), but the rubber flask appeared to be extremely dusty for some reason -- maybe this is something that&#x27;s put on all the A*Mens?</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> course, if someone were going to make a fake bottle and package, it makes sense that they would fake everything, including the code...</li>
            <li> Not Impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Wife likes this scent but now prefers Gucci Guilty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I recieved a very poor bittle that comes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this fragrance to say the least.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is you can not return it or exchange it</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the way the product looked.</li>
            <li> The cologne is a oil base so the water will help activate the smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I own many colognes and Thierry Mugler scents are some of the best. However, this review is based upon the fact that this was delivered opened, the code was scratched off, the bottle was turned around backwards in the box and sealed back up with a sticker. There is absolutely no doubt this is the authentic scent so I called Amazon and they are sending a replacement. Customer service has made it right yet again.</li>
            <li> this coffee smell is really good.</li>
            <li> The code that usually is on the original box was not present on this box ( it was scratched! )</li>
            <li> I purchased a NEW Thierry Mugler Angel cologne for men as a Christmas gift for my brother and what I got in the mail was disappointing. When  I opened the package I saw that the clear wrapping around the box was not original, because it was barely stuck together. Then I saw that the top shiny part of the box was glued on and peeling and when I opened the top of the box I saw the authentication code was missing (it looked like it was removed or peeled off). Lastly, the condition of the actual cologne bottle itself was very unappealing! It looked dirty, since it&#x27;s a black rubber flask, it had these grayish fingerprints on the bottle and the top spray part of the bottle had formed an indentation that was most likely due to constant use from the previous owner. I was very unhappy with the way the product looked.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite smells. A bit expensive but then so are most of the good ones.</li>
            <li> The product appeared to be retail packaged and shrink wrapped however upon opening it looks like somebody opened it and cut out the registration code under the top of the box and then re-sealed it. This registration code is part of the purchase and the removal of it is defrauding the customer who purchases it. It was not stated in the description this was anything other than a new sealed product.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Perfume delivered in perfect condition, very pleasant fragrance and excellent fixation.</li>
            <li> previously ordered Angel with described only new color packaging...found it to be a totally different fragrance...when customer service (what a poor description) intervened, the suggested fix was for me to order an item shown here with only different black packaging and await my refund from my perfectly packaged previously ordered item but with some new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, I was denied a refund on the first item...happy with the second item...but with double the cost...and denial of the triple guarantee......No customer service at all...do not go here...</li>
            <li> Its ok! More for winter cooler weather</li>
            <li> Pretty good scent, but as others said, be wary. My box was all nice and sealed, and the registration code was there (code on bottom of box also matched code on bottom of cologne), but the rubber flask appeared to be extremely dusty for some reason -- maybe this is something that&#x27;s put on all the A*Mens? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ve not seen it on any of my colognes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pretty good scent, but it really does smell borderline like perfume -- I think a woman could easily wear this. A pretty strong patchouli sweetness on top, and then it slowly morphs into a sweet, gourmond fragrance. I definitely don&#x27;t the the top note is as \\&quot;EW\\&quot; as so many others do, but I could see why some would be turned off by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good scent, but I&#x27;m wondering why my cologne had white stuff (maybe dust?) on the flask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUICK EDIT: After wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve decided I actually... love this cologne. It&#x27;s phenomenal for colder weather. The first few times I kind of thought it smelled nondescript and just... sweet, after the intense patchouli start. Now that I&#x27;ve worn it more, it&#x27;s just got an incredible caramel sort of smell and sugary aroma with toffee and maybe a little bit of coffee or something. The top note is still a massive amount of patchouli with a whole bunch of I-don&#x27;t-know-what, but it settles down after 30min-1hr. The silage with this cologne is reasonably heavy but not SUPER heavy with two sprays to the neck, and this has a great longevity. Pretty heavy silage for about 9 hours, and then there&#x27;s a subtle, sweet caramel and cocoa smell that lingers for a handful of hours after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must-buy cologne, but maybe not a blind buy. I blind bought it and loved it more than I thought I would -- just be sure to wear it a few times before passing judgment on it.</li>
            <li> The perfume i smell great lasts more than 12 hours, no problem, deputy, careful about application</li>
            <li> The fragrance became sickning.  I thought I liked it.  The scent of coffee is overwhelming.  I gave it two stars because they were honest about it&#x27;s scent.  I just could not go all day smelling like coffee.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4oz bottle of Angel for Men as a gift for someone on Tuesday 1/31/2012 from Amazon as the seller. When I received the box via UPS yesterday on 2/1/2012, the cologne arrived wrapped in the box; however, the cologne had been opened and the unique code within the box had been removed. The cologne itself appears to be fine, but I&#x27;m still uncertain as to its authenticity, considering someone obviously went out of their way to cut out the code on the box. I had read reviews that had spoken of this practice, but I had expected that Amazon, being the seller in this case, would have some form of Quality Control that would prevent grey market, old or fake products from being purchased. I have been very happy with nearly all of my Amazon purchases, but this particular example has kept me guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if someone were going to make a fake bottle and package, it makes sense that they would fake everything, including the code...but then a fake code would easily be identified once someone attempted to authenticate it.  And then, faking the rubber flask, and attempting to put cologne or any liquid inside the flask also seems like it would be cumbersome, right? But people are ambitious enough to market fake Ipads so what would halt someone from making a spot-on fake of something less technological like a bottle of cologne.  Alas, so many questions...and so many possibilities....seems a bit much for a simple purchase, but this is type of mindf**k one engages in when packages arrive in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not very certain about any or all of these things, but I am hoping it is the genuine article. Perhaps these were old, discounted or grey market items?  Again, these are all questions that I have.  The cologne itself seems to smell authentic, but who knows?</li>
            <li> This is a hazardous liquid and cannot be returned.  I\\&quot;m embarrassed to say that this is the second time I ordered something from Amazon that couldn&#x27;t be returned.  Hope this caution helps others.</li>
            <li> good fragrance and very long-lasting.  i think the variants, namely pure havane and pure malt are better.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and a great seller.  As promised.  I love it and use it.  It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely fantastic!  The nice thing is that not a lot of people wear it, so you tend to stick out in a crowd a bit more when you wear it out.</li>
            <li> What a great fragrance.  It is a LOT like Axe Dark chocolate.  It has a very sweet coffee/chocolate scent, and makes you smell absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I had the same issue that others mentioned.  Dusty bottle, code removed inside packaging, very fishy, likely grey market.  I&#x27;m a prime member and this is the first time I&#x27;ve received an item that was not as advertised.  Amazon is replacing.  I&#x27;m sure this was just a bad shipment they got at one of their warehouses, and they seem to be doing their best to take care of this QC issue.</li>
            <li> I received a fake bottle of this fragrance just like many of the other customers. The code was removed and the bottle was very scratched and marred. When I sprayed the fragrance and tested it against my old bottle, which was purchased from a brick and mortar store, the smell of the amazon product was more of rubbing alcohol with a hint of the fragrance. I will not buy anymore fragrances from amazon. I am a long time amazon shopper for over 7 years.</li>
            <li> Cheap ripoff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a very poor bittle that comes about as close to the gourmand smell of Amen as a cat is to a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did i mention it barely lasts an hour? Real amen can almost be smelt a day later</li>
            <li> I love the Angel for my man :)&lt;br /&gt;Price is less than in the store but it is not a bargain.</li>
            <li> I received the item in time. However I noticed that the unique code inside the box has been cut off. Now this has seeded doubts in my head now...</li>
            <li> Like many other customers, I received a bottle in suspect packaging.  The package was clearly opened, poorly resealed, and with the circle code poorly excised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself appears genuine, but without the real thing to compare, it&#x27;s difficult to be completely sure.  It could be merely a moderately convincing fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 50% off Thierry Mugler seemed like a great deal from Amazon.  But as with all things, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> A+++ I&#x27;ve never owned a cologne that has a fragrance that changes from the 1st time you put it on until the end of the day. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery, and you cannot find a better price for this cologna. Bought as a gift for my fianc&amp;eacute;e, and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Great scent!</li>
            <li> This is a Cologne that both my husband and I have used for years and found the price was good.  The package arrived on time and was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love the compliments. Everyone asks what is it that you are wearing. Long lasting and leaves a very recognizable trail</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent. Box came in tight and clean. Registration code was clear and I registered at the website. Rubber bottle can get kind of smudgy and its not the cleanest look. But the jewel is in the scent. The combination of mint, coffee, caramel, lavender, and tar just works! Really great classy fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cologne.  Try others but always come back to this.  Even tried the other Angel versions but nothing stands up to how long this stays with you and nothing ever gets more compliments.</li>
            <li> Not really bad, it&#x27;s just a different and unique winter/night/clubbing sweet scent which you should try at least once to see if you like it, IMO this is not the best choice for a blind buy, so I suggest you try it on your skin before you buy it ..I probably won&#x27;t buy it again since for the price I consider there are many other better options, I may use this bottle to experiment and combine it with other scents... I do like Pure Havane a lot though, the projection and longevity on these two is great so be easy on the trigger unless you really want to be noticed.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I ordered this product, and when I got it, the serial number was scratched off the bottom, BUT the product did smell as it was supposed to. However I called amazon, and they are sending me a new one, free of charge. They said if the next one isnt legit either, they will conduct an investigation. Soo, as long as you order from amazon LLC, they will do everything they can to resolve the issue. Plus, the product seems legit, the serial number is just gone. Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne but it does not last long after you put it on.</li>
            <li> As many others have stated on other colognes that they bought, the box was already opened, and the unique code inside was taken out. I *think* the cologne itself is fine, but the bottle is VERY dusty, as if it was sitting naked in a warehouse for a long time.</li>
            <li> When he wears this! Lovely citrus notes with earthy undertones.....changes as he wears it, especially love it the next morning!!! Reminiscent of LIGHTLY scented patchouli.</li>
            <li> amazing smell and great price</li>
            <li> I bought this scent 3rd time which I never did before. The magic is that it gives me some power for new achievements, inspiring me. Highly recommended to try at least once.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing. However, don&#x27;t buy it here. The one I received doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the one I purchased from Macy&#x27;s. 24 hours vs. just a couple hours. Do yourself a favor, pay a little more and but from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> received on time.nice perfume</li>
            <li> A little old, but still smells good</li>
            <li> The product was obviously open and handled. The bottle was dirty and full of fingerprints and the code was cut from the inside of the box. It might be a fake, now I can&#x27;t be sure. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> A-Men is a nice dark fragrance. It smells like coffee, caramel, brownies. It has great longevity (10 hrs easy), so if you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, give this one a try. The only reason I gave it four stars is because, I don&#x27;t like coffee. But if you do, I would highly reccommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this fragrance to say the least.I most seriously would not recommend it to anyone! It smells like over baked perfume cookies.My girl frowned after snifting it(blahhhh)</li>
            <li> very nice perfume long lasting and recommend for purchase for those who love intense fragrances.buy again from amazon,highly recommended.great.love it</li>
            <li> I received the product recently and all I can say is that it&#x27;s a unique fragrance not every man can wear,despite the fact I received an old bottle that has been stored in a confined place,it doesn&#x27;t last long as the one I previously bought from a local macy&#x27;s but the reason is self explanatory. I recommend that you go to your local department store and sample this stuff and if you enjoy the fragrance, do not hesitate to spend the extra $20 because you will be guaranteed a freshly packed and brand new cologne. You must give this fragrance time to develop, in one word to explain this fragrance, it would be &amp;#34;starbucks&amp;#34;...... It smells like a starbucks. (ex;coffee,cappuccino,brownie,sugar,cookies)</li>
            <li> For me.. My best cologne that matches me.. I&#x27;ll discourage anyone else from getting it though.. Because it&#x27;s mine.. Go get some Calvin somethin or other..;)</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> perfect good nice thank you,,</li>
            <li> Great fragrance... My only complaint is that a promotional code from the inside of the box had been removed / cut off by someone</li>
            <li> great scent, but it fades after a few hours.  usually mugler perfumes will stay, so I&#x27;m questioning the authenticity of this one.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to reapply it by afternoon!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t received an altered product contrary to some other reviewers. It&#x27;s a genuine bottle / packaging. Never opened and codes / numbers are present. The shipping was fast (3 days), the price is really good and the perfume smells great.</li>
            <li> Very good and long lasting. . Will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Incredible scent fell completely in love with it.  Strong sweet and amazing.</li>
            <li> Always get great deals on this product and my hubby gets so many compliments when he wears it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery, one of my all time fave colognes!</li>
            <li> Not Impressed with this product. I received an old perfume and smells not so good.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for many years.  The best thing about this cologne is that it last on your skin, clothes for over 24 hours, over time the smell changes and is just a very pleasing smell.  My wife loves this cologne on me, and is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li> Great perfume original although it was worth a fortune&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly my man just loves it. It is one of his favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it!</li>
            <li> Its a Rubbish product, smells like the hide of a dead animal. The bad thing is you can not return it or exchange it</li>
            <li> my son was very happy he love this parfum  and the price is good me and his daddy are very happy i love  this product</li>
            <li> Thierry Mugler is fast becoming my favorite cologne designer... I now own seven (7) or more of his fragrances and love them all.  All are similar to the next, but each offers a different spin that becomes a unique fragrance.  Well done Thierry Mugler...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A*Men comes out of the bottle hot (Hot meaning strong and can be overwhelming) with notes of tar, leather, pepper, and chocolate and then settles to a sweeter musk scent that is fantastic.  I am a huge fan.  The fragrance is ripe for a high &amp;quot;Wow Factor&amp;quot; as I routinely get compliments on the fragrance.  It is truly unique.  There are plenty of nay-sayers out there and I will admit - coming out of the bottle, most Mugler&#x27;s fragrance are not so appealing - it is the dry down that becomes pleasant.  And the beauty - the Mugler fragrances, including A*Men, last all day.  There is no problem lasting eight (8) hours on the skin and until the next day on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would feel comfortable wearing A*Men any season and for any event, but I suppose the experts say that fall or winter are most appropriate time with evening wear as ideal.  Me - anytime and anywhere..!!  The bottle and packaging are first class and Mugler offers that &amp;quot;above and beyond&amp;quot; customer service with registering your fragrance.  The bottle designs are unique and &amp;quot;the jury is still out&amp;quot; on whether I like them.  I can&#x27;t see the &amp;quot;rubber bottles&amp;quot; and would expect something more fitting -I have the small bottle of A*Men that is clear - I love clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/value is a slight deduction - but I am willing to pay more for longer lasting fragrances.  As I routinely  say, I have lots of problems - but money isn&#x27;t one of them..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final evaluation of A*Men is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  Only the (rubber) bottle design and price/value away from perfection.  The fragrance is awesome and I definitely recommend buying - just brace yourself for that initial blast and wait (keep telling yourself to wait) for a few minutes for the dry down.  You will be glad you did.  The beauty in communication - make sure you listen constructively...!!ourself for that initial blast and wait (keep telling yourself to wait) for a few minutes for the dry down.  You will be glad you did.  The beauty in communication - make sure you listen constructively...!!</li>
            <li> Wife likes this scent but now prefers Gucci Guilty.  She changes every year so nothing against Angel.  Real man scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Thierry Mugler by far makes my favorite winter colognes.  I have about 4 bottles of this, 4 of Pure Havane, 2 of Pure Malt, and 1 of every other Thierry Mugler cologne.  This is a great date scent or a scent for the bar.  This however needs to be used sparingly, no more than 4 sprays generally limited to 3 unless I&#x27;m going to a club.  Also never use this in the summer, way too sweet and strong for hot weather but when it comes to cold weather not much can beat it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, perfume was new just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance I get compliments every time I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> My oh my, does this stuff smell amazing!!! Smells delicious spraying it out of the bottle, but once it&#x27;s on the skin it turns into this warm, sexy scent that I just want to wrap myself in. The perfect mix of yin &amp; yang with the sweet caramel, vanilla &amp; chocolate blending with the masculine tar and musk. Lasts on my husband for 8+ hours and is irresistible year round. I&#x27;ve also never had a problem ordering perfume or cologne directly from Amazon (no 3rd party vendors).  So I recommend buying this for sure!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and was well received.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product the rubber bottle had a lot of scratches. Inside the top box cover it says \\&quot;This code is unique. Register it at [...] and let yourself be surprised...\\&quot; well sure enough the UNIQUE code was missing. The product was def. opened.  The cologne did not smell like the one I bought from Macy&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t get fooled by the price. Its better to spend extra $10-$20 at least you know you are buying the original product.</li>
            <li> One of the best scents in my opinion and the best part is that one spritz lasts for hours so the cologne lasts for a long time. Incredibly fast shipping from the company that I bought it from. Less than 36 hours and I ordered it with regular shipping.</li>
            <li> Wow; I was surprised by the big box from Frangrancenet, and when I opened it, very happy to find a gift pack in a black Angel Men toiletry bag with the 3.4 Oz EDT, plus a small deoderant stick and shower gel.....LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a test spray on my wrist and was overpowered by the tarry opening...just like the YouTube reviewers said about that strong tarry opening.  This EDT projects like a mad-man and lasts and lasts and lasts...Definitely a strip club or night club cologne that will eat up anyone&#x27;s Paco Rabanne 1 Million scent, and have room left over for a 2000 calorie dessert.</li>
            <li> Words can not express How sexy and manly you feel with this fragance, there are some that say it smells like the female version, if so, it really feels awesome specially because it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The box was opened and the unique code was gone!!!... The scent doesn&#x27;t smell like the one i try in the retail store.</li>
            <li> The cologne is a great long lasting man&#x27;s fragrance. The product was exactly as described.It was packaged and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Lovely and unique eau de toilette !! For really special occasions. I love it. It is really different and very special for me. I was looking for it and decided to buy it in Amazon. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Found a sample of this scent in a magazine &amp; had to have the real thing. Got many compliments from total female strangers.</li>
            <li> Defective - Code missing</li>
            <li> The rubber container makes it a little difficult to spray. If you shake it before pressing to spray it comes out better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I like the cover, it makes for a nice grip so the bottle won&#x27;t slip from my hand.</li>
            <li> Mugler makes unusual fragrances.  They are top quality with great projection and longevity.  However, they are very different..  I would describe this as the smell of baked Christmas goodies.  Everybody loves that!  The thing is, most people don&#x27;t expect such a scent in a cologne. I do enjoy wearing Angel for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I just love Amazon this website is so awesome, my husband love this new Thierry Mugler Angel Men. The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good. Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas</li>
            <li> my new smell. has a very unique blend of flavors that 2/3 sprays keeps around all day. thanks a lot</li>
            <li> This was for a gift, and really liked the aroma is very good, strong but good, the maxima of the stars at the perfume is original, I recommend it to all enterprising men, what I liked most is to have it  :D</li>
            <li> omg...angel men cologne is by far one of the best colognes i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. this fragrance is simply amazing. sweet goodness...i dont know what else to say... at first i was a little worried that it wouldnt smell good. and when i sprayed it...i didnt know what to expect...a few seconds later. an godly aroma filled my nose and i was in a trance...i had to take my shirt off because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> Bought myself a tester on ebay if only because a lot of people don&#x27;t trust what&#x27;s sold on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried many colognes and own 1 Million- one of my favorite scents. Nothing prepared me for the absolute deliciousness of A*men, which is like no other scent on the market. This stuff is heaven in a bottle! I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist every few minutes- it is INCREDIBLY good smelling. I cannot see why anyone on the fragrance forums would think otherwise- can&#x27;t imagine anything more sexy than getting a whiff of knee-trembling caramel, coffee, and vanilla spiced up in an intoxicating and remarkable juice. This is a sophisticated candy blend that is not only ostensibly masculine, but may make you and others want to devour any exposed flesh that you spray it on. I HIGHLY recommend!!! How on earth I survived without this stuff is beyond me! Can&#x27;t wait to try it around the ladiessss ^_^</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND I KNOW HE WILL LIKE IT AND I WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have over 50 colognes and this is in my top ten. Best way to use this cologne is to take a shower hop out do a quick dry and spray cologne on then hop back in the shower briefly. The cologne is a oil base so the water will help activate the smell. Has a vanilla type smell.</li>
            <li> The box appeared to have been resealed. The unique product code on the inside of the box has been removed. There is no way to verify that this is not a fake... DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li> This is the most unusual fragrance I have ever worn.  It is dark, warm, but not overly sweet.  It has notes of chocolate, pipe tobacco, spice, smokey and vanilla.  [[ASIN:B000JLAWIA A Men]] is not a typical \\&quot;club\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; cologne, best worn in one-on-one encounters or worn very lightly in office settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A typical reaction from a female coworker: \\&quot;Do you have incense or something in your office, it reminds me of something good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reaction from my girlfriend: \\&quot;I could just roll around in that stuff.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third bottle and never bought it at a better price.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good, I purchased the womens fragrance as well. It is worth a try, you will enjoy it.</li>
