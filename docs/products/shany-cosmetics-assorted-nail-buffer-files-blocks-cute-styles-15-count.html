            <li>Good price for everything you get.</li>
            <li>but price is good so that earns another star.</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these one for me and one for  a friend as part of her birthday gift, she loved it.</li>
            <li>This was another good choice for me . . .</li>
            <li>They look and feel of good quality, but the sand paper/buffing material are not.  </li>

            <li>, so you have a good idea what order to use them in.  </li>
            <li>and she told me that she loved it</li>
            <li>This is a good option for me because my grand daughters always think they need files and then they disappear The quality is not that great, but if you are like my household and need lots of files because they all get lost, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve order six of these for myself and very satisfied.</li>

            <li>Nice selection and</li>
            <li>nice varied selection</li>
            <li>The buffers are all nice, but I also needed a nail file.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of handy files.</li>
            <li>nice assortment of buffers and files.</li>
            <li>Whatever kind of file you like...</li>
            <li>the nail files fell apart in use but the blocks are nice</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get these because there are so many!!</li>
            <li>Sure I didn&#x27;t need all these nail files but they were very cheap!</li>
            <li>very pretty great assortment</li>
            <li>a good variety of cheap files.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was really nice, and some of the files are too cute to use.</li>
            <li>I could do without all the glittery ones that crud all over the place, but for the most part, this was a nice set of nail files.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect kit for a nail salon to give each manicurist, or as a gift for the COMPLETE manicure set.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need easy access to all of them!</li>
            <li>very cheap,</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Most of the choices in the box were levels of grit I would not have chosen.</li>
            <li>Cute designs.  </li>
            <li>Love the variety.</li>
            <li>But I feel like there are more buffer than filers.</li>
            <li>Love how many tools come in this package.  </li>
            <li>advise just go to the store and buy the 2 sided ones even if you buy more than one.</li>
            <li>i put my favorite one in my purse.</li>
            <li>I received some really cute ones with owl design, others were not my taste</li>
            <li>I received a lot in the package but most didn&#x27;t work more than once before falling apart.</li>
            <li>Also, since I probably won&#x27;t be using them all anytime soon, they will make cute additions to stockings or gift baskets during the holidays.</li>
            <li>Seems like it would be an excellent gift for a teenage girl :-)</li>
            <li>The daughter and wife seem to love them.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They come apart, Need better glue.</li>
            <li>so cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared many with my daughter and mom.</li>
            <li>This is a really awesome kit that I&#x27;m still using months later.</li>
            <li>Many many files included.  </li>
            <li>Well packaged with cute designs and pattern</li>
            <li>Many of the pieces in the kit are what I believe are 180/220 buffers</li>
            <li>Say it&#x27;s more like a $5.00 value.</li>
            <li>Huge variety, all nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Revlon brand is better</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this set of files and buffers.</li>
            <li>Would make an awesome gift for a tween or teen.  </li>
            <li>This had everything and more anyone needs to shape/smooth nails.  </li>
            <li>My friend wanted to buy more for Christmas gifts but they were out</li>
            <li>I plan on giving these away and purchasing something of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use most of it.</li>
            <li>Hoping that the redt of them make it through more than one go....</li>
            <li>more than one cause the price given may increase over time</li>
            <li>After trying this pack you will probably find a file and buffer that you want to use on a regular basis but for a someone who is still developing a nail care regime this pack is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Most of the block buffers also had ZERO grit to them.  </li>
            <li>I like the multiple sided buffing boards they work great!!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to buy nail files for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li>delivery was ok, and packaging was alright..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see they are selling more.</li>
            <li>There are too many polishers in the group.</li>
            <li>Need more files.</li>
            <li>As I was taking them out of the box, the glue on many of the pieces had not done its job of holding the abrasive side and the foam side together, so they&#x27;re falling apart.  </li>
            <li>, I made out better than paying $1</li>
            <li>The buffers are better than the filers.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did get this set.</li>
            <li>I love this set and would continue buying it for friends.</li>
            <li>rich rich rich in nail buffers!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased Shipped quick</li>
            <li>Good quality at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Some very cool and interesting designs.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is a great deal and plus they are so cute!</li>
            <li>Every things in great shape and brand new.</li>
            <li>Also, no directions or even explanations as to what the items are, that would have been super nice.  </li>
            <li>The free emory boards you get at parades and from politicians are better.</li>
            <li>nice big selection of every kind of buffer and files!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the ones I am using so far.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of nail files with fun patterns.  </li>
            <li>Very useful, some have more sides than others.</li>
            <li>So I recommend that you get this because you are saving money and getting so many useful things in it!</li>
            <li>fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>So many files for such a great price.</li>
            <li>They wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>item is cute, and functional, for the price I feel like I got more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>nail files are cheap looking and wear easily.</li>
            <li>When I tried to buy a fine buffer at the store, each one was $4.  </li>
            <li>Some of them are super adorable.  </li>
            <li>The designs are super cute, too.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>They are brightly colored and come in many different forms.</li>
            <li>This package has a huge variety of buffer pads and files.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll enjoy it and her sister will steal some of them.</li>
            <li>I woud buy it again for that price, as I came here to do, free shipping and all - but for $20?</li>
            <li>Its just light paper.</li>
            <li>Thank you SHANY for making such great products</li>
            <li>This was such a great value.</li>
            <li>Great gift for any teenage girl!</li>
            <li>cause they are cheap</li>
            <li>Price was cheap</li>
            <li>fantastic files and buffers</li>
            <li>Nothing to smooth any ridges.</li>
            <li>truthfully even with a count of 15 they weren&#x27;t worth 50 cents a piece like priced.  </li>
            <li>FAntastic deal for all you get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m way too cheap for that.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really, really cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>What is really great is that I can use specific files for my both of my feet and not have to worry about transferring fungus.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loved these.</li>
            <li>A good price for plenty of different kine nail files. :)</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>Not all the sides are labeled on every file, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>I love it thanks!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product, it was delivered quickly, the nail files are pretty girly and cute, just how I like them.</li>
            <li>This was such a good price, I was surprised by how many nail products were in this container!</li>
            <li>Nice little kit with more than I needed, would probably make a cute gift.</li>
            <li>Most have either no grit and some have way too much grit.</li>
            <li>These should last me a good while.</li>
            <li>Cute designs and colors but also very functional.  </li>
            <li>I really like these for the most part but the package I received had some damaged files.  </li>
            <li>you can pretty easily figure out how you&#x27;re supposed to use them if they&#x27;re not labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was afraid that the quality might not be very good because the price was so good</li>
            <li>Got it quickly.</li>
            <li>also ordered the &#x27;Girlie&#x27; mini emery boards ( 12 in a pack) for an &#x27;anytime/any place&#x27; quick fix. .</li>
            <li>They wear too quickly.</li>
            <li>So many, so many different sizes.</li>
            <li>Well they look cute but the first one fell apart on first use.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t love the curved ones as much), but in general an amazing assortment, and I like the fact that they are labelled right on the items themselves</li>
            <li>There is a very nice assortment here for the price and it allows you to try out the different styles of emery boards/blocks and see if one suits your personal preference better than another.</li>
            <li>Seemed lika a good deal, but the surfaces of the files are mostly glue with very little grit.</li>
            <li>Not only is it pretty to look at and feminine but also good value for money.</li>
            <li>At first I thought they were just foam packaging!</li>
            <li>a lot of stuff for little cash, great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li>Quality is not overly great, and I&#x27;ve already used up a few of them</li>
            <li>While I understand that I will receive an assortment, I still expect the kit to have the same kind of nail files and buffers shown included.</li>
            <li>Lots of stuff here, was fun going through it.</li>
            <li>Comes in a lovely clear box to keep them all organized.  </li>
            <li>And they are fun looking.  </li>
            <li>I love them all so far.</li>
            <li>The 4-sided, curved buffer is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Worth it, though.</li>
            <li>They are cute and I do enjoy and use weekly the ones that are actually for filing.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails a lot and these aren&#x27;t quite quality enough.  </li>
            <li>Honestly,  I grew up in a house with 4 boys, I was the only girl</li>
            <li>For what I paid, $8, this pack was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I liked this for the buffers and there are several varieties.</li>
            <li>Fun, versatile set.</li>
            <li>However, if you are expecting some kind of quality such as a 2-3+ times use...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $8 I paid.  </li>
            <li>These are not as high quality (smooth filing)</li>
            <li>It comes with some really cute and useful styles for one low price.</li>
            <li>Shipped out and received super fast, too.</li>
            <li>I would have loved a little case, or something.  </li>
            <li>Sand paper fell off first time I went to use these.</li>
            <li>many different styles of buffers and files like pictured.</li>
            <li>All of the files lost their grit along the edges after the first 1-2 uses and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I am in heaven with so many different files.</li>
            <li>My first issue is that there was no way for me to identify what was what.</li>
            <li>There are so many different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to have so many different pieces.</li>
            <li>First of all, there is no i instructions to each nail file to know which is which.</li>
            <li>Some nail file do not file at all, others eat ur whole nail!</li>
            <li>Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li>Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li>Most of the emery boards fell apart after a short time.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to ;-)</li>
            <li>Actually ruined my nails more than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first now</li>
            <li>Comparing the various grits, shapes, and colors, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can figure out exactly which sides are used for each purpose.  </li>
            <li>Even though I wash my files in soap and hot water, I was worried about transfer.</li>
            <li>My 2nd order of this set - just love it to pieces what with all its choices and the decent quality of the 15 items in it (and what&#x27;s not to love about the LOW PRICE?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good and low cost way to get multiple nail buffer files.</li>
            <li>I mean the price is great for how much stuff you get and how well it works.</li>
            <li>My nail files and buffers seem to lose their grit pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Nice little array of buffers.</li>
            <li>This came with a huge variety of different shapes, sizes and textures.  </li>
            <li>are 2 or 3 that i really like</li>
            <li>fast delivery too..</li>
            <li>Instructions would have been very helpful.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic value with several quality, multi-sided nail files/buffers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Really like this set.</li>
            <li>know these were inexpensive but would have been much happier if they had all been functional...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown several of them away because the cheap paper underneath began to fray almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Buffing works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy having all the different varieties and sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need these for the shaping portion, as I&#x27;ve purchased crystal files.  </li>
            <li>looks like 80 grit sandpaper, really.</li>
            <li>I bought this pack because it was much cheaper than buying things piecemeal at any store, but I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would have refunded this product if I paid that much.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it was the ones I liked the most, which meant I didn&#x27;t get as much used from them as I might have</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had gotten this set for my friend who loves to do her nails just as much as I did</li>
            <li>Decent quality files for so much cheaper than the drug store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to buy single files/buffer for more money that last longer.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really decent.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I purchased this kit was the rounded nail file/buffer and it did not come in the kit.</li>
            <li>super coarse-</li>
            <li>Had high hopes but glad it was an add on price that was half of what it is offered for on the Shany site but</li>
            <li>I am a novice when it comes to nail care and had high hopes for this assortment.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything high quality.</li>
            <li>So many to choose from and my little girl was stoked about the variety too.</li>
            <li>Much, much more than expected!!!</li>
            <li>This pack of nail files had every nail file you could ask for, plus a few more to stuff christmas stockings with.</li>
            <li>The different prints that it has also are fun...</li>
            <li>If you do your nails as much as I do (I have natural nails and can&#x27;t afford professional manicures, but I don&#x27;t need them as my nails grow well without stuff like Gel)</li>
            <li>The nail filers have a very soft grit.</li>
            <li>The buffers give a high shine no need for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Now I will never have to go on a wild goose hunt for a nail file ever again!</li>
            <li>Do not waste ur money!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting exactly what was in the picture necessary, but something resembling it.</li>
            <li>My nails are so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>There is a wide variety from coarse grit files to ultra smooth buffers for high shine.</li>
            <li>Majority smooth buffers (Some almost appeared to have no special surface - just... paper-like?)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy this again, but there are so many files that I expect this to last me a long time!</li>
            <li>Great variety of files, average quality, but only one file had a design on it, the rest plain.</li>
            <li>These are not high end emory boards or buffers, several have fallen apart without much use - for $20 that would not be worth while to buy again.</li>
            <li>Would recommend people spend a little extra money because cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>Comes in a clear plastic container.</li>
            <li>TOO soft.</li>
            <li>wow do you get a lot,  </li>
            <li>so much of them, haven&#x27;t an idea on how to use them properly yet.</li>
            <li>There was one file with glitter on it, my friends 12 year old loves it.</li>
            <li>Quite surprised with the amount that came in this box....</li>
            <li>Too coarse/harsh for natural nails&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to understand this whole nail/cut/file/shape/buff.  </li>
            <li>-8 sided:&lt;br /&gt;2 blocks (1 marked, 1</li>
            <li>They will not hold up as well as your more expensive files, but they are worth the investment.</li>
            <li>For the amount of files included it was worth the price, however only 3 or 4 of them were actually usable</li>
            <li>but most are such poor quality that it&#x27;s not even worth it.  </li>
            <li>so I had to rehome them, but having fun trying out the other things</li>
            <li>(normally they last a lot longer).</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to buy new nail files for several years!</li>
            <li>Even my hubs too one of the less colorful ones for himself.</li>
            <li>good for both natural and artificial nails.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the way the products were presented in this plain, cheap plastic box thing.  </li>
            <li>Buffers wear out pretty quickly, but with this set I will not have to run out to purchase another, well at least for a VERY long time!</li>
            <li>Even if some are for buffing, I&#x27;m not really sure what such a smooth surface would buff???</li>
            <li>They were ok but there were about 2 broken ones when it came</li>
            <li>most of the items are poorly constructed and falling apart after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li>There was very little overlap in products and every item is useful.</li>
            <li>Not sure that all of them will be totally useful</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the variety, this is a good way to find out which nail file types works best for you.</li>

            <li> Good price for everything you get.</li>

            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> but they are good  </li>

            <li> Bought 2 of these one for me and one for  a friend as part of her birthday gift, she loved it.</li>
            <li> This was another good choice for me . . .</li>
            <li> They look and feel of good quality, but the sand paper/buffing material are not.  </li>
            <li> Good assortment of files.</li>
            <li> I used them myself to give my nails a good buff.</li>

            <li> , so you have a good idea what order to use them in.  </li>
            <li> and she told me that she loved it</li>
            <li> This is a good option for me because my grand daughters always think they need files and then they disappear The quality is not that great, but if you are like my household and need lots of files because they all get lost, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order six of these for myself and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the variety of choices offered</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m So HAPPY most of these are labeled on what to do</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> But cute!</li>
            <li> Most the files fell apart after fist use!</li>

            <li> Really nice variety for the price.  </li>
            <li> A nice variety of files and buffers.</li>
            <li> loving it.</li>

            <li> Nice selection and</li>
            <li> nice varied selection</li>
            <li> The buffers are all nice, but I also needed a nail file.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of handy files.</li>
            <li> nice assortment of buffers and files.</li>
            <li> Whatever kind of file you like...</li>
            <li> the nail files fell apart in use but the blocks are nice</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these because there are so many!!</li>
            <li> Sure I didn&#x27;t need all these nail files but they were very cheap!</li>
            <li> very pretty great assortment</li>
            <li> a good variety of cheap files.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was really nice, and some of the files are too cute to use.</li>
            <li> I could do without all the glittery ones that crud all over the place, but for the most part, this was a nice set of nail files.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit for a nail salon to give each manicurist, or as a gift for the COMPLETE manicure set.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need easy access to all of them!</li>
            <li> very cheap,</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Most of the choices in the box were levels of grit I would not have chosen.</li>
            <li> Cute designs.  </li>
            <li> Love the variety.</li>
            <li> But I feel like there are more buffer than filers.</li>
            <li> Love how many tools come in this package.  </li>
            <li> advise just go to the store and buy the 2 sided ones even if you buy more than one.</li>
            <li> i put my favorite one in my purse.</li>
            <li> I received some really cute ones with owl design, others were not my taste</li>
            <li> I received a lot in the package but most didn&#x27;t work more than once before falling apart.</li>
            <li> Also, since I probably won&#x27;t be using them all anytime soon, they will make cute additions to stockings or gift baskets during the holidays.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would be an excellent gift for a teenage girl :-)</li>
            <li> The daughter and wife seem to love them.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They come apart, Need better glue.</li>
            <li> so cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared many with my daughter and mom.</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome kit that I&#x27;m still using months later.</li>
            <li> Many many files included.  </li>
            <li> Well packaged with cute designs and pattern</li>
            <li> Many of the pieces in the kit are what I believe are 180/220 buffers</li>
            <li> Say it&#x27;s more like a $5.00 value.</li>
            <li> Huge variety, all nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Revlon brand is better</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this set of files and buffers.</li>
            <li> Would make an awesome gift for a tween or teen.  </li>
            <li> This had everything and more anyone needs to shape/smooth nails.  </li>
            <li> My friend wanted to buy more for Christmas gifts but they were out</li>
            <li> I plan on giving these away and purchasing something of better quality.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use most of it.</li>
            <li> Hoping that the redt of them make it through more than one go....</li>
            <li> more than one cause the price given may increase over time</li>
            <li> After trying this pack you will probably find a file and buffer that you want to use on a regular basis but for a someone who is still developing a nail care regime this pack is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Most of the block buffers also had ZERO grit to them.  </li>
            <li> I like the multiple sided buffing boards they work great!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy nail files for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> delivery was ok, and packaging was alright..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see they are selling more.</li>
            <li> There are too many polishers in the group.</li>
            <li> Need more files.</li>
            <li> As I was taking them out of the box, the glue on many of the pieces had not done its job of holding the abrasive side and the foam side together, so they&#x27;re falling apart.  </li>
            <li> , I made out better than paying $1</li>
            <li> The buffers are better than the filers.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did get this set.</li>
            <li> I love this set and would continue buying it for friends.</li>
            <li> rich rich rich in nail buffers!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased Shipped quick</li>
            <li> Good quality at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Some very cool and interesting designs.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is a great deal and plus they are so cute!</li>
            <li> Every things in great shape and brand new.</li>
            <li> Also, no directions or even explanations as to what the items are, that would have been super nice.  </li>
            <li> The free emory boards you get at parades and from politicians are better.</li>
            <li> nice big selection of every kind of buffer and files!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the ones I am using so far.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of nail files with fun patterns.  </li>
            <li> Very useful, some have more sides than others.</li>
            <li> So I recommend that you get this because you are saving money and getting so many useful things in it!</li>
            <li> fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> So many files for such a great price.</li>
            <li> They wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> item is cute, and functional, for the price I feel like I got more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> nail files are cheap looking and wear easily.</li>
            <li> When I tried to buy a fine buffer at the store, each one was $4.  </li>
            <li> Some of them are super adorable.  </li>
            <li> The designs are super cute, too.</li>
            <li> Super cute</li>
            <li> They are brightly colored and come in many different forms.</li>
            <li> This package has a huge variety of buffer pads and files.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll enjoy it and her sister will steal some of them.</li>
            <li> I woud buy it again for that price, as I came here to do, free shipping and all - but for $20?</li>
            <li> Its just light paper.</li>
            <li> Thank you SHANY for making such great products</li>
            <li> This was such a great value.</li>
            <li> Great gift for any teenage girl!</li>
            <li> cause they are cheap</li>
            <li> Price was cheap</li>
            <li> fantastic files and buffers</li>
            <li> Nothing to smooth any ridges.</li>
            <li> truthfully even with a count of 15 they weren&#x27;t worth 50 cents a piece like priced.  </li>
            <li> FAntastic deal for all you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way too cheap for that.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really, really cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> What is really great is that I can use specific files for my both of my feet and not have to worry about transferring fungus.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loved these.</li>
            <li> A good price for plenty of different kine nail files. :)</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> Not all the sides are labeled on every file, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> I love it thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, it was delivered quickly, the nail files are pretty girly and cute, just how I like them.</li>
            <li> This was such a good price, I was surprised by how many nail products were in this container!</li>
            <li> Nice little kit with more than I needed, would probably make a cute gift.</li>
            <li> Most have either no grit and some have way too much grit.</li>
            <li> These should last me a good while.</li>
            <li> Cute designs and colors but also very functional.  </li>
            <li> I really like these for the most part but the package I received had some damaged files.  </li>
            <li> you can pretty easily figure out how you&#x27;re supposed to use them if they&#x27;re not labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the quality might not be very good because the price was so good</li>
            <li> Got it quickly.</li>
            <li> also ordered the &#x27;Girlie&#x27; mini emery boards ( 12 in a pack) for an &#x27;anytime/any place&#x27; quick fix. .</li>
            <li> They wear too quickly.</li>
            <li> So many, so many different sizes.</li>
            <li> Well they look cute but the first one fell apart on first use.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t love the curved ones as much), but in general an amazing assortment, and I like the fact that they are labelled right on the items themselves</li>
            <li> There is a very nice assortment here for the price and it allows you to try out the different styles of emery boards/blocks and see if one suits your personal preference better than another.</li>
            <li> Seemed lika a good deal, but the surfaces of the files are mostly glue with very little grit.</li>
            <li> Not only is it pretty to look at and feminine but also good value for money.</li>
            <li> At first I thought they were just foam packaging!</li>
            <li> a lot of stuff for little cash, great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> Quality is not overly great, and I&#x27;ve already used up a few of them</li>
            <li> While I understand that I will receive an assortment, I still expect the kit to have the same kind of nail files and buffers shown included.</li>
            <li> Lots of stuff here, was fun going through it.</li>
            <li> Comes in a lovely clear box to keep them all organized.  </li>
            <li> And they are fun looking.  </li>
            <li> I love them all so far.</li>
            <li> The 4-sided, curved buffer is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Worth it, though.</li>
            <li> They are cute and I do enjoy and use weekly the ones that are actually for filing.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails a lot and these aren&#x27;t quite quality enough.  </li>
            <li> Honestly,  I grew up in a house with 4 boys, I was the only girl</li>
            <li> For what I paid, $8, this pack was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I liked this for the buffers and there are several varieties.</li>
            <li> Fun, versatile set.</li>
            <li> However, if you are expecting some kind of quality such as a 2-3+ times use...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $8 I paid.  </li>
            <li> These are not as high quality (smooth filing)</li>
            <li> It comes with some really cute and useful styles for one low price.</li>
            <li> Shipped out and received super fast, too.</li>
            <li> I would have loved a little case, or something.  </li>
            <li> Sand paper fell off first time I went to use these.</li>
            <li> many different styles of buffers and files like pictured.</li>
            <li> All of the files lost their grit along the edges after the first 1-2 uses and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I am in heaven with so many different files.</li>
            <li> My first issue is that there was no way for me to identify what was what.</li>
            <li> There are so many different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to have so many different pieces.</li>
            <li> First of all, there is no i instructions to each nail file to know which is which.</li>
            <li> Some nail file do not file at all, others eat ur whole nail!</li>
            <li> Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li> Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  </li>
            <li> Most of the emery boards fell apart after a short time.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to ;-)</li>
            <li> Actually ruined my nails more than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first now</li>
            <li> Comparing the various grits, shapes, and colors, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can figure out exactly which sides are used for each purpose.  </li>
            <li> Even though I wash my files in soap and hot water, I was worried about transfer.</li>
            <li> My 2nd order of this set - just love it to pieces what with all its choices and the decent quality of the 15 items in it (and what&#x27;s not to love about the LOW PRICE?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good and low cost way to get multiple nail buffer files.</li>
            <li> I mean the price is great for how much stuff you get and how well it works.</li>
            <li> My nail files and buffers seem to lose their grit pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Nice little array of buffers.</li>
            <li> This came with a huge variety of different shapes, sizes and textures.  </li>
            <li> are 2 or 3 that i really like</li>
            <li> fast delivery too..</li>
            <li> Instructions would have been very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic value with several quality, multi-sided nail files/buffers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> Really like this set.</li>
            <li> know these were inexpensive but would have been much happier if they had all been functional...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown several of them away because the cheap paper underneath began to fray almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Buffing works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy having all the different varieties and sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need these for the shaping portion, as I&#x27;ve purchased crystal files.  </li>
            <li> looks like 80 grit sandpaper, really.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because it was much cheaper than buying things piecemeal at any store, but I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would have refunded this product if I paid that much.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was the ones I liked the most, which meant I didn&#x27;t get as much used from them as I might have</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had gotten this set for my friend who loves to do her nails just as much as I did</li>
            <li> Decent quality files for so much cheaper than the drug store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to buy single files/buffer for more money that last longer.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re really decent.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I purchased this kit was the rounded nail file/buffer and it did not come in the kit.</li>
            <li> super coarse-</li>
            <li> Had high hopes but glad it was an add on price that was half of what it is offered for on the Shany site but</li>
            <li> I am a novice when it comes to nail care and had high hopes for this assortment.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything high quality.</li>
            <li> So many to choose from and my little girl was stoked about the variety too.</li>
            <li> Much, much more than expected!!!</li>
            <li> This pack of nail files had every nail file you could ask for, plus a few more to stuff christmas stockings with.</li>
            <li> The different prints that it has also are fun...</li>
            <li> If you do your nails as much as I do (I have natural nails and can&#x27;t afford professional manicures, but I don&#x27;t need them as my nails grow well without stuff like Gel)</li>
            <li> The nail filers have a very soft grit.</li>
            <li> The buffers give a high shine no need for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Now I will never have to go on a wild goose hunt for a nail file ever again!</li>
            <li> Do not waste ur money!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting exactly what was in the picture necessary, but something resembling it.</li>
            <li> My nails are so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety from coarse grit files to ultra smooth buffers for high shine.</li>
            <li> Majority smooth buffers (Some almost appeared to have no special surface - just... paper-like?)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again, but there are so many files that I expect this to last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Great variety of files, average quality, but only one file had a design on it, the rest plain.</li>
            <li> These are not high end emory boards or buffers, several have fallen apart without much use - for $20 that would not be worth while to buy again.</li>
            <li> Would recommend people spend a little extra money because cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> Comes in a clear plastic container.</li>
            <li> TOO soft.</li>
            <li> wow do you get a lot,  </li>
            <li> so much of them, haven&#x27;t an idea on how to use them properly yet.</li>
            <li> There was one file with glitter on it, my friends 12 year old loves it.</li>
            <li> Quite surprised with the amount that came in this box....</li>
            <li> Too coarse/harsh for natural nails&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to understand this whole nail/cut/file/shape/buff.  </li>
            <li> -8 sided:&lt;br /&gt;2 blocks (1 marked, 1</li>
            <li> They will not hold up as well as your more expensive files, but they are worth the investment.</li>
            <li> For the amount of files included it was worth the price, however only 3 or 4 of them were actually usable</li>
            <li> but most are such poor quality that it&#x27;s not even worth it.  </li>
            <li> so I had to rehome them, but having fun trying out the other things</li>
            <li> (normally they last a lot longer).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy new nail files for several years!</li>
            <li> Even my hubs too one of the less colorful ones for himself.</li>
            <li> good for both natural and artificial nails.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the way the products were presented in this plain, cheap plastic box thing.  </li>
            <li> Buffers wear out pretty quickly, but with this set I will not have to run out to purchase another, well at least for a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> Even if some are for buffing, I&#x27;m not really sure what such a smooth surface would buff???</li>
            <li> They were ok but there were about 2 broken ones when it came</li>
            <li> most of the items are poorly constructed and falling apart after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> There was very little overlap in products and every item is useful.</li>
            <li> Not sure that all of them will be totally useful</li>
            <li> I agree with others the glitter makes some of the files more annoying than useful.  </li>
            <li> Also the hard plastic files have the file paper stuck on like a sticker and were all peeling off right out of the box.</li>
            <li> There was only one buffer with very coarse grit on two sides, the other 2 sides are usable for natural nails.</li>
            <li> Sure there are a number of files, but they are very poor  </li>
            <li> The long ones come in different color and only three of them are filers.</li>
            <li> you get a lot, but they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> These will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> long boards, one oval, one</li>
            <li> long (marked)&lt;br /&gt;1 plasticy&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Such a wide variety of patterns and buffers and filers.</li>
            <li> i got a twisted style one too was so excited when these came in</li>
            <li> Without closeups of each individual file, it&#x27;s hard to directly compare what I received.  </li>
            <li> Now I have buffing equipment and files for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Now I have buffing equipment and files for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Definitely not at a high price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about what I expected for the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> Colors vary from what is shown and I expected that.</li>
            <li> but it was to be expected.</li>
            <li> They are the type files that can only be used a few times and then you have to throw them away.</li>
            <li> It includes a wide variety as well.</li>
            <li> This amount of files and buffers may be overkill to some people, but for someone like myself that tends to my nails carefully and often, this set is invaluable.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Plenty of options in this low priced set to tame those nails for months to come.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the files similar to what I usually use and noticed that the layers were coming apart.</li>
            <li> was looking for other files for my nails and came across them and ordered</li>
            <li> The larger files are usually sold for $6-8 each.  </li>
            <li> I did have one that already fell apart so not sure about the overall quality</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as durable as some other pieces I&#x27;ve purchased, but I&#x27;d recommend them anyway for the price.</li>
            <li> but i have only had them for a few months and have already had to throw two away!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I ordered Shany products and they all have sucks.</li>
            <li> If you bought all these in a store you would pay 10 times the amount and get half the quality.</li>
            <li> I know this is a assortment of files but half of them have no file to them</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use half of them</li>
            <li> A little of this, a little of that.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> this set is definitely not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got through nail files like crazy and this set has enough for me to last awhile.</li>
            <li> Now, I keep some at my office, some in my home office and a few chosen ones in my car, too...</li>
            <li> And no, they don&#x27;t wear out after a few uses, either...</li>
            <li> I would say that this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> quite a few multi side buffers even a curved one i reccommend to anyone needing a file and buffer set and at this price its a steal</li>
            <li> The heavy duty nail files I gave to my niece.  </li>
            <li> I guess for the price, I got a few files that will work, so in all</li>
            <li> Poor quality but expected from price</li>
            <li> beware :/</li>
            <li> I have never had this issue with the files I usually pruchase.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure the quality is there.</li>
            <li> as some others I have purchased in the past,</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for in that some of the items are not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Not very good...</li>
            <li> hourglass shaped, hard plastic with boards glued on (shape, buff, and shine)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Any 1 of these items would be at least a couple of dollars in a retail store.  </li>
            <li> these are incredibly poor quality.</li>
            <li> Because of the somewhat poor quality I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> few bad quality ones</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this bundle.</li>
            <li> some of these were useless</li>
            <li> but they are not rigid making them difficult to use.</li>
            <li> But the two actual file I got were TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> One of the nail files is covered in glittery hearts on one side and is useless as a file on that side.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and i run through them like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buffing my nails like crazy.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews - I was afraid I would not like this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of Shany products, but this one was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Plastic Medium sized (the 3 pictured together) are so awkwardly shaped they&#x27;re not user-friendly</li>
            <li> Perhaps a got a bad pack..</li>
            <li> so how bad can it be.</li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated trying to find a nail file to use on my kids nails.  </li>
            <li> Horrible quality (peeled after 1 use)</li>
            <li> Awful quality!</li>
            <li> The files all smelled terrible and like chemicals upon opening.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> you get a lot, but they don&#x27;t last long. very cheap, and i run through them like crazy. fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter to put in her xmas stocking.  It&#x27;s about what I expected for the money I spent.  She&#x27;ll enjoy it and her sister will steal some of them.</li>
            <li> Most of the choices in the box were levels of grit I would not have chosen. TOO soft. Felt like I got a box of leftovers.</li>
            <li> Good price for everything you get.</li>
            <li> My 2nd order of this set - just love it to pieces what with all its choices and the decent quality of the 15 items in it (and what&#x27;s not to love about the LOW PRICE?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why a 2nd order? Now, I keep some at my office, some in my home office and a few chosen ones in my car, too... at this price, you can afford to!!! And no, they don&#x27;t wear out after a few uses, either... they&#x27;re really decent.</li>
            <li> I like Shany, I do.  I have ordered their polishes, and now their nail buffers and files.  Great variety, something for everyone.  A little of this, a little of that.  Some of them are super adorable.  My only issue is the way the products were presented in this plain, cheap plastic box thing.  I would have loved a little case, or something.  Also, no directions or even explanations as to what the items are, that would have been super nice.  I will order again when needed, and hopefully they will have made some packaging and direction improvements.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the price. I mean the price is great for how much stuff you get and how well it works. It works great, makes my nails shiny for days! So I recommend that you get this because you are saving money and getting so many useful things in it!</li>
            <li> Really nice variety for the price.  Cute designs.  Multiple functions for filing.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this bundle.</li>
            <li> Poor quality but expected from price, nail files came unglued</li>
            <li> these are incredibly poor quality. Most have either no grit and some have way too much grit. They are essentially a bunch of sticks for smoothing out nails that are already filed.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality (peeled after 1 use) but price is good so that earns another star.</li>
            <li> Love the variety. Will order another set.</li>
            <li> Great variety of shapes and sizes of nail files and buffers. These should last me a good while.</li>
            <li> Some fell apart and were melted together... Sand paper fell off first time I went to use these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal! But I feel like there are more buffer than filers. The long ones come in different color and only three of them are filers. Some of the multi-sided block has filer side so I guess that&#x27;s good. But overall, this is a great deal and plus they are so cute!</li>
            <li> This is a great box of filers and buffers. There was very little overlap in products and every item is useful. I will definitely be buying another for gifts.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Love how many tools come in this package.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year and thought it was average/decent for the price which was 7.95.  I woud buy it again for that price, as I came here to do, free shipping and all - but for $20? These are not high end emory boards or buffers, several have fallen apart without much use - for $20 that would not be worth while to buy again.</li>
            <li> Quantity Buy, beware, no quality. Sure there are a number of files, but they are very poor  quality and you will likely get just a couple of uses out of each file.</li>
            <li> wow do you get a lot,  This is a Hugh amount I could of supplied the nail salon  Great everything in it.  Very pleased Shipped quick</li>
            <li> its not horrible...and to no ones fault you get what you pay for. Would not buy again. Its just light paper. advise just go to the store and buy the 2 sided ones even if you buy more than one. Trust me thank you anyway seller, buyer beware :/</li>
            <li> many different styles of buffers and files like pictured. i got a twisted style one too was so excited when these came in i put my favorite one in my purse. and the purple block one is great for filing a lot of acrylic nails...</li>
            <li> a good variety of cheap files.  This is a good option for me because my grand daughters always think they need files and then they disappear The quality is not that great, but if you are like my household and need lots of files because they all get lost, this is for you. They will not hold up as well as your more expensive files, but they are worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I purchased this kit was the rounded nail file/buffer and it did not come in the kit. While I understand that I will receive an assortment, I still expect the kit to have the same kind of nail files and buffers shown included. Colors vary from what is shown and I expected that. I received some really cute ones with owl design, others were not my taste but it was to be expected. Quality is not overly great, and I&#x27;ve already used up a few of them (normally they last a lot longer). Because of the somewhat poor quality I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Much, much more than expected!!! I had purchased 2 thinking that I would need 2....not the case!! Very good nail files!!</li>
            <li> I received a lot in the package but most didn&#x27;t work more than once before falling apart. The emery boards all separated from the the middle cushion.</li>
            <li> They were ok but there were about 2 broken ones when it came&lt;br /&gt;there are 2 or 3 that i really like&lt;br /&gt;a few bad quality ones&lt;br /&gt;and the rest are ok&lt;br /&gt;i bought it when it was cheaper $13-ish&lt;br /&gt;but now at $20 i would not buy it again</li>
            <li> All of the files lost their grit along the edges after the first 1-2 uses and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li> My nail files and buffers seem to lose their grit pretty fast. That&#x27;s why it just made sense to pick up this assortment of 15 nail files and buffers. It comes with some really cute and useful styles for one low price. The last 7 sided buffer I purchased cost 4 dollars alone and this pack included that plus 14 others. Also, since I probably won&#x27;t be using them all anytime soon, they will make cute additions to stockings or gift baskets during the holidays. Bonus!</li>
            <li> A nice variety of files and buffers. But several were scratched looking or peeled looking upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I love it! Exactly as described. Great delivery!</li>
            <li> If you bought all these in a store you would pay 10 times the amount and get half the quality. Thank you SHANY for making such great products</li>
            <li> Lots of stuff here, was fun going through it. Some things appear to be for acrylics so I had to rehome them, but having fun trying out the other things, they all seem to work well. Seems like it would be an excellent gift for a teenage girl :-)</li>
            <li> I am in heaven with so many different files. nks for he fast delivery too..</li>
            <li> The daughter and wife seem to love them.</li>
            <li> I am a novice when it comes to nail care and had high hopes for this assortment. My first issue is that there was no way for me to identify what was what. Instructions would have been very helpful. I tried one of the files similar to what I usually use and noticed that the layers were coming apart. I have never had this issue with the files I usually pruchase.  I would say that this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price I paid for them- was looking for other files for my nails and came across them and ordered</li>
            <li> WOW! so much of them, haven&#x27;t an idea on how to use them properly yet. I have time. loving it.</li>
            <li> I throw away and lose nail tools so for me these are perfect -- they do the job and don&#x27;t cost a lot. I also can be generous giving them away to friends in need.</li>
            <li> For the amount of files included it was worth the price, however only 3 or 4 of them were actually usable</li>
            <li> This was such a great value. I was afraid that the quality might not be very good because the price was so good but the quality is excellent. Great buy!</li>
            <li> So many files for such a great price. Decent quality files for so much cheaper than the drug store. I won&#x27;t have to buy new nail files for several years! Thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for in that some of the items are not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Any 1 of these items would be at least a couple of dollars in a retail store.  The larger files are usually sold for $6-8 each.  This is a fantastic value with several quality, multi-sided nail files/buffers.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly. Every things in great shape and brand new. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for the price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These files are great! Cute designs and colors but also very functional.  Comes in a lovely clear box to keep them all organized.  Now I will never have to go on a wild goose hunt for a nail file ever again!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I like to do our toes on girls night.  This came with a huge variety of different shapes, sizes and textures.  And they are fun looking.  Great gift for any teenage girl!</li>
            <li> They come apart, Need better glue.</li>
            <li> They are nice but not that good quality but they are good  cause they are cheap</li>
            <li> I am officially done with Shany products. I have a beauty channel on Youtube so I wanted get a set of files since  I was nail designs on short nails. I ordered this product, it was delivered quickly, the nail files are pretty girly and cute, just how I like them. When it came time to use them, I realized that they sucked! They are the type files that can only be used a few times and then you have to throw them away. This is the third time I ordered Shany products and they all have sucks.</li>
            <li> used them for stocking stuffers at Christmas and all the girls loved them  so cute</li>
            <li> Nice selection and you can pretty easily figure out how you&#x27;re supposed to use them if they&#x27;re not labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, a lot of mine came stuck together and peeled off when I tried to separate them. Could only use about 4 of the things in the box, everything else was sticky or ruined.</li>
            <li> This pack of nail files had every nail file you could ask for, plus a few more to stuff christmas stockings with. I am very happy with this purchase, and recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I really like this set. There are so many different ones to choose from. I let my husband pick what he wanted out of them. I don&#x27;t like anyone else using my file and there are plenty to share. These will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The packaging was really nice, and some of the files are too cute to use. It includes a wide variety as well.</li>
            <li> some of these were useless</li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated trying to find a nail file to use on my kids nails.  He seems to grow claws like Wolverine.  Plenty of options in this low priced set to tame those nails for months to come.</li>
            <li> So many to choose from and my little girl was stoked about the variety too. Even my hubs too one of the less colorful ones for himself. A purchase I am definitely happy with.</li>
            <li> This amount of files and buffers may be overkill to some people, but for someone like myself that tends to my nails carefully and often, this set is invaluable.  It has everything I could ever want.  Once again, I am happy with a Shany product.  If you do your nails as much as I do (I have natural nails and can&#x27;t afford professional manicures, but I don&#x27;t need them as my nails grow well without stuff like Gel) then you will appreciate these items.  Buffers wear out pretty quickly, but with this set I will not have to run out to purchase another, well at least for a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again, but there are so many files that I expect this to last me a long time!</li>
            <li> It comes with a lot of buffers and files. Basically all the essentials. Would recommend. Especially for someone getting a lot of use out of their files.</li>
            <li> This was such a good price, I was surprised by how many nail products were in this container! They range from buffers to files and blocks. They are brightly colored and come in many different forms. I&#x27;ve shared many with my daughter and mom. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome kit that I&#x27;m still using months later. It&#x27;s great for starters or just anyone who likes to do their nails at home, the quality is great and you get almost everything you need to do your nails!</li>
            <li> Many many files included.  Great value.  Gave some away even as a gift, so it&#x27;s been a win win kind of purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get my nails done, I don&#x27;t go to salons. So when I saw this kit, I grabbed it. My sister explained what everything was for. I just needed clipper and some polish. Nice little kit with more than I needed, would probably make a cute gift. I gave it to my sister after I used it for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Just what you expect; a bunch of files and buffers in various shapes and colors. Comes in a clear plastic container. I added them as a gift for a teenager with a bunch of nail polishes and such. She loved it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be needing nail files for a while. I love the variety, this is a good way to find out which nail file types works best for you.</li>
            <li> Well packaged with cute designs and pattern but I&#x27;m not sure the quality is there. Many of the pieces in the kit are what I believe are 180/220 buffers but they are not rigid making them difficult to use. At first I thought they were just foam packaging! Also the hard plastic files have the file paper stuck on like a sticker and were all peeling off right out of the box. Say it&#x27;s more like a $5.00 value. But cute!</li>
            <li> Huge variety, all nice stuff. Didn&#x27;t expect it to have so many different pieces. I love them all so far.</li>
            <li> a lot of stuff for little cash, great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> Great deal.  And you can use everything in it .  Try it and you will agree .</li>
            <li> First of all, there is no i instructions to each nail file to know which is which. Some nail file do not file at all, others eat ur whole nail! Not worth it! Do not waste ur money! Revlon brand is better</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this set of files and buffers. There are a number of styles to suit your needs. You definitely cannot beat it for the price. The 4-sided, curved buffer is my favorite so far. It shapes my nails for me! The designs are super cute, too.</li>
            <li> Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  Good value for the money. Many different styles, I haven&#x27;t used all of them.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Most of the emery boards fell apart after a short time.  A waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not all the sides are labeled on every file, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s worth it!  I&#x27;ve been buffing my nails like crazy.</li>
            <li> Most the files fell apart after fist use! Awful quality!</li>
            <li> What a great set of nail files and buffers.  Good quality at a very reasonable price.  Would make an awesome gift for a tween or teen.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This had everything and more anyone needs to shape/smooth nails.  One at home and one at the office along with the nail growth products from Amazon and I&#x27;ll be modeling my hands in magazines before I know it!</li>
            <li> Sure I didn&#x27;t need all these nail files but they were very cheap! They&#x27;re made well too. Would order again but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to ;-)</li>
            <li> Really like this set. Not only is it pretty to look at and feminine but also good value for money. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that I have not used everything yet.</li>
            <li> I could do without all the glittery ones that crud all over the place, but for the most part, this was a nice set of nail files.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these one for me and one for  a friend as part of her birthday gift, she loved it. My friend wanted to buy more for Christmas gifts but they were out</li>
            <li> This was another good choice for me . . . there is enough variety to find just what one needs. This set added the finishing touch for what I need for nail care. As advertised and with a plastic container that keeps them neat. Yes, I do have a case that I prefer for regular use but I don&#x27;t need easy access to all of them! You&#x27;ll probably find your favorites in this assortment! Quality/cost efficient, recommended and granddaughter approved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the &#x27;Girlie&#x27; mini emery boards ( 12 in a pack) for an &#x27;anytime/any place&#x27; quick fix. .</li>
            <li> This is a good and low cost way to get multiple nail buffer files. If you need something like this, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Not of the greatest quality, but I also have really strong nails. Worth it, though.</li>
            <li> Price was cheap but so are these nail files.  Actually ruined my nails more than anything else.  Would recommend people spend a little extra money because cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> Nice little array of buffers. I&#x27;m happy with the variety. Has everything I need.</li>
            <li> The files in this kit hold up for about three uses each. It&#x27;s worth it to buy single files/buffer for more money that last longer.</li>
            <li> Just got the package in yesterday. One of the files fell apart just taking it out the Shany package....</li>
            <li> I started using one of the times today and it can apart already smh</li>
            <li> After reading reviews - I was afraid I would not like this set. There is a wide variety from coarse grit files to ultra smooth buffers for high shine. 14 of the 15 pieces are usable for my nails. There was one file with glitter on it, my friends 12 year old loves it. There was only one buffer with very coarse grit on two sides, the other 2 sides are usable for natural nails.</li>
            <li> I know this is a assortment of files but half of them have no file to them what so ever. Even if some are for buffing, I&#x27;m not really sure what such a smooth surface would buff??? They are cute and I do enjoy and use weekly the ones that are actually for filing.</li>
            <li> Three of them were damaged -- the file/buffer part was peeling away from the plastic they were glued to.&lt;br /&gt;I know these were inexpensive but would have been much happier if they had all been functional...</li>
            <li> I LOVE the variety of files! This is the perfect kit for a nail salon to give each manicurist, or as a gift for the COMPLETE manicure set. Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Between all the variety you are bound to find something that works so-so.  I plan on giving these away and purchasing something of better quality.  I do my own nails a lot and these aren&#x27;t quite quality enough.  They look and feel of good quality, but the sand paper/buffing material are not.  They wear too quickly.</li>
            <li> Quite surprised with the amount that came in this box.... I love it thanks!</li>
            <li> Seemed lika a good deal, but the surfaces of the files are mostly glue with very little grit. They wear out very quickly. I&#x27;ve thrown several of them away because the cheap paper underneath began to fray almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of nail files with fun patterns.  I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t run out any time soon! I did have one that already fell apart so not sure about the overall quality but I think they&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li> There is a very nice assortment here for the price and it allows you to try out the different styles of emery boards/blocks and see if one suits your personal preference better than another.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Pay close attention to what you&#x27;re getting. I couldn&#x27;t use most of it.</li>
            <li> nice varied selection</li>
            <li> Good assortment of files.</li>
            <li> rich rich rich in nail buffers!!! So many, so many different sizes. Very useful, some have more sides than others.</li>
            <li> NO COMPLAINTS HERE DAUGHTER WAS HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. ..USES IT REGULARLY</li>
            <li> Well they look cute but the first one fell apart on first use. Hoping that the redt of them make it through more than one go....</li>
            <li> fantastic files and buffers very pretty great assortment quite a few multi side buffers even a curved one i reccommend to anyone needing a file and buffer set and at this price its a steal i suggest you buy more than one cause the price given may increase over time</li>
            <li> Excellent!  This is a total bargain!  The number of files you get...including &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; ones...for the price ~ you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loved these. This package has a huge variety of buffer pads and files. I used them myself to give my nails a good buff. After trying this pack you will probably find a file and buffer that you want to use on a regular basis but for a someone who is still developing a nail care regime this pack is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Great varity of files, buffers, blocks.I received everything as shown in the photo. Good quality. I will be buying this again x</li>
            <li> Great variety in this set. Works quite well.</li>
            <li> The buffers are all nice, but I also needed a nail file. I didn&#x27;t get any. Perhaps a got a bad pack.. But the two actual file I got were TERRIBLE.  Most of the block buffers also had ZERO grit to them.  So, i got a bunch of buffers that just work for shine. Nothing to smooth any ridges. Honestly, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety for manicures!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Some of the files are low-quality. Two of the buffers were stuck together and I had to pull them apart. Now they are damaged. One of the nail files is covered in glittery hearts on one side and is useless as a file on that side. Another of the multisided file/buffers was peeling and damaged.</li>
            <li> You can never have too many nail files, and this is a great collection!</li>
            <li> The nail filers have a very soft grit.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great price and a nice assortment</li>
            <li> Great variety of files, average quality, but only one file had a design on it, the rest plain. I wasn&#x27;t expecting exactly what was in the picture necessary, but something resembling it. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of Shany products, but this one was disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and work great!! I use them for gifts and in raffle baskets for Jamberry!</li>
            <li> nail files are cheap looking and wear easily.</li>
            <li> When I received the kit the files were peeling apart and therefore will not work.  I agree with others the glitter makes some of the files more annoying than useful.  Had high hopes but glad it was an add on price that was half of what it is offered for on the Shany site but truthfully even with a count of 15 they weren&#x27;t worth 50 cents a piece like priced.  The free emory boards you get at parades and from politicians are better.</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars but some of the items do not have a number nor a package label so I do not know what they are used for when doing my nails.  The buffers give a high shine no need for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> This was a great value for me.  I do not polish my nails anymore.  Haven&#x27;t for years.  Buffing works very well for me.  Being able to get this pkg for this price was wonderful.  There were enough buffers in here to last a bit.  The heavy duty nail files I gave to my niece.  It is a great value.</li>
            <li> most of the items are poorly constructed and falling apart after 2-3 uses. I like the multiple sided buffing boards they work great!! However they are not holding up well either.</li>
            <li> You get lots of files and buffers for the price but most are such poor quality that it&#x27;s not even worth it.  The files all smelled terrible and like chemicals upon opening.</li>
            <li> Love this! Some very cool and interesting designs. Very useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great value set. They&#x27;re not as durable as some other pieces I&#x27;ve purchased, but I&#x27;d recommend them anyway for the price. I can always find something when I need it.</li>
            <li> Girls were very excited to receive these as part of their goody bag for attending my sister&#x27;s bachelorette party!  Very happy with this assortment!</li>
            <li> The files and buffers are excellent quality, and the variety is great!  Inexpensive and everything you could ask for.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! I enjoy having all the different varieties and sizes to choose from. There&#x27;s something for every file job you can think of.</li>
            <li> amazing number of nail files for the money! I won&#x27;t have to buy nail files for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> Got this on a whim for my wife, she loved it, lots of brownie points for me.&lt;br /&gt;This item is cute, and functional, for the price I feel like I got more than my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> ALL of these are CHEAP!!! i was so excited to get these because there are so many!! but i have only had them for a few months and have already had to throw two away! i dont use them often, but after one use i had to throw away one of them because it just fell apart!!!!!! this set is definitely not worth the money! delivery was ok, and packaging was alright.. but i still would never buy again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first now I can&#x27;t stop ordering. My clients love them!! Nothing to complain about. I&#x27;ve order six of these for myself and very satisfied. I&#x27;m glad to see they are selling more. I had to add to wishlist in order to see the availability. Thanks.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Variety of Shapes &amp; Sizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Majority smooth buffers (Some almost appeared to have no special surface - just... paper-like?)&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic Medium sized (the 3 pictured together) are so awkwardly shaped they&#x27;re not user-friendly&lt;br /&gt;- Not for shaping nails&lt;br /&gt;- Sanding Files felt like they&#x27;d be best suited for acrylic/artificial nails - Too coarse/harsh for natural nails&lt;br /&gt;- Glittery designs - Not only are they unusable but the glitter will linger and haunt you for weeks.</li>
            <li> Great products, great price, and being able to get them all in a bundle is excellent.  Beats buying them in the store one at a time.</li>
            <li> Now I have buffing equipment and files for a very long time. Very good quality.I love ii! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great variety, love this package!!</li>
            <li> FAntastic deal for all you get.</li>
            <li> nice big selection of every kind of buffer and files! very pleased with the variety of choices offered</li>
            <li> Honestly,  I grew up in a house with 4 boys, I was the only girl and my mom was never around so I&#x27;m So HAPPY most of these are labeled on what to do lol! I wouldn&#x27;t know what was what if they weren&#x27;t! Perfect!  So happy I ordered this! My nails are so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Nice selection of handy files.</li>
            <li> There are too many polishers in the group. Need more files. Also one of the files is already falling apart.</li>
            <li> Works well and you received a lot for the money.</li>
            <li> nice assortment of buffers and files. good for both natural and artificial nails. I am very pleased with this purchase. It arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Arrived today.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy another nail file again.  I&#x27;m just starting to understand this whole nail/cut/file/shape/buff.  For what I paid, $8, this pack was worth it.  When I tried to buy a fine buffer at the store, each one was $4.  I&#x27;m way too cheap for that.  I don&#x27;t really need these for the shaping portion, as I&#x27;ve purchased crystal files.  Comparing the various grits, shapes, and colors, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can figure out exactly which sides are used for each purpose.  Some of my shine sides do have paper stuck to them, probably to protect that side.  Without closeups of each individual file, it&#x27;s hard to directly compare what I received.  Some of the shapes may be different than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I received, with my categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buff and shine:&lt;br /&gt;1 hourglass shaped, hard plastic with boards glued on (shape, buff, and shine)&lt;br /&gt;1 short block&lt;br /&gt;2 long boards, one oval, one rectangular&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-8 sided:&lt;br /&gt;2 blocks (1 marked, 1 not)&lt;br /&gt;1 long (marked)&lt;br /&gt;1 plasticy&lt;br /&gt;2 4-sided plasticy files (1 marked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 normal&lt;br /&gt;1 glitter&lt;br /&gt;1 super coarse- looks like 80 grit sandpaper, really.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because it was much cheaper than buying things piecemeal at any store, but I guess you get what you pay for.  They&#x27;re really, really cheap and flimsy.  As I was taking them out of the box, the glue on many of the pieces had not done its job of holding the abrasive side and the foam side together, so they&#x27;re falling apart.  I guess for the price, I got a few files that will work, so in all, I made out better than paying $1+ per file like I would have at the store.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality Thanks A Lot</li>
            <li> Not the best quality products or anything but let&#x27;s be honest--you know what you&#x27;re paying for and they&#x27;re just nail files so how bad can it be. I liked this for the buffers and there are several varieties.</li>
            <li> Great Purchase, Thank You!</li>
            <li> very good quality all the girls in family enjoyed them and the variety to choose from</li>
            <li> Fun, versatile set. Good buy.</li>
            <li> What is really great is that I can use specific files for my both of my feet and not have to worry about transferring fungus. Even though I wash my files in soap and hot water, I was worried about transfer. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. You will have a file for every purse, bathroom and night table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the file blocks, so can&#x27;t comment as to their quality or effectiveness, but I will experiment with them. Who knows, I might like them.</li>
            <li> One use and it was of no use after that</li>
            <li> Any shape one needs. I am happy with the ones I am using so far.</li>
            <li> Not very good...but it does the job. You get what you pay for so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything high quality. However, if you are expecting some kind of quality such as a 2-3+ times use... This is not the product for you. Definitely not at a high price. I believe I paid about 7 dollars. I would def not pay 15. I would have refunded this product if I paid that much. Just saying.</li>
            <li> Such a wide variety of patterns and buffers and filers. Super cute and they all work so well!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use half of them</li>
            <li> I really like these for the most part but the package I received had some damaged files.  Unfortunately it was the ones I liked the most, which meant I didn&#x27;t get as much used from them as I might have but this is still the best set I have found and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Now I have buffing equipment and files for a very long time. Very good quality.I love ii! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are not as high quality (smooth filing) as some others I have purchased in the past, but I can&#x27;t believe the price on this.  Definitely worth the $8 I paid.  Not sure that all of them will be totally useful (don&#x27;t love the curved ones as much), but in general an amazing assortment, and I like the fact that they are labelled right on the items themselves, so you have a good idea what order to use them in.  The buffers are better than the filers.  Shipped out and received super fast, too.</li>
            <li> Whatever kind of file you like...it&#x27;s in here. We (my daughter and I) found everything we wanted and more in this set!</li>
            <li> the nail files fell apart in use but the blocks are nice</li>
            <li> I had gotten this set for my friend who loves to do her nails just as much as I did and she told me that she loved it so I decided to get me a set as well! I am so glad that I did get this set. I got through nail files like crazy and this set has enough for me to last awhile. The different prints that it has also are fun...the only reason why I took a star off is because on some of the files, some of the file part was peeling of the stick already...but nothing you can&#x27;t fix with glue...other than that...I love this set and would continue buying it for friends. A good price for plenty of different kine nail files. :)</li>
