            <li>The delivery was great.</li>
            <li>The product however did not work out as I thought it would, it was ok at best</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of good things anout Exotique Butter Creme Hydrator, so I decided to order a jar.</li>

            <li>USE wisely.</li>
            <li>THIS IS GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li>In order to get good results you must purchase the hydration, jelle styler, and aragon oil.</li>
            <li>Not that great of a moisturizer I&#x27;ve had a lot better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is wonderfully hydrated and has a very nice scent.</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great styler for fine or curly hair to do twist sets and as added moisture for kinky textures after using the Creme Jelly Styler.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>Now the product is really nice for styling</li>
            <li>I liked this product paired with the creme jelle styler.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>My twist outs were darn near PERFECT with this.</li>
            <li>My hair was  very curly when I used it and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from this for many years.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about, but not absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li>I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I will order this item in a 8oz size because I will be sure to keep using it.</li>
            <li>Buy it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Made doing hair more pleasurable for the girls.</li>
            <li>I just love how this product makes my hair feel...</li>
            <li>I love the manipulator way more.</li>
            <li>This product is great for twisting and is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I thought, ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure It will get better throughout the day, as the day went by, my hair got kinkier and kinkier, and let me mind you that I have the most fine curly baby hair you can think of.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft but not greasy and also the product has no smell to it which is great.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrives quickly</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon and reordered because it woks very very very good on my dry natural hair.</li>
            <li>The product surely hydrates your natural hair as stated that it will.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think the product worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love all of entwine products for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>After so many glowing reviews I. Guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>I apply this product right after I shampoo while my hair is damp to seal in the moisture, and also before blowdrying or doing a twistout.</li>
            <li>This will be the first time I returned a hair product, this isn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
            <li>Definitely on the pricy side; but I would pay the money because I have not found another product that provides the excellent curl definition with little to no water.  </li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s perfect because it dissolves into the hair without a heavy buildup or leaving the hair looking white.  </li>
            <li>This product was only ok for me.</li>
            <li>and I was able to twirl the ends of my twist around my fingers and got an instant defined curl.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the manufacturer says that it will do.</li>
            <li>I was in shock when I first started using this product because like alot of hair products</li>
            <li>It feels nice and goes on smoothly but for that price I at least expected my scalp to feel like what was described in so many reviews!</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft with it and there is no greasy</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for creating this product.</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing and also works very well to detangle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just learning about making the transition and this product has help me so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this stuff.</li>
            <li>But my hair felt very sticky and it took about 3 days to dissipate.</li>
            <li>This product together with the styling Jelle work really good on my thick 4C hair.  </li>
            <li>But the price is too high, so I use it sparingly...</li>
            <li>I will say that, but I&#x27;m having to add my own shea butter or shine so my hair doesn&#x27;t look dull.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Very moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Live this product.</li>
            <li>I usually never review products</li>
            <li>The product is nice but it dried my hair out when my hair was dry.</li>
            <li>Wow, I could not believe how moisturized this butter made my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair now stays soft and hydrated for 2-3 days without having to reapply it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far.)  </li>
            <li>Make going natural easier.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li>It can get through those tangles and it keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Both together did wonders for my hair and it felt soft and manageable at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I really have mixed feelings about this product.  </li>
            <li>If you have natural hair this product is a must have....</li>
            <li>My hair came out soooo curly and soft, I will purchase again but</li>
            <li>I normally have large pieces of dry oatmeal looking pieces on my hairline and all throughout my scalp each morning.  </li>
            <li>It worked and for the first time my natural hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li>I definitely expected more from the item after viewing other reviews.</li>
            <li>OK, very small amount received for the cost..</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll get the large size because I will be using this regularly.  </li>
            <li>The next I couldn&#x27;t even comb my hair; I had to wash it gently with conditioner, untangling the knots that left on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money trying to find the right product.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have been using on my African american soft 4b hair twist outs it makes my hair soft and it holds my twist for almost two weeeks.</li>
            <li>It has a thick rich texture.  </li>
            <li>my scalp has no dry flakes.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning I had no dry scalp around my hairline or on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am newly natural and have tried several products for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>and I love this product because it does not have a heavy weighted down feeling that I get with other products.</li>

            <li> and I love this product because it does not have a heavy weighted down feeling that I get with other products.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be too thick for my hair.</li>
            <li> Used it to put in twist,and it was sooooo soft when I took them down.</li>
            <li> I just used a little and my hair stayed soft and moisturized..</li>
            <li> BUT IT DO COST TO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE !!</li>
            <li> At times during the extreme southern summer heat my hair has been dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel to dry</li>
            <li> I normally do not write a review, but I had to say something about this product.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough my hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, just sticky.</li>
            <li> (my hair is normally very dry).  </li>
            <li> The next day, I took off the flex rods, and my hair just felt so dense, heavy and un-manageable.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have honestly spent over $100 in hair care products to help me transition in less than a months time.</li>
            <li> Mother is black and father is half black/Japanese.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my hair is such of bad, unmanageable, wild state, ever in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had many prescriptions with awful side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m feeling about this product.  </li>
            <li> I currently have a prescription that works very well, however it smells terrible and is almost $200!   </li>
            <li> The texture of the product is a little thin -- I was expecting it to be somewhat &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Its going to get cold outside and this is now my go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I dont have thick hair</li>
            <li> The consistency is slightly thin</li>
            <li> Too expensive, no discernible difference in cheaper moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my order did not arrive until three weeks after my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I twisted my hair with flex rods and went to sleep.</li>
            <li> For about 3 days my hair shrunk really bad and looked weird.</li>
            <li> Also - this price is crazy - 4 oz for $20</li>
            <li> To me it stinks.  </li>
            <li> and then here on Amazon to see if I could find anyone else that thinks this stuff smells bad?  </li>
            <li> It smells like Bradford Pear trees when they are in bloom. :-(</li>
            <li> Worst product ever</li>
            <li> The seller for Entwine was downright horrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used in my hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Worst product ever and the seller took forever to deliver.</li>
            <li> OK, very small amount received for the cost.. No will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Wow, I could not believe how moisturized this butter made my hair. Used it to put in twist,and it was sooooo soft when I took them down. And still moisturized days later. I already repurchased it, but the bigger size.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with eczema and sebhorric dermatitis. I have suffered from this for many years. I&#x27;ve also had many prescriptions with awful side effects. I currently have a prescription that works very well, however it smells terrible and is almost $200!   I used about a fifty cent piece amount of the product and I rubbed it on my scalp between my braided extension cornrows and put on my satin cap before bed. When I woke up the next morning I had no dry scalp around my hairline or on my scalp. I normally have large pieces of dry oatmeal looking pieces on my hairline and all throughout my scalp each morning.  I was so amazed, its the end of the next day and my scalp has no dry flakes. I&#x27;m so HAPPY I could cry. My hair feels so soft but not greasy and also the product has no smell to it which is great. The consistency is slightly thin but really it&#x27;s perfect because it dissolves into the hair without a heavy buildup or leaving the hair looking white.  Thank you so much for creating this product.</li>
            <li> The product surely hydrates your natural hair as stated that it will. At times during the extreme southern summer heat my hair has been dry and brittle. Since using this product that has changed dramatically. My hair now stays soft and hydrated for 2-3 days without having to reapply it. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this product.  It moisturizes my hair without making my hair feel too greasy.  It absorbs quickly.  No mineral oil.  It arrives quickly (I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far.)  Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> This is one product to have in your regimen. It helps to aid in the sealing of moisture and locking it in place. It&#x27;s also a great styler for fine or curly hair to do twist sets and as added moisture for kinky textures after using the Creme Jelly Styler.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, no discernible difference in cheaper moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am newly natural and have tried several products for my dry hair. I have heard a lot of good things anout Exotique Butter Creme Hydrator, so I decided to order a jar. I got it within 3 days and tried and immediately fell in love with it!!! I am about to throw out everything else and only use this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked that the delivery was quick. loved the packaging of the product. The product however did not work out as I thought it would, it was ok at best so I don&#x27;t think the product worth the price. I doubt I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product was only ok for me. Nothing to write home about, but not absolutely horrible. I definitely expected more from the item after viewing other reviews.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my order did not arrive until three weeks after my purchase.  When I did receive it I was pleased. It has a thick rich texture.  No sticky residue and my curls lasted for day. I received several compliments.</li>
            <li> Now this item I LOVE!!! At first I thought it would be too thick for my hair. I dont have thick hair so some items are a problem. Mother is black and father is half black/Japanese. This product leaves my hair feeling amazing. Its going to get cold outside and this is now my go to moisturizer. I just seal it in with coconut oil (my fav). I will order this item in a 8oz size because I will be sure to keep using it.</li>
            <li> USE wisely. THIS IS GOOD STUFF. but use it wisely it&#x27;s pricey as hell!</li>
            <li> I usually never review products but I just had to review it! I received the product today and was eager to try it out! In an instant my hair felt moisturized and I was able to twirl the ends of my twist around my fingers and got an instant defined curl. I have honestly spent over $100 in hair care products to help me transition in less than a months time. After trying it today it looks like I know what my staple product will be for hydrating my hair! This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Love the results for my hair! but it too is pricey for the size of product. My hair loves it though.</li>
            <li> I have used the entwine manipulator. Since ordering it I tried finding it in local stores and couldn&#x27;t. I went to Amazon and reordered because it woks very very very good on my dry natural hair. My hair was  very curly when I used it and beautiful. I wanted to write this review because I am not being paid to write this. I just wanted y&#x27;all to know it is the bomb. Buy it you will love it. I went for 4 days just using the Eco jell waiting for for my entwine manipulator to arrive.</li>
            <li> Not that great of a moisturizer I&#x27;ve had a lot better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great to hydrating your hair without all the additional products. I use it with the crème jelly styler and it is a great combo. Make going natural easier.</li>
            <li> In order to get good results you must purchase the hydration, jelle styler, and aragon oil. I use it for my twist outs and it this product gives my curls great definition. My curls are soft and full of body.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing and also works very well to detangle. Even my children did not whine when I was combing their hair after apply it. It is a MUST have from now on in my household. Made doing hair more pleasurable for the girls.</li>
            <li> Live this product. Works very well for natural hair. Leaves the hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I started using this product two days ago and I can honestly say this is the best product I have ever used for my hair!!! I just used a little and my hair stayed soft and moisturized.. when i paired it with the creme jelly styler my hair came great!! it made my curls pop and they stayed for days.. i will defiantly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning about making the transition and this product has help me so much. It can get through those tangles and it keeps my hair soft. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money trying to find the right product. I can finally stop</li>
            <li> This is the only product that moisturizes my hair without leaving it greasy to the touch. I apply this product right after I shampoo while my hair is damp to seal in the moisture, and also before blowdrying or doing a twistout. This product works wonders on my hair type (Type 4) and I have yet to find anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have been using on my African american soft 4b hair twist outs it makes my hair soft and it holds my twist for almost two weeeks.</li>
            <li> I just love how this product makes my hair feel...Very moisturized and soft.  But the price is too high, so I use it sparingly...</li>
            <li> The product is nice but it dried my hair out when my hair was dry. For about 3 days my hair shrunk really bad and looked weird. Now the product is really nice for styling but you can&#x27;t apply it to your hair if you are planning to wear a fro 3 days later...bad idea for  me.</li>
            <li> This Entwine Butter Creme Hydrator is a great hair care product. It does exactly what the manufacturer says that it will do. My natural hair is wonderfully hydrated and has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I need moisture and that&#x27;s what I get.my hair stays moisturized for days. I was in shock when I first started using this product because like alot of hair products you think that it&#x27;s the one but you soon realize that it&#x27;s not,well not with entwine Moisture cream, you pay for it,and you get it.Give this a try and you will never stop using it![[ASIN:B003R3K8F4 &#x27;Indulgently Luxe&#x27; Exotique Butter-Creme Hydrator, 4oz.]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this stuff. I love the manipulator way more. It didn&#x27;t give me that moisture that everyone raves about.</li>
            <li> I liked this product paired with the creme jelle styler. Both together did wonders for my hair and it felt soft and manageable at the end of the day. I will definitely buy both again!</li>
            <li> No, the product does not keep hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is of medium length, and I did not have the curl definition as demonstrated.</li>
            <li> It worked and for the first time my natural hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I have type 4a,b hair (combination) and I love this product because it does not have a heavy weighted down feeling that I get with other products. It is a bit chalky; but it is very good.  Definitely on the pricy side; but I would pay the money because I have not found another product that provides the excellent curl definition with little to no water.  My hair is super soft with it and there is no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a definite must have in your regime.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really have mixed feelings about this product.  My twist outs were darn near PERFECT with this. But my hair felt very sticky and it took about 3 days to dissipate. Oddly enough my hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, just sticky. It didn&#x27;t leave a residue but my stylist could tell I had a lot of product in my hair when she washed it. Also - this price is crazy - 4 oz for $20 but I would splurge on this again. And a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I just received the product in the mail today.  After smelling it I decided to go on you tube and then here on Amazon to see if I could find anyone else that thinks this stuff smells bad?  To me it stinks.  It smells like Bradford Pear trees when they are in bloom. :-(</li>
            <li> I love all of entwine products for my natural hair. This product is great for twisting and is very hydrating. If you have natural hair this product is a must have....</li>
            <li> This product together with the styling Jelle work really good on my thick 4C hair.  My hair came out soooo curly and soft, I will purchase again but next time I&#x27;ll get the large size because I will be using this regularly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND IT DID A GREAT JOB ... BUT IT DO COST TO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE !!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair look shiny (my hair is normally very dry).  The texture of the product is a little thin -- I was expecting it to be somewhat &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;.  But overall, it does what it says it will do (imparts shine/moisture).</li>
            <li> Great product. The seller for Entwine was downright horrible. Never again.</li>
            <li> After so many glowing reviews I. Guess I expected more. It was just regular run of the mill moisturizer. It feels nice and goes on smoothly but for that price I at least expected my scalp to feel like what was described in so many reviews! The delivery was great.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write a review, but I had to say something about this product. This is the worst hair product I have ever used in my hair. So I bought the crème jelly styler and the exotique butter-crème hydrator. I washed and condition my hair and applied both as they recommended. I twisted my hair with flex rods and went to sleep. The next day, I took off the flex rods, and my hair just felt so dense, heavy and un-manageable.  I thought, ok. I&#x27;m sure It will get better throughout the day, as the day went by, my hair got kinkier and kinkier, and let me mind you that I have the most fine curly baby hair you can think of.  I&#x27;ve never seen my hair is such of bad, unmanageable, wild state, ever in my life. The next I couldn&#x27;t even comb my hair; I had to wash it gently with conditioner, untangling the knots that left on my hair. This will be the first time I returned a hair product, this isn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m feeling about this product.  it does give me moisture I will say that, but I&#x27;m having to add my own shea butter or shine so my hair doesn&#x27;t look dull.  I am going to give it another try by itself before I can truley know what it can do for me.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel to dry</li>
