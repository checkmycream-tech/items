            <li>2 more</li>
            <li>Fits well in most handbags.  </li>
            <li>This comb does a pretty good job teasing my hair.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t make a good part with the point.</li>
            <li>Fits well in your hand and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It also comes it easily.</li>
            <li>My hair stays too!also combs out easy.</li>
            <li>The end works well for seperating my fine hair</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to use, fits in my hand well and does what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>Excellent if you like to tease or backcomb your hair for a little volume and don&#x27;t want any breakage.  </li>
            <li>This little brush is awesome!</li>
            <li>: When teasing your hair, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t freshly washed.</li>
            <li>It worlds great to tease my hair just enough to add some volume to the root of hair.</li>
            <li>Such a great brush for teasing hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this brush so much</li>
            <li>I like to lightly tease the crown of my hair to make it a bit fuller</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very compact.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush and so glad I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Brush is super worth it!</li>
            <li>The color is a bit more orange in real life than in the picture.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quick.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me and makes it so quick and easy to add a little oomph to my doo!</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>(first time I&#x27;ve ever teased my hair was with this brush, so user error was involved!).</li>
            <li>Styling tip can be handy for getting hair back in place after you have been out in the wind.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush can get as much or as little volume/shape as you want!</li>
            <li>Used a rat tail comb for teasing before but this little comb is amazing for backcombing!</li>
            <li>BUT it is very gentle on the hair</li>
            <li>They all seem to work fine, BUT, if you are using a blow dryer and a teasing brush, like I do, get natural bristles.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s why I find it does good with the teasing for little effort on my part.</li>
            <li>I ended up using this as a regular brush because I still get a better tease from a rat tail comb.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon AddOns!</li>
            <li>Able to rat up the back</li>
            <li>It creates volume that last thanks to the boar bristles and the nylon longer bristles help keep it smooth and tangle free while teasing.</li>
            <li>but this brush really gives me fuller looking hair!</li>
            <li>but them smooth down the top, all with this brush.  </li>
            <li>The higher the hair, the closer to Jesus and this brush will take it as high as you want it to!  </li>
            <li>This brush is a godsend for those with fine hair or those who just simply care about breakage.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended</li>
            <li>looking - this brush if great for targeting specific areas because it&#x27;s so narrow.</li>
            <li>I use this allong with teasing powder and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works well to tease my hair (with hairspray of course) and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This brush works really well to give my hair</li>
            <li>It works as expected but I do wish that the point was more defined.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Teases, but not so much that I feel that it damages my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It works very well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair that tends to be flat.</li>
            <li>This brush works great to sleek back my thick hair for a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing and the pick feature at the end helps tame the ratiness without removing your tease!</li>
            <li>Solid product, bristles brush well; looks like it will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but the small plastic beads on the end of the white sticks break off rather quickly, making it a very scratchy brush...</li>
            <li>Love this little teasing brush.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s small, so easy to pack into my purse!</li>
            <li>Not hard on my hair either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stiffer brush with the bristles not being very soft or bendy.</li>
            <li>I have thin long fine hair and the brush works great for not only teasing but just regular brushing as well.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this does a better job than the comb, but not much better.  </li>
            <li>If you must use freshly washed hair, you&#x27;l want to get your hands on some dry shampoo, or, a texturizing spray.</li>
            <li>Long and pointy, but very thin and good for quick touch-ups during the day.  </li>
            <li>The brush part works great but the handle pick is a little too thick, making it cumbersome to use for hair seperation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a well constructed brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Soft to the hair and never gets tangled.</li>
            <li>and it really does a good job of back combing then smoothing over the teased hair without disturbing the look you are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>Blow dry hair first then use the teaser brush to create volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure HOW to rate a hair brush, but it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy getting a little &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; in my hair and this brush really works well to tease and fluff up</li>
            <li>Perfect small size for my very thin hair</li>
            <li>I will not be going back to a normal comb ever again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see this product updates, with a thin metal</li>
            <li>Brushes well but the end of the bristles are so Sharp and pointy, it scratches my scalp way too much that I avoid using it.</li>

            <li> Brushes well but the end of the bristles are so Sharp and pointy, it scratches my scalp way too much that I avoid using it.</li>
            <li> a long hair dude</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this brush for so long.</li>
            <li> I use it both for teasing and brushing my hair and it works really well on my thick hair!</li>
            <li> This has definitely been a lifesaver for my limp, no volume hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> If I could have chosen a minus star rating I would have because a one star it doesn&#x27;t deserve!</li>
            <li> and I can use it to tease extensions without totally destroying them.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it just a few rows wider, but this is not a huge issue.  </li>
            <li> She has very long, thick hair and the usual Conair teasing combs just weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> But once I figured out the proper way to tease my hair, I have been unable to put it down.</li>
            <li> not sure how it will go through thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even use it in my hair because the &amp;#34;boar bristles&amp;#34; are loose and would get in my hair and be difficult to get out.  </li>
            <li> Just hard to find.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to apply a lot of hair spray for it</li>
            <li> At least, that was my experience.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and its a game changer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on it.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting my hair to hold a tease, but using this comb in combination with lots of hair spray has helped a lot!</li>
            <li> You can  tease an entire strand or just at the hair base.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t go wrong if you have thinner hair.</li>

            <li> Best teasing brush I have found. Teases well without causing damage and it stays all day. I use this allong with teasing powder and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this brush!  It&#x27;s for teasing but I love to brush my hair with it because it makes my scalp feel &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.  My daughter came home from college and took it back with her so this is my second brush.</li>
            <li> Best teasing comb/brush I have found that works doesn&#x27;t knot hair and can comb out at end of day. Just hard to find.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another one with a plastic handle to compare.&lt;br /&gt;This one is superior.  Teases better and looks better.</li>
            <li> Love this little teasing brush. Perfect small size for my very thin hair and it really does a good job of back combing then smoothing over the teased hair without disturbing the look you are trying to achieve. The end works well for seperating my fine hair tho not sure how it will go through thicker hair. Have washed it a couple of times and no bristle damage or loss of bristles or weakening of the plastic bristles. It&#x27;s a stiffer brush with the bristles not being very soft or bendy. But that&#x27;s why I find it does good with the teasing for little effort on my part. Just can&#x27;t go wrong if you have thinner hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has always laid on my head at the roots. I bought this to tease my hair to get some awesome volume. It works well to tease my hair (with hairspray of course) and was very inexpensive. I do recommend this for anyone looking for that extra volume in their hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works really well to give my hair a pick me up of for going out Its a great styling too.  Not hard on my hair either.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy and well made addition to all my brushes and combs.  Works great for teasing or just gentle uplifting.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple of months ago, to help tease my hair when I want to wear an updo. It works as expected but I do wish that the point was more defined. You really can&#x27;t make a good part with the point. It&#x27;s pretty much useless. The brush itself is great. I&#x27;d love to see this product updates, with a thin metal point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When teasing your hair, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t freshly washed. You need to create a foundation in order to build height. Day old (or longer) hair is best. If you must use freshly washed hair, you&#x27;l want to get your hands on some dry shampoo, or, a texturizing spray.</li>
            <li> The Philips Tease brush is an excellent teasing brush with  boar bristles as wel as plastic ones for extra support. I use it both for teasing and brushing my hair and it works really well on my thick hair! I don&#x27;t leave the house without it :).</li>
            <li> yep I use this brush every day as my goto brush Im a long hair dude and I don&#x27;t bother to  tease my hair but this works good</li>
            <li> VERY pleased.  Used a rat tail comb for teasing before but this little comb is amazing for backcombing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.. I ordered another one for me and one for my mom and she also loves it!  I&amp;#34;m so glad I found this brush...my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> This brush is a godsend for those with fine hair or those who just simply care about breakage. I will not be going back to a normal comb ever again. It works to prevent breakage but still add volume.</li>
            <li> The brush part works great but the handle pick is a little too thick, making it cumbersome to use for hair seperation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a well constructed brush for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but the small plastic beads on the end of the white sticks break off rather quickly, making it a very scratchy brush...</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and its a game changer! Great quality brush can get as much or as little volume/shape as you want!</li>
            <li> I ended up using this as a regular brush because I still get a better tease from a rat tail comb. BUT it is very gentle on the hair and I can use it to tease extensions without totally destroying them. Not bad.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to add some volume to my hair and it works great. Took me a couple of times using it to get the best results (first time I&#x27;ve ever teased my hair was with this brush, so user error was involved!). But once I figured out the proper way to tease my hair, I have been unable to put it down. No complaints here. Excellent quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent if you like to tease or backcomb your hair for a little volume and don&#x27;t want any breakage.  Love it.  Fits well in your hand and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used to tease my hair with a fine-toothed comb.  In my opinion, this does a better job than the comb, but not much better.  I think the comb followed with hairspray would have provided the same results.</li>
            <li> I use these every day. I really like it. It worlds great to tease my hair just enough to add some volume to the root of hair. It was a great find.Thanks Amazon AddOns!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! The color is a bit more orange in real life than in the picture. This adds perfect volume thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This brush really does a great job of adding volume to my &amp;#34;baby-fine&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hair! Plus it&#x27;s small, so easy to pack into my purse! Love it!</li>
            <li> Teases, but not so much that I feel that it damages my hair. It also comes it easily. Some may not like that, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Such a great brush for teasing hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I have thin long fine hair and the brush works great for not only teasing but just regular brushing as well. Leaves hair shiny and no flyaways.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair that tends to be flat. I can poof my hair w/o having it look all ratty. You can  tease an entire strand or just at the hair base. Ergonomic to the head and in the hand. Nice feel. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. A must have.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome styling tool! It gives me the extra ooomph i want at my roots! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush. I use it everyday. My new favorite. I am so glad i bought it. It was shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Love this teasing comb! All of my friends even noticed and asked me what I use!</li>
            <li> I enjoy getting a little &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; in my hair and this brush really works well to tease and fluff up</li>
            <li> Brush is super worth it! Blow dry hair first then use the teaser brush to create volume. The bristles are great and creates awesome volume especially for bangs! Soft to the hair and never gets tangled.</li>
            <li> Teases my hair great without any damage.  Able to rat up the back but them smooth down the top, all with this brush.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to use, fits in my hand well and does what I need it to do.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I will never need another teasing comb. This is amazing and the pick feature at the end helps tame the ratiness without removing your tease!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure HOW to rate a hair brush, but it works fine for me.  I keep it in my handbag for those fix ups you might need during the day.  I like teasing brushes and have several.  They all seem to work fine, BUT, if you are using a blow dryer and a teasing brush, like I do, get natural bristles. The brushes with plastic bristles will soften with the heat and bend out of shape.  At least, that was my experience.</li>
            <li> This comb does a pretty good job teasing my hair. I have a hard time getting my hair to hold a tease, but using this comb in combination with lots of hair spray has helped a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought this for teasing my daughter&#x27;s hair for dance competitions. She has very long, thick hair and the usual Conair teasing combs just weren&#x27;t working. If I&#x27;d have had this thing in the 80s.... :)</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush and so glad I decided to give it a try.  I even pop it in my suitcase when I travel and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit but I can not for the life of me tease my own hair. This product works great for me and makes it so quick and easy to add a little oomph to my doo! I hardly have to apply a lot of hair spray for it does the job perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very compact. You can take it with you. It gives you that lift you need when you need it. Very highly recommended</li>
            <li> Brushes well but the end of the bristles are so Sharp and pointy, it scratches my scalp way too much that I avoid using it. Now it just sits there...</li>
            <li> I like this brush. For the price I paid for it, it does the job. I would definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> Just as described. I don&#x27;t tease my hair with it, but use it for a slim brush to carry in pack for occasional use. Works well for that. Solid product, bristles brush well; looks like it will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> This brush works great to sleek back my thick hair for a pony tail.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> This little brush is awesome! this can tease any hair no matter the texture. I have baby fine hair and it lasts all day! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this brush for so long.</li>
            <li> The higher the hair, the closer to Jesus and this brush will take it as high as you want it to!  This has definitely been a lifesaver for my limp, no volume hair.  It creates volume that last thanks to the boar bristles and the nylon longer bristles help keep it smooth and tangle free while teasing.</li>
            <li> This has knobbed nylon &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; as well as Boar Bristles.  The nylon bristles are longer than the boar bristles.  Will work better for longer, thicker hair than for thinner, shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I love this teasing brush. It works very well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I have very thin hair and I get just the lift I need with this brush.</li>
            <li> Works great! My hair stays too!also combs out easy. Sturdy and functions well. I like the wood as opposed to plastic.</li>
            <li> I really liked this brush so much I came back to order 2 more so I can have one for my purse and one for work.  I have really thin hair but this brush really gives me fuller looking hair!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.  The &amp;#34;Boar&amp;#34; bristles, if in fact they are boar at all, fall out of the brush in my hand without even using it in my hair.  I won&#x27;t even use it in my hair because the &amp;#34;boar bristles&amp;#34; are loose and would get in my hair and be difficult to get out.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on it.  Another throw-away purchase!  If I could have chosen a minus star rating I would have because a one star it doesn&#x27;t deserve!</li>
            <li> Long and pointy, but very thin and good for quick touch-ups during the day.  Fits well in most handbags.  I&#x27;d like it just a few rows wider, but this is not a huge issue.  Styling tip can be handy for getting hair back in place after you have been out in the wind.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I like to lightly tease the crown of my hair to make it a bit fuller looking - this brush if great for targeting specific areas because it&#x27;s so narrow.</li>
