            <li>She will be thrilled.</li>
            <li>Also, I have found that the shape of the eye cup fits nicely on my eye.  </li>
            <li>Nice that you can boil it to sanitize it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>I like the shape of it even better than my glass one I keep at home</li>
            <li>(it seems to cup my eye better than the glass one)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m glad I have in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>Could have been wider, but is of better quality than the picture shows it to be.</li>
            <li>fits better then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li>I love It</li>
            <li>so I have a backup :) and it is made in USA :)</li>
            <li>I think that Shemp (Samuel Horwitz, Moe&#x27;s brother) used these most of the time.</li>
            <li>Very handy, not too large</li>
            <li>Quality product all the way around, seems to be made of high quality material, very good design, feels comfortable while using.  </li>
            <li>it will last years since is plastic and fit perfect.</li>
            <li>I broke my glass eye cup and read where these fit better than the glass cup.  </li>
            <li>I would have to agree that they do fit better than the glass eye cup.  </li>
            <li>I found this eye cup easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Only your doctor can tell you if use of a cup like this would be appropriate for you, but it&#x27;s working great for me in my situation.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li>For me, it has been much easier and more effective than the eye dropper/squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li>Decades ago, I had a lovely, heavy glass eye cup that fit my eye perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, easy to use, fits an eye like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>I have a little plastic eye cup which came free with a 4oz bottle of Bausch &amp; Lomb eye wash which fits my eye absolutely perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll do for the application, but I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with how much it leaks and from my research</li>
            <li>Small;, compact, and perfect.</li>
            <li>i found a number of glass eye wash cups on ebay in pretty colors for a dollar or two more, including the shipping, so I got one of those to use instead.</li>
            <li>Not anything special</li>
            <li>It does not supply a good seal, so fluid leaks around the edges.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>With less than a half ounce of slightly warm milk, I can safely and easily remove debris from my eye, or simply relieve eye stress with this perfectly shaped eye cup.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is so useful, when eyewash is needed,  will be purchasing another</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>it says it is plastic right in the title, but I somehow thought I was buying a glass one,</li>
            <li>And I just love it now even more after a few months of using it....</li>
            <li>After filling it with water and my granddaughter using it for the first time, she replied, &amp;#34;This is magic.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Must-have item for a well-stocked first aid kit or medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>, I tried it so many times with the same result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and last but not least, it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
            <li>A very cheap low quality Chinese copy of the sort of eye cups that used to be available.</li>
            <li>Eye wash cup is a bit large.  </li>
            <li>Nice little Eyewash.</li>
            <li>This item is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>It fits the eye real well and does not leak.</li>
            <li>They work, what can you really say??</li>
            <li>it is better than any other option I could find.</li>
            <li>Fill with clean water, cover over your eye, open eye and rinse out lashes, dirt, gnat, etc.</li>
            <li>go on eBay and buy a used older one, that&#x27;s actually made right and will work.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low price, more trouble than it would be worth to return it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those items (like a pocketknife or a tourniquet) for which there simply are few adequate replacements -- you either have the right tool or you do not.  </li>
            <li>one is slightly better, if I press in hard, it might not dribble.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an old ceramic egg cup that has been in the family and made in England not China.</li>
            <li>Except they were probably made from real glass back then</li>
            <li>The cup is well constructed but the cup is too small to comfortably cover my eye</li>
            <li>The diameter is a bit almond shaped, and just barely fits my eye, however.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>If you have dry eyes, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t make them to fit the curved European eye socket, at least not the ones on my head, YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clear eyecup is Just what I expected to rinse my eyes.which</li>

            <li> This clear eyecup is Just what I expected to rinse my eyes.which</li>
            <li> Whoever makes this eye cup should consider following that same standard, or perhaps offering a few different sizes.</li>
            <li> I am using this cup to apply medication necessary to keep my eye moist and medicated during an extended period of inability to close my eye due to partial facial paralysis.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t leaked and is extremely helpful in holding medication on eye for time necessary.  </li>
            <li> Every one I&#x27;ve bought since then has been made in China and every single one of them dribbles solution out the sides when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am a 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; caucasian male of average build and looks.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a few of these for emergency medical bags.</li>
            <li> Molds to your face relatively well but you must press firmly or it leaks.</li>
            <li> The thing is, it&#x27;s simply too small.  </li>
            <li> The other one does not.</li>
            <li> , are ALL very average.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after one use, I quickly determined this was useless to me, but due</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure but it seems a little small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way to small</li>
            <li> So my guess is, this eye cup will be too small on a lot of people.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to press in hard, I want an eye cup that fits!</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough.</li>
            <li> I got tired of water spilling all over me.  </li>
            <li> I found it difficult to keep the liquids from running out of the cup, but I just fill it twice to wash each eye.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cup I could carry on me and not have to worry about it getting broken, this does the trick!</li>
            <li> So it is uncomfortable, and doesn&#x27;t cover the eye.  </li>
            <li> The cup is too small and very badly shaped, and it&#x27;s practically useless.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does the job but next time I will find one in glass rather than plastic. Glass sterilizes easier.</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy to use, fits an eye like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck are you supposed to say about an eye-wash cup? LOL</li>
            <li> This item is very convenient.  Constantly recommend this to others with issues. It fits the eye real well and does not leak.</li>
            <li> For my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Duh! it says it is plastic right in the title, but I somehow thought I was buying a glass one, like my family had when I was a kid. Doesn&lt;br /&gt;t matter, it still does the job which is help with my allergies.</li>
            <li> Eye wash cup is a bit large.  I found it difficult to keep the liquids from running out of the cup, but I just fill it twice to wash each eye.</li>
            <li> I found this eye cup easy to use.  The diameter is a bit almond shaped, and just barely fits my eye, however.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Outstanding,excellent</li>
            <li> arrived on time and correct</li>
            <li> It is okay.  It&#x27;ll do for the application, but I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with how much it leaks and from my research it is better than any other option I could find.</li>
            <li> For baby&#x27;s eyes.. Way to small</li>
            <li> Recently my granddaughter had something in her eye.  We went into the bathroom and I took out an eye cup my mother used for me.  After filling it with water and my granddaughter using it for the first time, she replied, &amp;#34;This is magic.&amp;#34;  So we got her her own and put it in with her Valentine presents.  She will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> The cup is well constructed but the cup is too small to comfortably cover my eye</li>
            <li> With less than a half ounce of slightly warm milk, I can safely and easily remove debris from my eye, or simply relieve eye stress with this perfectly shaped eye cup.  Everyone should have one in the medicine cabinet and one to spare!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure but it seems a little small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a big problem, I can still use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cup I could carry on me and not have to worry about it getting broken, this does the trick! I like the shape of it even better than my glass one I keep at home (it seems to cup my eye better than the glass one)</li>
            <li> Severs its purpose well.</li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO.  FLUSH MY EYES</li>
            <li> You just cannot find these anymore so I found two on Amazon for my wife.  I&#x27;d prefer glass but plastic for now.  They work, what can you really say??</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an eye cup and could not find one in a drug store. This one meets my needs and fits my eye well.</li>
            <li> I picked up a few of these for emergency medical bags. I was looking for glass ones and did not read the information well enough. But they are good quality. And they will work well for the time being. They arrived in very good condition and on time.</li>
            <li> Not anything special but it was inexpensive and it does the job.</li>

            <li> This does the job just fine. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m glad I have in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I broke my glass eye cup and read where these fit better than the glass cup.  I would have to agree that they do fit better than the glass eye cup.  And I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking these!  Very good eye cup, very pleased!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works great. Could have been wider, but is of better quality than the picture shows it to be.</li>
            <li> Convenient when you have something you need to flush out of an eye. I wish they still made these in glass.</li>
            <li> Decades ago, I had a lovely, heavy glass eye cup that fit my eye perfectly.  It was made in either Germany or UK, I don&#x27;t remember which.  Every one I&#x27;ve bought since then has been made in China and every single one of them dribbles solution out the sides when I try to use it.  They just don&#x27;t make them to fit the curved European eye socket, at least not the ones on my head, YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is slightly better, if I press in hard, it might not dribble.  Or it might.  I don&#x27;t want to have to press in hard, I want an eye cup that fits!</li>
            <li> Quality product all the way around, seems to be made of high quality material, very good design, feels comfortable while using.  This is one of those items (like a pocketknife or a tourniquet) for which there simply are few adequate replacements -- you either have the right tool or you do not.  Must-have item for a well-stocked first aid kit or medicine cabinet.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> .Do not buy this eye wash cup.It is Smaller in size then the size of your eyes ..</li>
            <li> very good, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting eye lashes, etc. out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these eye cups.  They aren&#x27;t easy to find.  I am happy with these cups.  They look just like the picture on Amazon.  Also, although they are plastic, they are durable.  I boil mine in water for 5 minutes to sterilize it.  The plastic will not melt.  Also, I have found that the shape of the eye cup fits nicely on my eye.  It&#x27;s very very easy to use.  I would recommend this eye cup and would buy it again!</li>
            <li> A very cheap low quality Chinese copy of the sort of eye cups that used to be available. The cup is too small and very badly shaped, and it&#x27;s practically useless. Save your money, don&#x27;t be fooled by the photo... go on eBay and buy a used older one, that&#x27;s actually made right and will work.</li>
            <li> fits better then the one that comes with the eye wash i buy</li>
            <li> This clear eyecup is Just what I expected to rinse my eyes.which I like to do after swimming.. Small;, compact, and perfect.</li>
            <li> Fill with clean water, cover over your eye, open eye and rinse out lashes, dirt, gnat, etc.</li>
            <li> It leaks, I tried it so many times with the same result. I got tired of water spilling all over me.  I&#x27;m using an old ceramic egg cup that has been in the family and made in England not China. It works great with no leaking. It&#x27;s also dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> I love It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is that I did drop it and it did not break. And I just love it now even more after a few months of using it....I would definitely buy this again so I have a backup :) and it is made in USA :)</li>
            <li> It works well. Nice that you can boil it to sanitize it.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for what it meant to be use for. it will last years since is plastic and fit perfect.</li>
            <li> It was made well, but I prefer glass eye wash cups for personal reasons. If you don&#x27;t mind plastic then you&#x27;ll love this! I did get another one from Group Medical Supply that is glass, really well made of heavy glass that doesn&#x27;t seem to be very fragile. Love it!</li>
            <li> the shape is good, it works, but it is made of plastic. if you want plastic, that&#x27;s your business. i don&#x27;t want it to leach chemicals, especially when i have to boil it to sterilize. i found a number of glass eye wash cups on ebay in pretty colors for a dollar or two more, including the shipping, so I got one of those to use instead.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It cannot e sanitized by boiling it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leak when used.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended to a friend for purchase</li>
            <li> Sturdy plastic and holds the liquid well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after one use, I quickly determined this was useless to me, but due it&#x27;s low price, more trouble than it would be worth to return it.  The thing is, it&#x27;s simply too small.  I have a little plastic eye cup which came free with a 4oz bottle of Bausch &amp; Lomb eye wash which fits my eye absolutely perfectly.  By comparison, the diameter of this eye cup is much, much smaller, and therefore rests on the eye itself, instead of encircling the eye.  So it is uncomfortable, and doesn&#x27;t cover the eye.  And in case you&#x27;re wondering, my eyes, my size, my spacing, my head size etc., are ALL very average.  I am a 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; caucasian male of average build and looks.  So my guess is, this eye cup will be too small on a lot of people.  Bausch &amp; Lomb obviously did some research into what size would be correct for the majority or people, and hit the nail on the head.  Whoever makes this eye cup should consider following that same standard, or perhaps offering a few different sizes.</li>
            <li> What else can I say? It fits the eye. It&#x27;s big enough. It&#x27;s tough. It&#x27;s easy to clean and last but not least, it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
            <li> I have another cup from another manufacturer. This cup has a bigger volume. The solution spills around my eyes. The other one does not.</li>
            <li> Very handy, not too large</li>
            <li> The cup feels well made and I like that it is food-grade plastic. It got 4 stars because it is sized for a smaller eye. I prefer a larger cup with a larger reservoir.</li>
            <li> Use this for washing your eyes with Eyebright Herb Extract from Christopher&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice little Eyewash. Just like the ones that were used on several Three Stooges Episodes with Boric Acid eyewash when that was all that they had back in the day of Old-Tyme medicines and remedies. I think that Shemp (Samuel Horwitz, Moe&#x27;s brother) used these most of the time. Except they were probably made from real glass back then</li>
            <li> This is so useful, when eyewash is needed,  will be purchasing another</li>
            <li> very happy with product and seller</li>
            <li> Perfect for the purpose of cleaning the eyes.</li>
            <li> It does not supply a good seal, so fluid leaks around the edges.</li>
