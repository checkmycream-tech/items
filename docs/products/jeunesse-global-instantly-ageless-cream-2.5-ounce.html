            <li> I have large hollows under my eyes and I&#x27;m too chicken to do anything like injections or anything.  </li>

            <li> When reading that you could not put on makeup after, it already was not appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, this is a temporary fix, and it does make your crows feel vanish, wrinkles diminish, however any type of make-up applied on top looks horrible.</li>
            <li> but I do like the small packets that are convenient.</li>
            <li> I hardly noticed a change.</li>

            <li> I purchased 5 vials on eBay UK to try it out at a reasonable price of £12. (I have subsequently bought a full box of 25). As a previous reviewer said, purchase just a couple to see if it works for you. Take note that the vials contain 0.6mls and the sachets half that at 0.3mls, that&#x27;s why you get 50 sachets in the box. Also I would say the vials are better because of the cap which keeps the contents moist and good for 2/3 applications, if just around eyes. Effect lasts about 6 hours in my experience, if you don&#x27;t wash you face or visit the sauna. IMPORTANT this is NOT an anti-wrinkle serum or cream that may (or may not) decrease the severity of wrinkles on the face OVER TIME. (You need to buy Boots No 7 for that, it worked for me in plumping up the collagen on my face - NOT sure if it is available in the USA). Instantly Ageless is what I use for a quick fix when I am going out to a function or just want to look a little bit better. It does the job perfectly and I am satisfied with it. Being over 60 and male (I don&#x27;t wear make-up  . . .  and no I am not vain, just like to look as young as I feel . . . lol) is I suppose in the age bracket that would see or show the most benefit (45 - 75). I think some ladies who DONT have deep wrinkles may not see a distinguishable difference, but try out just a couple of vials or sachets and leave your feedback.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE DID NOT WORK FOR ME</li>
            <li> When reading that you could not put on makeup after, it already was not appealing to me. I actually bought it for my husband and he tried it once and found it very uncomfortable and never tried it again. It did take away some puffiness but then after a few hours it left a white or ashy look under his eyes. I hardly noticed a change. So,we now have used one vial and have a lot left over!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the pods and they worked well.  The sachets spent an extra day in the mailbox because I ecpected it on Tuesday and it arrived Friday.  Probably not a good choice in Arizona summer</li>
            <li> It gives me headache after I applied the product. I contacted the seller and no reply.</li>
            <li> The product was making makeup cake up, but it did what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service. The product is not effective. It doesn&#x27;t present results as described.</li>
            <li> I have a little puffiness below my eyes and a small amount, evenly applied, makes it disappear.  The secret is not applying too much and to let it dry completely before changing expression.  It lasts about 7-10 hours.  The only downside is that it is slightly uncomfortable after it dries because of the intense drawing effect on the skin.  Pretty good product that does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Love this product, really works!</li>
            <li> This product leaves a white dry residue around the area applied too. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This product is amazing!  I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She doesn&#x27;t wear makeup often.&lt;br /&gt;she dabbled some on her forehead and wow!! Wrinkles gone. But a few minutes and a white milky film started to show and it aerated to flake off after about 30 minutes. Then it looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next she tried again and tried to use makeup. Big mistake looks awful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars..</li>
            <li> I like the product better than Seacret recover</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great, BUT there is definitely a learning curve to using it.  I have large hollows under my eyes and I&#x27;m too chicken to do anything like injections or anything.  This tightens up the area very nicely.  However, you have to be careful to try to get it on smoothly because otherwise make-up looks cakey.  Use your creams and serums, FIRST, then the Instantly Ageless.  Let it dry THOROUGHLY.  Then powders can go over it.  I use the yellow in my contouring kit or Bare Minerals Well-Rested.  If you use a cream, it won&#x27;t work.  I love it and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Covers and tightens skin and dark circles</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the results,the video was very deceiving!!</li>
            <li> The ringles under the  eyes becames more evident</li>
            <li> It stung my eyes badly. I could not use</li>
            <li> Takes practices. It is a band aid so to speak, but it does work and I use it daily. It doesn&#x27;t fix it just conceals it.</li>
            <li> Effects only lasts for a short time.  Less than 1 hour.  And if you smile, it cracks.  I would compare it to dried elmers glue on your  face.  Sure it looks tight, but when you smile it turns white.  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> When you get the product, the instructions say to use with other Jeunesse products so this is kind of a disclaimer if it doesn&#x27;t work.  Does not say this in the original product description, however.  Tried it before applying makeup but found that I had tiny feathery lines so tried using it after makeup application.  I guess if you were having photos taken and weren&#x27;t planning on smiling in them, the product does what it says.  Just don&#x27;t move your face or the result doesn&#x27;t last.  The video is great and very motivating.  I can&#x27;t say I got as drastic a result and the result was not lasting.</li>
            <li> Great for undereye bags!</li>
            <li> excellent product and seller</li>
            <li> This best product on the Market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJB</li>
            <li> Great item, my mother in law loves it.</li>
            <li> it only works until you move your face</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations. Love the product.</li>
            <li> These are not the originals.  I am rather disappointed as I have actually tried the real deal!</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, this is a temporary fix, and it does make your crows feel vanish, wrinkles diminish, however any type of make-up applied on top looks horrible. You have to use this alone, nothing applied on top. Their is a white film left on skin so use this product sparingly. Probably would not buy again but I do like the small packets that are convenient.</li>
            <li> Perfect, really signficant results.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well for s few applications but then stopped</li>
            <li> I wish I could return this item.  It does exactly what it says.....for about 15 minutes.  Then your skin goes back to original form.  You cannot put any makeup over it either, but either way it only lasted for 15 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> Does not work as good as it says.</li>
    </ol>
