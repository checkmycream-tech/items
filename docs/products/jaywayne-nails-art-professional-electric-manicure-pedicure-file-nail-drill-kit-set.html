            <li>I just started doing my own acrylic tips</li>

            <li>Sometimes cheap isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li>Great for natural nails and acrylic.</li>
            <li>But so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Received it faster than expected and works great!</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly because of that.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its easy to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bits sit in securely but they do not lock in, which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I like the dial to adjust the speed and the drill itself is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I also ordered a smoothing nail bit (from another website below) which allows you to go close to the cuticle and smooth acrylics or gels in the fill in area without getting cut.</li>
            <li>It doesnt even turn on , i was so excited to receive this since all the other reviews were great .</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>is worth</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, the drill don&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I received my electric file super fast after ordering it, which was a plus and the price was very reasonable &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I cut down my salon budget by doing my own feet.</li>
            <li>it helps cut off so much filing time for my acrylic nails and def strong enough to work on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I feel like it should have been done right from the start so that paying customers don&#x27;t have to fix it or buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if I find that they loosen with use, but for now this has fulfilled its purpose and was reasonably priced, being a product I&#x27;m using for myself in my home and not in a salon on a bunch of people.</li>
            <li>Only complain is that the tips don&#x27;t really fit the drill.</li>
            <li>The red light comes on, but nothing.</li>
            <li>I would personally be more comfortable if they locked, but they just push in and hopefully remain tight enough for the life of the drill.</li>
            <li>Does not slow down and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It gets a little warm when used for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It arrived fast and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>While the drill is a cheap price, I still feel like it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>The drill bits included in the kit are helpful, but I needed one that smooths near the fill in area and was not included in this</li>
            <li>Other than the whole breaking thing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I originally posted a great review for this product, but since then, things have changed. One day the drill just didn&#x27;t turn back on. I took very good care of the drill so it&#x27;s definitely not user error. While the drill is a cheap price, I still feel like it&#x27;s a waste of my money. Sometimes cheap isn&#x27;t better. When it did work, it had a lot of vibration on the handle, so therefore there was a lot of vibration while using on clients. Heats up very quickly because of that. If this is your first drill, and you don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with drills, then it&#x27;s not so bad. Other than the whole breaking thing.  **EDIT** Opened it up and noticed that the soldering of the connections was done very poorly and/or lazely, re-soldered all of the connections and now it turns on again. So if this happens to you, don&#x27;t waste time and money trying to return it or replace it. It took just a coupe minutes and saved me money. I feel like it should have been done right from the start so that paying customers don&#x27;t have to fix it or buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Machine stopped working after five uses! What a waste.</li>
            <li> Love this nail kit. just  got it and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> This is great for home use. I just started doing my own acrylic tips and I wanted a nail drill to speed up filing and buffing, and this fulfills that need. The bits sit in securely but they do not lock in, which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5. I would personally be more comfortable if they locked, but they just push in and hopefully remain tight enough for the life of the drill. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and the bits have stayed in and done what I expected them to do. I&#x27;ll update my review if I find that they loosen with use, but for now this has fulfilled its purpose and was reasonably priced, being a product I&#x27;m using for myself in my home and not in a salon on a bunch of people. I like the dial to adjust the speed and the drill itself is comfortable to hold. I feel it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m reasonably happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My friends daughter just started learning to do nails and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Made well and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! it helps cut off so much filing time for my acrylic nails and def strong enough to work on acrylic nails. Love the clockwise/counterclockwise feature!! This is the best electrical drill for the price!!! BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Great for natural nails and acrylic. Great range of power and speed. Includes all drill bits necessary for manicures and fullsets.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews. The product arrived quickly. The quality of the product is very good for the $.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to doing my nails using this drill.  I also ordered a smoothing nail bit (from another website below) which allows you to go close to the cuticle and smooth acrylics or gels in the fill in area without getting cut. The drill bits included in the kit are helpful, but I needed one that smooths near the fill in area and was not included in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It doesnt even turn on , i was so excited to receive this since all the other reviews were great . However, it might have just been a defective one . i do want one that works ! PLEASE !</li>
            <li> The nail machine did not work.  The return was very easy though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice. But so far it&#x27;s been great. I got mines in two days, with extra charge of course. Only complain is that the tips don&#x27;t really fit the drill. Not sure if there&#x27;s a trick to it. I&#x27;ll keep working on it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Received it faster than expected and works great! Does not slow down and easy to use!</li>
            <li> IN THE BEGGINING WAS OK, BUT SOON FAILED</li>
            <li> Great product.  I get tired of going to salons that charge a fortune for Pedicure and Manicure.  It is easy to use and works perfect for me and my family.  My boys love it.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly. Very pleased.. Just received it. Right out of the box, the drill don&#x27;t turn on. The red light comes on, but nothing. Guess I&#x27;ll be contacting them for either a replacement or return. Keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after like 10 uses!!! Waste of money-- Next time I wont take the cheap route and get the more expensive one!!! DONT BUY!</li>
            <li> I had not used it yet,  but checked it and it seems to work great. It arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Works great and got here on time. Love it. I already started to use it. Will recommend to all my fellow nail techs</li>
            <li> If you have thick nails this is a savior. I cut down my salon budget by doing my own feet. I still get pedicures but I can shape my nails the way I want if it&#x27;s not done properly. I had two thick big toe nails and this machine change that. I love it!</li>
            <li> I received my electric file super fast after ordering it, which was a plus and the price was very reasonable &amp;#34;) The interesting thing is it doesen&#x27;t have a release button to remove/change the bit.  Its self-locking, you just take out the mandrel, change it and put it back&lt;br /&gt;in.  Feels very secure and does not feel like the bit will fall out during use.  I also like that the stand is purple and the hand piece has an on/off&lt;br /&gt;button as well as the unit.  Its easy to&lt;br /&gt;use and I am very happy with it &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am doing my own nails instead getting them done at the salon. is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am basically just learning how to use this machine. I love it&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The speed control did not work, so it only went one speed.</li>
            <li> Great for the price and works good. I had ordered a more expensive drill it did not work so I had to return it. I saw this one and thought  I would  try it. I&#x27;ve  had it over a year works great  for doing your nails at home.</li>
            <li> I love this e-file! It works great on toes and does magic when I use it on my acrylic nails. I do my own acrylics at home and this machine gives me salon quality nails. It gets a little warm when used for long periods of time. But mine has never over heated or stopped on me. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this....just as good as professional!!!!</li>
