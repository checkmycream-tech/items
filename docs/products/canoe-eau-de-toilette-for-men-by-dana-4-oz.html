            <li>great dealing with you</li>
            <li>I loved it then, and I still love it!!</li>
            <li>I have loved this cologne for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>Fair projection and 4 to 6 hours</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it did 20 years ago when Grandma gave me some for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I love it on him and he loves it too!  </li>
            <li>My husband was pleased &amp; so am I!</li>
            <li>yet some people liked it.</li>
            <li>That is Okay, but a spray would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Canoe has been a favorite for decades</li>
            <li>i have worn this produce for 45 years and still love it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to fin it for years.</li>
            <li>I have used Canoe for years, none of the local stores carry this product, so was very happy to find</li>
            <li>Have used it for over 50 years and the ladies still love</li>
            <li>Used it 50 years ago and it was better as I recall.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite.</li>
            <li>Canoe is his all time favorite.</li>
            <li>My friends favorite, was a gift for him.</li>
            <li>Not the most offensive smelling foulness out there,it was just soooo sweeeet.</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quickly, in good shape.  </li>
            <li>easy and very friendly ordering procedure</li>
            <li>A great masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice large container with a spray top.</li>
            <li>It came in a short amount of time and he loved it!</li>
            <li>I forgot about Canoe however after trying it again after many long years I am happy to say I will be using it as my every day scent,</li>
            <li>but I like the smooth sweetness and the soapy accord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it seems to last...remains a light skin scent afterwards.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t take a vintage bottle of Canoe for free...</li>
            <li>It put a huge smile on his face!  </li>
            <li>this was closer to original</li>
            <li>I purchase two  bottles and if they would have been packaged properly I would have rated  it excellent, but one bottle leaked  because lid on bottle was loose and most of that bottle was lost.</li>
            <li>Women love it when they get real close.</li>
            <li>Product came fast and safely packaged.</li>
            <li>initially-very clean citrus,a white soapy note that&#x27;s kind of</li>
            <li>I love the soft powdery smell of this cologne specially for after shower.</li>
            <li>scent is slightly different from the older versions, but still very nice</li>
            <li>the product did not smell right, when we got it it was sealed, but the spray part was not there, the canoe had leaked into the box&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I have a bottle left that I had in HIGH SCHOOL that I compared it with when it arrived ~ and the two smell EXACTLY the same, which is GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>This comes on a tad stronger than the After Shave, but very much a keeper.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Been consistent for years.</li>
            <li>Pardon the title of my review as to say Canoe never smelled good because it dates back to the mid 1930&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Canoe has a long lasting pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The soapy note is more dominant followed by the vanilla and powdery character while the citrus remains more subtle.</li>
            <li>It was great to find a hard to find item!</li>
            <li>The scent is very masculine, fresh &amp; woodsy.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
            <li>not so much?</li>
            <li>Came on time, no broken bottles.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>the shipping box was falling apart, but the men&#x27;s toilette &#x27;looked&#x27; ok, so i gave it to my husband on his birthday, today,&lt;br /&gt;10/26/13, however the sprayer was missing, the smell wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that this current formula by Dana is hands-down 100% the 1930&#x27;s original scent of Canoe.</li>
            <li>After a quick Google search I was lead to canoe as a similar scent and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Canoe is a classic.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend them, but hope amazon dumps this canoe vendor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since high school.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne because I love pinaud clubman aftershave, but I find its scent would fade after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It keeps the Cologne in but now has sharp edges where the cheap plastic broke.</li>
            <li>clean,green,sharp,and lively.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many other fragrances, but he always goes back to Canoe.</li>
            <li>this bottle is either old or Canoe now has a new &amp; undesireable scent.</li>
            <li>And since it is not a spray bottle I can dab on next to nothing, I don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much.</li>
            <li>An old stand-by.  </li>
            <li>My 30 yr old son researched this [??] and wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>I surprised him</li>
            <li>Old timer.  </li>
            <li>Takes me back to my High School days.</li>
            <li>The Canoe has always been a favorite, but the cap was broken.</li>
            <li>(High School was roughly 45 years ago!).  </li>

            <li> Takes me back to my High School days.</li>
            <li> The Canoe has always been a favorite, but the cap was broken.</li>
            <li> (High School was roughly 45 years ago!).  </li>
            <li> It is very similar (just a little bit more subtle) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant or long lasting as I remembered.</li>
            <li> Unique and very subtle.</li>
            <li> It may seem strange but my husband has been using this cologne for over 45 years.  </li>
            <li> The amber is long gone</li>
            <li> Or it&#x27;s possible when Dana acquired this scent they reformulated decades ago,turned out to be a mediocre seller through lacking imagination and repulsively sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong enough use for the night time</li>
            <li> A very strong base of amber,vanilla,and powder and</li>
            <li> received a gift assortment of Dana fragrances that had several small bottles of colognes about 3 years ago as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> The sage wears off and the citrus tames down a bit.</li>
            <li> The other two notes lack imagination but amber foundation colognes are so resinous and sweet it makes me sick.</li>
            <li> Bad memories of the cologne called Cameron by Kensington,Fire &amp; Ice for Men by Revlon,and Royal Copenhagen that were heavy in amber.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband is so angry with it that he doesn&#x27;t want me to order</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> or so vague I can&#x27;t smell it,</li>
            <li> worst shipment i have ever recd.</li>

            <li> This is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;In the stores this time of year,&lt;br /&gt;I always see the gift sets of Canoe,&lt;br /&gt;but this is the only product we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I could find on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It was a bday gift! It came in a short amount of time and he loved it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It smells like I remember it 50 years ago, but it has no staying power. One hour after applying, my wife said she could no longer smell it on me.</li>
            <li> Canoe has been a favorite for decades</li>
            <li> i have worn this produce for 45 years and still love it</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quickly, in good shape.  I have a bottle left that I had in HIGH SCHOOL that I compared it with when it arrived ~ and the two smell EXACTLY the same, which is GREAT!!  (High School was roughly 45 years ago!).  I loved it then, and I still love it!!</li>
            <li> the product did not smell right, when we got it it was sealed, but the spray part was not there, the canoe had leaked into the box&lt;br /&gt;and the shipping box was falling apart, but the men&#x27;s toilette &#x27;looked&#x27; ok, so i gave it to my husband on his birthday, today,&lt;br /&gt;10/26/13, however the sprayer was missing, the smell wasn&#x27;t right. it took from 10/9/13 to 10/21/13 to be delivered, and the box&lt;br /&gt;showed iot! worst shipment i have ever recd. from amazon. my husband is so angry with it that he doesn&#x27;t want me to order&lt;br /&gt;anything again from the internet, let alone from amazon. com! i had also ordered obsession from calvin klein, from amazon, but&lt;br /&gt;had no problems with the product or the shipment, so i highly recommend them, but hope amazon dumps this canoe vendor&lt;br /&gt;from their line-up of products! io used to believe in amazon and their handling of products, but this was the last straw!</li>
            <li> It may seem strange but my husband has been using this cologne for over 45 years.  I have purchased many other fragrances, but he always goes back to Canoe.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to my High School days. I haven&#x27;t been able to fin it for years.</li>
            <li> I purchase two  bottles and if they would have been packaged properly I would have rated  it excellent, but one bottle leaked  because lid on bottle was loose and most of that bottle was lost. The box it came in had  no damage from shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a splash product, not a spray as indicated on the item description page. That is Okay, but a spray would have been nice. I sm going to try the cologne spray next. The reason for choosing Canoe, my wife prefers it.</li>
            <li> Been using Canoe for over 40 years. Unique and very subtle. Women love it when they get real close. I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because I love pinaud clubman aftershave, but I find its scent would fade after a few hours. After a quick Google search I was lead to canoe as a similar scent and decided to give it a try. It is very similar (just a little bit more subtle) and lasts all day. And since it is not a spray bottle I can dab on next to nothing, I don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much.</li>
            <li> An old stand-by.  Been consistent for years.</li>
            <li> I have loved this cologne for over 30 years. It was put in a Waterford bottle and looks beautiful in my bath room.</li>
            <li> I have used Canoe for years, none of the local stores carry this product, so was very happy to find online.&lt;br /&gt;The flags on the bottle spell CANOE</li>
            <li> I remember the head cheerleader giving this to her boyfriend, the quarterback of our school team.  He gave her an&lt;br /&gt;enormous bottle of Ambush!  My 30 yr old son researched this [??] and wanted to try it.  I surprised him&lt;br /&gt;with it for his birthday.  I love it on him and he loves it too!  What a find!  Canoe is a classic.</li>
            <li> it seems as though dana has reduced the fragrance of their product. It certainly isn&#x27;t what it used to be. sorry</li>
            <li> Have used it for over 50 years and the ladies still love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Me not so much?</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant or long lasting as I remembered. Used it 50 years ago and it was better as I recall.</li>
            <li> This is a nice large container with a spray top. Canoe has a long lasting pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite. But cannot find the Eau De Cologne.</li>
            <li> I forgot about Canoe however after trying it again after many long years I am happy to say I will be using it as my every day scent,</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my brother. Canoe is his all time favorite.It put a huge smile on his face!  It was great to find a hard to find item!</li>
            <li> easy and very friendly ordering procedure</li>
            <li> Canoe products are excellent .</li>
            <li> When searched for SPRAY this product displayed. When ordered it arrived as SPLASH and is not what I wanted or preferred.</li>
            <li> Great gift for husband</li>
            <li> Old timer.  Cannot get locally.</li>
            <li> A great masculine scent. This comes on a tad stronger than the After Shave, but very much a keeper. The scent is very masculine, fresh &amp; woodsy. My husband was pleased &amp; so am I!</li>
            <li> I love the soft powdery smell of this cologne specially for after shower. It&#x27;s not strong enough use for the night time but it&#x27;s grate for mornings and day time and excellent to put it on b4 bed</li>
            <li> this bottle is either old or Canoe now has a new &amp; undesireable scent. Thinking of returning it.</li>
            <li> Had no problems.  Came on time, no broken bottles. Both shipments were awesome! !  Thanks</li>
            <li> The Canoe has always been a favorite, but the cap was broken. It keeps the Cologne in but now has sharp edges where the cheap plastic broke.</li>
            <li> great dealing with you</li>
            <li> My friends favorite, was a gift for him. His spouse loves the fragrance on him! Product came fast and safely packaged.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER THIS PRODUCT WHEN I WAS ALOT YOUNGER.&lt;br /&gt;STILL SMELLS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Best man scent out there. I&#x27;ve used it since high school.</li>
            <li> Pardon the title of my review as to say Canoe never smelled good because it dates back to the mid 1930&#x27;s.Growing up in the 80&#x27;s though I have to say...I tried this cologne twice and didn&#x27;t like it.Not the most offensive smelling foulness out there,it was just soooo sweeeet.A very strong base of amber,vanilla,and powder and that&#x27;s it.The other two notes lack imagination but amber foundation colognes are so resinous and sweet it makes me sick.Bad memories of the cologne called Cameron by Kensington,Fire &amp; Ice for Men by Revlon,and Royal Copenhagen that were heavy in amber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Canoe has been reformulated?&lt;br /&gt;I received a gift assortment of Dana fragrances that had several small bottles of colognes about 3 years ago as a Christmas gift.I smelled the Canoe cologne and it seemed different so I put a dab on my finger and rubbed it in...yep it was different.So I put some on and thought to myself &#x27;now that&#x27;s how it should have smelled&#x27;When you put it on you&#x27;ll get three notes initially-very clean citrus,a white soapy note that&#x27;s kind of fizzy(aldehydes),and clary sage...clean,green,sharp,and lively.The sage wears off and the citrus tames down a bit.The soapy note is more dominant followed by the vanilla and powdery character while the citrus remains more subtle.The amber is long gone or so vague I can&#x27;t smell it,but I like the smooth sweetness and the soapy accord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this current formula by Dana is hands-down 100% the 1930&#x27;s original scent of Canoe.But if it was...Dana refined it properly to the notes pertaining to the scent.Or it&#x27;s possible when Dana acquired this scent they reformulated decades ago,turned out to be a mediocre seller through lacking imagination and repulsively sweet yet some people liked it.Fair projection and 4 to 6 hours it seems to last...remains a light skin scent afterwards.I wouldn&#x27;t take a vintage bottle of Canoe for free...today&#x27;s Canoe is still old-fashioned but it&#x27;s now the good stuff!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it did 20 years ago when Grandma gave me some for my birthday.</li>
            <li> scent is slightly different from the older versions, but still very nice</li>
            <li> the smell of Canoe has changed over the years. this was closer to original</li>
            <li> I bought this for a senior friend that can&#x27;t find it in stores. He absolutely loves it</li>
