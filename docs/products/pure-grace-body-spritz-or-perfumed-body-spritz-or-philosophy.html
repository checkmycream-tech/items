            <li>I love to spritz this all over my shoulders as it does stick to fabric a lot more than skin.  </li>

            <li>Such a great fragrance!</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>But I do love the scents.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>

            <li>Love Love Love this body spray.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things from the Philosophy line.</li>

            <li>This is a very clean scent and very light</li>
            <li>Nice scent, clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love the clean scent smell.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it worked out quite well because I now have a briefcase size bottle with me all the time for a quick pick-me-up!</li>
            <li>It is also so refreshing on those hot summer days when you can spritz on a blast of refreshment and aroma!</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s light and</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I orderd the lotion and the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thank You again for having a great product with a low price.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell to it, nothing strong.</li>
            <li>This scent is so perfect for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Great for women who can not wear many fragrances due to migraine headaches.</li>
            <li>Love the clean fresh crisp scent and it lasts for hours!!</li>
            <li>This is probably my most favorite philosophy fragrance next to Amazing Grace;  it is a clean and not overly sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love Pure Grace!  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it embodies everything clean, light and uplifting.</li>
            <li>This smell is just a clean scent and light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely clean and fresh and \\&quot;just stepped out of the shower fresh\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Everyone compliments on the clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Now I can wear pure grace without overwhelming myself or others with the scent.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t say enough good about the item.</li>
            <li>Smells good but scent does not last at all</li>
            <li>Light, clean, airy, pretty.</li>
            <li>If you like smelling fresh and shower clean with some notes of fragrance throughout the day...</li>
            <li>I work at a hospital and the subtle scent is perfect.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean smell,  and</li>
            <li>I go through this so quickly because you can apply it so liberally without fear of over doing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and can be worn around people who are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this was OLD product as I generally love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>, it was a new, sealed bottle and shipped out very quickly</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and the fragrance lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I personally only use a few of the Philosophy items but I would have to say this is my favorite because of its CLEAN and REFRESHING aroma!</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly so it will last a year or more.</li>
            <li>pretty so just go with that description I guess.</li>
            <li>My daughter took it away from me ;)</li>
            <li>Most all colognes/perfumes smell like bug spray to me and this is a cleaner scent, a lot like the scent of French soap.  </li>
            <li>The Amazing Grace is a little sweeter smelling than the Pure Grace, but I prefer the Pure Grace for its clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first time I ever tried the Pure Grace.</li>
            <li>Pure grace has such a clean fresh smell I use it for a body spritz and also to freshen the air in the house</li>
            <li>Love the clean but not overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li>This one wears off a bit too fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks a Million</li>
            <li>I am a hugger - my whole family are huggers.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance very weak......will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Got this because no Inner Grace spritz is available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>but I like a little more ooomph for going to work, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a clean, soft smell.</li>
            <li>Grace - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Softly scented body spritz, smells like sundried bedsheets!  </li>
            <li>It is simple, pure, and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Like it, but Pure Grace does not come close to Inner Grace..  </li>
            <li>It is the only smell that is not overwhelming and is so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this spritz because it lasts at least 5-6 hours and smells like you just took a shower.</li>
            <li>I spray this all over my clothes, jacket, scarf, before leaving the house and frequently receive compliments.  </li>
            <li>sensitive to a lot of perfumes.</li>
            <li>Soft fragrances that can be worn every day.</li>
            <li>I only gave this 4 stars only because it seems Pure Grace is not for me</li>
            <li>I loved this smell, it unfortunately just doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>

            <li> I loved this smell, it unfortunately just doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s a little high priced now.</li>
            <li> Ive never been a fan of spritz&#x27; because they don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li> I spray it over the coordinating lotion for a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I can become ill from strong scents</li>
            <li> 3 stars because of how long it took and the condition it was in and staying power.</li>
            <li> Scent does not stay on long , have to keep reapplying it.  </li>
            <li> Not very fragrant - has a definitely rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> the scent was not strong, nor did it last very long once applied.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful what I wear.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
            <li> I complimented a woman the other day on her fragrance</li>
            <li> NOT REAL FRAGRANCE!!</li>
            <li> I previously used the perfume, but I like the body spray because it is not at all sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now and it smells like you just got out of the shower</li>
            <li> but I prefer to reapply than to have a heavy perfume smell on all day.</li>
            <li> I usually lose the scent in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> Delicate.</li>
            <li> no one has ever complained about it.  </li>
            <li> You know what I mean?</li>
            <li> Amazon and Beauty.com stand behind their products and if for some reason it doesn&#x27;t agree with you, you can always return it hassle-free.</li>
            <li> scent was very weak and spray bottle was broken.  </li>
            <li> It has the faint smell of soap and is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sticker the seller used is impossible to remove and the bottle looks terrible because of it.</li>
            <li> I assure you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Smells amazing and the fragrance lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This took forever to arrive. And was not packed so great. I think it got knocked around along the way as it won&#x27;t spray correctly. : [[  -- I only wear this scent. I am allergic to everything. I can become ill from strong scents so I&#x27;m careful what I wear. This one wears off a bit too fast. It&#x27;s such a clean, soft smell. I just think it&#x27;s a little high priced now. I wish it had arrived faster and in better condition. I would not order it again here. I use it sparingly so it will last a year or more. 3 stars because of how long it took and the condition it was in and staying power.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is absolutely wonderful! I&#x27;m a man and I wear it and receive compliments! It&#x27;s absolutely clean and fresh and \\&quot;just stepped out of the shower fresh\\&quot;! It&#x27;s very light and can be worn around people who are sensitive to fragrances. The description of the product is spot on. I assure you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It is also so refreshing on those hot summer days when you can spritz on a blast of refreshment and aroma! In my opinion, it embodies everything clean, light and uplifting. I go through this so quickly because you can apply it so liberally without fear of over doing it. I personally only use a few of the Philosophy items but I would have to say this is my favorite because of its CLEAN and REFRESHING aroma! Trust me, you will get compliments when you where it! I see no need for improvement. I love it just the way it is. One, teeny, tiny, problem I had with my last bottle and that was the pump spray stopped working toward the end. No worries though, I simply transferred the remaining product to another container. In fact, it worked out quite well because I now have a briefcase size bottle with me all the time for a quick pick-me-up! If you like smelling fresh and shower clean with some notes of fragrance throughout the day... this is the product for you! Buy now! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Sorry for the long review but I just can&#x27;t say enough good about the item. Buy with confidence... Amazon and Beauty.com stand behind their products and if for some reason it doesn&#x27;t agree with you, you can always return it hassle-free. Ladies AND gentlemen- ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a few years now and it smells like you just got out of the shower and I get quite alot of compliments on the scent.  Definitely a must buy !!!</li>
            <li> Best smelling scent every. Light, clean, airy, pretty. Delicate. So many adjectives. It just makes you smell like a running bubble bath in a room with a running dryer exhaust. You know what I mean? No. Well, it&#x27;s light and pretty so just go with that description I guess.</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance.  It is simple, pure, and long-lasting.  Not flowery or overwhelming, its freshness makes it the only fragrance I use.</li>
            <li> Ive never been a fan of spritz&#x27; because they don&#x27;t last long and you have to keep spritzing throughout the day. I LOVE this spritz because it lasts at least 5-6 hours and smells like you just took a shower. It has the faint smell of soap and is very subtle.  Philosophy Im sold. I liked it so much I orderd the lotion and the fragrance. I just love this line. It makes you feel fresh and feminine. Ladies if you buy one beauty item this year make it this one-you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I bought this body spritz and love Philosophy products but this is the first time I ever tried the Pure Grace. If you are looking for something with the soap and water scent and its not overbearing this is the product to buy!!!! Love the clean fresh crisp scent and it lasts for hours!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The fragrance is wonderful and it leaves your skin so soft. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, clean and not too strong. I work at a hospital and the subtle scent is perfect. I previously used the perfume, but I like the body spray because it is not at all sticky.</li>
            <li> Scent is wonderful when applying but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I apply after a shower and the scent fades within 20-30 minutes for me.</li>
            <li> I spray this all over my clothes, jacket, scarf, before leaving the house and frequently receive compliments.  This is a very clean scent and very light so you can truly mist it all over and not have it overdone.</li>
            <li> Great Price and Great Product.  I would purchase from this seller again, which I have.  Thank You again for having a great product with a low price. Thanks a Million</li>
            <li> the scent was not strong, nor did it last very long once applied. Disappointing. Will only purchase the perfume from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome price.</li>
            <li> I loved this smell, it unfortunately just doesn&#x27;t stay on long. I&#x27;ll spritz in the morning and from my morning commute to work, the scent has already wore off.</li>
            <li> Have to apply a lot and often for fragrance to last</li>
            <li> Smells great!  My daughter took it away from me ;)</li>
            <li> Fresh clean smell,  and no one has ever complained about it.  Everyone compliments on the clean fragrance.  Love it  thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It has a clean smell to it, nothing strong. I have received plenty of compliments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent I love in a light all over body spray!  Now I can wear pure grace without overwhelming myself or others with the scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! It stays with you and everyone says &amp;#34;you smell so clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am a hugger - my whole family are huggers.  I love to spritz this all over my shoulders as it does stick to fabric a lot more than skin.  I always get compliments on the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; I bring into any room.  I love this smell.</li>
            <li> I love Pure Grace!  It is the only smell that is not overwhelming and is so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> This smells great and the fragrance lasts. Unfortunately the sticker the seller used is impossible to remove and the bottle looks terrible because of it.</li>
            <li> scent was very weak and spray bottle was broken.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Softly scented body spritz, smells like sundried bedsheets!  Such a great fragrance!</li>
            <li> This smell is just a clean scent and light.  Doesn&#x27;t last to long but I prefer to reapply than to have a heavy perfume smell on all day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I just wished it lasted longer. I usually lose the scent in a couple of hours. I even have the perfume, same thing. But I do love the scents.</li>
            <li> Smells good but scent does not last at all</li>
            <li> sensitive to a lot of perfumes. This one is so so.</li>
            <li> Fragrance very weak......will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> All is good.  Arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
            <li> I now know what Heaven is going to smell like.  I love this scent.</li>
            <li> Got this because no Inner Grace spritz is available anywhere.  Like it, but Pure Grace does not come close to Inner Grace..  This has more of a soap and water scent.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL FRAGRANCE!! DO NOT BUY! Would give zero stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Scent does not stay on long , have to keep reapplying it.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This is probably my most favorite philosophy fragrance next to Amazing Grace;  it is a clean and not overly sweet fragrance.  I spray it over the coordinating lotion for a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff great for my psoriasis thank you</li>
            <li> Great price, convenient purchase. That was all I needed. If you haven&#x27;t tried this line, you should. Soft fragrances that can be worn every day.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars only because it seems Pure Grace is not for me, I use it on knock around the house days but I like a little more ooomph for going to work, etc.  Great for the price, it was a new, sealed bottle and shipped out very quickly</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this body spray. It has a just out of the shower smell. Light and refreshing. I will always keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  One of my favorite things from the Philosophy line.</li>
            <li> Pure grace has such a clean fresh smell I use it for a body spritz and also to freshen the air in the house</li>
            <li> Even though I thought I was buying &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; scent, this one is OK.  It is not the one I thought I was buying, but the product arrived in good condition and on time.  I need to pay more attention to the details for the scent, otherwise this purchase was a good transaction.  The product arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
            <li> This scent is so perfect for everyday.  I layer this with the whipped body cream and it stays with me all day.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Most all colognes/perfumes smell like bug spray to me and this is a cleaner scent, a lot like the scent of French soap.  I get compliments all of the time from men and women.  I complimented a woman the other day on her fragrance and she said it was Philosophy Amazing Grace.  The Amazing Grace is a little sweeter smelling than the Pure Grace, but I prefer the Pure Grace for its clean fragrance.  Love this!  I spritz this all over after a shower..</li>
            <li> Love this product.Love the clean but not overwhelming fragrance.Would definitely re-purchase when depleted.Great for women who can not wear many fragrances due to migraine headaches.The lotion is great as well with an even lighter smell.</li>
            <li> Love the clean scent smell.  This one of many that is awesome.  It will last all day even tho you can&#x27;t smell it on you some one will . Like it states it&#x27;s Amazing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Grace - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Not very fragrant - has a definitely rubbing alcohol smell. I&#x27;m guessing this was OLD product as I generally love this fragrance.</li>
