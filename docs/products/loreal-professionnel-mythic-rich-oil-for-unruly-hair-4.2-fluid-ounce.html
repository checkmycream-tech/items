            <li>Hair feels nice and smooth/</li>
            <li>Really works good along with my curling iron for my frizzy hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair straightener work so much more effectively with this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Said it made the hairshaft lay better, and hair not as &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and it is the best frizz tamer, shine producer</li>
            <li>I put a squirt or two in my palms and rub it mostly into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I use just a squirt or two most days of the week.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Does make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I originally received this to try it as a consumer opinion panelist.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and easy to dry, plus I swear it keeps it straighter longer.  </li>
            <li>Was using originally using morroacan oil on my coarse hair, but my hairdresser recommended this.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended  this to other people and they love it.</li>
            <li>I bought it originally from my hair salon, but it&#x27;s just a few dollars cheaper on Amazon - and worth the spend.</li>
            <li>I use it instead of conditioner, which weighs down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I keep looking for a miracle product to tame the frizzies and this one seems to be as good as any but certainly no miracle.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>This is such a light oil that it does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>i really liked it but the only thing is that when it arrived it was open, i mean the box the bottle was in, rest i like it</li>
            <li>Its rich you use very little.  </li>
            <li>Did not do much for my hair as expected.  </li>

            <li> Great &amp;#34;tamer&amp;#34; for the snarls and frizz</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot for my hair.  My hair is very thick and coarse.  I keep looking for a miracle product to tame the frizzies and this one seems to be as good as any but certainly no miracle.  I bought it after reading so many positive reviews.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair...</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other oil you can buy in a regular store...it&#x27;s okay.  Not worth the price.  Buy another brand cheaper.</li>
            <li> Literally life changing.  Makes my hair super soft and easy to dry, plus I swear it keeps it straighter longer.  I have VERY long, thick, wavy hair and this helps!</li>
            <li> This product delivers.  Its rich you use very little.  A little goes a long way. I have recommended  this to other people and they love it.</li>
            <li> I originally received this to try it as a consumer opinion panelist.  I desperately wanted to know what it was from the first time I tried it!  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and it is the best frizz tamer, shine producer this 66-year-old woman with salt and pepper hair has ever used!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great product!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist. I use it instead of conditioner, which weighs down my fine hair. I put a squirt or two in my palms and rub it mostly into the ends of my hair. Conditions and detangles while enhancing volume.</li>
            <li> Tried lots of different products but they all made my hair feel heavy.  This product makes my hair soft and smooth.  Love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Love, this product!  Even use it on my dogs hair!</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small, but I&#x27;ve had this bottle for close to a year and I use just a squirt or two most days of the week. I have naturally dry hair in general, but it does not grease my hair at all and it makes my hair straightener work so much more effectively with this.

            <li> Really works good along with my curling iron for my frizzy hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shinny.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps with my frizzy hair on rainy days.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Did not do much for my hair as expected.  Ihosever would like to keep using it.</li>
