            <li>I love this soap!</li>
            <li>Love the soap!  </li>
            <li>(hey it worked great and was cheap).</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, is non-drying, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>After having them out of the box for a while, the scent disippated and the soap is quite nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>The soap is kind of nice</li>
            <li>The Best Natural soap on the market today!!!</li>
            <li>One of the things we did was to order a sample pack of Cal Ben&#x27;s more popular</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing some more soon.</li>
            <li>I also love the coconut type smell.</li>
            <li>I love the Dr. Bronner brand</li>
            <li>I have 1 more bar of this I haven&#x27;t grated yet</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s never been able to find a laundry detergent that didn&#x27;t cause her some pain and rash, and could never even think about using a laundry powder.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I cant ask for more.</li>
            <li>I have switched to Dr. Bonners Miracle soap and like it better.</li>
            <li>A great soap for the price and natural ingredients...can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all-natural, has a light almond scent, and does the trick for cleansing.</li>
            <li>(It smells like an almond pastry every time I open the container) and makes me happy to do my laundry.</li>
            <li>Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s natural but who knows....</li>
            <li>I find that organic soap doesn&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes our skin feel clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li>I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal.</li>
            <li>Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well.</li>
            <li>She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder.</li>
            <li>Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop.</li>
            <li>Its a nice hard soap,  foams well, and leaves the skin nice.</li>
            <li>But so worth knowing what&#x27;s in your soap.</li>
            <li>This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size, lathers well, cleans well, and lasts for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and seemed legit when it came to being all natural.</li>
            <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t going to buy it because i could not find the ingredients to this soap.</li>
            <li>I noticed the price was getting higher every time I would order it.</li>
            <li>Good to know I am not putting a bunch of harsh chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for one family member who has excema - we got it for that person, but we ALL love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>might be certain ingredients still lingering.</li>
            <li>It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling.</li>
            <li>So really i have no clue whats really in this soap</li>
            <li>but my wife will not let me use it in our master bathroom shower because the almond smell is rather overpowering..  Really odiferous.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line.</li>
            <li>When you first open the package it has a strong almond smell, but that goes away once the soap is in use, so nothing is left on the skin.</li>
            <li>both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; better mentally.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have bought Pure and Natural Soap from Amazon for quite some time now because my wife has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t deny that the soap got my skin as clean as any other soap I&#x27;ve used (if not cleaner) and did it with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was looking up all natural soap</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I prefer natural products.</li>
            <li>and I now reside with dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon prices fluctuate wildly at times so I will leave that matter up to the shopper to decide.</li>
            <li>We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the &amp;#34;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;Â® Collection&amp;#34; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo.</li>
            <li>So after doing some research, I now know I can order this soap directly from the factory.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in hopes of finding a &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; natural soap.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I was completely overwhelmed by the almond scent.</li>
            <li>I used this soap, it works well and is natural.</li>
            <li>It has nothing strange added, no antibacterials or &amp;#34;cleansing cream&amp;#34; and is nice and hard so it lasts in the shower.</li>
            <li>Back in the old days a lot of backyard mechanics like myself used to wash greasy parts and our hands in gasoline, diesel, turpentine, kerosene etc.</li>
            <li>Extreme fast shipping.</li>
            <li>wife and I had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a late night satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller, which on Amazon can change abruptly.</li>
            <li>Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right).</li>

            <li> Sorry Amazon, I will no longer be ordering this product from you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this soap.  It smells, feels, and works good.  None of the junk that dries you out and leaves you itchy.  This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I was looking up all natural soap and i came across this soap. It was cheap and seemed legit when it came to being all natural. At first i wasn&#x27;t going to buy it because i could not find the ingredients to this soap. So i thought maybe if i buy it then it should have the ingredients on the soap somewhere or with the pack of soap......Nope! So really i have no clue whats really in this soap so i&#x27;m not using it. I threw mine out. Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for my family for at least 4 years. It&#x27;s all-natural, has a light almond scent, and does the trick for cleansing. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price, especially if free shipping is offered. I buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I have sensitive skin and I prefer natural products. This is so affordable and simple. A great soap for the price and natural ingredients...can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Love the soap!  It lathers nicely, is non-drying, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  I wish I could purchase larger bars, though.</li>
            <li> The Best Natural soap on the market today!!! Love this stuff</li>
            <li> This soap turned out being everyting I expected.  It&#x27;s the right size, lathers well, cleans well, and lasts for quite some time.  I rate it a 5.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s natural but who knows....might be certain ingredients still lingering. I find that organic soap doesn&#x27;t clean as well and I now reside with dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Extreme fast shipping. I love this soap. I plan on purchasing some more soon. I have very sensitive skin so this soap works well. I also love the coconut type smell. Keep on making this soap for people like me and I will keep buying as long as the price doesn&#x27;t get out of control.</li>
            <li> I grated this for use in my homemade laundry soap. It works SOOOO well, smells DIVINE (It smells like an almond pastry every time I open the container) and makes me happy to do my laundry. I love the Dr. Bronner brand so I purchased one of their almond bars for use in my shower (I use their liquid almond soap + coconut milk as my shampoo), but it has 0 scent; not like this little beauty! I have 1 more bar of this I haven&#x27;t grated yet and I actually leave it on my kitchen counter and sniff it every time I walk by. It&#x27;s yummy almond scent makes me happy. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again over any other brand of bar soap.</li>
            <li> Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop. I&#x27;ve never been one to worry about coming into contact with chemicals. Back in the old days a lot of backyard mechanics like myself used to wash greasy parts and our hands in gasoline, diesel, turpentine, kerosene etc. (hey it worked great and was cheap). I know guys who still do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a late night satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could. One of the things we did was to order a sample pack of Cal Ben&#x27;s more popular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; better mentally. It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling. I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal. I didn&#x27;t expect or even want the stuff to be any different from my Dial soap, because ordering bar soap on-line seemed like it would be a hassle. I couldn&#x27;t deny that the soap got my skin as clean as any other soap I&#x27;ve used (if not cleaner) and did it with all natural ingredients. We immediately placed an order for a four year bundled supply of all the Cal Ben 5 Star Soap products. Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line. Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes. She&#x27;s never been able to find a laundry detergent that didn&#x27;t cause her some pain and rash, and could never even think about using a laundry powder. Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well. I tried for three years to get her to try Cal Ben. Last year she finally agreed to let us give her some of the laundry powder, bar soap, shampoo and dish soap. She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder. A week later, she called and wanted to know if we could sell her some of our personal supply. Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right). We ended up placing a big order with Cal Ben and dividing the product between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon prices fluctuate wildly at times so I will leave that matter up to the shopper to decide. I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller, which on Amazon can change abruptly. We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the &amp;#34;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;Â® Collection&amp;#34; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo. Cleaning products are very heavy, so ordering in bulk really cuts down on shipping costs per unit and makes it convenient to not have to keep a close eye on our supply. This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance. I believe you&#x27;ll find, like our family, that you love the product line and will feel good about buying a product that is made here in the good ol&#x27; US of A..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance.

            <li> Calling it regular soap is a compliment here. It has nothing strange added, no antibacterials or &amp;#34;cleansing cream&amp;#34; and is nice and hard so it lasts in the shower. When you first open the package it has a strong almond smell, but that goes away once the soap is in use, so nothing is left on the skin. And you get a lot of them for your money. Great bargain.</li>
            <li> I have bought Pure and Natural Soap from Amazon for quite some time now because my wife has sensitive skin. I noticed the price was getting higher every time I would order it. So after doing some research, I now know I can order this soap directly from the factory. I will save a good amount of money by doing that also. Sorry Amazon, I will no longer be ordering this product from you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of finding a &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; natural soap. When I opened the box I was completely overwhelmed by the almond scent. After having them out of the box for a while, the scent disippated and the soap is quite nice. I would consider buying this again, but the price has gone way up.</li>
            <li> My family loves this soap.  It smells nice, but not overpowering at all.  It is gentle enough for one family member who has excema - we got it for that person, but we ALL love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes our skin feel clean but not stripped.  Even cleans our youngin well! :o)  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Simple, limited ingredient and low cost. Each bar is individually wrapped. They smell yummy and not strong at all. Just right. The bar is a bit smaller than your standard bar. But so worth knowing what&#x27;s in your soap. I cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Does not dry out my skin. Lathers up nicely. Good to know I am not putting a bunch of harsh chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this soap, it works well and is natural. Made in America. I recommend it. I have switched to Dr. Bonners Miracle soap and like it better. It&#x27;s more expensive though. I still like this product and would use it again. Still have some and I use it for hand-washing. Use Dr. Bonners for the shower though.</li>
            <li> It must be just my taste or something.  The soap is kind of nice but my wife will not let me use it in our master bathroom shower because the almond smell is rather overpowering..  Really odiferous.  Its a nice hard soap,  foams well, and leaves the skin nice.</li>
