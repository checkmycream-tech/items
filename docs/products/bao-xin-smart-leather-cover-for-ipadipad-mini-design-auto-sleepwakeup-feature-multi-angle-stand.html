            <li>Arrived one month after the purchase but the case is beautiful, worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>This one does not cover the top or bottom part of the phone, but it&#x27;s still a nice cover.</li>
            <li>and it was received very quickly!</li>
            <li>Nice and original, haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else!</li>
            <li>I decide to buy again, I won&#x27;t buy it. :)</li>
            <li>This case looks great and has a bright red color.</li>
            <li>the dollar tree make sure you look for this case</li>
            <li>I am very much pleased on the quality....</li>
            <li>Love love love the design...</li>
            <li>The case doesn&#x27;t cover any of the front and is just one of those snap on cases that is more for looks.</li>
            <li>It has a strong chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>It did fit the phone well without obscuring the camera.</li>
            <li>The case seemed cheap anyway even if it had fit.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special product....</li>
            <li>I am very please with how the case looks but it does not cover the top and bottom edge of the phone.  </li>
            <li>good product, love the pattern will definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants it.</li>
            <li>Pieces of the case snapped off the first time I took it off of my iphone 5.  </li>
            <li>I love the look of it, just wish it was rubber on the back versus plastic.  </li>
            <li>It was more a raspberry pink than a red, but I love the color and the style</li>
            <li>so i really don&#x27;t recommend you buying this ,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it would prtect too much if I dropped it, but it fits 5s just fine and has a unique look.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s cute, but doesn&#x27;t provide the protection most of us are looking for.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the early delivery got it Tuesday instead of Wednesday.</li>
            <li>and they had this exact same case no difference exept for the price .</li>
            <li>Surprised at Amazon for dealing with a merchant such as this.</li>
            <li>I like the case a lot, it&#x27;s thin and snaps on easily.</li>

            <li> I like the case a lot, it&#x27;s thin and snaps on easily.</li>
            <li> However it provided minimal protection.  </li>
            <li> I have washed it a few times with dish soap and even left it in soapy water overnight.</li>
            <li> so it is not very durable.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the aggrevation for a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> The case did not fit my iPhone 5.  </li>
            <li> It already has a small crack in it</li>
            <li> The case arrived quickly, but it stinks so badly it gave me a head ache.  </li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> Bao Xin asking me to take a photo of my phone and send it to them to prove it was wrong or else &amp;</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like is that it got dirty after 3-4 days of use.</li>
            <li> When I attempted to return it, I ended up in a rude and insulting e-mail volley with Evan @</li>

            <li> Pieces of the case snapped off the first time I took it off of my iphone 5.  It did fit the phone well without obscuring the camera. However it provided minimal protection.  Would not recommend this case.</li>
            <li> Arrived one month after the purchase but the case is beautiful, worth waiting for. Nice and original, haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Nothing special product.... If you like .... buy it, if you don&#x27;t like .... don&#x27;t buy !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to buy again, I won&#x27;t buy it. :)</li>
            <li> I like the case a lot, it&#x27;s thin and snaps on easily. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that it got dirty after 3-4 days of use.</li>
            <li> The case arrived quickly, but it stinks so badly it gave me a head ache.  It has a strong chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away.  I have washed it a few times with dish soap and even left it in soapy water overnight. No luck.  I&#x27;ll try baking soda or maybe vinegar and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would prtect too much if I dropped it, but it fits 5s just fine and has a unique look.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. The braid design has a nice feel to the touch. Very satisfied with this case. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the look of it, just wish it was rubber on the back versus plastic.  Otherwise, the look and feel is great.</li>
            <li> This case looks great and has a bright red color. I get lots of compliments on it. Would recommend buying this case.</li>
            <li> I am very please with how the case looks but it does not cover the top and bottom edge of the phone.  This will allow it to be scratched.  It already has a small crack in it so it is not very durable.  That being said, it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> It was more a raspberry pink than a red, but I love the color and the style and it was received very quickly!</li>
            <li> It broke a week after it arrived. It does not have very good quality. But a different phone case. Seriously</li>
            <li> READ THIS!! READ THIS!! READ THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this case here for 20$ and I went to dollar tree the next week and they had this exact same case no difference exept for the price . I paid 1$ at the dollar tree so i really don&#x27;t recommend you buying this , so next time you go tho the dollar tree make sure you look for this case and ima be like I told you so so don&#x27;t buy this case if you want to save money unless you like to not save money</li>
            <li> I liked it. I&#x27;ve noticed that I prefer covers that cover the phone all around and have cut outs for the lock button and the charging dock. This one does not cover the top or bottom part of the phone, but it&#x27;s still a nice cover.</li>
            <li> Got it today.......this case is beautiful .... I am very much pleased on the quality.... Love love love the design... I got the same design  for my ipad and same color... Thank you so much for the early delivery got it Tuesday instead of Wednesday.</li>
            <li> The description stated that this is a protective case. The case doesn&#x27;t cover any of the front and is just one of those snap on cases that is more for looks. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s cute, but doesn&#x27;t provide the protection most of us are looking for.</li>
            <li> good product, love the pattern will definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants it. loved it and will buy agin</li>
            <li> The case did not fit my iPhone 5.  When I attempted to return it, I ended up in a rude and insulting e-mail volley with Evan @ Bao Xin asking me to take a photo of my phone and send it to them to prove it was wrong or else &amp;#34;NO REFUND, those are the rules&amp;#34;.  How can I take a picture of my phone with my phone??  The case seemed cheap anyway even if it had fit.  Not worth the aggrevation for a few bucks.  Surprised at Amazon for dealing with a merchant such as this.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I have zero complaints about this phone case. Fits good. covers well. does it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
