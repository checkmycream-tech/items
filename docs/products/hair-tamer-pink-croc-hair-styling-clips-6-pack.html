            <li>Love love love these clips!</li>

            <li>Love these clips.</li>
            <li>Better than the crocodile clips I bought at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>The reason I love these better than the metal clips or butterfly clips is that...these croc clips do not pull my hair when I go to remove them from my hair..</li>
            <li>Easy to section with strong grip.</li>
            <li>These are much sturdier and hold my hair much better than the flimsy ones from the store!  </li>
            <li>They would be perfect except for the little teeth, they prevent the clip from sliding smoothly into the hair.</li>
            <li>Work great for larger section of hair</li>
            <li>I use them with my hair dryer and round brush to achieve perfect hair!  </li>
            <li>the glide out smoothly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>They secure a lot of hair in place and allows you to work on smaller sections in your hair and see what you are doing better.</li>
            <li>If you have medium to short hair claw clips are better</li>
            <li>Really nice clips--engineered to hold large chunks of hair or thick hair securely.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, strong, able to hold even my heavy, incredibly thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else comes close.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely well made, and very durable -- not cheap or plastic, like so many.</li>
            <li>These work great on my thick heavy hair!  </li>
            <li>The hold my hair like no other clips I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length thick hair and this clip is the only clip I have found that will securely hold my hair while I blow dry my hair layer by layer and to secure my hair while showering to keep my hair from getting wet.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are a little too sharp though and can easily snag on hair.</li>
            <li>They really hold tight in your hair, and they are pretty in pink!  </li>
            <li>Hold large amounts of hair, wet or dry and stay in place.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They are hard to use if you have medium length hair because they leave so much extra space.  </li>
            <li> I have thicker hair and usually have problems with clips just not holding or slipping.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> These pulled my hair so badly from the studs on the bottom part of the clip.</li>
