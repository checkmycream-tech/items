            <li> These pins really do blend with blonde hair and the pins stay in all day. My daughter has extremely light colored hair and I was concerned that the pins would show since they appear darker, but they remain camouflaged when we use them.</li>
            <li> Great for my ombré hair when I want to make a high bun. I use darker pins for anything else but this is great color to match ombré ends!</li>
            <li> The do the job nicely of holding your hair. No slipping, and a great color color for blondes, blend right in.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my blond hair. Was able to pin it up  and not worry about it sticking out like a sore thumb. it blended in nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product. No problems</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t change your life silly… they are just bobby pins.  They do hold that pretty bun in place though and could probably pick an old lock if need be.</li>
            <li> If you are a blonde, you need these.  This is my second package - I hate using regular bobby pins now because these look so much better against blonde hair.  They just blend in very nicely for updos/partial updos.  I&#x27;d recommend picking up a pack of these; it will make a difference in how polished your hair looks when it&#x27;s pulled back.</li>
            <li> Good bobby pins, do stretch out if used on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love using these for blonde hair clients. Great quality and durability. Awesome and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> These seem to be just what they say they are. The tips are good and they&#x27;re not too small or too large. Good for white hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;thank you~</li>
            <li> Match my honey blonde hair well. The gold does fade a bit over time, but they&#x27;re cheap enough to just replace every few months.</li>
            <li> Love the metallics! These are good bobby pins, a little more fun than traditional brown but without being too flashy.</li>
            <li> Love these oversized bobby pins!  Am so glad they come in a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use them all the time to help with my hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback - their price is ridiculous.  I needed them badly and just had to pay it but I felt it was overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is blonde with natural low light and high lights and these colors work really well with it. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it but I also really like their form or how they are made.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used bobby pins in decades.  But recently I purchased a wig and decided bobby pins might be useful.  To my dismay, these are not at all like the bobby pins I used years ago.  They are very thin and  flimsy-feeling and have a tendency to flip and twist when you try to open them.  I was surprised because Goody has always been a good brand.  I looked at the pack of the package they come on and, sure enough, I see that they are now made overseas. Sigh.  No surprise there. On the plus side, they do blend with blonde hair color...</li>
            <li> We bought to use nail polish to create &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; bobby pins as per a pinterest find. Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped! I still use these for my daughter, but they&#x27;re too short for me.</li>
            <li> I wear a wig that is blonde and these bobby pin match it nicely.  Great holding power.  Some time I use them as paper clips also.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the color, the pins seemed flimsy and would get &amp;#34;twisted&amp;#34; after putting them in my 4 yr old&#x27;s hair (bought to use when putting her hair up for dance class). Not strong enough to even use them in my hair. If you only use these for thin hair or to hold small sections of hair they might work ok.</li>
            <li> Nice comb, not much else to write, nice size too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic pins for blonde/brown hair. Love these.</li>
