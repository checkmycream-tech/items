            <li> My hairstylist uses Davines products in her salon. She recommended the Melu products to me because it&#x27;s made for strengthening long hair. I have naturally curly hair but during the winter I wear it straight which requires the use of a blow dryer and flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using the Melu shampoo, conditioner, and serum in my hair for almost a month. My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> this product is terrible..it says serum but its more of a sticky creme that smells terrible...it makes your hair sticky and does not work at all!</li>
            <li> quick service...product ok, not sure i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Davines! This really is light a d creamy and it makes dry frizzy ends looks like new! Use it on dry hair after you style for bestb results!</li>
            <li> Best hair softener.  I love how shiny and soft my hair feels.  Not to mention the fragrance.  I will purchase it again and again.  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from Amazon on several occasions.  It normally smells really nice. However,  this time it smells really terrible when first applied. The smell goes away within 5 minutes. The product still works in terms of strengthening my hair and preventing split ends.</li>
            <li> Great Product-my daughter can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> REally smoth the ends of my hair, it has taken away the split.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very silky. I&#x27;m also using the conditioner...now I&#x27;m going to try the shampoo...</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product and I found it on Amazon for 30% less.  I love it.  I have very fine, straight hair and every other product I use weighs my hair down and makes it look greasy.  This product really helps my fly aways and frizz.  I actually carry it in my purse and put it on throughout the day if I need to.  Winter static solved!  Occasionally I curl my hair and this product lets my hair have a curl to it w/out being puffy.</li>
            <li> best thing ever !!!!! I try it and leave my hair soft and smooth and the ends so manageables looking great</li>
            <li> This brand has noticeably improved the health of my hair. I love all of the Melu products: shampoo, conditioner, and serum.</li>
            <li> Great product for smoothing hair and preventing split ends.</li>
            <li> Love! I am African American and use it on the ends of my hair before I go to bed. In the A.M. I use the flat iron and it makes a world of difference and the smell is too die!!</li>
            <li> not sure if its the product or the seller, will try product from a salon and see. even though it will cost much more</li>
            <li> Funny enough I ordered this split end mender on accident wanting to order the Devines Melu protectant spray instead, but since I love all Davines products I decided use it instead of returning it and I&#x27;m so glad I did!
