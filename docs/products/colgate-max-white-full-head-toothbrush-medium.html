            <li>awesome price too!</li>
            <li>All in all a great product!</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>feels great and cleans wonderfully!!</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush for travel.  </li>
            <li>I have an electric toothbrush at home and this one is great for tossing in a gym bag or suitcase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great spare brush to have alongside my electric one.</li>
            <li>Great affordable brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This brush feels very nice in my hand and in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Not as good as an electric one</li>
            <li>The bristles are in varying heights, so they do a good job getting in the the grooves and around each curve.</li>
            <li>The design of this toothbrush is very interesting.</li>
            <li>So, I am just not all that thrilled with these fancy manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Either way, though, the toothbrush is effective at cleaning, so it gets four stars from me.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I liked the polishing-star concept ...</li>
            <li>The handle on this brush is very easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s just a toothbrush, but I made sure to let my girlfriend know about it before she found it for herself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Colgate Toothbrushes most of my life, without problems.  </li>
            <li>helps me get my gums better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, cleans well.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li>but my teeth do feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>, it gets your gums/teeth/tongue nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice handle that is easy to grip and medium bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the soft bristle, while ideal for gums, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>I like the ergonomic handle; it&#x27;s easy to hold and comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li>it brushes my teeth quite fine indeed</li>
            <li>I enjoy them when I want a break from my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Kept my teeth clean and is easy to grip/use.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I got on amazon and bought one myself.</li>
            <li>The medium really is achieved in a nice balance.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing fantastic about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of brushing my teeth without hurting my gums which tend to be on the sensitive side.  </li>
            <li>However, while it fits nicely in my hand, it does not fit nicely in my toothbrush holder!  </li>
            <li>but then I discovered I could take the top off my toothbrush holder, push the head of the toothbrush through a hole in the top the holder, and put the top back on.  </li>
            <li>far its the most interesting toothbrush that I have run into, in terms of design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The degree of clean</li>
            <li>It brushes clean and maybe does some polishing</li>
            <li>This is your basic toothbrush that can make a nice supplement to a more efficient Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>Clean</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this toothbrush is the handle - it is nice and thick and the ergonomic design makes it a nice fit in my hand and feels nice and comfortable when I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>It was fairly inexpensive, but serves its purpose well enough.</li>
            <li>but I didn’t find much of a difference from another toothbrush with more bristles.  </li>
            <li>B00ELI7U3C Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]]</li>
            <li>Usually love  Colgate tooth brushes but this one not so much since it has</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>and I found this one to be perfectly adequate.</li>
            <li>These new Colgate tooth brushes all have a very comfortable handle that has some pliability when in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I found it to be a pretty good brush.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush a lot more than the brush with the rubber flanges, but the loss of bristles makes it odd.  </li>
            <li>The one I got was bright pink.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the shape of the bristles of this toothbrush, but it is better than the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; series.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really do anything noticable and seems like just a gimmick to</li>
            <li>As far as ways to make a toothbrush more fun go, this one works quite well.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a pad on the back to clean my cheeks and tongue, like other models, but the bristle design is really very good.</li>
            <li>The bristles have the right stiffness for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are going to help with whitening any more than any other toothbrush, but they do make my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad or anything, but I just think paying a couple extra bucks would result in a much better result.</li>
            <li>The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  </li>
            <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  </li>
            <li>As with a lot of new models, this doesn&#x27;t fit into my existing toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>At first I wrapped the toothbrush in a paper towel and put it in my medicine cabinet after using it</li>
            <li>B0070PX7E4 Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] being my favorite and the one I&#x27;m currently using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is designed so my index finger grips the indention below the head and my thumb goes on top of the middle grip of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having tried many different brands of toothbrushes over the decades, I&#x27;ve settled on Colgate.</li>
            <li>They seem more comfortable to me than some of the previous brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li>The medium bristles are ok, but softer would irritate gums less; however, they do clean your teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like the bristles on these really do any MORE than the generic drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>For example, the handle is extra thick (which can be perfect for those with dexterity issues).</li>
            <li>There is more of these rubber polishing pieces on this Max White brush than there is on the Whole Mouth</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a Colgate toothbrush that is similar to these but has quite a bit less of the rubber polishing pieces in them, and focuses more on just adding more bristles, then check out the Colgate Max Fresh brushes.</li>
            <li>(Of course, full disclosure, my teeth are professionally bleached to the point where I cannot drink a glass of ice-water without blinding pain ...</li>
            <li>And because they are good quality, after serving for brushing teeth they can be cleaned and used for all the other home projects and tasks for which one might want to use an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like this one better than most other regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
            <li>On this Max White toothbrush the bristles are staggered at various shorter lengths on the inside of the brush, and the longest bristles are at the very top and bottom of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>are great toothbrushes with just a few variation in them that make them different.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really buy into the whole &amp;#34;max white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Even having brushed vigorously, teeth do not feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>I really like the star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I DO really like the ergonomic shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bristles on the brush are harder than most.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t really understand what the purpose of it is.</li>
            <li>It did seem to soften up a bit with use, but I don&#x27;t really like having to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The back of the brush head on the 360 Whole Mouth Clean bush is covered in rubber texture for cleaning the insides of the cheeks and also the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of the rather awkward handle, I am very happy with the Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is a significant break with traditional brushes.</li>
            <li>They bill their Extra Clean model as an \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium does polish as it cleans</li>
            <li>I like the design of this Colgate Max White Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and [[ASIN:B00A9YS9QO Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]]</li>
            <li>particular model is certainly better in quality than more basic Colgate toothbrushes, such as the Colgate Extra Clean model, but to me it&#x27;s not worth the additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Max White does seem to be a better tooth-scrubber, but given that I floss and use a Waterpik and Sonicare, etc., I don&#x27;t feel I need to spend extra on my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The star bit seems interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure yet exactly what benefit I have received from it.  </li>
            <li>The rather large handle feels decidedly masculine.</li>
            <li>I normally use a sonic toothbrush but when I&#x27;m at travel or at work I need a brush that&#x27;s convenient to stash.  </li>
            <li>The star takes space that normally belongs to a mix of bristles and rubber.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>The thick handle and light weight is ideal for the elderly or those with arthritis making a tight grip harder to do.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit too stiff for me (many dentists advise to use either soft or extra-soft to avoid brushing away enamel/abrading gums).</li>
            <li>I like the medium brush better than the soft bristle, with the medium you don&#x27;t have to brush as hard for clean teeth and as long as you aren&#x27;t grinding the bristles into your mouth your gums should not become stressed.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth and that&#x27;s all I really expected.</li>
            <li>The Colgate Max White toothbrush is similar to Colgate&#x27;s 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush, in that they both have bristles in varying lengths and they both have small rubber pieces nestled in between the bristles that is said to help clean plaque from teeth.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I like the full head.  </li>
            <li>They have a similar style, but have more bristles and less rubber polishing pieces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the medium bristles are effective and not too hard, and I did like the head size, handle grip and overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li>As an additional bonus, the toothbrush has a “polishing star” to help remove stains and reveal the natural whiteness of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I thought the bristles were much too harsh for a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush, and felt more like a harder bristle.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I would think the company could save so much money by making these in a basic color without all the business in the body.  </li>
            <li>whoever I talk to next thanks you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the polishing star is really more effective than normal bristles if you do a good job of brushinganyway, and it is a but squeaky on my teeth and can rub the gums the wrong way if you are careless in brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, if money were no object, I would probably regularly purchase the Max White and/or other premium Colgate toothbrushes instead of their more \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into bells and whistles and stars on my toothbrush, but this one leaves my mouth feeling pretty clean, without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are nice and firm, but not too firm.</li>
            <li>It is not really a remarkable product with something that just makes me shout that it is so much better than another toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>However, as far as toothbrushes go it&#x27;s fairly standard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s true, as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but it gives an odd/fun squeaky feeling while brushing.</li>
            <li>The 360 Whole mouth clean has bristles that are a little shorter in the very center of the brush, then all the way around the outside bristles, they are longer.</li>
            <li>I typically purchase a medium and this was a bit more stiff than I was accustomed to using.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are not too hard and my teeth feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>I can feel it gently polishing my teeth where other toothbrushes hadn&#x27;t reached before.</li>
            <li>I probably will look for a new toothbrush a little sooner than normal.</li>

            <li> (Of course, full disclosure, my teeth are professionally bleached to the point where I cannot drink a glass of ice-water without blinding pain ...</li>
            <li> And because they are good quality, after serving for brushing teeth they can be cleaned and used for all the other home projects and tasks for which one might want to use an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like this one better than most other regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
            <li> On this Max White toothbrush the bristles are staggered at various shorter lengths on the inside of the brush, and the longest bristles are at the very top and bottom of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> are great toothbrushes with just a few variation in them that make them different.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really buy into the whole &amp;#34;max white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Even having brushed vigorously, teeth do not feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I really like the star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I DO really like the ergonomic shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bristles on the brush are harder than most.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t really understand what the purpose of it is.</li>
            <li> It did seem to soften up a bit with use, but I don&#x27;t really like having to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The back of the brush head on the 360 Whole Mouth Clean bush is covered in rubber texture for cleaning the insides of the cheeks and also the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outside of the rather awkward handle, I am very happy with the Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is a significant break with traditional brushes.</li>
            <li> They bill their Extra Clean model as an \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium does polish as it cleans</li>
            <li> I like the design of this Colgate Max White Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and [[ASIN:B00A9YS9QO Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]]</li>
            <li> particular model is certainly better in quality than more basic Colgate toothbrushes, such as the Colgate Extra Clean model, but to me it&#x27;s not worth the additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Max White does seem to be a better tooth-scrubber, but given that I floss and use a Waterpik and Sonicare, etc., I don&#x27;t feel I need to spend extra on my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The star bit seems interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure yet exactly what benefit I have received from it.  </li>
            <li> The rather large handle feels decidedly masculine.</li>
            <li> I normally use a sonic toothbrush but when I&#x27;m at travel or at work I need a brush that&#x27;s convenient to stash.  </li>
            <li> The star takes space that normally belongs to a mix of bristles and rubber.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> The thick handle and light weight is ideal for the elderly or those with arthritis making a tight grip harder to do.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit too stiff for me (many dentists advise to use either soft or extra-soft to avoid brushing away enamel/abrading gums).</li>
            <li> I like the medium brush better than the soft bristle, with the medium you don&#x27;t have to brush as hard for clean teeth and as long as you aren&#x27;t grinding the bristles into your mouth your gums should not become stressed.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth and that&#x27;s all I really expected.</li>
            <li> The Colgate Max White toothbrush is similar to Colgate&#x27;s 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush, in that they both have bristles in varying lengths and they both have small rubber pieces nestled in between the bristles that is said to help clean plaque from teeth.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I like the full head.  </li>
            <li> They have a similar style, but have more bristles and less rubber polishing pieces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the medium bristles are effective and not too hard, and I did like the head size, handle grip and overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li> As an additional bonus, the toothbrush has a “polishing star” to help remove stains and reveal the natural whiteness of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I thought the bristles were much too harsh for a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush, and felt more like a harder bristle.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I would think the company could save so much money by making these in a basic color without all the business in the body.  </li>
            <li> whoever I talk to next thanks you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the polishing star is really more effective than normal bristles if you do a good job of brushinganyway, and it is a but squeaky on my teeth and can rub the gums the wrong way if you are careless in brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, if money were no object, I would probably regularly purchase the Max White and/or other premium Colgate toothbrushes instead of their more \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into bells and whistles and stars on my toothbrush, but this one leaves my mouth feeling pretty clean, without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are nice and firm, but not too firm.</li>
            <li> It is not really a remarkable product with something that just makes me shout that it is so much better than another toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, as far as toothbrushes go it&#x27;s fairly standard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s true, as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but it gives an odd/fun squeaky feeling while brushing.</li>
            <li> The 360 Whole mouth clean has bristles that are a little shorter in the very center of the brush, then all the way around the outside bristles, they are longer.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase a medium and this was a bit more stiff than I was accustomed to using.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and my teeth feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> I can feel it gently polishing my teeth where other toothbrushes hadn&#x27;t reached before.</li>
            <li> I probably will look for a new toothbrush a little sooner than normal.</li>
            <li> the back of the brush head on this Max White brush is mostly smooth, with just a small section having a little texture to it.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth and gums but have no problems using other Colgate toothbrushes, with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has raised bristles in front and back and a polishing star in the center of the head of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care so long as the product works.</li>
            <li> The bristles never fall out (as they sometimes do with other brands, especially generic and other bargain toothbrushes), and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I buy different toothbrushes for travel (no use lugging my electric toothbrush around due to the weight) and this works well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In fairness to the manufacture I did use this brush for several days but had to stop using it due to irritation and pain.</li>
            <li> As for the other bells and whistles, the varied bristles help get nooks and crannies on the entire tooth, front and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just fail to understand how the rubber polishing star can clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> There is not one single thing to like about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It seems like it takes less time to brush my teeth and the extra width</li>
            <li> The Max White model is less affordable.</li>
            <li> I wish this toothbrush was a little firmer and the back of the head had a tongue scraper</li>
            <li> There are little rubber flaps mixed in with the bristles which are supposed to polish your teeth.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem a little on the harsh side, but perhaps my gums are just sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is medium so not too hard that your gums maybe irritated and not too soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any extra benefit from the &#x27;polishing star&#x27; (it did feel a bit gimmicky)</li>
            <li> &quot;, this brush has a rubber \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; star in the center that purportedly cleans and polishes teeth.</li>
            <li> In this case, there are no bristles in the center.</li>
            <li> For the money I would have to spend (I change them out every month or two and more often if I have been sick)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a poorly designed, ineffective toothbrush, which I highly dislike.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the interior bristles are supposed to do differently from the other bristles</li>
            <li> It’s a little bit on the firm side and wider than a regular head.  </li>
            <li> and I think that star in the middle is working but its a bit hard to tell after 1 month of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oddly shaped grip is distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often found myself in odd situations of reviews through the Vine program.  </li>
            <li> However, as is the case in both brushes, the space taken up by the rubber pieces equates to less bristles.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a little bit odd feeling in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, both my wife and I noticed a difference in that after a few weeks use, our teeth appeared whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a toothbrush I look for a few things.</li>
            <li> On the Colgate 360 brushes they refer to them as polishing cups, because they are in a round shape.</li>
            <li> It has a small brush and a large handle that feels a bit awkward depending on my brushing position.</li>
            <li> The bristles were surprisingly stiff but otherwise worked well.</li>
            <li> the past month and this Colgate Max toothbrush feels too small and wimpy to me.</li>
            <li> Given that I floss, use a Waterpik and Sonicare (alternating between them), and rinse with horrible tasting yet dentist-recommended regular Listerine, I don&#x27;t feel a need to pay extra for toothbrushes that promise extra cleaning</li>
            <li> brush has very few bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard that I feel like it is scraping my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Works well, not too harsh!!</li>
            <li> all the ridiculously overpriced manual toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li> It makes bushing your teeth feel a little weird.</li>
            <li> A bit awkward</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> feels great and cleans wonderfully!! this is my to go toothbrush from now on!! awesome price too!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for travel.  I have an electric toothbrush at home and this one is great for tossing in a gym bag or suitcase.  The bristles are not too hard and my teeth feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> I wish this toothbrush was a little firmer and the back of the head had a tongue scraper thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a tooth brush. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this toothbrush is the handle - it is nice and thick and the ergonomic design makes it a nice fit in my hand and feels nice and comfortable when I&#x27;m using it.  However, while it fits nicely in my hand, it does not fit nicely in my toothbrush holder!  At first I wrapped the toothbrush in a paper towel and put it in my medicine cabinet after using it but then I discovered I could take the top off my toothbrush holder, push the head of the toothbrush through a hole in the top the holder, and put the top back on.  A bit awkward but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the rather awkward handle, I am very happy with the Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush.  It does a good job of brushing my teeth without hurting my gums which tend to be on the sensitive side.  As an additional bonus, the toothbrush has a “polishing star” to help remove stains and reveal the natural whiteness of the teeth.  I can&#x27;t say my teeth are all that whiter now that I&#x27;ve been using the tooth brush for a while but my teeth do feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a premium toothbrush in every way.  As with a lot of new models, this doesn&#x27;t fit into my existing toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind the colors are assorted!  The one I got was bright pink.  Didn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s just a toothbrush, but I made sure to let my girlfriend know about it before she found it for herself.</li>
            <li> Colgate knows oral hygiene they make quality products and this brush is one of those. Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium does polish as it cleans, it gets your gums/teeth/tongue nice and clean. It is medium so not too hard that your gums maybe irritated and not too soft. I don&#x27;t know about the whitening claim, but that&#x27;s where my mouthwash and toothpaste come in. Give these a try I enjoy them when I want a break from my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any extra benefit from the &#x27;polishing star&#x27; (it did feel a bit gimmicky) but otherwise this worked well.  Kept my teeth clean and is easy to grip/use.  I buy different toothbrushes for travel (no use lugging my electric toothbrush around due to the weight) and this works well for that purpose.  The bristles were surprisingly stiff but otherwise worked well.</li>
            <li> These new Colgate tooth brushes all have a very comfortable handle that has some pliability when in the mouth.  The bristles seem a little on the harsh side, but perhaps my gums are just sensitive. I&#x27;m not sure what the interior bristles are supposed to do differently from the other bristles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really buy into the whole &amp;#34;max white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34; gimmick but this toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth and that&#x27;s all I really expected. I&#x27;m not overly picky when it comes to the design pattern of the bristles on my toothbrush and I found this one to be perfectly adequate. All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> This brush feels very nice in my hand and in my mouth. The bristles have the right stiffness for me. I&#x27;m not into bells and whistles and stars on my toothbrush, but this one leaves my mouth feeling pretty clean, without irritating my gums. It&#x27;s a great spare brush to have alongside my electric one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Colgate Toothbrushes most of my life, without problems.  There is something about this toothbrush that hurts my gums.  I like the ergonomic handle; it&#x27;s easy to hold and comfortable in the hand but the bristles/polishing star hurts when I brush.  I do have sensitive teeth and gums but have no problems using other Colgate toothbrushes, with [[ASIN:B0070PX7E4 Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] being my favorite and the one I&#x27;m currently using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness to the manufacture I did use this brush for several days but had to stop using it due to irritation and pain.</li>
            <li> There is not one single thing to like about this toothbrush. Even having brushed vigorously, teeth do not feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has very few bristles. The soft rubber &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; star in the middle is of absolutely no benefit. The oddly shaped grip is distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a poorly designed, ineffective toothbrush, which I highly dislike.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the shape of the bristles of this toothbrush, but it is better than the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; series.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;polishing star&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really do anything noticable and seems like just a gimmick to me.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does not come with a built-in tongue cleaner like the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Maxfresh&amp;#34; series.</li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like the design of this Colgate Max White Full Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  I thought the bristles were much too harsh for a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush, and felt more like a harder bristle.  I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I normally use a sonic toothbrush but when I&#x27;m at travel or at work I need a brush that&#x27;s convenient to stash.  The handle on this brush is very easy to grip.  The head is really big. It seems like it takes less time to brush my teeth and the extra width helps me get my gums better.</li>
            <li> Not a bad buy. It was fairly inexpensive, but serves its purpose well enough. I probably will look for a new toothbrush a little sooner than normal. It&#x27;s not bad or anything, but I just think paying a couple extra bucks would result in a much better result.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever. Order every order so I have on hand. 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great affordable brush. Girlfriend had it and I liked it so much that I got on amazon and bought one myself. Did I just admit to using her brush? Yes I did...</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked well and I think that star in the middle is working but its a bit hard to tell after 1 month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far its the most interesting toothbrush that I have run into, in terms of design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  It is a medium brush but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the polishing star is really more effective than normal bristles if you do a good job of brushinganyway, and it is a but squeaky on my teeth and can rub the gums the wrong way if you are careless in brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the medium bristles are effective and not too hard, and I did like the head size, handle grip and overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often found myself in odd situations of reviews through the Vine program.  I don&#x27;t know what to say about a toothbrush that seems to be working.  It is not really a remarkable product with something that just makes me shout that it is so much better than another toothbrush.  On the other hand, I like the full head.  It gives me a clean feeling.  The bristles are not too hard that I feel like it is scraping my teeth.  I like the back of these toothbrushes because of the &amp;#34;tongue freshener&amp;#34; because it makes me feel like I don&#x27;t have to scrub my tongue, which can make me feel like gagging.</li>
            <li> I really like the star. As far as ways to make a toothbrush more fun go, this one works quite well. It enhances the productivity of the toothbrush and makes me feel like a star when I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and firm, but not too firm. The medium really is achieved in a nice balance. On my fronts, this toothbrush is a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one better than most other regular toothbrushes. It revolutionizes your brushing experience and hopefully leaves you feeling like a star as well.</li>
            <li> So, I am just not all that thrilled with these fancy manual toothbrushes.  For the money I would have to spend (I change them out every month or two and more often if I have been sick) I recommend an electric toothbrush.  I just don&#x27;t feel like the bristles on these really do any MORE than the generic drugstore brands.  The degree of clean It is all about how you brush your teeth in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I DO really like the ergonomic shape of the handle.  It is designed so my index finger grips the indention below the head and my thumb goes on top of the middle grip of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an issue with how these toothbrushes have to be so &amp;#34;decorated&amp;#34;.  I would think the company could save so much money by making these in a basic color without all the business in the body.  Then Colgate could pass that saving onto us.  I mean, I don&#x27;t care if my toothbrush has cute little dots, stars and stripes on it because it lives in a drawer (which is where everyone should keep theirs to avoid fecal matter getting on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the ridiculously overpriced manual toothbrushes out there, this is one of two I would consider buying and using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush. Not as good as an electric one but it works when I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
            <li> Works well, not too harsh!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a little bit odd feeling in the beginning.  The star takes space that normally belongs to a mix of bristles and rubber.  It brushes clean and maybe does some polishing but I didn’t find much of a difference from another toothbrush with more bristles.  It’s a little bit on the firm side and wider than a regular head.  It&#x27;s ok, cleans well.</li>
            <li> The medium bristles are ok, but softer would irritate gums less; however, they do clean your teeth thoroughly. As for the other bells and whistles, the varied bristles help get nooks and crannies on the entire tooth, front and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rubbery star, they claim it polishes and whitens. I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s true, as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but it gives an odd/fun squeaky feeling while brushing. Does it contribute to oral health? Unclear. It looks neat and is probably more a flashy add-on to create the illusion of added value to justify the price. Either way, though, the toothbrush is effective at cleaning, so it gets four stars from me.</li>
            <li> Yum. whoever I talk to next thanks you</li>
            <li> or when the rest of the family is asleep and you don&#x27;t want the noisy electric brush to wake them up. The thick handle and light weight is ideal for the elderly or those with arthritis making a tight grip harder to do. I like the medium brush better than the soft bristle, with the medium you don&#x27;t have to brush as hard for clean teeth and as long as you aren&#x27;t grinding the bristles into your mouth your gums should not become stressed. With the soft bristle, while ideal for gums, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fantastic about this toothbrush. It has a small brush and a large handle that feels a bit awkward depending on my brushing position. The rather large handle feels decidedly masculine. I have been using a [[ASIN:B00ELI7U3C Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] and [[ASIN:B00A9YS9QO Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] the past month and this Colgate Max toothbrush feels too small and wimpy to me. However, as far as toothbrushes go it&#x27;s fairly standard.</li>
            <li> No doubt toothbrushes are beginning to advance.  From \\&quot;rubber flanges\\&quot; and \\&quot;rubber stars\\&quot; to bristles facing in every direction.  Colgate is making this push. This brush is in line with that change.  Unlike a brush I recently tried that used \\&quot;rubber flanges\\&quot;, this brush has a rubber \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; star in the center that purportedly cleans and polishes teeth. However, as is the case in both brushes, the space taken up by the rubber pieces equates to less bristles.  In this case, there are no bristles in the center. Also, the bristles on the brush are harder than most.  I liked this brush a lot more than the brush with the rubber flanges, but the loss of bristles makes it odd.  I just fail to understand how the rubber polishing star can clean my teeth. Nevertheless, both my wife and I noticed a difference in that after a few weeks use, our teeth appeared whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, whether you like this brush or not will be a highly personal choice.  It is a significant break with traditional brushes.</li>
            <li> it brushes my teeth quite fine indeed</li>
            <li> Usually love  Colgate tooth brushes but this one not so much since it has like rubber pieces I side the tooth brush. And I don&#x27;t really understand what the purpose of it is. It makes bushing your teeth feel a little weird. So will stick with the plan bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit too stiff for me (many dentists advise to use either soft or extra-soft to avoid brushing away enamel/abrading gums). However, there are benefits to this brush. For example, the handle is extra thick (which can be perfect for those with dexterity issues). Additionally, I liked the polishing-star concept ... but I cannot say that I see any difference in my teeth. (Of course, full disclosure, my teeth are professionally bleached to the point where I cannot drink a glass of ice-water without blinding pain ... ahh, what we won&#x27;t do for beauty!) This is your basic toothbrush that can make a nice supplement to a more efficient Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The design of this toothbrush is very interesting. There are little rubber flaps mixed in with the bristles which are supposed to polish your teeth. I don&#x27;t think they are going to help with whitening any more than any other toothbrush, but they do make my teeth feel very clean. I like the way this toothbrush feels in my mouth when I brush. The bristles are in varying heights, so they do a good job getting in the the grooves and around each curve. I wish it had a pad on the back to clean my cheeks and tongue, like other models, but the bristle design is really very good.</li>
            <li> Having tried many different brands of toothbrushes over the decades, I&#x27;ve settled on Colgate. The bristles never fall out (as they sometimes do with other brands, especially generic and other bargain toothbrushes), and they last a long time. And because they are good quality, after serving for brushing teeth they can be cleaned and used for all the other home projects and tasks for which one might want to use an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is certainly better in quality than more basic Colgate toothbrushes, such as the Colgate Extra Clean model, but to me it&#x27;s not worth the additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see at their site, Colgate markets a variety of toothbrushes. They bill their Extra Clean model as an \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; toothbrush. The Max White model is less affordable. Given that I floss, use a Waterpik and Sonicare (alternating between them), and rinse with horrible tasting yet dentist-recommended regular Listerine, I don&#x27;t feel a need to pay extra for toothbrushes that promise extra cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if money were no object, I would probably regularly purchase the Max White and/or other premium Colgate toothbrushes instead of their more \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; models. The Max White does seem to be a better tooth-scrubber, but given that I floss and use a Waterpik and Sonicare, etc., I don&#x27;t feel I need to spend extra on my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has raised bristles in front and back and a polishing star in the center of the head of the toothbrush.  The idea seems to be that you polish your teeth with the star. It also has a nice handle that is easy to grip and medium bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a toothbrush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has the polishing star.  I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase a medium and this was a bit more stiff than I was accustomed to using.  It did seem to soften up a bit with use, but I don&#x27;t really like having to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; a toothbrush.  The star bit seems interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure yet exactly what benefit I have received from it.  My teeth don&#x27;t seem to be any whiter than they were before, but after a bit of usage I do like the style of the head and the handle.  They seem more comfortable to me than some of the previous brushes I have used.  Overall, I found it to be a pretty good brush.</li>
            <li> The Colgate Max White toothbrush is similar to Colgate&#x27;s 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush, in that they both have bristles in varying lengths and they both have small rubber pieces nestled in between the bristles that is said to help clean plaque from teeth. On the Colgate 360 brushes they refer to them as polishing cups, because they are in a round shape. On this Max White brush, they are in a star shape so they are referred to as polishing stars. There is more of these rubber polishing pieces on this Max White brush than there is on the Whole Mouth Clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles also are a bit different between these two versions of tooth brushes. The 360 Whole mouth clean has bristles that are a little shorter in the very center of the brush, then all the way around the outside bristles, they are longer. On this Max White toothbrush the bristles are staggered at various shorter lengths on the inside of the brush, and the longest bristles are at the very top and bottom of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the back of the brush head on this Max White brush is mostly smooth, with just a small section having a little texture to it. The back of the brush head on the 360 Whole Mouth Clean bush is covered in rubber texture for cleaning the insides of the cheeks and also the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are great toothbrushes with just a few variation in them that make them different. If you&#x27;re looking for a Colgate toothbrush that is similar to these but has quite a bit less of the rubber polishing pieces in them, and focuses more on just adding more bristles, then check out the Colgate Max Fresh brushes. They have a similar style, but have more bristles and less rubber polishing pieces.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference. I can feel it gently polishing my teeth where other toothbrushes hadn&#x27;t reached before. Only downside is you don&#x27;t know what color you are getting and I don&#x27;t care so long as the product works. I plan on buying more for the rest of the family.</li>
