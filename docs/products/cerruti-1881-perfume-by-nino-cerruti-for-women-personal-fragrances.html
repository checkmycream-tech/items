    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>1881 by CERRUTI is a very beautiful and feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance!</li>
            <li>I call it my own fragrence!!</li>
            <li>Great deal for this size on amazon, as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of the best perfumes, and will make men turn too! :)</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience with 1881 Collection, I was hopeful that 1881 might be just as good and snagged a mini parfum (75% vol)</li>
            <li>She saw this online and wanted to try it out again and loved it.</li>
            <li>Well, for the price you still have a good deal.</li>
            <li>I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS PERFUME!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume EVER!</li>
            <li>I searched for this fragrance many places and was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it smells on her.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this perfume</li>
            <li>I have often wondered how authentic perfume is that you buy online.  </li>
            <li>I Love this..</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Hello Amazon: I love my cologn.</li>
            <li>This particular perfume was a great value on amazon and was given as a gift.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of garden filled with flowers, light and sexy</li>
            <li>Smells just great, my wife definitely loves it</li>
            <li>I saw this lotion at a local store with a higer price, so this was a great deal for me.</li>
            <li>the last I bought was a gift to a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li>People at the office tell me I smell nice even though it&#x27;s the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a soft sent which lingers on throughout the day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it , but it very light , and do not last more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, sweet scent that has a staying power.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing scent; the longest lasting fragrance that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am unable to find it in the store so was thrilled to be able to get it at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Nice to see a product not change over multiple decades and maintain quality.</li>
            <li>nice scent, fast delivery and came with small gifts, nice surprise</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase it for myself when I run out.....and perhaps will purchase as a gift for friends as well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty but uninteresting and characterless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The hint of musk is very alluring; the husband gave this scent a thumbs-up, and so it&#x27;s a winner for me!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of TRUE LOVE by Elizabeth Arden but a little lighter.</li>
            <li>Started using it in Europe and originally paid 120 Eu for the same size bottle.</li>
            <li>Ever since my cousin brought this back for me in a trio mini pack of parfumes from Italy I have gotten nothing but compliments on this one in particular, its not cheap, but worth the smell!!!</li>
            <li>but this new bottle I just received smells nothing like the ones I used to get when it was sold in department stores.  </li>
            <li>It is light yet sensual and although it has some flower notes, it is not distinctly floral.</li>

            <li> pictured real cerruti received fake with shiny cap</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with 1881 Collection, I was hopeful that 1881 might be just as good and snagged a mini parfum (75% vol) the moment that I found it. Unfortunately, 1881 is a soapy white floral on me. It&#x27;s pretty but uninteresting and characterless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self: Stop giving straight-up florals a chance. They just aren&#x27;t that into you.</li>

            <li> This is an amazing scent; the longest lasting fragrance that I have ever used. The scent is discernible on clothes even on the next day of application. The hint of musk is very alluring; the husband gave this scent a thumbs-up, and so it&#x27;s a winner for me!</li>

            <li> I will definitely recommend it to a friend in fact the last I bought was a gift to a friend and she loved it.</li>
