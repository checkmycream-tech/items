            <li>I read good reviews, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s kind of overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I also get a nice stain off it as it wears.</li>
            <li>nice neutral color and wears well.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>healthy, silky feeling lipstick, but needs many re-applications.</li>
            <li>silky moisturizing lipstick that comes in many colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay....</li>
            <li>I love this color, love the formula.  </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve had many over the years)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in love with the Nars Matte Velvet lip pencils.  </li>
            <li>More than just a &amp;#34;nude,&amp;#34; the color goes with probably 98% of everything I wear.  </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>so I thought this was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Great natural color.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is Bettina, a light pinkish nude.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wear- feels like lip balm.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, it does not bleed, smells fine, and it is a high quality lipstick.</li>
            <li>Color is perfect and lipstick is not too heavy, easy application.  </li>
            <li>Dolce Vita is such a great, neutral color choice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice matte finish and is very creamy.</li>
            <li>Cruising is a great nude and is the regular lipstick formula.  </li>
            <li>Years ago, I had Senorita, which is a  light brownish pearl color, and now can&#x27;t find it anymore.  </li>
            <li>how excited I was when I found it.</li>
            <li>Also nice is Sex Machine, a rose pink.  </li>
            <li>and  everyone makes nice comments about how natural it looks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loved it so much, I ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and the color is just right.</li>
            <li>I wear Bettina the most often but the other two are nice to have in my lipstick wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>this is such a very cute lip stick color.</li>
            <li>Seems like a lot of lipsticks have frost, not crazy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it for the quality that you get.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice neutral, not too dark or so light as to be ghostly.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft shade of dark rose of this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My first one ever was a gift from a friend some 10 years ago</li>
            <li>I have bought so many lipsticks before that looked different on.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this lipstick, I just like the matte pencils much more.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the natural rosy color.</li>
            <li>I love this color, but it is too sheer and seems to be gone in an hour, even if i don&#x27;t eat.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out.</li>
            <li>Shipping arrived at a reasonable time and the price I paid for this product and shipping all together was pretty reasonable also.</li>
            <li>that I didn&#x27;t really like much.  </li>
            <li>I also like Dolce Vita, which in the matte pencils is a light neutral red.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick.</li>
            <li>It is creamy soft, feels incredibly smooth and moisturizing, and offers just a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dry or waxy, wears comfortably</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a sheer red, but not the reality.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The shade is very close to my natural lip color but just a little more color (which was what i was hoping for).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I have put up with tube after tube of dry, orangey, overly bright or just plain drab lipsticks that clutter up my drawers and purses.  </li>
            <li>This shade has a very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking and whether I am matching it with a smokey eye look, or just some eyeliner and mascara, it makes my lips look fuller</li>
            <li>They really last a long time and don&#x27;t migrate into fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Dolce Vita is a dark rose pink.  </li>
            <li>The matte pencils are much longer lasting than the Nars lipsticks but they are waxier and not creamy, so if you&#x27;re prone to chap lips, they probably worn&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead</li>
            <li>It is also very silky and the color is just right for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The sheer needs frequent application, so that I go without lipstick all day since I don&#x27;t have time to reapply.</li>
            <li>Yep, dolce vita is just the right shade of pink for my skin coloring and is moisturizing enough not to dry out my lips.  </li>

            <li> The color is a nice neutral, not too dark or so light as to be ghostly.  </li>

            <li> The only reason not 5-star is because it did not last as long as it should given the price ($24).</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> Gipsy doesn&#x27;t last very long on my lips at all.  </li>
            <li> Still the lipsticks last longer than other lipstick formulas I&#x27;ve tried, so</li>
            <li> I have three of these lipsticks, the sheer red, Gipsy, the dark pink Dolce Vita and the slightly pink nude, Cruising.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The color is nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a winter/cold color person where pink is not really part of my color palette.</li>
            <li> The lip pumper stung a bit but it was about what I expected.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine how difficult it was for me to find just the right shade and</li>
            <li> Looks too dark and it makes lips look too dry</li>
            <li> the color was not exactly as shown in the ad</li>
            <li> It has a slight sheen and is creamy</li>
            <li> This is my go to everyday lip color.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, not sticky like gloss or thick like some lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> The color is hard to see online.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; to fins lipsticks that work.</li>
            <li> - I was wrong, I have tried other colors from NARS and others but this one remains my #1 choice.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t too dramatic and goes along with any type of make up you have on.</li>
            <li> the retailer is awful!</li>

            <li> the retailer is awful!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick!  It goes on smoothly and the color is just right.</li>
            <li> Very nice color and creamy texture.  Hoping to pick up another tube soon to keep in my desk at work.</li>
            <li> Dolce Vita is such a great, neutral color choice. My first one ever was a gift from a friend some 10 years ago and I thought, what was she thinking that&#x27;s not my color - I was wrong, I have tried other colors from NARS and others but this one remains my #1 choice. The lipstick lasts so I put it on in the morning and maybe reapply once during the day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color (Dolce Vita) on fair skin...healthy, silky feeling lipstick, but needs many re-applications. The only reason not 5-star is because it did not last as long as it should given the price ($24).</li>
            <li> silky moisturizing lipstick that comes in many colors. The sheer needs frequent application, so that I go without lipstick all day since I don&#x27;t have time to reapply.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Color is perfect and lipstick is not too heavy, easy application.  I would buy it again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay....never tried NARS before and I think it&#x27;s kind of overpriced.  The color is hard to see online.  It&#x27;s not too dry or waxy, wears comfortably but you do need to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> Love the soft shade of dark rose of this lipstick. I&#x27;ve been buying it for over 8 years and  everyone makes nice comments about how natural it looks. It has plenty of moisturizer for my lips as well. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shade has a very natural looking color. The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long so I have to keep reapplying it after everything. It has a nice matte finish and is very creamy.</li>
            <li> I love this color, love the formula.  It&#x27;s easy to wear- feels like lip balm.  I will buy this again when I use it up!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it. I have bought so many lipsticks before that looked different on. It looks like the color that is advertised and is sheer, without frost. Seems like a lot of lipsticks have frost, not crazy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it so much, I ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews, so I bought it. I am fair-medium, beige undertones. This color is almost invisible on my lips. On the bright side, it does not bleed, smells fine, and it is a high quality lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great natural color. Universally flattering.</li>
            <li> Great color. NARS is the best.</li>
            <li> I have three of these lipsticks, the sheer red, Gipsy, the dark pink Dolce Vita and the slightly pink nude, Cruising.  Gipsy doesn&#x27;t last very long on my lips at all.  It seems to disappear 10 minutes after application.  It&#x27;s the only Nars lipstick I have (and I&#x27;ve had many over the years) that I didn&#x27;t really like much.  I love the idea of a sheer red, but not the reality.  Cruising is a great nude and is the regular lipstick formula.  It has a slight sheen and is creamy but it lasts longer than Gipsy.  Dolce Vita is a dark rose pink.  Years ago, I had Senorita, which is a  light brownish pearl color, and now can&#x27;t find it anymore.  I like Nars lipsticks but I&#x27;m in love with the Nars Matte Velvet lip pencils.  They really last a long time and don&#x27;t migrate into fine lines.  My favorite color is Bettina, a light pinkish nude.  Also nice is Sex Machine, a rose pink.  I also like Dolce Vita, which in the matte pencils is a light neutral red.  I wear Bettina the most often but the other two are nice to have in my lipstick wardrobe.  The matte pencils are much longer lasting than the Nars lipsticks but they are waxier and not creamy, so if you&#x27;re prone to chap lips, they probably worn&#x27;t work for you.  Still the lipsticks last longer than other lipstick formulas I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;m giving them four stars.  Maybe one day I&#x27;ll find the color Senorita and stock up.  I definitely recommend this lipstick, I just like the matte pencils much more.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was amazing! The color wasn&#x27;t too dramatic and goes along with any type of make up you have on. Shipping arrived at a reasonable time and the price I paid for this product and shipping all together was pretty reasonable also. At the store this lipstick alone is around $23-25 so I thought this was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I have put up with tube after tube of dry, orangey, overly bright or just plain drab lipsticks that clutter up my drawers and purses.  Now that I have found NARS Dolce Vita I will never need another.  It is creamy soft, feels incredibly smooth and moisturizing, and offers just a hint of color.  More than just a &amp;#34;nude,&amp;#34; the color goes with probably 98% of everything I wear.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> The color is nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> Looks too dark and it makes lips look too dry</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. this is such a very cute lip stick color. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;my lips but better&amp;#34; lipstick. It is also very silky and the color is just right for everyday use. I also get a nice stain off it as it wears. Will buy again! Also--- I am a natural redhead and it&#x27;s hard for &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; to fins lipsticks that work. This is one of them!</li>
            <li> this is purely personal to me. the color was not exactly as shown in the ad and i didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick. It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out. The shade is very close to my natural lip color but just a little more color (which was what i was hoping for).</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my go to everyday lip color. It&#x27;s very natural looking and whether I am matching it with a smokey eye look, or just some eyeliner and mascara, it makes my lips look fuller and I really enjoy the natural rosy color. It can be pricey but I think it is worth it for the quality that you get.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but it is too sheer and seems to be gone in an hour, even if i don&#x27;t eat.  I wish they made this color in lip dye.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, not sticky like gloss or thick like some lipsticks.  The color is a nice neutral, not too dark or so light as to be ghostly.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> nice neutral color and wears well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a winter/cold color person where pink is not really part of my color palette. So you can imagine how difficult it was for me to find just the right shade and how excited I was when I found it. Yep, dolce vita is just the right shade of pink for my skin coloring and is moisturizing enough not to dry out my lips.  I&#x27;m a NARS fan!!!</li>
            <li> The lip pumper stung a bit but it was about what I expected. I have used it several days and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick. It looks like I.m not wearing lipstick when I am</li>
