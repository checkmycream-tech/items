            <li> Perfect for my 90 year old mother in law!  Tough to find these days.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers!  I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores and was delighted to see them on your site.  I plan on ordering the 1&amp;#34; and  the next larger size today  Thanks so much  The price is great  Patt</li>
            <li> Perfect size for mom&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I like the rollers.  They are very convenient and don&#x27;t damage the hair.  They are quite open so it&#x27;s easy to air dry or blow dry with the rollers and the snap on clips hold.</li>
            <li> all of these snap on rollers are the same, they are&lt;br /&gt;just the thing if you have arthritis in your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend trying to sleep on them so it&lt;br /&gt;is best to use them in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers, a throw back from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.  They are good for curl, do not crimp your hair....and hair dries faster, plus you are not burning your hair folicule.....great product.</li>
            <li> ( I bought 3 sets of rollers and my review is the same for all)&lt;br /&gt;Since my wife&#x27;s shoulder surgery I had to be her &amp;#34;beautician&amp;#34;. Her old, user unfriendly  rollers plus my big fingers didn&#x27;t do so well. As soon as she stood up half of the rollers would drop out. The criticism and verbal abuse  stopped  since I&#x27;ve been using these rollers.  They grip the hair and the roller is locked in place. No more dropouts.</li>
            <li> These hair rollers won&#x27;t close if you put too much hair in them which isn&#x27;t a lot. And a few of them got tangled in my hair and I had to cut my hair to get it out so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. When I asked for a refund they said to contact the company who makes the package. But if you&#x27;re hair is bone straight then it might work fine. Not for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I needed small rollers as I&#x27;m not handy with my curling iron. These rollers don&#x27;t pull &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; my hair. I&#x27;ll buy more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;And they are easy to use for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Brought these for mom exactly what she was looking for very happy with item</li>
            <li> When rolling short thin hair, this roller work securely in holding your hair and drying fast. Just love them! I have been using this type of roller for years and just recently found I could again purchase them since they are near impossible to find them in stores. Thnks</li>
            <li> they had a smooth surface withnogrip</li>
            <li> They are just what I wanted.  I wish I had bought more of them.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe next time.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was all the postage I had to pay for such a small package.&lt;br /&gt;I would think twice before I ordered again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my sister. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but she likes them. They got here really fast. Don&#x27;t think I would buy again though</li>
            <li> I could not be happier I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this size roller and could not find them. And I will most likely will order more.</li>
            <li> Product has little bumps on it which gets snagged in my hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t use them unless I wanted to go bald. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> Nice snap on&#x27;s ... they&#x27;re a good size for short hair and stay where they&#x27;re put!</li>
            <li> Very happy.Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and it got here very quickly.  The entire order was uneventful that&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be but still good.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I&#x27;m very pleased with these rollers.</li>
