            <li>it works so happy</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, FITS MY NEEDS</li>
            <li>WHAT EVERY I NEED AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in great condition and it includes two AAA-batteries which is required.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality.</li>
            <li>Those required a power cord for the built in battery.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding size and it does do the job, great for travel.</li>
            <li>but I would not say it is great.</li>
            <li>It lasts a couple of years and is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This will be great to keep in the car or at work for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Hey, for $10 this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Being Sicilian means there is unwanted hair over my lip - not too attractive on a woman.  </li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>I keep one in my Gym Bag for a great shave after a Steam Sauna, and another in my car&#x27;s glovebox for emergency shaves.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>Great product tho, and good for the price.</li>
            <li>I rated this product a five out of five and loved it, because it a great product to use</li>
            <li>my husband is thrilled!</li>
            <li>They would be wonderful if they were better constructed.</li>
            <li>Found this online and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!!</li>
            <li>AMAZON did a good job in managing the sale and delivery as promised.</li>
            <li>For its size, it does a really good job getting my whiskers without a lot of pulling or irritation.  </li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>but over all its a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true\\&quot;, it is...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Some to give as gifts and the persons who received them also loved them.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>work good for every day shave</li>
            <li>Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>The Micro Force is just as good if not</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a quick touch up, or for travel.</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with it and asked me where I got it.</li>
            <li>Works best when batteries are fresh and</li>
            <li>My husband uses it as an auxiliary shaver and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I gave this thing another shot!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve dealt with this seller and am very happy with them also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought two of them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It works great for when I am away from home and need a good quick shave.</li>
            <li>Now I have 2 of the best little shavers ever made for the best price.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>Shaver That I own.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, you want to turn a switch and watch your beard go away with no fuss or muss.    </li>
            <li>no charger is included..and you have to buy and install your own batteries before you can even use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the kind of person to complain but we are a none profite org.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for women&#x27;s facial hair just the best.</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of longer hair</li>
            <li>Great for quick shaves, touch up and for travel.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product, so far it seems to work</li>
            <li>Shaver is very portable and works great at a nice price.</li>
            <li>and I cut it very easily and was able to take the shaver out of the package.</li>
            <li>It fits very comfortably in a shirt</li>
            <li>I suppose its ok for touch ups.</li>
            <li>and you will be quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>i am glad i purchased.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been ok.</li>
            <li>Better off carrying a disposable razorblade or buying one at 7-11 in a pinch  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I started going thru so many batteries</li>
            <li>I would expect more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was able to test the Micro Force Shaver to see if it works well</li>
            <li>so, much better than the ones that are chargeable.</li>
            <li>It does shave ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order 30 more and will see what happens.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave with hair clippers.  </li>
            <li>people complain about not being able to cut longer hair</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit more out of curiosity than anything else.  </li>
            <li>If you try anything more than that, it probably won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not designed to shave anything more than the face.</li>
            <li>She is allegoric to straight blades, but this works great.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature on this razor is its wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have so many hair</li>
            <li>And while I was pleased with the job that product did</li>
            <li>most stores around have stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>He uses it every day, sometimes more than once.  </li>
            <li>mostly useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see it more as a travel one, for the emergency bag you may have in your car in case you get snowed in somewhere, or maybe in a drawer at work.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mention it, but the blade probably needs to be replaced every year as with most electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wore one out and bought two more because I wanted a spare.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used mine for the first time today and it did a good job, the one I have takes two AAA batteries, for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Still, pretty good.</li>
            <li>He really raves about it and was happy to know it was still available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, this could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t given it a good test yet.  </li>
            <li>Goes through batteries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>now this is a good buy now good price like it because it wet and  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first shave, I had the astounding revelation that \\&quot;It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>The screens are so fine, not even the finest hairs can get through to be lopped off.  </li>
            <li>It just works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Easy fix- spread some nail polish on those border holes, and the shave is close &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work, but it was fine with alkalines.  </li>
            <li>It did as good as my old DA!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the cheap little vinyl travel bag it came with.</li>
            <li>For some reason they have great difficulty making low end stuff that uses switches.  </li>
            <li>Batteries are cheap now).</li>
            <li>Light and portable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>This razor is not meant to cut off more than a day or two worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and cheaply made, but it does do what it&#x27;s designed to do</li>
            <li>(In all honesty I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do AS well with detailed hair lines (i.e. around the mustache and goatee).  </li>
            <li>They do such a great Job when it comes to detailing.</li>
            <li>It worked great for several years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I can&#x27;t see this as being my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good so far, as is ease of cleaning.    </li>
            <li>Very useful for teaveling.</li>
            <li>So having them around is nice and even nicer to find them online at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I love this super compact and economical shaver.  </li>
            <li>I always want to have one on hand,; however, my first one is still working well after more than 2 1/2 year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Humms while it does the best job of a small shaver.  </li>
            <li>Excellent small travel shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close, pretty smooth (mostly, except for around my goatee outline) and the best thing is - It doesn&#x27;t cause a mess of hair particles around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very small and easy to slip into your pocket works great!</li>
            <li>but they shave super close and smooth.</li>
            <li>A near perfect short life razor for women.</li>
            <li>I ues it daily for a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>Its my quick get fresh tool!</li>
            <li>not too great wet</li>
            <li>Then I can easily and thoroughly clean it with hot running water from the tap.  </li>
            <li>most assuredly gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and it removed some or most of my hairs in very teeny pieces.</li>
            <li>works for what it is made to do so too many words required so no one wants to rate on here</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s cool...</li>
            <li>This was the only electric razor that ever gave me a good shave.</li>
            <li>It actually does as good of a job as my Gillette 6-blade</li>
            <li>Great little shave with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfect for light use, pops in the purse if needed, lasts a long time but would recommend buying two - tends to quit suddenly, never to be revived.</li>
            <li>I keep this in my car for quick touchups for afterwork activities.</li>
            <li>ice for travel or a quick chin clean-up anytime.</li>
            <li>Broke quickly, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Certainly not the greatest, but nice little shaver.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d use this as my main razor, but for 5:00 shadow touch ups, and buzzing my head (I shave my head), it works great, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I checked the Amazon reviews to see if it was worth trying to return it, but I&#x27;m now convinced I am one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li>Bought it at Ross for only $7, my razor blades cost more!</li>
            <li>These little shavers are great.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver (but no trimmer), but</li>
            <li>While both give good shaves by themselves, each misses certain areas or does not cut close enough.</li>
            <li>and you get one that works free from defects,it works very well for 10 cheese bits..</li>
            <li>Not quit as sturdy and accurate as an expensive electric razor but does a real good job for me ( for under $10) can&#x27;t be beat).</li>
            <li>The rechargeable variety requires too many too frequent recharging times.  </li>
            <li>The Chinese are capable of making good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I will order this model again, but not the rechargeable model, which doesn&#x27;t do anything useful.  </li>
            <li>and I like it a bit better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>I already own 1 shaver and use it everywhere, especially when camping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are identical except this one runs on 2 AAA batteries, which I find more convenient but caution that the batteries run down pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts amazingly close and is a no- brainer for the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a good answer to a daily problem.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the battery cover is really hard to get back on and you are best off leaving the plastic cover on because you&#x27;ll probably have to brace against it to secure the bottom.  </li>
            <li>The small size makes it great for a travel/portable shaver.</li>
            <li>To paraphrase a popular commercial for a certain satellite tv service:&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Spend a little more for better results</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to open and close to change batteries, to clean the foils, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, has a sleek design and honestly, for ten bucks, you can&#x27;t much beat it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happily, I found it on Amazon, at the same low price.  </li>
            <li>However, I found that it fits perfectly in an old Gerber nylon knife case, so that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Especially useful in trimming loose hairs from moustache and shaving nose hairs that protrude from nose.</li>
            <li>Now after using this shaver i gata say it leaves my skin very smooth, just keep on shaving at the same spot, (or try with water)and</li>
            <li>It is rare when an &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; item lives up to its hype, but this one certainly does.</li>
            <li>I like it mostly for doing the back of my head though</li>
            <li>, it may be a better head shaver than a face shaver, provided your stubble is very short already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge razor from Germany for years, and I love the closeness.</li>
            <li>the ability to use 2AAA is fantastic as opposed to the old ones when they first came out.</li>
            <li>We always order 2 more when he opens the last one on hand.</li>
            <li>He uses it like most people use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought it expecting to return it after first use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back for more but hope there is a structural upgrade.</li>
            <li>I bought the first some years ago in an Office Depot, of all places.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased 2 more from Amazon.com and am back in business.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>shave is close enough for my liking, however you should be warned it will work with AT MOST a day&#x27;s stubble.  </li>
            <li>It even comes with an extra foil so that I&#x27;ll be able to replace the old one when it eventually wears out - and I&#x27;ll then be able to double the life of this great little razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is very small and seemingly great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so what did you really expect for ten dollars?</li>
            <li>one star demerit for not including the extra foil that significantly extends useful life</li>
            <li>Granted, it does run a long time on a couple of AAAs, but it accomplishes nothing more than to make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased, and will probably pick up another for my kit and keep this one for normal travel use.  </li>
            <li>5 days later my legs are staying pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>It is portable, does a good job shaving and the batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, since it didn&#x27;t work at all, it certainly didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.    </li>
            <li>It definitely provides a comfortable close shave equal to and better than the high end  </li>
            <li>small, light weight, easy to use &amp; fast!</li>
            <li>This is the only shaver that seems to really give a close shave to my mustashe area below the nose, and really removes all the fine hairs in and around ears.</li>
            <li>This product does not do what I expected it to be able to do.</li>
            <li>so it all worked out very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I think the key with this shaver is that you have to have a light touch.</li>
            <li>really works</li>
            <li>thinking it would be something I could use on my legs while getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The Shaver works very well.</li>
            <li>but it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But this one really does work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>they have been very satisfactory....</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend it to those in a hurry and need something cheap for a traveling kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Postage would have increased the price too much to return.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real complaints about the shave.  </li>
            <li>This thing would be perfect if it had a way of cutting longer hairs.</li>
            <li>Size really doesn&#x27;t matter....</li>
            <li>These are so cheap, you can afford to have several.</li>
            <li>Contrary to some of the other reviews listed here, I love the Micro Force razor.</li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first one died recently after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product delivers as published with expected results both under the WET and DRY formats.  </li>
            <li>, I use it against the grain after first shaving along the grain with a blade, and it works great, especially in small areas I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly</li>
            <li>When I shave with the Norelco, and then a quick finish up with this little guy, my face is as smooth as it can be with no misses.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it was so small</li>
            <li>He wore the first one out after a considerable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I believe  it performs better with less hassle.</li>
            <li>Works better than my razor and with much less</li>
            <li>Eventually I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll tire of the novelty and go back to my double, but for now, and for $10, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li>The MicroForce razor is small, compact, solidly built &amp; effective!  </li>
            <li>I dropped it and the blades cut right though the super thin screen (no damage to the razor itself), but they gave me two screens and it was easy to replace.</li>
            <li>shaver is high rpm.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the MicroForce.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver for a vacation, the office, the car and as a backup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this little razor.  </li>
            <li>Love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Glad i can still find these little guys online.</li>
            <li>A Bic disposable would have been far preferrable to buzzing around on her chin, leaving the hairs that were upsetting her so much.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely did not do anything as far as shaving.</li>
            <li>For the price, its not even worth the time or money to send this thing back and demand my refund.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is handy on trips as well as for daily shaving.  </li>
            <li>Comes with an extra foil, cleaning brush, and nice little pouch.</li>
            <li>This thing reminds me of the Yugo, a car that could be bought new in the 80&#x27;s for like $3500,...</li>
            <li>If shaver does not start with new batteries, bend battery contacts on cover to increase contact tension (works every time).</li>
            <li>that in mind, it&#x27;s shave is pretty good and while it does take a little longer since it&#x27;s a small blade</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this small shaver to shave some of the hairs off my tape line.</li>
            <li>It is pretty close to using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Gives very clean shave by not pressing down hard, but gently gliding over skin with many passes from different directions.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll stay smooth and spend less on blade</li>
            <li>It also has a nice little pouch thing and a brush, but the pouch is too small to fit the brush or extra batteries rendering it</li>
            <li>Since i cut my own hair and straightened my tape with a shaving razor, this shaver totally does the job, at first it did start irritating, but just give it some time</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver several times, for instance after driving several hours to an interview and I needed a quick brush up on the face.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use (RIP).</li>
            <li>MicroForce has always provided a much closer shave than my larger electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Sure, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to perform as a $100.00 razor, but at least work on some level.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll stick to using my old razor.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Each one I buy lasts for about 2 to 3 months (far cheaper than buying bags of disposable razors).</li>
            <li>However, it pulls your hairs frequently and that hurts like hell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, at least in most circles.  </li>
            <li>I picked one of these razors last summer at the beach not expecting much out of it.</li>
            <li>Gave as presents for on the go young guys</li>
            <li>(yes I opened a bit early)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is going to get as close as a classic double edge razor (especially a slant bar) except a straight razor (cutthroat razor).</li>
            <li>It is so small, it is probably easy to lose, and 2.</li>
            <li>I like that it is small and seems to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job of shaving really short hair in case you just want to maintain a goatee or a &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s small and compact, only 2 AAA batteries, cheap!</li>
            <li>so it is always ready to use, and does not lose its charge it if sits for a long time.</li>
            <li>I recently dropped mine on a concrete patio and broke it.</li>
            <li>Shave as normal, then use this shaver for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how much Medicare bills for them, as I am certain they&#x27;re not free.  </li>
            <li>I like the shaver very much but they are disposable since they don.t last very long.</li>
            <li>If I let my beard grow for a day or two, then I have to use blades or a larger electric to bring it back down, and use the Micro for a clean finish.</li>
            <li>the re-chargeable battery life simply died unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>This works quite well, the price is reasonable and it has not let me down.  </li>
            <li>Comes with extra foil because this shaver will last long enough to need a new foil.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the close dry shave I have now received on the 2 occasions</li>
            <li>For less than the rip-off price for a replacement blade set for another shaver, and much smaller to store, this little shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom who started having problems with facial hair due to new medications (she is in her 80&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I really prefer this little razor over more expensive models.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great quality.</li>
            <li> Those required a power cord for the built in battery.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding size and it does do the job, great for travel.</li>

            <li> Hey, for $10 this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Being Sicilian means there is unwanted hair over my lip - not too attractive on a woman.  </li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> I keep one in my Gym Bag for a great shave after a Steam Sauna, and another in my car&#x27;s glovebox for emergency shaves.</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> Great product tho, and good for the price.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a five out of five and loved it, because it a great product to use</li>
            <li> my husband is thrilled!</li>
            <li> They would be wonderful if they were better constructed.</li>
            <li> Found this online and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!!</li>
            <li> AMAZON did a good job in managing the sale and delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> For its size, it does a really good job getting my whiskers without a lot of pulling or irritation.  </li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> but over all its a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good buy.  </li>
            <li> it sounds too good to be true\\&quot;, it is...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Some to give as gifts and the persons who received them also loved them.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> work good for every day shave</li>
            <li> Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> The Micro Force is just as good if not</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a quick touch up, or for travel.</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with it and asked me where I got it.</li>
            <li> Works best when batteries are fresh and</li>
            <li> My husband uses it as an auxiliary shaver and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I gave this thing another shot!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve dealt with this seller and am very happy with them also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought two of them!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It works great for when I am away from home and need a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> Now I have 2 of the best little shavers ever made for the best price.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Shaver That I own.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, you want to turn a switch and watch your beard go away with no fuss or muss.    </li>
            <li> no charger is included..and you have to buy and install your own batteries before you can even use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of person to complain but we are a none profite org.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for women&#x27;s facial hair just the best.</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of longer hair</li>
            <li> Great for quick shaves, touch up and for travel.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product, so far it seems to work</li>
            <li> Shaver is very portable and works great at a nice price.</li>
            <li> and I cut it very easily and was able to take the shaver out of the package.</li>
            <li> It fits very comfortably in a shirt</li>
            <li> I suppose its ok for touch ups.</li>
            <li> and you will be quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> i am glad i purchased.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been ok.</li>
            <li> Better off carrying a disposable razorblade or buying one at 7-11 in a pinch  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I started going thru so many batteries</li>
            <li> I would expect more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was able to test the Micro Force Shaver to see if it works well</li>
            <li> so, much better than the ones that are chargeable.</li>
            <li> It does shave ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order 30 more and will see what happens.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave with hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> people complain about not being able to cut longer hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit more out of curiosity than anything else.  </li>
            <li> If you try anything more than that, it probably won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not designed to shave anything more than the face.</li>
            <li> She is allegoric to straight blades, but this works great.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature on this razor is its wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have so many hair</li>
            <li> And while I was pleased with the job that product did</li>
            <li> most stores around have stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> Still love it.</li>
            <li> He uses it every day, sometimes more than once.  </li>
            <li> mostly useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see it more as a travel one, for the emergency bag you may have in your car in case you get snowed in somewhere, or maybe in a drawer at work.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mention it, but the blade probably needs to be replaced every year as with most electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wore one out and bought two more because I wanted a spare.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I used mine for the first time today and it did a good job, the one I have takes two AAA batteries, for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Still, pretty good.</li>
            <li> He really raves about it and was happy to know it was still available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, this could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t given it a good test yet.  </li>
            <li> Goes through batteries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> now this is a good buy now good price like it because it wet and  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first shave, I had the astounding revelation that \\&quot;It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> The screens are so fine, not even the finest hairs can get through to be lopped off.  </li>
            <li> It just works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Easy fix- spread some nail polish on those border holes, and the shave is close &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work, but it was fine with alkalines.  </li>
            <li> It did as good as my old DA!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the cheap little vinyl travel bag it came with.</li>
            <li> For some reason they have great difficulty making low end stuff that uses switches.  </li>
            <li> Batteries are cheap now).</li>
            <li> Light and portable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This razor is not meant to cut off more than a day or two worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and cheaply made, but it does do what it&#x27;s designed to do</li>
            <li> (In all honesty I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do AS well with detailed hair lines (i.e. around the mustache and goatee).  </li>
            <li> They do such a great Job when it comes to detailing.</li>
            <li> It worked great for several years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I can&#x27;t see this as being my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good so far, as is ease of cleaning.    </li>
            <li> Very useful for teaveling.</li>
            <li> So having them around is nice and even nicer to find them online at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I love this super compact and economical shaver.  </li>
            <li> I always want to have one on hand,; however, my first one is still working well after more than 2 1/2 year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Humms while it does the best job of a small shaver.  </li>
            <li> Excellent small travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close, pretty smooth (mostly, except for around my goatee outline) and the best thing is - It doesn&#x27;t cause a mess of hair particles around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very small and easy to slip into your pocket works great!</li>
            <li> but they shave super close and smooth.</li>
            <li> A near perfect short life razor for women.</li>
            <li> I ues it daily for a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Its my quick get fresh tool!</li>
            <li> not too great wet</li>
            <li> Then I can easily and thoroughly clean it with hot running water from the tap.  </li>
            <li> most assuredly gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and it removed some or most of my hairs in very teeny pieces.</li>
            <li> works for what it is made to do so too many words required so no one wants to rate on here</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s cool...</li>
            <li> This was the only electric razor that ever gave me a good shave.</li>
            <li> It actually does as good of a job as my Gillette 6-blade</li>
            <li> Great little shave with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect for light use, pops in the purse if needed, lasts a long time but would recommend buying two - tends to quit suddenly, never to be revived.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car for quick touchups for afterwork activities.</li>
            <li> ice for travel or a quick chin clean-up anytime.</li>
            <li> Broke quickly, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the greatest, but nice little shaver.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d use this as my main razor, but for 5:00 shadow touch ups, and buzzing my head (I shave my head), it works great, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked the Amazon reviews to see if it was worth trying to return it, but I&#x27;m now convinced I am one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li> Bought it at Ross for only $7, my razor blades cost more!</li>
            <li> These little shavers are great.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver (but no trimmer), but</li>
            <li> While both give good shaves by themselves, each misses certain areas or does not cut close enough.</li>
            <li> and you get one that works free from defects,it works very well for 10 cheese bits..</li>
            <li> Not quit as sturdy and accurate as an expensive electric razor but does a real good job for me ( for under $10) can&#x27;t be beat).</li>
            <li> The rechargeable variety requires too many too frequent recharging times.  </li>
            <li> The Chinese are capable of making good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I will order this model again, but not the rechargeable model, which doesn&#x27;t do anything useful.  </li>
            <li> and I like it a bit better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> I already own 1 shaver and use it everywhere, especially when camping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are identical except this one runs on 2 AAA batteries, which I find more convenient but caution that the batteries run down pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts amazingly close and is a no- brainer for the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a good answer to a daily problem.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the battery cover is really hard to get back on and you are best off leaving the plastic cover on because you&#x27;ll probably have to brace against it to secure the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it great for a travel/portable shaver.</li>
            <li> To paraphrase a popular commercial for a certain satellite tv service:&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Spend a little more for better results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to open and close to change batteries, to clean the foils, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, has a sleek design and honestly, for ten bucks, you can&#x27;t much beat it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happily, I found it on Amazon, at the same low price.  </li>
            <li> However, I found that it fits perfectly in an old Gerber nylon knife case, so that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Especially useful in trimming loose hairs from moustache and shaving nose hairs that protrude from nose.</li>
            <li> Now after using this shaver i gata say it leaves my skin very smooth, just keep on shaving at the same spot, (or try with water)and</li>
            <li> It is rare when an &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; item lives up to its hype, but this one certainly does.</li>
            <li> I like it mostly for doing the back of my head though</li>
            <li> , it may be a better head shaver than a face shaver, provided your stubble is very short already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge razor from Germany for years, and I love the closeness.</li>
            <li> the ability to use 2AAA is fantastic as opposed to the old ones when they first came out.</li>
            <li> We always order 2 more when he opens the last one on hand.</li>
            <li> He uses it like most people use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought it expecting to return it after first use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back for more but hope there is a structural upgrade.</li>
            <li> I bought the first some years ago in an Office Depot, of all places.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased 2 more from Amazon.com and am back in business.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> shave is close enough for my liking, however you should be warned it will work with AT MOST a day&#x27;s stubble.  </li>
            <li> It even comes with an extra foil so that I&#x27;ll be able to replace the old one when it eventually wears out - and I&#x27;ll then be able to double the life of this great little razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is very small and seemingly great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so what did you really expect for ten dollars?</li>
            <li> one star demerit for not including the extra foil that significantly extends useful life</li>
            <li> Granted, it does run a long time on a couple of AAAs, but it accomplishes nothing more than to make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased, and will probably pick up another for my kit and keep this one for normal travel use.  </li>
            <li> 5 days later my legs are staying pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> It is portable, does a good job shaving and the batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, since it didn&#x27;t work at all, it certainly didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.    </li>
            <li> It definitely provides a comfortable close shave equal to and better than the high end  </li>
            <li> small, light weight, easy to use &amp; fast!</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver that seems to really give a close shave to my mustashe area below the nose, and really removes all the fine hairs in and around ears.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what I expected it to be able to do.</li>
            <li> so it all worked out very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I think the key with this shaver is that you have to have a light touch.</li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> thinking it would be something I could use on my legs while getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The Shaver works very well.</li>
            <li> but it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But this one really does work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> they have been very satisfactory....</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it to those in a hurry and need something cheap for a traveling kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Postage would have increased the price too much to return.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any real complaints about the shave.  </li>
            <li> This thing would be perfect if it had a way of cutting longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Size really doesn&#x27;t matter....</li>
            <li> These are so cheap, you can afford to have several.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some of the other reviews listed here, I love the Micro Force razor.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first one died recently after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product delivers as published with expected results both under the WET and DRY formats.  </li>
            <li> , I use it against the grain after first shaving along the grain with a blade, and it works great, especially in small areas I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly</li>
            <li> When I shave with the Norelco, and then a quick finish up with this little guy, my face is as smooth as it can be with no misses.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it was so small</li>
            <li> He wore the first one out after a considerable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I believe  it performs better with less hassle.</li>
            <li> Works better than my razor and with much less</li>
            <li> Eventually I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll tire of the novelty and go back to my double, but for now, and for $10, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> The MicroForce razor is small, compact, solidly built &amp; effective!  </li>
            <li> I dropped it and the blades cut right though the super thin screen (no damage to the razor itself), but they gave me two screens and it was easy to replace.</li>
            <li> shaver is high rpm.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the MicroForce.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver for a vacation, the office, the car and as a backup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this little razor.  </li>
            <li> Love this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Glad i can still find these little guys online.</li>
            <li> A Bic disposable would have been far preferrable to buzzing around on her chin, leaving the hairs that were upsetting her so much.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely did not do anything as far as shaving.</li>
            <li> For the price, its not even worth the time or money to send this thing back and demand my refund.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is handy on trips as well as for daily shaving.  </li>
            <li> Comes with an extra foil, cleaning brush, and nice little pouch.</li>
            <li> This thing reminds me of the Yugo, a car that could be bought new in the 80&#x27;s for like $3500,...</li>
            <li> If shaver does not start with new batteries, bend battery contacts on cover to increase contact tension (works every time).</li>
            <li> that in mind, it&#x27;s shave is pretty good and while it does take a little longer since it&#x27;s a small blade</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this small shaver to shave some of the hairs off my tape line.</li>
            <li> It is pretty close to using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Gives very clean shave by not pressing down hard, but gently gliding over skin with many passes from different directions.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll stay smooth and spend less on blade</li>
            <li> It also has a nice little pouch thing and a brush, but the pouch is too small to fit the brush or extra batteries rendering it</li>
            <li> Since i cut my own hair and straightened my tape with a shaving razor, this shaver totally does the job, at first it did start irritating, but just give it some time</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver several times, for instance after driving several hours to an interview and I needed a quick brush up on the face.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use (RIP).</li>
            <li> MicroForce has always provided a much closer shave than my larger electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Sure, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to perform as a $100.00 razor, but at least work on some level.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll stick to using my old razor.  </li>
            <li> Arrived early.  </li>
            <li> Each one I buy lasts for about 2 to 3 months (far cheaper than buying bags of disposable razors).</li>
            <li> However, it pulls your hairs frequently and that hurts like hell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, at least in most circles.  </li>
            <li> I picked one of these razors last summer at the beach not expecting much out of it.</li>
            <li> Gave as presents for on the go young guys</li>
            <li> (yes I opened a bit early)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is going to get as close as a classic double edge razor (especially a slant bar) except a straight razor (cutthroat razor).</li>
            <li> It is so small, it is probably easy to lose, and 2.</li>
            <li> I like that it is small and seems to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of shaving really short hair in case you just want to maintain a goatee or a &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s small and compact, only 2 AAA batteries, cheap!</li>
            <li> so it is always ready to use, and does not lose its charge it if sits for a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently dropped mine on a concrete patio and broke it.</li>
            <li> Shave as normal, then use this shaver for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how much Medicare bills for them, as I am certain they&#x27;re not free.  </li>
            <li> I like the shaver very much but they are disposable since they don.t last very long.</li>
            <li> If I let my beard grow for a day or two, then I have to use blades or a larger electric to bring it back down, and use the Micro for a clean finish.</li>
            <li> the re-chargeable battery life simply died unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> This works quite well, the price is reasonable and it has not let me down.  </li>
            <li> Comes with extra foil because this shaver will last long enough to need a new foil.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the close dry shave I have now received on the 2 occasions</li>
            <li> For less than the rip-off price for a replacement blade set for another shaver, and much smaller to store, this little shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who started having problems with facial hair due to new medications (she is in her 80&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I really prefer this little razor over more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> Barely works at all when used dry.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget gave me at least as good, if not better, a shave than all of the $50.00-$100.00 electric shavers I have ever had</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m late going somewhere and need to do a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li> Their only problem is they dont last terribly long.</li>
            <li> Though small, this razor seems very well built and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> no good, with fresh batteries and nothing, leave me in the face all irritated by lack of edge.. . . .</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work on long beards since they only cut the ends of each hair folicle, and for some people you may need a touch-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small, maybe as wide and long as a playing card.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who wanted a small travel size shaver on the go.</li>
            <li> but if your hair is that long why bother?</li>
            <li> I had bought one from TV Commercial, tried it 3 times and cut my face till it bled...despite having been careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible the rechareables were too close to empty</li>
            <li> your Microforce razor wears out after 4 years, you go back to shaving your slightly fuzzy upper lip with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> You could possibly use it to shave other body parts, but it&#x27;s not designed for that</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that stated that the razor works well when your beard is already short.  </li>
            <li> Will not work on thick beard or very thick whiskers (like most electric shavers).  </li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> Difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a small copy of the old Ronson type electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Total THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> Had no idea that this shaver could perform wet or dry for $10.00.    </li>
            <li> I get a smoother face with this than when I spend half an hour carefully shaving with a multiblade disposable hand shaver, such as Schick Quatro or the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shave as part of an emergency kit I am putting together, but have found myself using it almost daily since getting it.  </li>
            <li> can only think of two downsides to this little cutter.</li>
            <li> So basically, I used a sharper professional scissor to cut the hard plastic cover of the product</li>
            <li> It pulls out longer beard hairs instead of cutting them and the only real time that is shaves is when you just cut your beard with an actual razer before hand.</li>
            <li> I have not used it wet</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Micro Force Shaver from this amazon company service that sells this type of product and got it delivered on the expected day that it was supposed to be delivered on.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected</li>
            <li> I expected a rechargeable shaver with an adapter.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use it wet by</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it would work as the only razor for a man with a heavy beard.)  </li>
            <li> And it even shaves wet.</li>
            <li> Certainly not comparable to a blade.  </li>
            <li> is that it is not strong enough and it pulls on longer stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this little unit!</li>
            <li> If you press it into your skin it will bite you (like almost any other shaver).</li>
            <li> Besides the shaver itself, the MICROFORCE WET/DRY SAVER also includes a travel pouch, an extra micro foil, a small cleaning brush, and instructions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took me about 5-7 minutes to shave what usually takes around 10 minutes in the shower with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty darn close to having an expensive electric</li>
            <li> I learned that it was the tiny holes around the screen border that caused the pinches, not the main cutting holes.</li>
            <li> not worth time and energy.</li>
            <li> Far too small and delicate.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I was very displeased with my microshaver!I received it,charged it as directed,got through half a shave and it fell apart.</li>
            <li> I applied the shaver onto my face and neck and then rubbed the shaver up and down repeatedly</li>
            <li> This non-rechargeable product functions just as well and when the batteries begin to run down all one needs to do is change them out.</li>
            <li> If there was a way to split the vote in half, I would have given this product 2 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li> we have previously purchased 6 micro shavers as gifts for travelling friends and family......</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had previously owned a re-chargeable unit.</li>
            <li> I bought the battery shaver instead of the rechargeable version because there are less items needed in your drawer/cabinet or when packing for vacation.</li>
            <li> The really sad thing about this little shaver is that it is handed out to hospital patients (especially women) who request a razor to get rid of embarrassing facial hair in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Little gizmo works well ..</li>
            <li> Takes care of the little jobs efficiently.</li>
            <li> Once your hair gets a little longer, however, just use a blade.  </li>
            <li> cannot wait and for the time being have converted to using this little guy exclusively.</li>
            <li> A little problem with the plastic chipping and making one unusable</li>
            <li> Worse than that is your service,I emailed you three different times,to receive no response from you.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> they give him a closer shave and don&#x27;t tug on his heavy beard.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Near useless for a man&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> It shaves poorly even with short hairs.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 4 items and batteries dead in all 4.  </li>
            <li> Total rip-off.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, didn&#x27;t even shave hair at all</li>
            <li> Wasted my money here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just false advertising plain and simple.</li>
            <li> poor excuse for a razor.</li>
            <li> While not being a electric razor expert, I have tried and owned at least half a dozen razors over the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> this was a total waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> and it lasted till this past summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small travel size shaver which i always wanted.</li>
            <li> the past I&#x27;ve used the ones costing up to $200.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so small, he just whips is out whenever he feels stubble.</li>
            <li> Small but high-RPM for closeness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> When this product arrived and got delivered at my address, the shaver inside the package was difficult to open with my hands, because it was wrapped around with hard plastic cover on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some crap before, but this is one of the most useless ever.  </li>
            <li> Then I dropped it on the hard floor of the bathroom and it broke apart.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can irritate the skin when used on the face,depending on the length of stubble, but for something to keep in your office desk drawer before a late meeting, it does the job.</li>
            <li> you will get results, at least for me.</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t have irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> sucks...</li>
            <li> My poor mother was so humiliated by a few chin hairs, so I went to the nurse and requested a razor--and was handed one of these.  </li>
            <li> seriously, I was mad when I thought I order the wrong one, but the batteries should last forever on this think.</li>
            <li> and you will get used to it, plus inside the package it will give you a note talking about irritating and should give it 2 weeks or so to get used to it.</li>
            <li> this is the worse shaver I ever used it pulls won&#x27;t cut if I wanted to torched some one</li>
            <li> Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Unable to cut longer hair.  </li>
            <li> The product Description is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> CAN INJURE FACE BADLY.</li>
            <li> just like this review:-(</li>
            <li> at all...embarrassed about it because I have one as a gift:( Friend bought one too and that one didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li> Definitly didnt even work  what is this crap</li>
            <li> Very bad pice of crap</li>
            <li> I too was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> (yes I&#x27;m a woman), I have a terrible time breaking out when I use tweezers or razors.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Little gizmo works well .. one star demerit for not including the extra foil that significantly extends useful life</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order</li>
            <li> This product does not do what I expected it to be able to do. It pulls out longer beard hairs instead of cutting them and the only real time that is shaves is when you just cut your beard with an actual razer before hand. I suppose its ok for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t given it a good test yet.  When I have tried It didn&#x27;t like it.  I haven&#x27;t given up on it yet</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my brother in 2013 and it lasted until now. He was very pleased with it and asked me where I got it. I ordered him two this time . He received it in record time so it all worked out very well. Thanks again. My brother loves this shaver because it gives him a close shave and he can sit in his chair and shave each day. He really raves about it and was happy to know it was still available.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is fantastic.  Takes care of the little jobs efficiently. This is my second one. I always want to have one on hand,; however, my first one is still working well after more than 2 1/2 year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Humms while it does the best job of a small shaver.  Have owned several. Buy recharge or battery powered, have owned both and you will be quite satisfied. Especially useful in trimming loose hairs from moustache and shaving nose hairs that protrude from nose. Close shave on neck and throat hairs excellent.  Do not regard it as principal shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing reminds me of the Yugo, a car that could be bought new in the 80&#x27;s for like $3500,... As the Yugo can be called a car; this can be called a shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivers as published with expected results both under the WET and DRY formats.  While I purchased 2 rechargeable type shavers +1 battery shaver I prefer the battery shaver* I believe  it performs better with less hassle. The rechargeable variety requires too many too frequent recharging times.  I will purchase another battery operated type because it maintains a longer period of time with maximum  quality results. It definitely provides a comfortable close shave equal to and better than the high end  Shaver That I own.  AMAZON did a good job in managing the sale and delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car for quick touchups for afterwork activities. I like that it is small and seems to do the job just fine. I have not used it wet so cant speak on this. I agree with others that this is for stubble cleanup only. Its my quick get fresh tool!</li>
            <li> i do have very coarse facial hair but for a touch during the day, i think it is definitely with the price. i am glad i purchased. most assuredly gives a very close shave. no skin irritation yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shave as part of an emergency kit I am putting together, but have found myself using it almost daily since getting it.  For its size, it does a really good job getting my whiskers without a lot of pulling or irritation.  Battery life is good so far, as is ease of cleaning.    Overall, I am pleased, and will probably pick up another for my kit and keep this one for normal travel use.  I would definitely recommend this little unit!</li>
            <li> I used mine for the first time today and it did a good job, the one I have takes two AAA batteries, for the price it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I was very displeased with my microshaver!I received it,charged it as directed,got through half a shave and it fell apart.It wouldnt restart.  Worse than that is your service,I emailed you three different times,to receive no response from you.If this is the quality of your product,no wonder you dont respond.Disapointly David P  PS-If you do wish to respond use this email address [ dpineau@eastlink.ca ] Thank you[[ASIN:B001E6KB4Y Microforce Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d use this as my main razor, but for 5:00 shadow touch ups, and buzzing my head (I shave my head), it works great, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It can irritate the skin when used on the face,depending on the length of stubble, but for something to keep in your office desk drawer before a late meeting, it does the job. I like it mostly for doing the back of my head though, I use it against the grain after first shaving along the grain with a blade, and it works great, especially in small areas I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it may be a better head shaver than a face shaver, provided your stubble is very short already. It definitely shaves close though.</li>
            <li> MicroForce has always provided a much closer shave than my larger electric shaver. I use both; the electric for the basic shave andtheMicroShaver for the finishing touches.</li>
            <li> Ok, so what did you really expect for ten dollars? I bought this at a local store, since I just couldn&#x27;t justify paying shipping for a $10 electric shaver. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge razor from Germany for years, and I love the closeness. This doesn&#x27;t even compare. But neither does the $200 class Braun, Norelco or Remington. Nothing is going to get as close as a classic double edge razor (especially a slant bar) except a straight razor (cutthroat razor). What anyone is actually looking for in buying an electric shaver is convenience. Let&#x27;s be honest, you want to turn a switch and watch your beard go away with no fuss or muss.    So, that being said, this shaver is alright. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, every day and it&#x27;s been ok. I think the key with this shaver is that you have to have a light touch. If you press it into your skin it will bite you (like almost any other shaver). And you have to use it every day. It won&#x27;t work with longer hair. It just pulls and hurts.    It is hell on batteries though. I got through three days of shaves before I had to change batteries. I&#x27;m gonna buy some rechargeable AAA batteries and try that.    Eventually I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll tire of the novelty and go back to my double, but for now, and for $10, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> Great compact, waterproof shaver for home or travel.  Does not come with the 2 AAA batteries, but I use rechargeables so always have a spare set charged to go.  Comes with extra foil because this shaver will last long enough to need a new foil.  Works best when batteries are fresh and shaver is high rpm.  When batteries low, then shaver will catch on whiskers (like all electric shavers).  Will not work on thick beard or very thick whiskers (like most electric shavers).  Gives very clean shave by not pressing down hard, but gently gliding over skin with many passes from different directions.  If shaver does not start with new batteries, bend battery contacts on cover to increase contact tension (works every time).</li>
            <li> You folks that got your razors to work-- I admire you.  I put batteries in, turned it on and--- nothing.  It didn&#x27;t even vibrate.  On the plus side, since it didn&#x27;t work at all, it certainly didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.    The Chinese are capable of making good stuff.  For some reason they have great difficulty making low end stuff that uses switches.  Go to any Dollar store and buy a Chinese made flashlight, and you&#x27;ll see this fact firsthand.    My advice: shave with a blade or set aside enough money to buy an electric razor that works.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  It can&#x27;t  help you shave at all.  If your thinking about buying something like this product find a different one.</li>
            <li> It works great for when I am away from home and need a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> It works good I just fix it now it works so happy now this is a good buy now good price like it because it wet and  dry really works I  fix it now it turns on yay</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all. I followed all of the instructions, and even after a week, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I bought a \\&quot;MicroForce\\&quot; (pah-LEEZE!) thinking it would be something I could use on my legs while getting ready in the morning.  The screens are so fine, not even the finest hairs can get through to be lopped off.  You run it over and over, gaining nothing but irritation, both on your skin and in your head.  Granted, it does run a long time on a couple of AAAs, but it accomplishes nothing more than to make a lot of noise. The really sad thing about this little shaver is that it is handed out to hospital patients (especially women) who request a razor to get rid of embarrassing facial hair in a pinch. I have no idea how much Medicare bills for them, as I am certain they&#x27;re not free.  Mom&#x27;s bill was so extensive, I didn&#x27;t have time to comb through it in search of this \\&quot;shaver&#x27;s\\&quot; medical code. My poor mother was so humiliated by a few chin hairs, so I went to the nurse and requested a razor--and was handed one of these.  A Bic disposable would have been far preferrable to buzzing around on her chin, leaving the hairs that were upsetting her so much.  Yeah, it was cheap---a prime example of getting what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve bought some crap before, but this is one of the most useless ever.  If you allowed a NO STAR rating on this page, I would have given it just that. Save your money.........</li>
            <li> Barely works at all when used dry.  Difficult to clean.  Goes through batteries very quickly.  Causes irritation.  Unable to cut longer hair.  Better off carrying a disposable razorblade or buying one at 7-11 in a pinch  AVOID</li>
            <li> These little shavers are great. I got it for travel but now I use it every day. The battery life is amazing. I would highly recommend the MicroForce.</li>
            <li> I love this little razor.  The company gave excellent service.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this shaver for me as a Christmas present in 2010. I liked that it was so small and that is uses regular batteries (mine is not rechargeable so it is always ready to use, and does not lose its charge it if sits for a long time. Batteries are cheap now). It is perfect for a quick touch up, or for travel. I can carry it my suit coat pocket and take it work.  I have found my Norelco and this shaver are the perfect combination for the best electric shave. While both give good shaves by themselves, each misses certain areas or does not cut close enough. When I shave with the Norelco, and then a quick finish up with this little guy, my face is as smooth as it can be with no misses.  I like this product a lot and have been using it for a year now. I dropped it and the blades cut right though the super thin screen (no damage to the razor itself), but they gave me two screens and it was easy to replace. Just don&#x27;t drop it.  If I lost it, I would buy another.</li>
            <li> this was a total waste of money!!!! it worked ( i should say, it turned on) about six times and then never started again. changed batteries of course, ne-ver worked a-gain!! Total THUMBS DOWN. don&#x27;t waste your money.  and try finding customer service to complain............</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality of shave for the money invested. Had no idea that this shaver could perform wet or dry for $10.00.    I highly recommend this product as a good answer to a daily problem.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this small shaver to shave some of the hairs off my tape line. Since i cut my own hair and straightened my tape with a shaving razor, this shaver totally does the job, at first it did start irritating, but just give it some time and you will get used to it, plus inside the package it will give you a note talking about irritating and should give it 2 weeks or so to get used to it. Now after using this shaver i gata say it leaves my skin very smooth, just keep on shaving at the same spot, (or try with water)and you will get results, at least for me. Great product tho, and good for the price.</li>
            <li> If there was a way to split the vote in half, I would have given this product 2 1/2 stars.  Reason:  I bought two and only one of them worked.  The one that does work, works well, but I would have preferred a process by which I could have returned the defective one and had a replacement sent instead of getting a monetary credit.</li>
            <li> Well I agree with some of you,,cheap china junk comes to us in droves,that being said if you get the luck of the draw on your side and you get one that works free from defects,it works very well for 10 cheese bits..and yes if you keeps it short it works well..not too great wet but over all its a good buy.</li>
            <li> have to keep going over n over the same spot to get it to shave smooth not a great item for a camping trip</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FITS MY NEEDS WELL AND AT A GREAT PRICE! I LOVE THAT AMAZON IS A ONE STOP PLACE TO FIND WHAT EVERY I NEED AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> The product Description is wrong.  Product Features:Charger included! One charge lasts up to 7 days    No charger provided.   The feature need to be updated.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t work on stubble that&#x27;s longer than 2 days growth but they shave super close and smooth. Dad keeps them in his car, at work etc. I use 2 at a time on my legs. I started going thru so many batteries so I got rechargeables.</li>
            <li> This is just false advertising plain and simple. Says it is a chargable razor with the charger included. It is not a chargabe razor...no charger is included..and you have to buy and install your own batteries before you can even use. For the price, its not even worth the time or money to send this thing back and demand my refund. Guess they got me (and my money) on this one. I would expect more from Amazon. Like maybe actually inspecting a product before putting on their website.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Micro Force Shaver from this amazon company service that sells this type of product and got it delivered on the expected day that it was supposed to be delivered on. When this product arrived and got delivered at my address, the shaver inside the package was difficult to open with my hands, because it was wrapped around with hard plastic cover on it. So basically, I used a sharper professional scissor to cut the hard plastic cover of the product and I cut it very easily and was able to take the shaver out of the package. I was able to test the Micro Force Shaver to see if it works well and it did. I applied the shaver onto my face and neck and then rubbed the shaver up and down repeatedly and it removed some or most of my hairs in very teeny pieces. The Shaver works very well. It&#x27;s in great condition and it includes two AAA-batteries which is required. I rated this product a five out of five and loved it, because it a great product to use and it doesn&#x27;t become obsolete like the Micro Touch Max Trimmer. It just works perfectly fine. The product, seller, and delivery were excellent. I would recommend this product to anyone that loves it. It&#x27;s a great quality. Thank you very much for this product!</li>
            <li> the ability to use 2AAA is fantastic as opposed to the old ones when they first came out. Those required a power cord for the built in battery.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding size and it does do the job, great for travel.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  Perfect.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> works for what it is made to do so too many words required so no one wants to rate on here</li>
            <li> Order arrived perfectly, thank you!</li>
            <li> Good buy.  Just what I expected</li>
            <li> so, much better than the ones that are chargeable. seriously, I was mad when I thought I order the wrong one, but the batteries should last forever on this think. or just a bit short of that</li>
            <li> While they are not as durable as the brand names (he goes through 2 or 3 per year) they give him a closer shave and don&#x27;t tug on his heavy beard. We always order 2 more when he opens the last one on hand.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a small copy of the old Ronson type electric shaver.  It does shave ok but I would not say it is great.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of shaving really short hair in case you just want to maintain a goatee or a &#x27;stache.  Once your hair gets a little longer, however, just use a blade.  Still, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for light use, pops in the purse if needed, lasts a long time but would recommend buying two - tends to quit suddenly, never to be revived.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He uses it like most people use a regular razor.  It lasts a couple of years and is a great buy.</li>
            <li> does the shaving job well.  Light and portable.  worth the money.  buy several shavers while they are still being made.</li>
            <li> Very bad pice of crap</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Ross over a year ago. I was under the impression it didn&#x27;t work. After reading some reviews on here, I took some tips out...shave before using it. It will not cut longer hairs. So I shaved one day and the next used this on my legs. It worked to remove the stubble. 5 days later my legs are staying pretty smooth. Glad I gave this thing another shot!</li>
            <li> I really prefer this little razor over more expensive models.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve dealt with this seller and am very happy with them also.</li>
            <li> I received my order but when I opened the box I counted 29 shavers I ordered 30. I&#x27;m not the kind of person to complain but we are a none profite org. these shavers are going to patients who are bed bound at a Spinal Cord Injury Unit at the VA Hospital. I&#x27;m going to order 30 more and will see what happens.  SMILEY</li>
            <li> I too was very disappointed with this product.  Sure, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to perform as a $100.00 razor, but at least work on some level. I found I had to hold it in place for a while or keep going over the same place for it to do anything.  As one reviewer stated, it does irritate the skin.  I also tried it in the shower thinking running water would help.  No, it didn&#x27;t.  As the saying goes \\&quot;If it sounds too good to be true\\&quot;, it is...  Guess I&#x27;ll stick to using my old razor.  I get a better shave with hair clippers.  No irritation there.</li>
            <li> Question: does this product work on gentile areas</li>
            <li> I expected a rechargeable shaver with an adapter. I received a shaver with batteries.</li>
            <li> Love this little shaver.  Had one years ago and it lasted till this past summer. Found this online and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!!</li>
            <li> poor excuse for a razor. not worth time and energy. what a waste of money and time. just like this review:-(</li>
            <li> I will order this model again, but not the rechargeable model, which doesn&#x27;t do anything useful.  They are two different animals.</li>
            <li> tLike it If used as recommended.</li>
            <li> To paraphrase a popular commercial for a certain satellite tv service:&lt;br /&gt;When your Microforce razor wears out after 4 years, you go back to shaving your slightly fuzzy upper lip with a safety razor. When you go back to using a safety razor you irritate your skin. When you irritate your skin you cut yourself. When you cut yourself, you get an infection. When you get an infection, you have to see the doctor. When you see the doctor you get a prescription for an antibiotic. When you get an antibiotic you have an allergic reaction. When you have an allergic reaction you end up in the ER. Don&#x27;t end up in the ER - buy a MicroForce!!</li>
            <li> For the price, I bought 2.  This little shaver is handy on trips as well as for daily shaving.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the big brand name razors.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good shave.  It&#x27;s comfortable to use.  I have used the Microforce for about 3 years, depending on availability.  I have the whiskers of a 74-year-old man.  Incidentally, I&#x27;m Lada&#x27;s husband.</li>
            <li> This is about the fourth one I have bought. Some to give as gifts and the persons who received them also loved them.&lt;br /&gt;Very ice for travel or a quick chin clean-up anytime.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  Works great.  Excellent Price!!</li>
            <li> I bought it expecting to return it after first use but it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;I avoided all electric razors as they only irritated and tore up my skin. But this one really does work!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and compact, only 2 AAA batteries, cheap! Bought it at Ross for only $7, my razor blades cost more! Works better than my razor and with much less irritation!&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about not being able to cut longer hair but if your hair is that long why bother?</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit more out of curiosity than anything else.  That and the claim that it can be used as a wet/dry shaver.  I was pleasantly surprised by the close dry shave I have now received on the 2 occasions I have used it. While not being a electric razor expert, I have tried and owned at least half a dozen razors over the past 30 years.  This gave me as close if not the closest shave as any of the more expensive units I have tried.  I have yet to use it wet by cannot wait and for the time being have converted to using this little guy exclusively.</li>
            <li> work good for every day shave</li>
            <li> Definitly didnt even work  what is this crap</li>
            <li> I purchased the MICROFORCE WET/DRY SHAVER when I needed an emergency razor while I was on a trip. The small size makes it great for a travel/portable shaver. This razor is not meant to cut off more than a day or two worth of stubble. If you try anything more than that, it probably won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s also not designed to shave anything more than the face. You could possibly use it to shave other body parts, but it&#x27;s not designed for that and you will probably have issues if you do. Also, there&#x27;s no mention on the insert or in the info that comes with it that this is a rechargeable shaver. I have used this shaver several times, for instance after driving several hours to an interview and I needed a quick brush up on the face. It&#x27;s inexpensive and cheaply made, but it does do what it&#x27;s designed to do (you just have to use it properly). Besides the shaver itself, the MICROFORCE WET/DRY SAVER also includes a travel pouch, an extra micro foil, a small cleaning brush, and instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who started having problems with facial hair due to new medications (she is in her 80&#x27;s). She is allegoric to straight blades, but this works great. It&#x27;s gentile enough for her skin, yet shaves well enough to remove hair. Each one I buy lasts for about 2 to 3 months (far cheaper than buying bags of disposable razors). A near perfect short life razor for women. Near useless for a man&#x27;s beard. Far too small and delicate.</li>
            <li> my husband is thrilled! small, light weight, easy to use &amp; fast!</li>
            <li> The MicroForce razor is small, compact, solidly built &amp; effective!  My favorite feature on this razor is its wet/dry capability.  I use it to touch up my shave while using lather from face soap either standing at the sink or in the shower.  Then I can easily and thoroughly clean it with hot running water from the tap.  Running on 2 AAA batteries (I use rechargeable) I can get 4 or 5 shaves out of it before swapping batteries.  Though small, this razor seems very well built and sturdy.  (In all honesty I have a light beard.  I don&#x27;t know whether it would work as the only razor for a man with a heavy beard.)  It&#x27;s easy to open and close to change batteries, to clean the foils, etc.  It even comes with an extra foil so that I&#x27;ll be able to replace the old one when it eventually wears out - and I&#x27;ll then be able to double the life of this great little razor.  Great for quick shaves, touch up and for travel.  I&#x27;m glad I bought two of them!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and after fighting to get it out of the packaging, and buying some batteries for it, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  I checked the Amazon reviews to see if it was worth trying to return it, but I&#x27;m now convinced I am one of the lucky ones.  At least I don&#x27;t have irritated skin.  Lesson: always beware of \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very small and seemingly great for travel.  However, it pulls your hairs frequently and that hurts like hell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that stated that the razor works well when your beard is already short.  I do not agree with that assessment at all. It shaves poorly even with short hairs.  It works in a pinch, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a while now. This shaver is fantastic. It is rare when an &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; item lives up to its hype, but this one certainly does. On Amazon for 2 dollars. They have a rechargeable version for about 10 dollars. I use rechargeable batteries, so I buy the 2 dollar shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t work on long beards since they only cut the ends of each hair folicle, and for some people you may need a touch-up. Shave as normal, then use this shaver for daily maintenance. You&#x27;ll stay smooth and spend less on blade cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this thing while watching TV or if I&#x27;m late going somewhere and need to do a quick dry shave. I get a smoother face with this than when I spend half an hour carefully shaving with a multiblade disposable hand shaver, such as Schick Quatro or the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition. It is just as it appears in the photo</li>
            <li> its okay if you don&#x27;t have so many hair</li>
            <li> Great little shaver (but no trimmer), but it pinched sometimes. I learned that it was the tiny holes around the screen border that caused the pinches, not the main cutting holes. Easy fix- spread some nail polish on those border holes, and the shave is close &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY...CAN INJURE FACE BADLY. I had bought one from TV Commercial, tried it 3 times and cut my face till it bled...despite having been careful.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver very much but they are disposable since they don.t last very long.They would be wonderful if they were better constructed.I&#x27;ll come back for more but hope there is a structural upgrade.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it as an auxiliary shaver and is very pleased with it.  I would not hesitate order it again</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECOUSE I USE TO WORK FRECUENTLY WITH MY FACE AND ALREADY A GOT THIS PRODUCT THAT GONA HELP ME EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> Excellent small travel shaver.  The shaver shaves close and is used as a touch up type of shaver as needed. Bought several for my various vehicles and around the house.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the greatest, but nice little shaver. Seem to last a couple years. I&#x27;m on my third.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for the two day beards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small travel size shaver which i always wanted. Highly recommended for those who wanted a small travel size shaver on the go.</li>
            <li> The Micro Force Wet/Dry Shaver, cordless is the best shaver for the money.I&#x27;ve used one for 3&lt;br /&gt;years .In the past I&#x27;ve used the ones costing up to $200. The Micro Force is just as good if not&lt;br /&gt;better. I get a close shave every time.</li>
            <li> we have previously purchased 6 micro shavers as gifts for travelling friends and family......they have been very satisfactory....we intend to continue to purchase them as the occasion occurs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had previously owned a re-chargeable unit. And while I was pleased with the job that product did the re-chargeable battery life simply died unexpectedly. This non-rechargeable product functions just as well and when the batteries begin to run down all one needs to do is change them out.</li>
            <li> This actually works quite well for my stubble and daily shaves. If I let my beard grow for a day or two, then I have to use blades or a larger electric to bring it back down, and use the Micro for a clean finish. This is the only shaver that seems to really give a close shave to my mustashe area below the nose, and really removes all the fine hairs in and around ears. This will be great to keep in the car or at work for touch ups.</li>
            <li> On a whelm, I bought this cordless, waterproof shaver at Wal-Mart.  I initially thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to work well with only paying around $10.00 for it.  I was wrong.  It is pretty close to using a regular razor.  It shaves pretty close, pretty smooth (mostly, except for around my goatee outline) and the best thing is - It doesn&#x27;t cause a mess of hair particles around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took me about 5-7 minutes to shave what usually takes around 10 minutes in the shower with a razor.  It&#x27;s compact, has a sleek design and honestly, for ten bucks, you can&#x27;t much beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do AS well with detailed hair lines (i.e. around the mustache and goatee).  Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty darn close to having an expensive electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to those in a hurry and need something cheap for a traveling kit.</li>
            <li> Hey, for $10 this is a great deal.  It is portable, does a good job shaving and the batteries last a long time.  I highly recommend this shaver for a vacation, the office, the car and as a backup.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a day-to-day basis.  I keep it in the car for emergency touch-up or mornings when I am rushing out the door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Glad i can still find these little guys online. most stores around have stopped carrying them. Back in dec 2012 CVS was getting rid of their inventory and were selling them for $4.88 each. i bought 5 of them, Against my wifes wishes, and just ran out.  Their only problem is they dont last terribly long. The connections tend to rust out faster than they let on to be. so in the end you try to turn it on after 6weeks to 6 months of use in the shower and they wont turn on. So having them around is nice and even nicer to find them online at a decent price. They do such a great Job when it comes to detailing.</li>
            <li> Please see my review in May 2011 of the Microforce by ShavePro rechargeable version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;They are identical except this one runs on 2 AAA batteries, which I find more convenient but caution that the batteries run down pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts amazingly close and is a no- brainer for the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my second MicroForce Wet/Dry Shaver.  I bought the first some years ago in an Office Depot, of all places.  It caught my eye.  Being Sicilian means there is unwanted hair over my lip - not too attractive on a woman.  Well, at least in most circles.  LOL  I&#x27;ve always shaved it or used a cream to remove it, but when I saw the Wet/Dry Shaver, and at such a low price, I grabbed it.  It worked great for several years.  Then I dropped it on the hard floor of the bathroom and it broke apart.  I could not reattach the head.  Happily, I found it on Amazon, at the same low price.  Bought it.  Using it again.  Still love it.</li>
            <li> For less than the rip-off price for a replacement blade set for another shaver, and much smaller to store, this little shaver does a great job. I use it with rechargeable nickel-zinc batteries and it is dynamite.</li>
            <li> ...bought two and neither one works...at all...embarrassed about it because I have one as a gift:( Friend bought one too and that one didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product, so far it seems to work O.K. I use an electric shaver so I&#x27;m use to them.</li>
            <li> this is the worse shaver I ever used it pulls won&#x27;t cut if I wanted to torched some one I would suggest it but I couldn&#x27;t do that to some one I knew this product should not be on the market it is a rip off</li>
            <li> I picked one of these razors last summer at the beach not expecting much out of it. Contrary to some of the other reviews listed here, I love the Micro Force razor. I ues it daily for a good clean shave. Not quit as sturdy and accurate as an expensive electric razor but does a real good job for me ( for under $10) can&#x27;t be beat). I recently dropped mine on a concrete patio and broke it. After 14 months, I was not too upset. I just purchased 2 more from Amazon.com and am back in business.</li>
            <li> Ordered 4 items and batteries dead in all 4.  Total rip-off.  Postage would have increased the price too much to return.</li>
            <li> no good, with fresh batteries and nothing, leave me in the face all irritated by lack of edge.. . . .</li>
            <li> This is the third one I bought. It was for another of my sisters.  They&#x27;re great for women&#x27;s facial hair just the best.</li>
            <li> Very useful for teaveling.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Comes with an extra foil, cleaning brush, and nice little pouch. I bought the battery shaver instead of the rechargeable version because there are less items needed in your drawer/cabinet or when packing for vacation.</li>
            <li> Shaver is very portable and works great at a nice price. Gave as presents for on the go young guys</li>
            <li> I love this super compact and economical shaver.  I take it with me when traveling.  This is my second one, the first one died recently after many years of use.  The order came promptly.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase for this shaver.  He wore the first one out after a considerable amount of time.  My husband just loves them.  He uses it every day, sometimes more than once.  Because it&#x27;s so small, he just whips is out whenever he feels stubble.</li>
            <li> I had one of the rechargeable versions of these and took it back.  I recently got another one for Christmas (yes I opened a bit early) and I like it a bit better than the old one.  I also like that I paid nothing for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a couple of types of electric razor, the 3 spinning blades and the flatish foils.  This is the latter.  It&#x27;s pretty small, maybe as wide and long as a playing card.  It runs on two AAA batteries.  I tried it with rechareables and it didn&#x27;t work, but it was fine with alkalines.  It&#x27;s possible the rechareables were too close to empty so maybe you can get it to run with them, but don&#x27;t count on it.  Anyway, the battery cover is really hard to get back on and you are best off leaving the plastic cover on because you&#x27;ll probably have to brace against it to secure the bottom.  I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly be water proof, but it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close enough for my liking, however you should be warned it will work with AT MOST a day&#x27;s stubble.  If you have any kind of longer hair it&#x27;s not going to do anything for you at all.  As long as I bare that in mind, it&#x27;s shave is pretty good and while it does take a little longer since it&#x27;s a small blade I don&#x27;t have any real complaints about the shave.  It also has a nice little pouch thing and a brush, but the pouch is too small to fit the brush or extra batteries rendering it mostly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I can&#x27;t see this as being my primary shaver.  I see it more as a travel one, for the emergency bag you may have in your car in case you get snowed in somewhere, or maybe in a drawer at work.  It doesn&#x27;t mention it, but the blade probably needs to be replaced every year as with most electric razors.  I don&#x27;t know if you can even buy blades for it so it&#x27;s somewhat disposable.</li>
            <li> Still doesn&#x27;t afford a close enough shave.  Certainly not comparable to a blade.  Would not purchase it again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Broke quickly, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This works quite well, the price is reasonable and it has not let me down.  This thing would be perfect if it had a way of cutting longer hairs.</li>
            <li> The razor has always performed satisfactorily  I am on my third one now.  A little problem with the plastic chipping and making one unusable but  I still like them.</li>
            <li> This thing is really tiny but works well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, didn&#x27;t even shave hair at all just it made noise. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Small but high-RPM for closeness.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s cool... it&#x27;s small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;What sucks... is that it is not strong enough and it pulls on longer stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to shaver with the grain then against.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Very poorly made. Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims it will do. Wasted my money here.&lt;br /&gt;Should have known based on the price</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. Spend a little more for better results</li>
            <li> I already own 1 shaver and use it everywhere, especially when camping. Now I have 2 of the best little shavers ever made for the best price. Every man should have one!</li>
            <li> My beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use (RIP). This was the only electric razor that ever gave me a good shave. I saw the MICROforce at Walmart, for just $9.99. The 9000 RPM claim got my attention. I bought  it, fully expecting to have to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave, I had the astounding revelation that \\&quot;It&#x27;s true! Size really doesn&#x27;t matter....\\&quot; This little gadget gave me at least as good, if not better, a shave than all of the $50.00-$100.00 electric shavers I have ever had (I have had them all at one time or another....) It did as good as my old DA! And it even shaves wet. It actually does as good of a job as my Gillette 6-blade disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only think of two downsides to this little cutter. 1. It is so small, it is probably easy to lose, and 2. I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the cheap little vinyl travel bag it came with. However, I found that it fits perfectly in an old Gerber nylon knife case, so that is an easy fix. These are so cheap, you can afford to have several. I keep one in my Gym Bag for a great shave after a Steam Sauna, and another in my car&#x27;s glovebox for emergency shaves. I have another in my desk. It fits very comfortably in a shirt pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is actually my third one. I wore one out and bought two more because I wanted a spare. Very small and easy to slip into your pocket works great! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It absolutely did not do anything as far as shaving. All it did was leave the skin red and burning. Don&#x27;t recommend buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Great little shave with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver.  I can carry mine in my back pocket or in my purse (yes I&#x27;m a woman), I have a terrible time breaking out when I use tweezers or razors.  This works great.  I love it.</li>
