            <li>Have used the brand many times.</li>
            <li>I have used the  Ogilvie Home Permanent for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love Ogilvie Perms.  </li>
            <li>I have used the foam produce for many years and now I need to use this product which does the job</li>
            <li>I do love</li>
            <li>though how it hold my curls better then without the perm/wave.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon.com for always giving me a safe and easy Internet purchasing experience.</li>
            <li>I have the right kind coming today.</li>
            <li>Easy to use. .  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you want an easy to use process.</li>
            <li>My hair came out nice for the first timer.</li>
            <li>But this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions for maximum time (to leave the perm solution on my hair,) and my hair is now full of curls and body.</li>
            <li>The Citrical D was priced more reasonably at Amazon than anywhere else, and I have searched.    </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use, instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li>Wow was I super pleased.</li>
            <li>This perm is very strong and if not careful you could end up with nothing but frizz.</li>

            <li>This is the first time that I used this brand, it worked as expected, the price is fair, online order saved my time.</li>
            <li>I must be a dying breed because perm solution is getting harder and harder to find in stores, so I was happy to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Your response was very fast.</li>
            <li>I was the first one to try it out in my family.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li>There is body in my hair now, and the curl on top is doing relatively well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only rating it as okay</li>
            <li>It was a decent price too!</li>
            <li>Could barely breathe, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Have not yet used this particular perm yet; ordered it to have on hand when needed.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely continue using in the future by using more curling rods.</li>
            <li>it should include those little tissue papers that are used to hold the hair so the curler go on easily</li>
            <li>A PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>I, however, was not paying attention to what I was ordering and purchased the wrong kind.</li>

            <li> I tried it and it did nothing but waste time, dry up my hair, and stink up my whole house with its odor...</li>
            <li> It looks wild and frizzy and looks to have very little curl.  </li>

            <li> but I wish I could buy at least 6 of the foam product</li>
            <li> too thick I guess</li>
            <li> It was the only one that i could depend on for my very difficult  to  curl hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT I have to have them since my hair is so thin</li>
            <li> I know there can be a bad product in anything, and I will try the Ogilvie again, but I certainly am not pleased with this  one.</li>
            <li> However, this one has been a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> To begin with, I hate perms!</li>

            <li> I was looking for something to replace my Toni perms, which I have used for 30 plus years. I was a little skeptical of something new. Wow was I super pleased. This turned out great. I still have my curl after a month of washing. I would rate this just as good as the Toni perms. I was the first one to try it out in my family. I plan on using this type from now on.</li>
            <li> Better than going to a beauty parlor--- only thing--- it should include those little tissue papers that are used to hold the hair so the curler go on easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use. .  No frizz. Holding  its body well.  Will definitely order more when needed. This is the second time I have used this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because it is hard for my hair to maintain a curl. But this product was fantastic. I followed the directions for maximum time (to leave the perm solution on my hair,) and my hair is now full of curls and body. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again. It was a decent price too!</li>
            <li> Cannot find this product anywhere in my local stores. Have used this for years on my mom&#x27;s hair and her perms always look beauty shop beautiful. Thank you Amazon.com for always giving me a safe and easy Internet purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> Have not yet used this particular perm yet; ordered it to have on hand when needed.  Have used the brand many times.</li>
            <li> This perm is perfect, and the curls held shape great. I would recommend this if you want an easy to use process.</li>
            <li> I have used the  Ogilvie Home Permanent for many years.  It was the only one that i could depend on for my very difficult  to  curl hair.  However, this one has been a disappointment.  There is body in my hair now, and the curl on top is doing relatively well.  But the sides and part of the back (to my mind) is a disaster.  It looks wild and frizzy and looks to have very little curl.  I know there can be a bad product in anything, and I will try the Ogilvie again, but I certainly am not pleased with this  one.</li>
            <li> My hair came out nice for the first timer.</li>
            <li> THIS THE BEST PERM I GAVE IT TO MY 89 YR MOTHER AND IT LOOKS LIKE A PROFESSIONAL DID IT.  I WOULD NOT BUY ANOTHING ELSE PUT THIS PERM.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular Ogilvie Perm for years and have been unable to purchase it in this state for the last several years.  Thank heaven for Amazon, Mama&#x27;s got curls! Your response was very fast. The Citrical D was priced more reasonably at Amazon than anywhere else, and I have searched.    Thank you, LG in Montana</li>
            <li> Never being happy with salon results, I perm my own hair.  I must be a dying breed because perm solution is getting harder and harder to find in stores, so I was happy to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Ogilvie Perms.  They are easy to use and give me the best curl I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making them.</li>
            <li> Love the warm curling solution and the results were great. Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> She used similar product before, but it doesn&#x27;t make her hair curl.  This product does, I will order next time.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I used this brand, it worked as expected, the price is fair, online order saved my time. No complains. Will stick with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I always have excellent results with this perm, good curl, no friz, lasts 3 months, and easy to apply also.</li>
            <li> This is the only perm I&#x27;ve tried recently that works like they did years ago.  And it smells like it too.  Could barely breathe, but it was worth it.  A month later it&#x27;s still working well.  None of the others lasted any time at all.</li>
            <li> If this perm is as good as those I have used before,I will be pleased.  I am pleased, I am pleased!  Now I have enough words!!</li>
            <li> To begin with, I hate perms! BUT I have to have them since my hair is so thin I need the body. This perm is very strong and if not careful you could end up with nothing but frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used the foam produce for many years and now I need to use this product which does the job but I wish I could buy at least 6 of the foam product can the mfg contact me so I can purchase the foam product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating it as okay because, everything inside the box is there and in useful order. I, however, was not paying attention to what I was ordering and purchased the wrong kind. I cannot ship it back because of the type of product (personal care) and that it is a chemical. USPS will not ship these back. I am going to donate it my local assisted living nursing home. I know it will get some use there. I have the right kind coming today.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it did nothing but waste time, dry up my hair, and stink up my whole house with its odor...DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Even though it could have been wavier, I am thinking that my hair is just to stubborn.  I do love though how it hold my curls better then without the perm/wave.  It is also very easy to use, instructions are clear.  Will definitely continue using in the future by using more curling rods.</li>
            <li> Worked great! I have lots of curls/</li>
            <li> It did not work on my hair...too thick I guess</li>
            <li> Was mailed in a bubble envelope. Box was mashed and some liquid leaked out of one of the bottles. Would suggest mailing in a bow instead! Thx.</li>
