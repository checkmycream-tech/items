            <li>Love Andy&#x27;s dedication to using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>, the guy had me sold right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made so many purchase, then googled the ingredients only to find it was not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all, but actually full of sneaky toxic junk.</li>
            <li>I honestly saw results after the first application and have seen continued improvement over the last month.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you exactly how this work</li>

            <li>I saw this mask for the first time on in the Bulletproof website.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it, I realized it was something else.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since adding this mask to my routine and I can&#x27;t thank this company enough.</li>
            <li>A definite MUST HAVE:)))))))</li>
            <li>High praise to Alitura!!</li>
            <li>This mask takes my my skin from dull lifeless to the youthful look I love!!</li>
            <li>I use this every other day and it makes my skin look and feel amazing..</li>
            <li>You could buy some other products but they won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li>Love this mask, it leaves my skin so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>After previously buying the aztec clay, and then mixing my own ingredients into it....</li>
            <li>I had dry unbalanced skin and as a professional celebrity makeup artist in Hollywood, I need to look my best everyday.</li>
            <li>I have battled my skin for most of my life with little success.</li>
            <li>My skin thanks me</li>
            <li>I also stopped taking the prescription from my Dermatologist to really put the Alitura Mask to the test.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This natural approach to skin care is exactly what the market needs.</li>
            <li>But, this product brought me to a new level!  </li>
            <li>time you are at your favorite fancy store, do yourself a favor and check out the ingredients on the back label of any big name skin product........</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are so high quality.  </li>
            <li>its all pure and natural ingredients and a product a high end spa would try to sell you for about $200.  </li>
            <li>after 50 years of ignoring my skin except for some sunscreen (pretty much my whole life) i have finally found my fix.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I love the fact that this company uses only the finest ingredients not cheep fillers and unhealthy additives.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product is one of the only products that I can use on it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin glowing and tightens my pores, feels like new skin after every use.</li>
            <li>and the container lasts a long time so its so worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure nutrition for the skin and leaves it looking glowing and brighter after only one treatment</li>
            <li>I have used the Alitura Mask for about a month now and wanted to review after my system had the opportunity to clear out the prescription and rely solely on the mask.</li>
            <li>When I learned about this product I was eager to try something natural as opposed to what I have been using.</li>
            <li>His knowledge of the components of his product made it obvious that he is a very thorough researcher, which made me feel like I could trust the product...</li>
            <li>I have purchased at least 3 jars and LOVE the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked by several people about the new glow on my face!</li>
            <li>My skin is less oily and looks fresh.</li>
            <li>try pronouncing them first of all, secondly google a few of them.  </li>

            <li> I have really sensitive, dry, yet sometimes acne prone skin and have to be really careful what I put on it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pretty good looking. But, this product brought me to a new level!  Ha. But seriously.......&lt;br /&gt;Andy is a good friend, but I don&#x27;t put my stamp on just anything.&lt;br /&gt;With all the options out there, why not choose the best ingredients for your body.  If you can&#x27;t eat it, why would you put in on your face?&lt;br /&gt;Next time you are at your favorite fancy store, do yourself a favor and check out the ingredients on the back label of any big name skin product........try pronouncing them first of all, secondly google a few of them.  Now look at Alitura......mic drop!&lt;br /&gt;Keep the products coming!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for my husband and myself. Take a look at the ingredients. The developer of this product carefully hand picked these ingredients from the best sources in the world. It&#x27;s always nice to buy from someone you respect and not a corporate entity looking to make a buck.  I can personally vouch for this product and Andy. Make this a staple in your medicine cabinet like we do. Can&#x27;t wait for their next products!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Before I heard Andy Hnilo on a podcast, I never gave a thought to skin care. After hearing how passionate he was about this product I had to give it a try. I can&#x27;t tell you exactly how this work but, not only does it make your skin feel great, it makes you feel great in general. I apply the mask at night, lay on my back and listen to meditative music; it&#x27;s the most relaxing rejuvenating thing I&#x27;ve done and all in my own home, no spa required. I always use the Alitura moisturizer after and then sleep like a baby. Your face is the first thing people notice, take care of it! This mask will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!! This mask takes my my skin from dull lifeless to the youthful look I love!! After I use his I get tons of what have you done to your skin? It looks flawless.. It&#x27;s truly amazing!! If you try it you will see just what im talking about and you will be hooked like me:)</li>
            <li> The Alitura Clay mask is the best out there!  After being introduced to it, my wife and I have never deviated.  We are skin care addicts and truly dedicated to our organic products we use.  Once we started using the Alitura Clay Mask we never again throught about using anything else.  Andy (the founder) is dedicated to the highest quality and purest ingredients, which you will see a difference in your skin after only one use.  Once you start using 2x&#x27;s a week, your skin will be glowing and more youthful.  Do not hesitate adding this to your cart immediately.</li>
            <li> Guys!!! This product will change your confidence. My skin thanks me everytime I mask. I had dry unbalanced skin and as a professional celebrity makeup artist in Hollywood, I need to look my best everyday. Alitura helped achieve this and helped balance my skins texture and complexion. I recommend it to all my clients now. The ingridentds are top notch and natural so you know you are doing something great for your skin.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I was a little hesitant to use a mask.  But a friend recommended the Alitura mask to me and I gave it a try.  The results were AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked or felt so good.  I feel so rejuvenated after using this every week.  Great product, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love Alitura because it&#x27;s basically food for your skin. It&#x27;s nourishing leaving my skin feeling silky smooth with a healthy glow. Even more importantly you can eat it! Ladies &amp; Gents if you can&#x27;t eat it, you shouldn&#x27;t put it on your skin. Thanks for the creator of Alitura for making such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Alitura products are by far the best and purest on the market when it comes to skincare. Leaves my skin glowing and tightens my pores, feels like new skin after every use.</li>
            <li> Best mask on the market!!! Just amazing!!</li>
            <li> The Alitura Clay Mask is amazing! Never thought I&#x27;d use a clay mask, much less publicly post about it...but the Alitura folks have a winner here! Great product from great people!</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective, and truly natural clay mask on the market. These guys obviously did their research and held no punches when sourcing  ingredients and making the formula. Don&#x27;t be fooled by useless beauty and health products like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made so many purchase, then googled the ingredients only to find it was not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all, but actually full of sneaky toxic junk. This is the s**t!</li>
            <li> Great product. Made with the best ingredients (compare the ingetients of Alitura to other brands which are almost purely chemical based). This product is safe and actually works, I&#x27;ve seen the results after 6mths of use.</li>
            <li> I have battled my skin for most of my life with little success. When I learned about this product I was eager to try something natural as opposed to what I have been using. I also stopped taking the prescription from my Dermatologist to really put the Alitura Mask to the test. I have used the Alitura Mask for about a month now and wanted to review after my system had the opportunity to clear out the prescription and rely solely on the mask. I honestly saw results after the first application and have seen continued improvement over the last month. This natural approach to skin care is exactly what the market needs. Too often we neglect the natural balances Nature has to offer us, and we choose to Nurture our bodies through chemical or other unnatural sources. While Nature vs. Nurture pertains to human behavior, I think it applies it&#x27;s fitting here. For myself, this product has stood the test of Nature vs. Nurture...Nature always Wins!</li>
            <li> after 50 years of ignoring my skin except for some sunscreen (pretty much my whole life) i have finally found my fix.  this mask makes your skin feel and look wonderful!  its all pure and natural ingredients and a product a high end spa would try to sell you for about $200.  its easy to mix up, dries quickly on your face and then you get to enjoy your baby soft skin.  and the container lasts a long time so its so worth the price.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> For about 10 years I have used another clay mask, which I was very pleased with.  I met Andy Hnilo (owner) last year at the BULLETPROOF conference in LA, the guy had me sold right off the bat.  His knowledge of the components of his product made it obvious that he is a very thorough researcher, which made me feel like I could trust the product... I feel that if your gonna put something on your face for 30+ minutes, 2 times a week, you better trust it.  Anyway, I bought the product to test, and it blew me away.  It has definitely changed the complexion of my skin and the healthy way it radiates.  I have a constant glow that definitely shows, people are constantly asking me what I do for my skin.  Its an amazing product and after meeting Andy, you can tell that he puts his heart and soul into this, it shows....I am a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> A few years back, I began really caring for my skin and searching the market for the highest quality products..Alitura clay mask is by far the hands down best product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always reading the ingredients on everything and nearly all products have all kinds of fillers for texturizing and crap like that..this has none of those..just seemingly the highest quality of ingredients..I use this every other day and it makes my skin look and feel amazing.. this is the best thing you could possibly do to for your face..and probly the best thing for preventing aging..well this and staying out of the sun..</li>
            <li> As someone with dark and sensitive skin, Alitura is the product I can personally back. It&#x27;s founder lives by the creed of only using THE BEST ingredients to produce THE BEST. Andy Hnilo doesn&#x27;t cut corners and it shows with this product. He made sure this and his upcoming products are worthy to fall under the Alitura Brand and also is just as effective no matter the skin type or ethnicity. My skin is less oily and looks fresh. I give the Alitura Clay Mask my seal off approval.</li>
            <li> Best clay mask out there. Honestly the highest quality ingredients make a huge difference. You could buy some other products but they won&#x27;t be as effective. Clears blemishes, exfoliates, and provides anti inflammatory effects.&lt;br /&gt;If your on the fence about buying this please, just do it. I&#x27;ve wasted money on cheaper products only to have it catch up with me. You only need a little of this stuff to make a mask. Lasts a long time. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> One of the best face masks i have ever used. I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever used and the only one I will use. From the moment you put it on there is no doubt that it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s a game changer. I highly recommend the moisturizer as well. 5 stars honestly isn&#x27;t enough. I love this product and I love the fact that this company uses only the finest ingredients not cheep fillers and unhealthy additives. I wish more company&#x27;s would take note of the consumer demand for the best instead of cutting corners. Please release more products</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; masque whenever my skin looks dull and feels clogged. It&#x27;s pure nutrition for the skin and leaves it looking glowing and brighter after only one treatment</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I have really sensitive, dry, yet sometimes acne prone skin and have to be really careful what I put on it. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it is actually awesome. My skin feels super refreshed and invigorated after using it, and looks bright and more clear right away. It&#x27;s a super good product. I will be a lifetime user!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this mask for the first time on in the Bulletproof website.  I was a little worried it would be just marketing and hype.  There was nothing to worry about.  THIS . . .  STUFF . . . WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I used it, I realized it was something else. My skin has never felt cleaner, but it&#x27;s more than a mask.  It draws impurities from my skin and leaves me with a fresh-faced glow.  It clears up blemishes in an application or two.  I had a rash and it eradicated it.  It&#x27;s become a staple in my medicine cabinet and part of my morning routine a couple of times a week because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality ingredients.  Great value.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what Andy Hnilo comes up with next!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product is one of the only products that I can use on it.  I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since adding this mask to my routine and I can&#x27;t thank this company enough. I also use this mask on my hands and feet and love the results.  A definite MUST HAVE:)))))))</li>
            <li> Love this mask, it leaves my skin so soft and clear.  I have used another high end/super expensive one for over 10 years and I never thought I could switch till I found this mask.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best ever you can do for your skin. Just put it on once and you will feel the benefits. Andy has created a truly magnificent mask that will leave you feeling rejuvenated for days to come. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it works wonders :)</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. After previously buying the aztec clay, and then mixing my own ingredients into it....I&#x27;ve finally found a product that is amazing on its own. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne and blemishes for years, so I used almost avery skin product I could get my hands on. And ever since using the alitura mask, I&#x27;ve noticed crazy improvements in my skin-such as my pore size shrinking, smoother and more gentle complexion of my skin, hardly any breakouts, and just a vibrant feeling. Try it out for yourself :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My wife and I both use it and we both agree that it gives your face that kind of glow afterwards. Great stuff made from great products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask!  I mix it with apple cider vinegar but you can use water as well.  I let it sit on my face for an hour or so or until the product dries and then remove with warm water.  My face feels amazing afterwards, very soft.  I will never use another type of mask again, it&#x27;s that good.  The ingredients are so high quality.  I&#x27;m sick of seeing products out there that are just chemicals, and this is NOT chemicals.  Buy this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> All natural and very effective. I&#x27;ve seen this stuff work wonders, not only for myself but for others that I&#x27;ve recommended it to as well. The moisturizer is also great. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> No product has come close to the results that the Alitura Clay Mask provides. The all natural feel is a game changer both physically and mentally.</li>
            <li> I found out about Alitura Naturals from a BulletProof Podcast.  I have purchased at least 3 jars and LOVE the product. My skin feels softer and looks smoother after each use.  Love Andy&#x27;s dedication to using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This mask produces results instantly.  It has helped with some small sun spots and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and renewed.  The ingredient list is unlike any other in the market! High praise to Alitura!!</li>
            <li> This mask is a dream come true for every person that cares about their appearance! It gives my skin very nice complexion and gives me that nice healthy skin texture that I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks after using the mask. I&#x27;ve been asked by several people about the new glow on my face! A truly great product!</li>
