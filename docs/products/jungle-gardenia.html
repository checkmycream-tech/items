            <li>THAT WE LOVED SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>An old favorite- still great!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many fragrances you can say that about.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m okay with</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of gardenia&#x27;s you will love it.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find they still make jungle gardenia perfume.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the jungle gardenia I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many of us who would hope so.</li>
            <li>I have to undo the top and apply that way.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it</li>
            <li>and it brings back wonderful memories of my Mother.  </li>
            <li>Had not used it in many years...</li>
            <li>My Mom wanted the Jungle Gardenia of the 1970s, it was her favorite.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite for over forty years.</li>
            <li>I used this many years ago - not the cologne, but the Eau De Perfume and it was lovely.  </li>
            <li>Gave it a try but was hoping for a better result.  </li>
            <li>she is like many of you on the reviews saying she wore it when she was younger and how perfect it is.</li>
            <li>it was the one she wore many years ago.</li>
            <li>gardenias are my favorite flower</li>
            <li>love it, so do my fans</li>
            <li>This is a fraud for sure.....</li>
            <li>I used Jungle Gardenia for about 10 years and then started using something else..  Could not find it for many years and then forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>First caught the fragrance in the 1960&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance of Jungle Gardenia, as a young girl, and was very pleased to find it available and smelling just as sweetly as I remembered.  </li>
            <li>had strong memories of JG, so I bought it for my wife.  </li>
            <li>Too strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too good a fragrance to disappear into obscurity; a true classic!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, identical or near identical to the beloved Jungle Gardenia of yore -</li>
            <li>It is a light scent.</li>
            <li>I gave it a three - it smelled great going on but changed after about 30 minutes then totally faded.</li>
            <li>If the people who make the perfume are reading this -IMHO, the propellant you were using in fall 2011 is far superior to the propellant you are using in spring 2012.  </li>
            <li>I love so many of the good old fragrances, and given the high praise women (and men)</li>
            <li>It is very nice and when first applied, smells very similar to the original, but not as potent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only smells completely amazing, but it LASTS!</li>
            <li>I ordered, and when I received it, it was love at first sniff.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps they bought the trademark,but not the original</li>
            <li>Can I return it without the original packaging?  </li>
            <li>I used the Original Jugle Gardenia in the 1960&#x27;s and this product doesn&#x27;t quite capture the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I wore the original Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache for 20 years.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>This version is about as good as the original - still has a great Gardenia fragrance to it but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the older version of Jungle Gardenia in the past and loved it and was so happy to see that it&#x27;s now carried by Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>For all I know it is perfectly good - just totally</li>
            <li>It used to be my absolute favorite, but the composition has been changed.  </li>
            <li>I wore for so many years, was never so overpowering, and always really smelled of gardenias after the alcohol wore off.  </li>
            <li>To be a specific request, must be a good product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not smell like Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache, it didn&#x27;t even smell good to me.</li>
            <li>My First and -  Only Love!!</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on, I was horrified - a strongly chemical smell which was not like ANY perfume, let alone Junge Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>This is an extraordinary scent I hope to have in my life for the rest if my life.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>I thought i had gotten lucky when I stumbled onto this so called \\&quot;jungle gardenia\\&quot; that claimed to be \\&quot;it\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice but is not as fragrant as the original and not quite the same.</li>
            <li>She would always smile and say Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I had found a bottle (partial) at a garage sale a couple of years ago and loved having it again.  </li>
            <li>There was a notification that certain ingredients in the original we&#x27;re no longer allowed.  </li>
            <li>Not the right fragrance</li>
            <li>stop comparing to the old and accept the new, amazing smell.</li>
            <li>Years ago I loved this scent, but this new version is NOT the same.  </li>
            <li>and i can tell you, this perfume smells exactly like fresh gardenias.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an up to date replacement and this version is pretty close - identical after it dries, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the only fragrance I really enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like gardenias.  </li>
            <li>And the writers seemed young enough that they may have used one of the many reincarnations of Jungle Gardenia,none of which smelled like the original either.</li>
            <li>Iam thrilled to have found my signature perfume again as it was all Iused to wear and was devastated when Icould no longer find it,over the years I tried other so called gardenia perfumes but nothing could ever come close to jungle .</li>
            <li>This scent smells nothing like the clean soft gardenia fragrance that Coty did so well.</li>
            <li>When I was old enough to make my own purchases, I bought a bottle of Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li>I remember the fragrance as being pure Gardenia.</li>
            <li>AND I CERTAINLY KNOW WHAT</li>
            <li>The first order I received several months ago had almost the original scent of Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting much of a gardenia smell from this perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>oh, not so much once I received it.</li>
            <li>I am sad and wish the orginall that I loved so much would still be available.</li>
            <li>So I was really pumped up when I got it.  </li>
            <li>it is strong enough to last all day and sweet enough to make you smell clean.</li>
            <li>but, she claims this is simply as close to the original smell you could get.</li>
            <li>It is not the same as it once was and does stay with me as the original did.</li>
            <li>not every perfume is going to smell the exact same if another company buys the trademark, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells NOTHING like the perfume from the 70&#x27;s, nor does it smell particularly like gardenias.  </li>
            <li>This one is clouded by a cheap old lady Aqua Net hair spray smell.....</li>
            <li>I wore this cologne when I was a senior in high school.  </li>
            <li>My Mama introduced me to Jungle Gardenia when I was very young.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This fragrance is definitely not the same as the original Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache.  </li>
            <li>Though I didn&#x27;t think it smelled as the JG of old, I wore it to work the next day but could not seem to put enough on for it to last more than a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Have looked for years for a replacement for the Jungle Gardenia of old.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps Evyan will continue to strive to meet the old standards of Tuvache.  </li>
            <li>it may not be the exact same, simply because like someone mentioned, many of the ingredients used in the past to make perfume are now banned.</li>
            <li>ladies, don&#x27;t be tricked into believing this is the one we all remember wearing in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original.</li>
            <li>The older version I know was from a different company.  </li>
            <li>In November 2011, I bought a 1 ounce bottle for $ 49, it smelled a little sweeter than the original when first sprayed on, then after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a little research first because I used this perfume in the 60&#x27;s and have been looking for it since then.</li>
            <li>I understand that over the years certain fragrances became difficult to get or were deemed less that safe, so the formula has changed.</li>
            <li>It is just a little loud at first, then it calms down.</li>

            <li> it is strong enough to last all day and sweet enough to make you smell clean.</li>
            <li> but, she claims this is simply as close to the original smell you could get.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as it once was and does stay with me as the original did.</li>
            <li> not every perfume is going to smell the exact same if another company buys the trademark, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells NOTHING like the perfume from the 70&#x27;s, nor does it smell particularly like gardenias.  </li>
            <li> This one is clouded by a cheap old lady Aqua Net hair spray smell.....</li>
            <li> I wore this cologne when I was a senior in high school.  </li>
            <li> My Mama introduced me to Jungle Gardenia when I was very young.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definitely not the same as the original Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache.  </li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t think it smelled as the JG of old, I wore it to work the next day but could not seem to put enough on for it to last more than a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Have looked for years for a replacement for the Jungle Gardenia of old.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps Evyan will continue to strive to meet the old standards of Tuvache.  </li>
            <li> it may not be the exact same, simply because like someone mentioned, many of the ingredients used in the past to make perfume are now banned.</li>
            <li> ladies, don&#x27;t be tricked into believing this is the one we all remember wearing in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original.</li>
            <li> The older version I know was from a different company.  </li>
            <li> In November 2011, I bought a 1 ounce bottle for $ 49, it smelled a little sweeter than the original when first sprayed on, then after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a little research first because I used this perfume in the 60&#x27;s and have been looking for it since then.</li>
            <li> I understand that over the years certain fragrances became difficult to get or were deemed less that safe, so the formula has changed.</li>
            <li> It is just a little loud at first, then it calms down.</li>
            <li> I first heard about Jungle Gardenia on a vintage perfume website, but saddened to hear it was hard to find or discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is not exact, but close enough that I can go back to my signature perfume.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the scent does not seem to last all day as I had read and hoped.  </li>
            <li> Jungle gardenia wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This could be due to my body chemistry, but I have others that don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Very old name in perfumes and verturally impossible to find, and have not seen it in several decades, but I have it now.</li>
            <li> It was so disappointing to try others with the same or similar names as they just did not have the &amp;#34;certain something&amp;#34; this fragrance has!  </li>
            <li> I wore Jungle Gardenia in my teens and early 20&#x27;s until I was unable to find it in any store.  </li>
            <li> It is a perfume I used as a young women and for years was unable to find it anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product--my purchase went in the trash, I couldn&#x27;t give it away.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> (I lived during the 60&#x27;s when this could be purchased for a few bucks at Woolworth).  </li>
            <li> I took the perfume to my Mama in GA, I live in SC, and asked her if I was indeed crazy, or was the smell of this perfume the correct smell of Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li> is usually &amp;#34;spot-on&amp;#34; with its products.  </li>
            <li> This is the most horrible smelling stuff I have ever smelled, and no, this is not the way Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache&#x27; smelled.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product but was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift and one the person was unable to locate for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> She loves the scent and was unhappy that she had used up her previous bottle.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it even though I&#x27;m not happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> THIS IS CERTAINLY FALSE ADVERTISMENT.</li>
            <li> off the mark, the scent was very weak</li>
            <li> I personally hate heavily scented perfumes and colognes.</li>
            <li> I just feel sad now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product bears no resemblance to that perfume.</li>
            <li> but it was awfully expensive</li>
            <li> Fragrance very faint.</li>
            <li> I was utterly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When Coty stopped making it I was so disappointed and looked for an alternative.  </li>
            <li> So if you want to try it go ahead, you have nothing to lose, but prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put some on and was appalled by the scent.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed with this fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wore this perfume for years and never smelled anything as horrible as this stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wore this cologne when I was a senior in high school.  I&#x27;m 52 now and this cologne smells amazing now just as it did back then. Thank you, Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wore Jungle Gardenia in my teens and early 20&#x27;s until I was unable to find it in any store.  It was so disappointing to try others with the same or similar names as they just did not have the &amp;#34;certain something&amp;#34; this fragrance has!  At the suggestion of a friend, I have now found it again on-line, and its everything I remember it to be.  My First and -  Only Love!!</li>
            <li> I first heard about Jungle Gardenia on a vintage perfume website, but saddened to hear it was hard to find or discontinued. I love so many of the good old fragrances, and given the high praise women (and men) were giving JG, I knew I had to try it if I ever had the chance. When I found it here on Amazon, I was ecstatic! I ordered, and when I received it, it was love at first sniff.  This is an extraordinary scent I hope to have in my life for the rest if my life. When I use up a bottle, I&#x27;ll buy another and another. There aren&#x27;t too many fragrances you can say that about. This stuff not only smells completely amazing, but it LASTS! I sprayed it on before bed and could smell it all night, and it was still there throughout the next morning. Wow! I hope they keep Jungle Gardenia around and that it doesn&#x27;t vanish again. It&#x27;s too good a fragrance to disappear into obscurity; a true classic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Jungle Gardenia fan with a couple of vintage bottles purchased on EBay and tucked away.  I&#x27;ve been searching for an up to date replacement and this version is pretty close - identical after it dries, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  In November 2011, I bought a 1 ounce bottle for $ 49, it smelled a little sweeter than the original when first sprayed on, then after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wanted that bottle, so I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  In April 2012, I bought an 2 ounce bottle for $ 69.  When I first sprayed it on, I was horrified - a strongly chemical smell which was not like ANY perfume, let alone Junge Gardenia.  I was furious and was going to demand a refund - but after about ten minutes, the chemical smell evaporated and after it dried it became - as far as I can tell - identical to the original. So, I&#x27;m okay with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But purchasers may want to know that the manufacturers seem to be experimenting with the propellant, or whatever it is that you call the medium that that carries the essential oils to your skin and then evaporates.  If the people who make the perfume are reading this -IMHO, the propellant you were using in fall 2011 is far superior to the propellant you are using in spring 2012.  Either way, I&#x27;ll remain a customer cause once the propellant dries it&#x27;s fine, identical or near identical to the beloved Jungle Gardenia of yore - but I prefer to NOT have to hold my nose for ten minutes after I put the perfume on!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT! It is just a little loud at first, then it calms down. If you like the smell of gardenia&#x27;s you will love it.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find they still make jungle gardenia perfume.  It is a perfume I used as a young women and for years was unable to find it anymore. just happened to look on the internet one day and could get it thru amazon. It is still the same product just more expensive than it used to be. Thankyou</li>
            <li> I have worn jungle gardenia for over 30 years. This is not the same product I have always purchased. A refund of my $65. would be nice.</li>
            <li> not the one I thought it was.wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells NOTHING like the perfume from the 70&#x27;s, nor does it smell particularly like gardenias.  I like flowery perfumes (so sue me), had strong memories of JG, so I bought it for my wife.  I was utterly disappointed.  Clearly a different company purchased the rights to the name, under which they are selling a completely different perfume.  For all I know it is perfectly good - just totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It baffles me that a business would buy an established product name, then choose to produce an unrelated product.  What possible business sense can that make?</li>
            <li> Fragrance very faint. Don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I was so happy to re-discover JUNGLE GARDENIA perfume on Amazon.com. I did a little research first because I used this perfume in the 60&#x27;s and have been looking for it since then. I read the history of the brand at another web site and was assured that this had the trademark. The reviews on Amazon.com all agreed that this was the one. Well,I just received it. And I can assure  you that ,while it is a pleasant fragrance,it is not,repeat NOT, the fragrance that I wore in the 60&#x27;s. I re-read the reviews. And the writers seemed young enough that they may have used one of the many reincarnations of Jungle Gardenia,none of which smelled like the original either. I remember the fragrance as being pure Gardenia. I&#x27;m not getting much of a gardenia smell from this perfume. Perhaps they bought the trademark,but not the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;Some things can never be recaptured. Maybe this is one of those things. But,I&#x27;ll keep looking and hoping. Maybe some day,someone will get it right.[[ASIN:B003H2YE9G Jungle Gardenia for Women]]</li>
            <li> Years ago I loved this scent, but this new version is NOT the same.  Too strong and it seems to linger for days.</li>
            <li> An old favorite- still great!</li>
            <li> My  wife loved it been looking for it since the  1980</li>
            <li> I use to wear it all the time.  Then it went off the market. I could not find it any where, and per chance I found you, still smells great.</li>
            <li> Have looked for years for a replacement for the Jungle Gardenia of old.  This is not exact, but close enough that I can go back to my signature perfume.  Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described. This was a mother&#x27;s day present for my mom who wore Jungle Gardenia in her teenage years in the 70s. She said it smells just like she remembers!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and one the person was unable to locate for a long time. She was thrilled - for 80th birthday !</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed this time. The first order I received several months ago had almost the original scent of Jungle Gardenia. This scent was&lt;br /&gt;way off the mark, the scent was very weak it smelled diluted.  I wont order it again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. My gf loves it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the jungle gardenia I love. I used to buy it from Tuvasha years ago, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the smell ever since they went out of business. This is no match!</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed with this fragrance!  It used to be my absolute favorite, but the composition has been changed.  It smells NOTHING like gardenias.  Can I return it without the original packaging?  Please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is usually &amp;#34;spot-on&amp;#34; with its products.  I would suggest you not carry this product.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definitely not the same as the original Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache.  It is very nice and when first applied, smells very similar to the original, but not as potent.  There is no lasting quality to the fragrance and must be applied often.  There was a notification that certain ingredients in the original we&#x27;re no longer allowed.  I don&#x27;t know what they are or how they affect the end result.  With that being said, if this is my only option, I will continue to reorder this product.  Perhaps Evyan will continue to strive to meet the old standards of Tuvache.  I&#x27;m sure there are many of us who would hope so.</li>
            <li> The wonderful fragrance is true to the original but the atomizer on mine doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to undo the top and apply that way.</li>
            <li> This was my Mother&#x27;s cologne when I was a child. I was aprehensive about ordering it fearing it wouldn&#x27;t smell the same after all these years.  The shipping service was excellent.  I received it in 2 days without even paying extra for priority mail.  The fragrance is wonderful, exactly as I remember it.  I love wearing it and it brings back wonderful memories of my Mother.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Had not used it in many years...still like it. Wish I could find it in bath powder, too. Don&#x27;t seem to see it in stores in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> My Mom wanted the Jungle Gardenia of the 1970s, it was her favorite. She says this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite for over forty years. It is a light scent. I personally hate heavily scented perfumes and colognes.</li>
            <li> Loved this sent in the 50s and it is still captivating.</li>
            <li> Jungle Gardenia for Women  Evyan Perfumes, Inc. ... What can I say... I have used Jungle Gardenia for Women  for over 45 years.  I must like it!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Jungle Gardenia I used to wear. My Mama introduced me to Jungle Gardenia when I was very young. Mama always smelled so good and I remember asking her what kind of perfume she had on. She would always smile and say Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache&#x27;. When I was old enough to make my own purchases, I bought a bottle of Jungle Gardenia. Everyone loved the smell, so when I found this, I was very happy--oh, not so much once I received it. I put some on and was appalled by the scent. This was not what I remembered Jungle Gardenia smelling like. I took the perfume to my Mama in GA, I live in SC, and asked her if I was indeed crazy, or was the smell of this perfume the correct smell of Jungle Gardenia. Mama&#x27;s reply: \\&quot;OMG, where did you get this from? This is the most horrible smelling stuff I have ever smelled, and no, this is not the way Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache&#x27; smelled. I wore this perfume for years and never smelled anything as horrible as this stuff. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product--my purchase went in the trash, I couldn&#x27;t give it away.</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago - not the cologne, but the Eau De Perfume and it was lovely.  This cologne just doesn&#x27;t compare.  The scent is very short lived.  I decided to keep it even though I&#x27;m not happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product with excitement.  Was for my wife.  This was the only fragrance I really enjoyed.  Purchased this product but was pretty disappointed.  Not the same!  Not upset.  Gave it a try but was hoping for a better result.  First caught the fragrance in the 1960&#x27;s and loved it.  This one is nice but is not as fragrant as the original and not quite the same.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED AND RECEIVED WHAT WAS ADVERTISED AS JUNGLE GARDENIA by EVYAN AND BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT JUNGLE GARDENIA.  THIS IS ISLAND GARDENIA OR SOME OFF THE WALL PERFUME BUT IT IS NOT JUNGLE GARDENIA.  I HAVE WORN JUNGLE GARDENIA ALL MY LIFE AND I CERTAINLY KNOW WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE AND THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE.  THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE ADVERTISED AS JUNGLE GARDENIA. THIS IS CERTAINLY FALSE ADVERTISMENT.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  The fragrance is way too overpowering.  I do know that our body chemistry changes and that may be part of the problem; however, The Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache I wore for so many years, was never so overpowering, and always really smelled of gardenias after the alcohol wore off.  I just feel sad now.</li>
            <li> I used the Original Jugle Gardenia in the 1960&#x27;s and this product doesn&#x27;t quite capture the original fragrance.  I understand that over the years certain fragrances became difficult to get or were deemed less that safe, so the formula has changed. I am sad and wish the orginall that I loved so much would still be available.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  Just what I was looking for.  My only complaint is that the scent does not seem to last all day as I had read and hoped.  I am okay with doing a refresh because it smells so good.  For the price, it should last longer.</li>
            <li> i recently bought this perfume for my mom for her birthday. she is like many of you on the reviews saying she wore it when she was younger and how perfect it is. well, i bought this for her thinking it was the one she wore many years ago. she absolutely loved it. it may not be the exact same, simply because like someone mentioned, many of the ingredients used in the past to make perfume are now banned. but, she claims this is simply as close to the original smell you could get. not every perfume is going to smell the exact same if another company buys the trademark, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it still isn&#x27;t great. gardenias are my favorite flower and i can tell you, this perfume smells exactly like fresh gardenias. it is strong enough to last all day and sweet enough to make you smell clean. stop comparing to the old and accept the new, amazing smell. it is still gardenia.</li>
            <li> love it, so do my fans</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Jungle Gardenia for years; it was signature summer scent.  When Coty stopped making it I was so disappointed and looked for an alternative.  I thought i had gotten lucky when I stumbled onto this so called \\&quot;jungle gardenia\\&quot; that claimed to be \\&quot;it\\&quot;.  This scent smells nothing like the clean soft gardenia fragrance that Coty did so well. This one is clouded by a cheap old lady Aqua Net hair spray smell.....Horrible. This is a fraud for sure.....ladies, don&#x27;t be tricked into believing this is the one we all remember wearing in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s.  I wouldn&#x27;t even use this perfume if I were paid to do so!  I just wasted my money.  COTY!!! PLEASE BRING BACK THE JUNGLE GARDENIA THAT WE LOVED SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I ordered. It came promptly, was well wrapped, and thrilled my mother who had requested it. She loves the scent and was unhappy that she had used up her previous bottle.</li>
            <li> I used Jungle Gardenia for about 10 years and then started using something else..  Could not find it for many years and then forgot about it.  Chanced on Island Gardenia and got it.  Not the right fragrance&lt;br /&gt;A sales clerk .&lt;br /&gt;suggested I go online.  I did and found Jungle Gardenia.  It is not the same as it once was and does stay with me as the original did.</li>
            <li> I wore this years ago and it was not this costly.  Smells exactly like gardenias.  I probably won&#x27;t order it again because of the cost.</li>
            <li> Very old name in perfumes and verturally impossible to find, and have not seen it in several decades, but I have it now. The gift was just what hit the spot for her. Glad to find it again. GREAT fragrance unlike others, I think.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mother-she specifically asked for this perfume. To be a specific request, must be a good product.</li>
            <li> Jungle gardenia wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> I wore the original Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache for 20 years. Unfortunately this product bears no resemblance to that perfume. Not only does it not smell like Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache, it didn&#x27;t even smell good to me. I realize everyone&#x27;s nose is different, but my nose knows Jungle Gardenia when it smells it and what I got wasn&#x27;t Jungle Gardenia. Whatever it is that Evyan is selling there is no way it could be mistaken for my Jungle Gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that Evyan was very courteous and prompt in refunding my $$$ so I have no complaints on that account. So if you want to try it go ahead, you have nothing to lose, but prepare to be disappointed. I would still like to find the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three - it smelled great going on but changed after about 30 minutes then totally faded. This could be due to my body chemistry, but I have others that don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Iam thrilled to have found my signature perfume again as it was all Iused to wear and was devastated when Icould no longer find it,over the years I tried other so called gardenia perfumes but nothing could ever come close to jungle . gardenia  so to have found it again is my gift from heaven Please keep making it I used to buy tuvaches jungle gardenia bath powder and soap as well as perfume oil any plans to expand the jungle gardenia line sincerly Anita munro</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance of Jungle Gardenia, as a young girl, and was very pleased to find it available and smelling just as sweetly as I remembered.  It arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Not scent that I used to get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the older version of Jungle Gardenia in the past and loved it and was so happy to see that it&#x27;s now carried by Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  I had constant compliments on it from people I knew and strangers.  The older version I know was from a different company.  This version is about as good as the original - still has a great Gardenia fragrance to it but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and would order it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at their online store.  There had been lots of looking all over the internet to find my wonderful Jungle Gardenia and found their site. I was so excited but it was awfully expensive (I lived during the 60&#x27;s when this could be purchased for a few bucks at Woolworth).  It smelled nothing like the Jungle Gardenia I knew as a kid.  I had found a bottle (partial) at a garage sale a couple of years ago and loved having it again.  So I was really pumped up when I got it.  Though I didn&#x27;t think it smelled as the JG of old, I wore it to work the next day but could not seem to put enough on for it to last more than a couple of years.  Plus, it just didn&#x27;t smell like the Jungle Gardenia of the 60&#x27;s.  They ARE very nice, however.  Very nice people.  Said all I need do is to return it (which I shall). The stars are for the people...not the product!</li>
