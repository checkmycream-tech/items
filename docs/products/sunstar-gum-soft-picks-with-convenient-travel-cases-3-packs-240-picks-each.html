            <li> Incredible expensive compare to Costco and other distributors.</li>
            <li> These are the first and only ones that have reversed the slow loss of gum to plaque.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using them can be difficult for people with tight teeth resulting in bent posts particularly when trying to clean molars toward the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> One reason that I use the GUM Soft-Picks over other picks is because they are small enough to fit between the narrow spaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li> For 20 years I went through agonizing, long and humiliating dental exams.  </li>
            <li> No probs, product was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, teeth are tight, and I find it difficult to reach a couple teeth with regular floss (confirmed by my hygienist).  </li>
            <li> Not a cheap &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; you sometimes see in the market.</li>
            <li> Those of us with gum problems (i.e. gingivitis and periodonitis) know the importance of flossing everyday to remove food particles between teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist was convinced that I was not flossing despite my using string floss at least 4 times a day, brushing three times a day with an Oral-B toothbrush and using a tartar control mouthwash.</li>
            <li> that might mean checking a bunch.  </li>
            <li> Some products are less expensive store brands.</li>
            <li> Some others were just ineffective while others were particularly irritating to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> GUM soft picks are exactly what needed for additional flossing of my teeth. The value pack offing makes it very ffordle.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Not a cheap &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; you sometimes see in the market.</li>
            <li> Besides promoting gum health, it is much gentler than most other picks I&#x27;ve tried.  I noticed improved gum condition within days.</li>
            <li> I use them almost exclusively.  Hygienist gave me some samples after my cleaning visit and I have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I try these......am sooooo glad I did.......these are FANTASTIC......another item best bought in bulk.....always have one handy...!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.  It is really helpful in keeping your gums clean.  I like to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> No probs, product was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> My wife uses these all the time and wanted some more.  I found this posting at Amazon.com and got them.  They are the original and work like a charm.  Thanks for the great price!</li>
            <li> My wife has had me buy this brand of soft picks for around 3 to 4 years now.  She finds this brand very good (I don&#x27;t) and I find that the price is as good as I have found.  First make sure you find a pick that works best for you and that might mean checking a bunch.  After you find it than locate the best deal.  I personally think they all suck and believe in the electric tooth bruch and dental floss twice a day.</li>
            <li> Saved a lot of money order bulk! This time all the soft picks arrived in pink to support breast cancer. Nice.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this higher, if this had not arrived in packaging that banged up the product packaging.  The product is great and with the travel case, I can use these where ever I am.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my dentist.it&#x27;s a great alternative to flossing and toothpicks because it&#x27;s so gentle. the traveling case is a great idea/</li>
            <li> For my parents.  They like them for functional form and hygiene - one time use.  Not my opinion, but they are critical.</li>
            <li> i will buy another  . and this product is very good .  thanks for  all  . i will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery at a great price.</li>
            <li> Approved by father-in-law (and he&#x27;s a dental surgeon). Enough said!</li>
            <li> Incredible expensive compare to Costco and other distributors. Since the amount purchased was large I believed the price should have been more competitive but it was not...by far!</li>
            <li> Always happy when I get these.....best product on the market so far for teeth cleaning in between brushing...even got my friends hooked on them also.....recommend highly....</li>
            <li> For 20 years I went through agonizing, long and humiliating dental exams.  My dentist was convinced that I was not flossing despite my using string floss at least 4 times a day, brushing three times a day with an Oral-B toothbrush and using a tartar control mouthwash. My partner could not believe my dread of the dental exam as hers was pain free. Over that time I tried different flossing products, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and electric toothbrushes with no improvement in gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using these picks about 3 years ago. My first exam about 5 months after I started using these picks was pain free. For the first time, I understood how my partner could report pain free dental visits.  And all dental visits have resulted in compliments about how well I am flossing. Also, my dental cleaning takes must less time, which makes my dentist happy but makes me wonder why I am spending even more on dental visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 20 years I have tried a number of similar products before and since discovering these.  Some products are less expensive store brands. I have a drawer full of tried and discarded flossing products. These are the first and only ones that have reversed the slow loss of gum to plaque. Some others were just ineffective while others were particularly irritating to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using them can be difficult for people with tight teeth resulting in bent posts particularly when trying to clean molars toward the back of the mouth. Practice can minimize bending of the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintain a large supply of these picks as I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to those torturous dental visits.</li>
            <li> Those of us with gum problems (i.e. gingivitis and periodonitis) know the importance of flossing everyday to remove food particles between teeth.  However, flossing sometimes just doesn&#x27;t get everything.  I found the GUM Soft-Picks to be a good way to clean out particles that flossing may have missed.  The bristles do a good job of catching food without harming gums.  One reason that I use the GUM Soft-Picks over other picks is because they are small enough to fit between the narrow spaces of my teeth. I have tried the GUM Go-Betweens, but have a hard time fitting those between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!  I have a small mouth, teeth are tight, and I find it difficult to reach a couple teeth with regular floss (confirmed by my hygienist).  These soft-picks really get between the teeth and are easy to use. I will continue to buy them.  Hopefully the next dentist visit will confirm my love for these picks!</li>
