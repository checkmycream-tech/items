            <li> Light.  Not flowery.  Very femine but not too girly.  And definately not overpowering.  I have been coming back to this one for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Bold yet feminine. This is my go to fragrance during the summer.Jasmine, musk, beach type fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for 15 years, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air every time I smell it.</li>
            <li> I chose to give five stars on this one!  It is an amazing fragrance!  And has real lasting power..  Also, it just gets prettier, even hours after you&#x27;ve applied it.. Pretty, fresh, beautiful and in a way, very natural too.. I would purchase again.. And it came very quickly, within 2days after I made the order!  Very nicely packaged and had pamphlet about the company, tucked in there too.. Thank you!</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume ever!  Just a nice fresh and clean smell.  No one note is dominant.  So it has fruit and flowers but it just blends together so well.
