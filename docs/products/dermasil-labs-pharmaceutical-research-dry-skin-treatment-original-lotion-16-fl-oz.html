            <li>It&#x27;s unscented but still pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is top notch  and the pump is great.  </li>
            <li>Sure, everything under the sun and beyond seems to cause some kind of cancer these days, but why add one more thing if you can avoid it?</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it makes your skin feels really smooth and being that I type all day, it is good to keep at my desk.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great &amp; is pretty well unscented.</li>
            <li>My dad gave me a tube of this,  I just love this.</li>
            <li>I did find it at Dollar Tree and bought out the store :)</li>
            <li>Will always buy more of this lotion</li>
            <li>Dermasil seems to better than most.</li>
            <li>Many skin care products leave my hands feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I noticed today that my heels looked soooo much better.</li>
            <li>My family and I love Dermasil.</li>
            <li>I can still ad perfume or another scented lotion over the top if I want.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is the best lotion I have ever used for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best Dry Skin product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy and works all day.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see that Amazon had a very large bottle.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be good for excessively dry skin and leaves skin feeling really softer than before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my skin feel instantly soft and it hasn&#x27;t got a  strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Dermasil for showing up at the Dollar Tree!</li>
            <li>I love applying Dermasil as it gives instant results...moisture.  </li>
            <li>and this helps it so much.</li>

            <li>IT CALMS THE RED, ITCHY, DRY SKIN AND LEAVES IT SOFT AND NICE LOOKING</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also comedogenic, which means it blocks up your skin&#x27;s pores and impedes its natural respiration process.</li>
            <li>The difference is night and day - my feet were really dry from working on my house barefooted and now they&#x27;re pretty well back to normal, and even the burning is gone.    </li>

            <li> real healing properties for estra dry skin.</li>
            <li> No strong smell, nice compact bottle shape and thick consistency are all additional pluses and a little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Anyone with really dry skin problems, especially if you have cracking on your feet and hands, must give this lotion a try.</li>
            <li> With regular lotions my legs will be dry and flakey by bedtime, but not with this.  </li>
            <li> Just picked up a bottle the other day to use on both my hands and feet but didn&#x27;t actually try it on my feet until about 20 minutes ago.</li>
            <li> I Have not even used it that religiously probably every other night or so.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter which causes flare ups of my eczema.</li>

            <li> I have been on a mission to cure my dry heels.</li>
            <li> If your heels are dry you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> HAVE EXTREMELY DRY SKIN AND CANNOT DO WITHOUT THIS LOTION.  </li>
            <li> This product does not, and it takes very little to moisturize my hands.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> My heels were not in terrible shape but they were visibly dry and there were some visible crack lines but no pain.</li>

            <li> My dad gave me a tube of this,  I just love this. I buy it from Amazon all the time now! Its great for the face.</li>
            <li> Just picked up a bottle the other day to use on both my hands and feet but didn&#x27;t actually try it on my feet until about 20 minutes ago. The difference is night and day - my feet were really dry from working on my house barefooted and now they&#x27;re pretty well back to normal, and even the burning is gone.    Anyone with really dry skin problems, especially if you have cracking on your feet and hands, must give this lotion a try. No strong smell, nice compact bottle shape and thick consistency are all additional pluses and a little bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion. I have extremely dry skin in the winter which causes flare ups of my eczema. This lotion helped keep it under control. I couldn&#x27;t find this lotion anywhere so I ordered off here. I did find it at Dollar Tree and bought out the store :) Will always buy more of this lotion</li>
            <li> It seems to be good for excessively dry skin and leaves skin feeling really softer than before. I use it on my hands, above my heels and on my arms. In Arizona, your skin is dry. Dermasil seems to better than most.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! They also have both a day and night formula for face. I have extremely dry skin and this helps it so much. It can be purchased at Dollar Tree for $1. Seriously!</li>
            <li> But this stuff does. It&#x27;s the fourth ingredient listed, and it&#x27;s a known carcinogen. It&#x27;s also comedogenic, which means it blocks up your skin&#x27;s pores and impedes its natural respiration process. Unless Dermacil started making this lotion without that ingredient, I would suggest using something else. Sure, everything under the sun and beyond seems to cause some kind of cancer these days, but why add one more thing if you can avoid it?</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I may even order it again when I need it to,&lt;br /&gt;I will tell everyone about it too</li>
            <li> Many skin care products leave my hands feeling greasy.  This product does not, and it takes very little to moisturize my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission to cure my dry heels. So I would try to moisturize with what ever I had on hand and would buy feet creams from the local grocery store or the drugstores. My heels were not in terrible shape but they were visibly dry and there were some visible crack lines but no pain. I was starting to think that I just have to live with that. Nope, this stuff has really transformed my heels. I Have not even used it that religiously probably every other night or so. I noticed today that my heels looked soooo much better. Almost no dryness at all. I received two 8 oz containers without the pump. I would have preferred the pump but no big deal since it actually works. If your heels are dry you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!...real healing properties for estra dry skin. Within two to three days I felt and saw the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great- seems like it leaves a protective layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the best I have ever found, no greasy residue either.  Thanks Dermasil for showing up at the Dollar Tree!</li>
            <li> My local stores do not carry Dermasil so I was excited to see that Amazon had a very large bottle.  My family and I love Dermasil.</li>
            <li> I get the Dermasil 10oz bottles at the local Dollar Tree. This stuff is great &amp; is pretty well unscented.</li>
            <li> I love applying Dermasil as it gives instant results...moisture.  When I have time, I use extra and wrap my legs in plastic wrap while I put on my make-up.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottle that pours and I noticed the pump.  The lotion is top notch  and the pump is great.  This lotion is the best lotion I have ever used for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it makes your skin feels really smooth and being that I type all day, it is good to keep at my desk.  You can get a 10fl oz at the Dollar tree for $1</li>
            <li> If I could I&#x27;d give this product 10 Stars.  Best Dry Skin product I&#x27;ve ever used AND the bonus is I can afford it!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel instantly soft and it hasn&#x27;t got a  strong fragrance.  Also doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> HAVE EXTREMELY DRY SKIN AND CANNOT DO WITHOUT THIS LOTION.  IT CALMS THE RED, ITCHY, DRY SKIN AND LEAVES IT SOFT AND NICE LOOKING</li>
            <li> Did not come with a pump as I ordered, came with a squeeze bottle. Like the lotion, but would have preferred pump.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a lot like Cetaphil.  It&#x27;s unscented but still pleasant.  (I think some unscented products smell gross.)  It is smooth and creamy and works all day.  With regular lotions my legs will be dry and flakey by bedtime, but not with this.  I can still ad perfume or another scented lotion over the top if I want.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It has MINERAL OIL which causes cancer</li>
