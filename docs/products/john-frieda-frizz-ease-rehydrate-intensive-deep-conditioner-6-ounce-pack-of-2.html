            <li>each J.F.&#x27;s Frizz Ease is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is THE best condition EVER.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used the packet conditioner that comes with Revlon Colorsilk hair color and tried your best to find out what it is, this is the closest you&#x27;ll come to finding it.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>It also has a great smell to it!</li>
            <li>very good product, delicious aroma, ideal for hair care</li>
            <li>Brilliant.  </li>
            <li>So, this is a great solution for frizzy hair that won&#x27;t chew up your budget.</li>
            <li>Great price too</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>HAPPY ENDINIG:  </li>
            <li>Great to relax the frizz</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>The best part is that most of the items were prime and I recieved it in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I have a good hair cut, full body , it lays perfect; but</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and smells good.</li>
            <li>This particular seller offered the best deal of all, that I saw.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for years to buy a conditioner that would leave my hair as smooth and in as good of a condition as the after color conditioner does after I dye my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very fine</li>
            <li>; fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, keeps my hair soft and fizz-free.</li>
            <li>, I love that leaving it soft, silky and shiny, very good this line.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really nourishes and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m pleased this works like it says  its supposed to</li>
            <li>The amount of moisture this product puts back into my hair for 2-3 days is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best deep conditioner</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be more happier with the product.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I still use it, just wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li>I started using this as my regular conditioner and while it does not make my hair perfect, the curls are more defined and much softer.</li>
            <li>Good thing I bought two, so I did not have to run out to the store the next week to get more.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 stars but there is nothing really that I LOVE about it,</li>
            <li>Wonderful for the naturally curly hair that can frizz when wet.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural curly/wavy and a beautiful white.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product has the right consistency for every day use.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but should have paid attention to the fact that this is only 6 ounces.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner that I keep going back to.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I found claims that said this works exactly like it.  </li>
            <li>and after so many trials and errors, I had used a couple of tubes of this (it only takes about a dime-size drop onto the palm of the hand for very long hair), and fallen in love with it.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works fine for my thin, fine hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Normally I try to get more higher end salon products, but when I can&#x27;t afford the tiny bottles for $50</li>
            <li>I first saw the product at Ulta, but decided to see how much Amazon cost, and Amazon was way cheaper than Ulta.</li>
            <li>No more flyaways, no frizz, a gorgeous sheen with no added weight to the hair, no greasiness.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I will be purchasing it in the future.  </li>
            <li>I Start used but for really be result probably in one moth</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I have very curly frizzy hair, and this product tames it well.</li>
            <li>Shampoo works very well also.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>I have what can only be described as some of the most unruly and untamable hair, but when I combine this deep conditioner with John Frida&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frizz Ease&amp;#34; shampoo, it&#x27;s like I literally had a hair</li>
            <li>When the 2nd tube was running out, I went back for more.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for overprocessed hair people like myself.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s rare for a claimed deep conditioning product!</li>
            <li>I got that tip from someone else on the net and they were right.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t fess up to how many I bought, but suffice it to say that thanks to Amazon and this seller, I have enough to last me for several YEARS!</li>
            <li>Leaves my thick hair so soft and silky, I can&#x27;t keep my own hands off it.</li>
            <li>If I get anywhere near moisture, BAM, I have frizz!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair shining and soft and no frizz!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed ethnicity and have kinky-curly hair that frustrates many a hair stylists...and frustrates me every other day!</li>
            <li>and makes your hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Will buy forever as it makes my hair so soft &amp; manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair had started to get naturally drier which means it is lightweight and fly-away</li>
            <li>Not too thick and precious.</li>
            <li>I leave it in for a few minutes, rinse it out, and my hair is super soft and after drying and styling</li>
            <li>I tried those because I saw on the John Frieda website that a whole new line is out now and none of it remotely looks similar in name or purpose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally wavy but will turn to frizz in a matter of a second.</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner that makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that claim was 100% accurate but needless to say I really like this product.  </li>

            <li> I use after normal conditioner every other time I shower and leave in for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>

            <li> my hair sees just about every type of condition that exists; humid, dry, hot, cold, ocean water...</li>
            <li> This size tube will last for at least 6 months.</li>

            <li> I have a little over shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Other online vendors outside of Amazon indicated it is discontinued, but a few were selling it at silly prices plus too-high shipping.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy products I already know and like and on occasion I buy gifts and clothes.</li>
            <li> Even using a small amount, this occurs.  </li>
            <li> This was not a very good bargain nor a time saver.</li>
            <li> My hair after child birth and medications for arthritis made my hair frizzy (that not even hair spray could help)and dull to the point</li>
            <li> and I mean &amp;#34;super&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Its not perfect for me</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, nasty, rough curly hair.</li>
            <li> I forged on, disappointed.  </li>
            <li> its awful!</li>

            <li> Smells great and really nourishes and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years as it beats any other conditioner I have used in controlling frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li> and makes your hair really soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve only ever used the serum so i&#x27;m pleased this works like it says  its supposed to</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased John Frieda&#x27;s products. Normally I try to get more higher end salon products, but when I can&#x27;t afford the tiny bottles for $50 each J.F.&#x27;s Frizz Ease is perfect for my hair. I&#x27;m mixed ethnicity and have kinky-curly hair that frustrates many a hair stylists...and frustrates me every other day! The amount of moisture this product puts back into my hair for 2-3 days is wonderful. I leave it in for about 7-10 minutes while showering and then I can towel dry to wear it curly. The next day I can straighten it if I want and there&#x27;s no residue from the day before. That&#x27;s rare for a claimed deep conditioning product! So, this is a great solution for frizzy hair that won&#x27;t chew up your budget. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I Start used but for really be result probably in one moth</li>
            <li> This is THE best condition EVER.

I have what can only be described as some of the most unruly and untamable hair, but when I combine this deep conditioner with John Frida&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frizz Ease&amp;#34; shampoo, it&#x27;s like I literally had a hair transplant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot, so my hair sees just about every type of condition that exists; humid, dry, hot, cold, ocean water... you name it!  This stuff saves me from myself!</li>
            <li> Brilliant.  Will buy forever as it makes my hair so soft &amp; manageable.  Highly recommend for overprocessed hair people like myself. I use once to twice a week because I flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but should have paid attention to the fact that this is only 6 ounces. Good thing I bought two, so I did not have to run out to the store the next week to get more. I shop online to save time and money.  I usually buy products I already know and like and on occasion I buy gifts and clothes. This was not a very good bargain nor a time saver.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, nasty, rough curly hair. I started using this as my regular conditioner and while it does not make my hair perfect, the curls are more defined and much softer. I ran out and went back to my regular conditioner and noticed my hair started to feel like straw again. I went back to this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the naturally curly hair that can frizz when wet.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use after normal conditioner every other time I shower and leave in for a few minutes before rinsing. Keeps my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Bottles should always have bottom openings. This product has the right consistency for every day use. Not too thick and precious.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a lot of body and fullness; but I was looking for some sheen to go along with it.  My hair is natural curly/wavy and a beautiful white.  I have a good hair cut, full body , it lays perfect; but no sheen.  What do I need?  I thought this would be it.</li>
            <li> My hair after child birth and medications for arthritis made my hair frizzy (that not even hair spray could help)and dull to the point I never wore my hair down. After buying John Frieda Frizz Ease line my hair has done a total transformation. I can&#x27;t be more happier with the product. I first saw the product at Ulta, but decided to see how much Amazon cost, and Amazon was way cheaper than Ulta. The best part is that most of the items were prime and I recieved it in no time at all. Definitly would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner that I keep going back to. I have a little over shoulder length hair. It is very fine and I mean &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; fine! It&#x27;s naturally wavy but will turn to frizz in a matter of a second. If I get anywhere near moisture, BAM, I have frizz! its awful! But this conditioner does help that situation. Its not perfect for me but I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works fine for my thin, fine hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> very good product, delicious aroma, ideal for hair care, I love that leaving it soft, silky and shiny, very good this line. thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product to tackle frizziness caused by humidity. It seems to work to some degree, but the humid days still brought out the wolf</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is easy to use and I will be purchasing it in the future.  This size tube will last for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have very curly frizzy hair, and this product tames it well. It has a nice consistency and smells good. I would give it 4 stars but there is nothing really that I LOVE about it, I just like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that makes my hair soft and shiny and I have tried everything. Great price too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, keeps my hair soft and fizz-free. we&#x27;ll worth the price. I&#x27;ll buy them again. Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> This is crazy-good stuff and has been discontinued.  My hair had started to get naturally drier which means it is lightweight and fly-away and after so many trials and errors, I had used a couple of tubes of this (it only takes about a dime-size drop onto the palm of the hand for very long hair), and fallen in love with it.  No more flyaways, no frizz, a gorgeous sheen with no added weight to the hair, no greasiness.  When the 2nd tube was running out, I went back for more.  ZAP, none on the shelves anywhere locally.  I tried 2 other of Frieda&#x27;s conditioners and they made my hair look dirty halfway into the day, and tried some more with similar results and with all of them, my hair was dull and dry and flyaway.  I tried those because I saw on the John Frieda website that a whole new line is out now and none of it remotely looks similar in name or purpose.  I forged on, disappointed.  Other online vendors outside of Amazon indicated it is discontinued, but a few were selling it at silly prices plus too-high shipping.  On  Amazon there were a number of sellers offering it, at varying prices.  This particular seller offered the best deal of all, that I saw.  Elsewhere online I found that conditioners can last for years if unopened and left in climate controlled spaces out of the sun.  HAPPY ENDINIG:  I won&#x27;t fess up to how many I bought, but suffice it to say that thanks to Amazon and this seller, I have enough to last me for several YEARS!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair shining and soft and no frizz! Great buy! Shampoo works very well also. It also has a great smell to it!</li>
            <li> While this product does help keep my hair from snagging, it also makes it look greasy the next day.  Even using a small amount, this occurs.  I still use it, just wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for years to buy a conditioner that would leave my hair as smooth and in as good of a condition as the after color conditioner does after I dye my hair.  After doing some research, I found claims that said this works exactly like it.  I don&#x27;t believe that claim was 100% accurate but needless to say I really like this product.  I leave it in for a few minutes, rinse it out, and my hair is super soft and after drying and styling it&#x27;s very frizz-free.  Definitely a product to try!</li>
            <li> Great to relax the frizz</li>
