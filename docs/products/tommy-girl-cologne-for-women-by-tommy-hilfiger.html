            <li>ANOTHER WONDERFULLY PLEASANT, LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>I usually love Hilfiger fragrances, but I didn&#x27;t like the way this one smelled at all.</li>
            <li>To that end, I think most people would like Tommy Girl.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>They make so many sizes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a wonderful, fresh scent with a pinch of something that makes me feel young without making me feel like a teenybopper.  </li>
            <li>Received authentic perfume in the original box.</li>
            <li>The bottle was full and sprayer worked fine.</li>
            <li>The scent is cool, fresh and relaxing for me.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it has a fresh, bold, young feeling in it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Fresh and citrusy.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much from this and was pleasantly surprised that it smelled so nice.  </li>
            <li>Nicely scented very fragrant and young</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance especially together with Tommy Hilfiger Righteous raspberry lotion.  </li>
            <li>Like it after a hot shower after mowing the lawn.  </li>
            <li>You really need to shop around and make sure when you think you find a deal on tommy girl you are comparing the same amount.  </li>
            <li>A kind of sweet smell that last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I FOUND ON AMAZON AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>It was so strong at first that it gave me a headache, and then after about ten minutes, it smelled kind of stale.</li>
            <li>Ideal for when the weather is warm and you feel like doing outdoor activities, because it&#x27;s not sweet, so it won&#x27;t make you feel sick.</li>
            <li>She got it for Christmas a few years ago and asked for more</li>
            <li>This was a decent price, but since the &amp;#34;Tommy Girl&amp;#34; name seems to suggest to teenagers that it&#x27;s for young &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; I just wish it came with a young girls&#x27; price.  </li>
            <li>after alot of tracking down I did end up finaly gettin the item I ordered, it was not their fault for the super long delay, but the post office, so I would order from them again, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again from this seller, since the price was comparable to others and they were decent enough to call it what it is, &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; so you know you are paying for.</li>

            <li> For anyone considering any perfume, I would suggest going to a department store, spritzing it on yourself, and wear it for the day (or however long it lasts) to find out whether you&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes/lotions she wears that don&#x27;t make me nauseous.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I usually love Hilfiger fragrances, but I didn&#x27;t like the way this one smelled at all. It was so strong at first that it gave me a headache, and then after about ten minutes, it smelled kind of stale. I gave it to my sister and made her promise not to wear it around me. Maybe it smells different on other people, but I definitely would not wear it again myself, and based on that, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else, either.</li>
            <li> I always worry about ordering perfume on line. Too often it turns out to be a knock off/fake. Received authentic perfume in the original box. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance especially together with Tommy Hilfiger Righteous raspberry lotion.  Both of them together the  smell is righteous .Purchased 4oz bottle but  1 oz was sent. Gave 3 stars because of perfume bottle  size.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it has a fresh, bold, young feeling in it!&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is a cologne, the smell lasts forever (I once put it on in the morning before going to work and in the evening after hugging my boyfriend I could feel it ON HIM)! Ideal for when the weather is warm and you feel like doing outdoor activities, because it&#x27;s not sweet, so it won&#x27;t make you feel sick. The size is very good for traveling. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> ANOTHER WONDERFULLY PLEASANT, LIGHT FRAGRANCE I FOUND ON AMAZON AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  THIS FRAGRANCE ALSO LASTS ALL DAY.  RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WOMEN.</li>
            <li> after alot of tracking down I did end up finaly gettin the item I ordered, it was not their fault for the super long delay, but the post office, so I would order from them again, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love Tommy Girl perfume!  It&#x27;s got a wonderful, fresh scent with a pinch of something that makes me feel young without making me feel like a teenybopper.  It&#x27;s not too floral but does have some hints of floral scents in it.  For anyone considering any perfume, I would suggest going to a department store, spritzing it on yourself, and wear it for the day (or however long it lasts) to find out whether you&#x27;d like it.  To that end, I think most people would like Tommy Girl.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with the product. If you like this fragrance, it&#x27;s a deal to purchase here. I was a regular user before purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> She got it for Christmas a few years ago and asked for more and it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes/lotions she wears that don&#x27;t make me nauseous.  This was a decent price, but since the &amp;#34;Tommy Girl&amp;#34; name seems to suggest to teenagers that it&#x27;s for young &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; I just wish it came with a young girls&#x27; price.  I&#x27;d buy again from this seller, since the price was comparable to others and they were decent enough to call it what it is, &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; so you know you are paying for. You really need to shop around and make sure when you think you find a deal on tommy girl you are comparing the same amount.  They make so many sizes.</li>
            <li> muy buena relacion de precio/calidad.&lt;br /&gt;Los perfumes tomy son muy ricos.&lt;br /&gt;En argentina salen 4 veces mas.&lt;br /&gt;3 palabras mas</li>
            <li> Fresh and citrusy.  Didn&#x27;t expect much from this and was pleasantly surprised that it smelled so nice.  Like it after a hot shower after mowing the lawn.  The scent is cool, fresh and relaxing for me.  Love it.</li>
            <li> A great price on this and it smell great on my wife.  A kind of sweet smell that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this perfume as a gift, she&#x27;s happy, so I am happy! Smells wonderful also!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife and she loves it. I like it also. The bottle was full and sprayer worked fine.</li>
            <li> I would advise not spraying too close to your nose.  Nicely scented very fragrant and young oh yeah it does say &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34;</li>
