            <li>The characters/ shapes fall off very easily.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know if they were going to be good quality or simply cheap looking</li>

            <li>Clips are cute, but took weeks to receive.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>these are really very cute and sweet</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and people wondering where they can get them</li>
            <li>these are some of the most adorable designs that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, but I specifically ordered them bc</li>
            <li>These are adorable.  </li>
            <li>these are very unique and you&#x27;ll find a color to go with every outfit imaginable</li>
            <li>Very cute and distinct.</li>
            <li>There were a successful trick for getting our daughter to wear her hair clips because we were able to make her think that fish, flowers, horses, cupcakes, and butterflies were far cooler to put in her hair than just bows.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loved them so much she put six in at a time.  </li>
            <li>I tried to post a picture, but after editing my original review i wasn&#x27;t able to.</li>
            <li>like them but one pin was rusty, cute but more particular types may not like the quality, for me for the price its ok</li>
            <li>These are super cute.</li>
            <li>The clips are jagged on the inside and not snag free</li>
            <li>Great price, some of the colors are unusual but overall well worth it since kids lose these so easily.</li>
            <li>Although the clips are unique, the colors used could be improved as they were not as colorful as seen in the image posted on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>Look very pretty.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Although these are adorable, I cannot use them for my eleven month old daughter bc</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s hair parts to the right</li>
            <li>Adorable with no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>Nothing a hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix though.    </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m only able to use the horse and fish clips on her.</li>
            <li>These were cute and well made, but I only received 14 of the 19 that it advertised.</li>
            <li>Really cute and different.</li>
            <li>Very cute, but a few have fallen off their clips.</li>
            <li>Plus arrived way before the expected delivery date I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li>These are great little hair clips and they actually stay in my daughter&#x27;s wild curly hair!</li>
            <li>and I already have to fix more than half of them.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li>the only thing I would change is the fact most of the designs are made for the right side of the head because that&#x27;s the way the clip is only 4 of them where for the left side</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a few cute ones in the pile</li>
            <li>A must have for any young girl.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>but the end is actually rounded instead of a normal point.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared at first</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the objects are attached to the hair clips with a hot glue gun and she has definitely pulled a few of the crocheted items off the clip.</li>

            <li> I love all of them!! but these for my niece and they are perfect!! the only thing I would change is the fact most of the designs are made for the right side of the head because that&#x27;s the way the clip is only 4 of them where for the left side and I didn&#x27;t receive any horses but the rest are very beautiful, I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I think they are adorable but I have one problem.  I cannot put matching pairs in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  All of one style have clips facing the same direction so I can only mismatch.  Nice quality but disappointing.</li>
            <li> Took weeks to arrive but well worth it.  These are super cute.</li>
            <li> Very cute and unique.  You won&#x27;t find anyone else wearing these.  My daughter loves them and likes to choose which one to wear.  I took 1 star off because they all face the same way.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, you can still wear the matching ones that way, but it&#x27;s a little awkward to have them face the same way on both side.  Doesn&#x27;t take away from their cuteness though.</li>
            <li> Another batch of clips to throw in the trash... The backings are too rough against baby&#x27;s head.  There&#x27;s a few cute ones in the pile but I got 9 donkeys.  Seriously?  Why would I want to put a donkey on my daughter&#x27;s head, let alone have 9 to choose from??  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The ribbon and crocheted animals falling out. Very bad quality. Colors were dull and looked old. Appears to be something put together in hurry. the glue is coming out on couple of them</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how cute these barrettes are! I was hoping for something that would look good in a family picture in my daughter&#x27;s hair. These barrettes are so cute I cannot decide which one to use. LOVE LOVE LOVE them.</li>
            <li> Clips are cute, but took weeks to receive.</li>
            <li> Although these are adorable, I cannot use them for my eleven month old daughter bc the back of the clip is NOT wrapped up and has a pointed end exposed.  I&#x27;ll have to wait until she&#x27;s a little bit older.</li>
            <li> Very cute, but a few have fallen off their clips. Nothing a hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix though.    *Edited after only having them a couple of weeks*  A lot of the crocheted pieces have fallen off of the clips and they have become rusty and unusable. On occasion my daughter&#x27;s hair is wet when we style it, but I never thought that the clips would become rusty. Huge waste of money! Think twice before purchasing them. I tried to post a picture, but after editing my original review i wasn&#x27;t able to.</li>
            <li> These were delivered quite promptly. There were a successful trick for getting our daughter to wear her hair clips because we were able to make her think that fish, flowers, horses, cupcakes, and butterflies were far cooler to put in her hair than just bows. The only downside is that the objects are attached to the hair clips with a hot glue gun and she has definitely pulled a few of the crocheted items off the clip.</li>
            <li> Somewhat poor quality .just got these yesterday and I already have to fix more than half of them. The characters/ shapes fall off very easily. The clips don&#x27;t hold well on my daughters hair either.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful I had to write a review!!! I was a little scared at first didn&#x27;t know if they were going to be good quality or simply cheap looking but boy was I wrong! They are well made, unique, bright in color perfect for my 10 month old :D would highly recommend these to everyone. Plus arrived way before the expected delivery date I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> these are beautifull, they look great on my 2yo.</li>
            <li> Great price, some of the colors are unusual but overall well worth it since kids lose these so easily.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very cute and distinct. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Misleading labelling of product ---- Not animal themed as the only animals among them were 3 horses, 2 butterflies and 3 fishes. My baby&#x27;s hair parts to the right so I&#x27;m only able to use the horse and fish clips on her. The other 13 clips are for partings to the left side. Although the clips are unique, the colors used could be improved as they were not as colorful as seen in the image posted on the Amazon website. Disappointing purchase as the items I received were not as described by previous buyers except for the bottom section of the clips were not wrapped up as claimed by the seller.</li>
            <li> these are really very cute and sweet</li>
            <li> These were cute and well made, but I only received 14 of the 19 that it advertised.</li>
            <li> Adorable with no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> These are great little hair clips and they actually stay in my daughter&#x27;s wild curly hair! The only misleading thing I would say about them is that they&#x27;re labelled as animal hair clips. The only animals are fish and horses - all of the others are flowers, cherries, hearts, etc. but that didn&#x27;t bother e a bit. The underneath part of the clip is not covered with fabric but the end is actually rounded instead of a normal point. A great buy!</li>
            <li> very cute and work great! i use they to put my daughters bangs out of her face or clip them next to a pony tail</li>
            <li> Really cute and different.</li>
            <li> The clips are jagged on the inside and not snag free</li>
            <li> Love these hair clips!</li>
            <li> These are adorable!!! I use them every day on my 14 mo old&#x27;s hair and they are just perfect. I get so many compliments and people wondering where they can get them</li>
            <li> these are some of the most adorable designs that I&#x27;ve seen. the only thing that I could say bad about them is that they don&#x27;t stay in the hair as well as some of those &amp;#34;snap clips&amp;#34;.but these are very unique and you&#x27;ll find a color to go with every outfit imaginable</li>
            <li> like them but one pin was rusty, cute but more particular types may not like the quality, for me for the price its ok</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, but I specifically ordered them bc they say &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; themed and others mentioned that they came with horses.  My daughter loves horses.  The only animals in mine were 4 fish.  The rest are cupcakes, suns, cherries, and strawberries.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Look very pretty. However the sharp, exposed metal of the clip can end up hurting the child. They should cover up that portion.</li>
            <li> These are adorable.  They are all crochet perfectly.  The clip does not pull the hair.  My granddaughter loved them so much she put six in at a time.  A must have for any young girl.</li>
