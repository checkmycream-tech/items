            <li>I have been using Gratiae for 3 years and love this serum!</li>
            <li>Love this line of products!</li>
            <li>I love it - it works!  </li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d taken better care of my skin all along!</li>
            <li>It was so inexpensive &amp; I liked the produce discription plus the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals</li>
            <li>Very bright and alive....</li>
            <li>I found magic.</li>
            <li>and I just love how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on</li>
            <li>When I recieved my shipment of Gratiae face lifting serum there was more product in the box than in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>am I glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about it</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I got waylaid at a mall (as is the case with most everyone here), and discovered these products.  </li>
            <li>I say this because I love the products.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a year and it is my favorite of all the skin products I use.  </li>
            <li>it is smooth and silky and really has helped my complexion a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it feels oily when it goes on, but my skin drinks it up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are hands down the best products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had such great results.</li>
            <li>tell me my skin is fabulous and my friend told me I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li>I do notice that it can cause my makeup to not be smooth unless used with an additional day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels velvety smooth after I&#x27;m finished, but that&#x27;s about all.  </li>
            <li>Hope Gratiae is always available at this price.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this serum for a very high price in Las Vegas and was so thrilled to learn I could order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love Gratiae products ~ they really deliver results!  </li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s mild fragrance (not a fragrance person).  </li>
            <li>Listen, as we get older are skin gets drier &amp; most products aim at 18 to 28 years market.  </li>
            <li>serum\\&quot; after all, right?  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly,  and  feels wonderful on the skin, is non irritating, and  the bottle lasted me a whole year.</li>
            <li>Well This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I was given a tiny sample and thought it was interesting.</li>
            <li>You will love the results if you use this line of skin care as directed daily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going back to my favorite over the counter products.</li>
            <li>Whatever remains on my hand, I rub in (my hands have become much softer, too!).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product that leaves your skin looking fabulous &amp; feeling soft &amp; velvety while diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I am not going to review each product separately as this review pretty much sums up my exdperience with all 4 products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Gratiae Lifting Facial Serum now for one full year!  </li>
            <li>I love this product, the moisterizer, scrub, wipe off make-up , all over cream, astringent and last but not least the mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing that prevents wrinkles is very moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li>However results are really what matters and after using this product for about 2-3 weeks now I have not been blown away.  </li>
            <li>I just paid too much for them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Everyday is use this regimen:  clean your skin with a good facial cleanser;put on Lifting Serum; put on facial primer; put on moisturizer; put on sun screen.  </li>
            <li>Oddly I use most of the oils alone that they list</li>
            <li>I see less lines and more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>This has become one of those &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; products for me.  </li>
            <li>but I feel a new softness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>just cheap imitation of something.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>Easily fixed.</li>
            <li>First it takes a long time to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but I put 4 dabs total on my face (2 cheeks, forehead and chin)</li>
            <li>I can get darned near a year out of them because you use just a bead of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular product, the \\&quot;lifting facial serum\\&quot; leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I tried this facial serum and have been pleasantly surprised at how wonderfully soft my face feels.  </li>
            <li>Did not do what was expected...goes on very oily and  absolutely no difference on my face or neck..</li>
            <li>my wife gets lots of compliments on her skin and using Gratiae is her  own little secret.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> my wife gets lots of compliments on her skin and using Gratiae is her  own little secret.</li>
            <li> If you are experiencing extra dry skin earlier in your age - use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then put two drops of the facial serum on the back of my other hand, dot it around my face and rub it in, and then rub the excess into the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I truly like all of them and find that they last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> As an older person, there are not many products that help with aging.  </li>
            <li> It really looks expensive and high end.  </li>
            <li> The product had a strange oily consistancy that took effort to wash off of my hands.</li>
            <li> but it leaked in shipping and only half of the serum was left.</li>
            <li> It is a really strange feeling on the skin, like there is a film on your skin, but I still have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I am going to try to the other face cream from this line next.</li>
            <li> I use just a drop of the eye serum, which I put on the back of my hand, and then pat around my eyes with the other hand.  </li>
            <li> This may not be for everyday use, or maybe only evening use?</li>
            <li> I will have to find another place to order that I hope will rap and ship carefully.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I seek out organic skin care due to dry-acne-sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> For skin that has changed due to life style, age, or weather, this maybe for you...</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the prices and purchased the Ultrox expression anti wrinkle serum and cream as well as the facial lifting serum and cream thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try to see this through and use bottle till finished, but I expect this will take a loooong time, as a little goes a very long</li>
            <li> So far not impressed with the product for my type of skin, others may get different results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a weird feeling on your skin and doesn&#x27;t really help with dryness.</li>
            <li> and it takes at least 1 minute of constant massaging to achieve absorbtion.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seem any changes to my face, and I purchased other Dead Sea products, but haven&#x27;t see the change yet.</li>
            <li> I found and bought it for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Then after letting each segment dry a bit, you are now ready to put on some makeup base and loose powder to set it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with gratieas toner and aqua glycolic wash (also on amazon) for a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> When I apply this serum to my face it looks a little shinny, but it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Product looks like plain mineral oil, has no creamy consistency to it, something you would expect from this type of product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to expensive to pay for something and only get half of the product.</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried a different serum that was very expensive; when I completed it, I decided to give the Gratiae facial serum a try.....</li>
            <li> I actually had a random lady at the store</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has solved some small mole problems after a years use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be afraid of this product if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is literally unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> It was very expensive so decided to look for it online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad stuff and messed up my skin</li>
            <li> So disappointed in the way it was shipped leaked all over everything.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a coworker who had paid an outrageous price at a kiosk then heard about Amazon prices.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I originally bought this serum for a very high price in Las Vegas and was so thrilled to learn I could order it from Amazon.  there is nothing like it!  it is smooth and silky and really has helped my complexion a great deal.  This has become one of those &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; products for me.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I seek out organic skin care due to dry-acne-sensetive skin. Add all that to being 34, living in a metro city and being a smoker...bad news. Well This is the real deal! I was stunned I actually noticed \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; after 2 uses, and I am a skeptic. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun and I think (fingers crossed) I found magic. Oddly I use most of the oils alone that they list and I&#x27;ve never had such great results. I&#x27;ve been using this with gratieas toner and aqua glycolic wash (also on amazon) for a little over 2 weeks and the results are wonderful. I actually had a random lady at the store tell me my skin is fabulous and my friend told me I&#x27;m glowing. Hooked and look forward to getting more from this brand! Oh...and it smells great too! Bonus.</li>
            <li> It leaves a weird feeling on your skin and doesn&#x27;t really help with dryness. This may not be for everyday use, or maybe only evening use? It is a really strange feeling on the skin, like there is a film on your skin, but I still have dry patches. I am going to try to the other face cream from this line next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and I just love how it makes my skin feel and look. Very bright and alive....</li>
            <li> This stuff is junk. I was given a tiny sample and thought it was interesting. It&#x27;s really bad stuff and messed up my skin</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I love the way that it makes my face feel. I would recommend this product to anyone.it was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Product looks like plain mineral oil, has no creamy consistency to it, something you would expect from this type of product. I did not like it and I think it&#x27;s either counterfeit or product itself just cheap imitation of something.&lt;br /&gt;will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had bought this cream before, but paid a fortune.  Bought it again with Amazon for a great price.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Gratiae for 3 years and love this serum! I get compliments on my skin all the time and I know it is from using this product. I use it morning and night. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products! I see less lines and more even skin tone. I do notice that it can cause my makeup to not be smooth unless used with an additional day moisturizer. Easily fixed.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time i have purchased this product from amazon. I love it and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gratiae Lifting Facial Serum now for one full year!  I love it - it works!  It helps to lift my under chin area/neck area; and it firms up my facial area.  I also use it on my decollete area.  I will always use this serum.  It helps to nourish your skin cells and prepares it for your moisturizer and for your facial primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone 45 years of age on up. If you are experiencing extra dry skin earlier in your age - use this.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that prevents wrinkles is very moisturized skin.  Everyday is use this regimen:  clean your skin with a good facial cleanser;put on Lifting Serum; put on facial primer; put on moisturizer; put on sun screen.  Then after letting each segment dry a bit, you are now ready to put on some makeup base and loose powder to set it.</li>
            <li> When I apply this serum to my face it looks a little shinny, but it is not greasy. The smell is good.  So far not impressed with the product for my type of skin, others may get different results.  Haven&#x27;t seem any changes to my face, and I purchased other Dead Sea products, but haven&#x27;t see the change yet. I will update my review if I see any good changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even seen this brand before looking on Amazon.  It was so inexpensive &amp; I liked the produce discription plus the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals so I&#x27;d thought what the heck.  I use lots of department store products in various price ranges.  I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 or 5 days but I feel a new softness in my skin.  I love the way it goes on &amp; it&#x27;s mild fragrance (not a fragrance person).  I can actually feel a bit of firming tightness to my skin after applying.  I am over 60 by the way if that helps.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this was a reorder....and we included a couple for gifts... my wife gets lots of compliments on her skin and using Gratiae is her  own little secret.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly,  and  feels wonderful on the skin, is non irritating, and  the bottle lasted me a whole year.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and I look 35. I have used everything under the sun on my skin. I discovered this line a year ago and I will never go back. They are hands down the best products I have ever used. My skin is literally unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> When I recieved my shipment of Gratiae face lifting serum there was more product in the box than in the bottle.  The product had a strange oily consistancy that took effort to wash off of my hands. Dont know if this is the actual product or some knockoff but i returned it.</li>
            <li> As an older person, there are not many products that help with aging.  This is an exception.  My skin has not felt so enriched. Listen, as we get older are skin gets drier &amp; most products aim at 18 to 28 years market.  For skin that has changed due to life style, age, or weather, this maybe for you...</li>
            <li> I love Gratiae products ~ they really deliver results!  I love the way me skin feels and looks revitalized ~ perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence with this one.  If it were up to the packaging I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  It really looks expensive and high end.  However results are really what matters and after using this product for about 2-3 weeks now I have not been blown away.  First it takes a long time to absorb into the skin.  Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but I put 4 dabs total on my face (2 cheeks, forehead and chin) and it takes at least 1 minute of constant massaging to achieve absorbtion.  My skin feels velvety smooth after I&#x27;m finished, but that&#x27;s about all.  I&#x27;m yet to see any \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; results.  It is supposed to be a \\&quot;lifting serum\\&quot; after all, right?  I am going to try to see this through and use bottle till finished, but I expect this will take a loooong time, as a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the lifting moisutre cream with volcanic stone, the replenishing eye cream and relenishing eye serum.  I am not going to review each product separately as this review pretty much sums up my exdperience with all 4 products.  The only thing I would add with the eye cream is that it makes my eyes water and my vision blurry if I get it too close to my eye lids.  So if you have sensitive eyes, be careful when applying this cream.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of its quality.  I am having wonderfull changes in my skin since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Did not do what was expected...goes on very oily and  absolutely no difference on my face or neck.. Nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product that leaves your skin looking fabulous &amp; feeling soft &amp; velvety while diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a coworker who had paid an outrageous price at a kiosk then heard about Amazon prices.  I tried this facial serum and have been pleasantly surprised at how wonderfully soft my face feels.  In the past, I tried a different serum that was very expensive; when I completed it, I decided to give the Gratiae facial serum a try.....am I glad that I did.  I just ordered the eye serum and look forward to seeing the results!</li>
            <li> You only need to use 2 drops of serum on your face. This product goes along way. Hope Gratiae is always available at this price. It also does wonders for your neck area.&lt;br /&gt;It has solved some small mole problems after a years use. No kidding !  I love this product, the moisterizer, scrub, wipe off make-up , all over cream, astringent and last but not least the mask. When using the mask you have to keep rubbing it into your skin until it becomes creamy. You will love the results if you use this line of skin care as directed daily.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  don&#x27;t be afraid of this product if you have sensitive skin, I do and it work wonderful.  Love everything about it</li>
            <li> After having 1/2 of my face \\&quot;lotioned\\&quot; at the Gratiae salon in the Paris casino in Las Vegas, I was greatly impressed by the immediate results.  I was not pleased with the prices and purchased the Ultrox expression anti wrinkle serum and cream as well as the facial lifting serum and cream thru Amazon.  After one month of usage, instead of improvement I can see regression.  These products will be going into the trash and I&#x27;m going back to my favorite over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product at the mall in Las Vegas. I tried it and loved it.  It was very expensive so decided to look for it online. I found and bought it for half the cost. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone complains about the price I just got mine at a kios and only paid 30 for the scrub it was suppose to be 180. So looks like I got a great deal. Haven&#x27;t used the product yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gonna be wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product but it leaked in shipping and only half of the serum was left. So disappointed in the way it was shipped leaked all over everything. I will have to find another place to order that I hope will rap and ship carefully. It&#x27;s to expensive to pay for something and only get half of the product.</li>
            <li> I never used any lotion or product on my skin and washed my face with soap only.  Then I got waylaid at a mall (as is the case with most everyone here), and discovered these products.  I wound up spending close to $1000!  I&#x27;m still ashamed of that, but consider it a lesson well-learned.  I say this because I love the products.  I just paid too much for them.  This particular product, the \\&quot;lifting facial serum\\&quot; leaves my skin soft and supple.  Yes, it feels oily when it goes on, but my skin drinks it up very quickly.  Within 10 minutes, it has all soaked in.  I use this product and the \\&quot;Replenishing eye serum\\&quot;, as well as the \\&quot;purifying facial cleanser\\&quot;.  I truly like all of them and find that they last me a very long time.  I can get darned near a year out of them because you use just a bead of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s the mistake some folks are making.  I use just a drop of the eye serum, which I put on the back of my hand, and then pat around my eyes with the other hand.  Whatever remains on my hand, I rub in (my hands have become much softer, too!).  I then put two drops of the facial serum on the back of my other hand, dot it around my face and rub it in, and then rub the excess into the back of my hand.  I use the facial cleanser every 2 to 3 days.  Again, you only need about a nickle-sized dollop and this does not just my face, but my neck and decolletage.  Don&#x27;t use too much.  Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, from using no product at all on my skin, I have a regular regimen now with these products and I am routinely mistaken for being much younger than I actually am.  Wish I&#x27;d taken better care of my skin all along!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and it is my favorite of all the skin products I use.  It makes your skin feel so luxuriant.</li>
