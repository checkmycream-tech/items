            <li>She was very happy to find it on line at amazon.</li>
            <li>The protection is superb, and the product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as do some antiperspirants.    </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>great buy!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it has no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is a great bonus!!  </li>
            <li>awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The quantity was great for the price</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND STILL IS THE BEST FOR MY SKIN TYPE AND BODY PHYSIOLOGY.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised and at a fair price.</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to find this online because stores no longer carry the unscented Power Gel.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This is great cruelty free anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>It is effective, but does not cause stinging.</li>
            <li>Depending on which has the best price at the time, I&#x27;ll either buy this pack of deodorant, or the one for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;for Women&amp;#34; on it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better then</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and she could no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li>When I could no longer use regular Mitchums (which I chose many years ago as the antiperspirant that works best for me)</li>
            <li>I love that this has no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li>You can confidently order from this listing.</li>
            <li>I like being able to order online, and it always comes promptly</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had reactions to most any deodorant except this one.</li>
            <li>This time I ordered &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34; and it is just that, Fragrance Free.  </li>
            <li>My doctor had recommended anything &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; and after trying this in the store, I&#x27;ve been buying on amazon in bulk (x6) since.</li>
            <li>Mitchum&#x27;s Antiperspirant for Sensitive Skin is, overall, an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Like being able to find it for a reasonable price and</li>
            <li>It has a very plesent and light sent and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Love buying more than one due to better pricing.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who has fragrance allergies.</li>
            <li>I have previously been happy with Mitchum products</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and many items cause issues fo her.</li>
            <li>If Mitchum&#x27;s does this, it will position itself as one of the most complete antiperspirants on the market!</li>
            <li>I use this produce because it is fragrance free and really works on controlling perspiration and odor.  </li>
            <li>My skin has become sensitive to most deoderants, but this product from Mitchum does not irritate my underarm skin.</li>
            <li>so I figured that its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>have it delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about this brand is, even though it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply it more than once a day to keep odor under control.  </li>
            <li>This gel is easy to apply and since it&#x27;s clear, leaves no marks.  </li>
            <li>Amazon really needs to update the picture on this item so no one else gets a surprise!</li>
            <li>Strong enough for man...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in the grocery stores around here, so I&#x27;m delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After some research I&#x27;ve settled on Almay instead, which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>thanks Oprah.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because in a household full of girls, this is something that I cannot afford to run out of and \\&quot;teen spirit\\&quot; just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>so I really love the save and subscribe program by Amazon even though I have been having issues with project availability (usually available though per amazon with different sellers if not available on save and subscribe).</li>
            <li>Works better than any other deodorant I have tried!</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>SO I normally don&#x27;t care about Oprah&#x27;s list or whatever she&#x27;s selling</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and smelling sweet...</li>
            <li>It works just as well, but I got a bit of a rash when first using it, which was the main reason I ordered it, because this was the only anti perspirant I had found that didnt give me a rash.</li>
            <li>Many deodorants claiming to be for sensitive skin are in fact heavily perfumed, and can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>This product advertises as scent free but it had a very strong scent that makes it  unpleasant and unusable.  </li>
            <li>the trend among some companies is to make a gel stick-type of antiperspirant which goes on completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, as in 99% of beauty products give me a rash/hives/blisters.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item based on the picture, which was the old style deodorant that mitchum made, but that is not what they send you.</li>
            <li>In the past I have tried Mitchum Unscented and it had a strong perfume scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product but it can be very difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>They send the new style power gel which isnt the same formulation.</li>
            <li>It also works very well at keeping me dry.</li>
            <li>I tried the sensitive version and found that it works equally well without irritation.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, this is the only anti-deodorant that does not cause a rash.</li>
            <li>Seriously though there really is no difference ingredient wise between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s versions of this except the women&#x27;s has aloe and some other skin soothing ingredients.  </li>

            <li> I was always a SECRET girl, but never liked how it left me smelling at the end of the day as a flowery version of my B.O. not so fun.</li>
            <li> Since these all have no fragrance, there&#x27;s really no change-</li>
            <li> I typically would spend $15-18 for this, but for whatever reason the few sellers on Amazon spiked the price upwards of $27.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this deodorant&lt;br /&gt;is difficult to find in a local store.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area</li>
            <li> I feel for m, but I think it was a mere shipping error.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they discontinued the men&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li> so I do not know if I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t expensive!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND STILL IS THE BEST FOR MY SKIN TYPE AND BODY PHYSIOLOGY.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, as in 99% of beauty products give me a rash/hives/blisters.  I&#x27;ve always used Mitchum deodorant and was stoked to find the sensitive-skin fragrance-free gel version.  Do NOT be tricked into buying Mitchum&#x27;s \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; deodorant, because it is SCENTED!  (It smells like baby powder, and should be labelled as such.)  If your deodorant leaves you itching or irritated, try this product.  I&#x27;m now purchasing it on Amazon in 6-packs because I can&#x27;t count on drugstores stocking it (they stock \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on the picture, which was the old style deodorant that mitchum made, but that is not what they send you. They send the new style power gel which isnt the same formulation. It works just as well, but I got a bit of a rash when first using it, which was the main reason I ordered it, because this was the only anti perspirant I had found that didnt give me a rash. Amazon really needs to update the picture on this item so no one else gets a surprise!</li>
            <li> I love this product...It has a very plesent and light sent and goes on easily.  It keeps me dry and smelling sweet...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s too bad they discontinued the men&#x27;s version.  They need to bring it back.  But the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s appear to be basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> This deoderant works as promised.  It keeps you dry and odor free.  It&#x27;s much better then another brand I was using.  The only downside is that its a bit wet when applying.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and she could no longer find it in stores. She was very happy to find it on line at amazon. We got our order in a timely manner and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer use regular Mitchums (which I chose many years ago as the antiperspirant that works best for me) I tried the sensitive version and found that it works equally well without irritation.</li>
            <li> I found this product once in a CVS or similar store and they no longer carry it. Thank god that Amazon carries it I buy it once a year and it isn&#x27;t expensive!! Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only unscented deodorant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. It&#x27;s hard to find at retail consistently so I get it from here now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because in a household full of girls, this is something that I cannot afford to run out of and \\&quot;teen spirit\\&quot; just don&#x27;t cut it. The quantity was great for the price and I share with my sister.</li>
            <li> Mitchum&#x27;s Antiperspirant for Sensitive Skin is, overall, an excellent product.  The protection is superb, and the product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as do some antiperspirants.    The only suggestion I would make involves a bit of product development:  the trend among some companies is to make a gel stick-type of antiperspirant which goes on completely clear.  If Mitchum&#x27;s does this, it will position itself as one of the most complete antiperspirants on the market!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hard to find in my area so I really love the save and subscribe program by Amazon even though I have been having issues with project availability (usually available though per amazon with different sellers if not available on save and subscribe). Love buying more than one due to better pricing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and lasts a long time (you could probably go two days without applying if you were camping or something). I love that this has no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and many items cause issues fo her. This works for her and no breakouts at all. Her only issue is tha this goes on sticky and stays that way longer than she would like.​</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried Mitchum Unscented and it had a strong perfume scent.  This time I ordered &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34; and it is just that, Fragrance Free.  I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who has fragrance allergies.</li>
            <li> Many deodorants claiming to be for sensitive skin are in fact heavily perfumed, and can cause irritation. This is one of the only deodorants I have found that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash and has no scent. It also works very well at keeping me dry. It&#x27;s hard to find in the grocery stores around here, so I&#x27;m delighted to find it on Amazon. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it can be very difficult to find in stores.  Like being able to find it for a reasonable price and have it delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this listing about 1/2 dozen times since m&#x27;s review and have ALWAYS received the product in the photo &amp; description. This is the only product that works for me as well. That rash can be maddening! I feel for m, but I think it was a mere shipping error. You can confidently order from this listing. 😊</li>
            <li> this is the only type of deo i use and can&#x27;t get it at this price around here.  great buy!</li>
            <li> Depending on which has the best price at the time, I&#x27;ll either buy this pack of deodorant, or the one for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;for Women&amp;#34; on it.  Both seem about the same to me.  One thing I really like about this brand is, even though it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply it more than once a day to keep odor under control.  Other brands formulated for sensitive skin seem to lose their effectiveness after several hours (at least in my case).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to find this online because stores no longer carry the unscented Power Gel. Just as advertised and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I cannot use scented products because of my husbands allergies and health problems.  For some reason, this deodorant&lt;br /&gt;is difficult to find in a local store.  They simply do not stock it.  I like being able to order online, and it always comes promptly and I have on hand when I need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this antiperspirant and deodorant for over 30 years, and this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon.  I use this produce because it is fragrance free and really works on controlling perspiration and odor.  Great price, fast delivery.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> My skin has become sensitive to most deoderants, but this product from Mitchum does not irritate my underarm skin. It is effective, but does not cause stinging.</li>
            <li> This product advertises as scent free but it had a very strong scent that makes it  unpleasant and unusable.  I have previously been happy with Mitchum products so I do not know if I got a bad batch but since I have to throw them all away I will buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works for me! I have sensitive skin, this is the only anti-deodorant that does not cause a rash.</li>
            <li> Strong enough for man... so that&#x27;s why I (a man) use it. Seriously though there really is no difference ingredient wise between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s versions of this except the women&#x27;s has aloe and some other skin soothing ingredients.  This is great cruelty free anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to traditional antiperspirants that can get white marks on your clothes.  This gel is easy to apply and since it&#x27;s clear, leaves no marks.  It keeps me dry and odor free.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it feels sticky for a couple of minutes until it dries.  But the pros outweight the cons.  I will keep using this product.  And the fact that it has no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is a great bonus!!  Recommend.</li>
            <li> For a couple years I&#x27;ve used this product. I&#x27;ve had reactions to most any deodorant except this one. My doctor had recommended anything &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; and after trying this in the store, I&#x27;ve been buying on amazon in bulk (x6) since. I typically would spend $15-18 for this, but for whatever reason the few sellers on Amazon spiked the price upwards of $27. After some research I&#x27;ve settled on Almay instead, which is much cheaper. Since these all have no fragrance, there&#x27;s really no change- though I do think Almay dries quicker and can be applied easier. I won&#x27;t be going back to Mitchum.</li>
            <li> SO I normally don&#x27;t care about Oprah&#x27;s list or whatever she&#x27;s selling but I once overheard her mention this brand in passing as her go to deodorant. That lady must sweat buckets under her lights so I figured that its worth a shot. Totally is. I was always a SECRET girl, but never liked how it left me smelling at the end of the day as a flowery version of my B.O. not so fun. This deodorant leaves you NOT smelling like anything. awesome. thanks Oprah.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other deodorant I have tried! Has no smell so it doesn&#x27;t cover but prevents smell! In my opinion!</li>
