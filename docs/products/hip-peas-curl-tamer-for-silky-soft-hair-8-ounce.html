            <li>Great for my daughters fine curly hair...</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it really gives a great look to the curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult and have no kids, but I figured with the price and excellent reviews why should it matter that the product was intended for kids?</li>
            <li>When running the product through her hair for the first time, I already knew that it was going to work great.  </li>
            <li>She has curls, and most of her hair always goes against Gravity Laws.</li>
            <li>Basically, her hair goes up like an over the top</li>
            <li>It does, for the most part.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, she looks a bit like Einstein, as she rubs her head in the car seat and tugs on her hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>What more could a curly girl want?</li>
            <li>I love the way this controls my curls and helps wave the gray.</li>
            <li>I read many rave reviews on this product and decided to try it on my curly haired toddler.</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair look cute at all.</li>
            <li>But I love it for my daughter, and it deserves all 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I cant stand the crunch from most products.</li>
            <li>Perhaps better for people with lots of hair.</li>
            <li>I would love to try some more of</li>
            <li>Love this curl</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t rationalize spending 11-12$ on a baby hair product but decided just to give it a shot after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It seems to help her hair from becoming too tangled and I love that it doesn&#x27;t give her hair a crunchy feeling (like gel products).</li>
            <li>and I have had pretty good results with both of their hair types.</li>
            <li>but I noticed it works best in wet hair</li>
            <li>Glad to be putting something chemical free though.</li>
            <li>Very nice curl definition on my 2 year old.  </li>
            <li>We already had fallen in love with Hip Peas Styling Balm and Hip Peas Detangler, so we were excited when the Curl Tamer was introduced to the line.  </li>
            <li>Makes everyone comment on how sweet my daughter&#x27;s curls are!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much other than work as a great detangler!</li>
            <li>Some parts of her hair does not give in so easily....  </li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair with a fine texture (she&#x27;s 21 months, so it&#x27;s baby hair).</li>
            <li>He still has fine, baby hair</li>
            <li>I use both this product and original sprout (not together) and I like original sprout alot better.</li>
            <li>My toddler has super curly fine hair that gets incredibly frizzy when she sleeps or if it is brushed.</li>
            <li>The tube is really large and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>It would remove all her little knots (which happens quite often w/curly hair) perfectly without any tugging or tears.</li>
            <li>my baby boys curls frizz free</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be heavy handed, and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>It keep the frizz in check, was soft to the touch and smelled so good.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, we were not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks fresh!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>I would just prefer something more fruity or ocean smelling over this particular smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome that you can use it on wet or dry hair--I haven&#x27;t found another product for dry hair--and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a more appropriate scent for a child than the perfumed stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and course and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li>admit to using it on my own hair (coarse, wavy, frizzy hair)</li>
            <li>I love this product for my curly-haired 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>I completely agree with the review written by curl magic.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, this product is light and seems very fitting for little ones&#x27; curliness.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with soft, curly hair :)!</li>
            <li>The fragrance (although not bad) was so strong that I had to immediately wash my hands after applying it - a pain during a busy morning routine.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s got fine blonde hair, the type that tangles easily and is not that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair looking gorgeous without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>The curl cream is made from natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals and leaves my hair looking and feeling amazing every time.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of chemical-y and gross right from the bottle, but after it&#x27;s dry and on his hair it smells like a grape smartie, which is actually quite nice!</li>
            <li>and with a little water and a comb makes it beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>She is also able to where her hair down now as it looks perfectly smooth, and not at all kinky.  </li>
            <li>The cream leaves her curls defined but not crunchy, soft but not droopy, and clean not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have tried countless products trying to get the kind of curl results we hope for--defined instead of frizzy, while also soft instead of \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Great product to tame young curls.</li>
            <li>Easy to wet her curls for a quick restyle after a car seat smashing when on the go</li>
            <li>Even with just a little product, it nicely covered ALL of her hair.  </li>
            <li>love the light texture and delicate scent for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the grape smell</li>
            <li>It causes her ringlets to really spring up</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to style her hair since I found this product.</li>
            <li>I may be using too much, or maybe it needs to be like that to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter inherited this, but being only two, her texture was vastly different than my own.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or hard like other curl creams sometimes do.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other &#x27;designer&#x27; hair products, and Hip Peas Curl Tamer beats them all.  </li>
            <li>My five year old girl&#x27;s fine, curly hair needs sprayed with water and scrunched to bring out her big, spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>so most products just weigh it down.</li>
            <li>If your toddler has curly messy hair that tangles easy, you MUST buy this!</li>
            <li>hope amazon keeps it online as I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live!</li>
            <li>My daughters hair was softer, more defined and way less frizzy then before.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, the bottle size is generous and a little bit of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My child has curly hair that can look messy pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I purchased this curl cream a couple of weeks ago after moving to Texas to help deal with the effects of the high heat and humidity on my hair.</li>
            <li>It works better, smells great, and is less expensive.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell but it gets a little greasy on the baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural!!</li>
            <li>first thing is that I hoped this product will actually help the whole gravity thing.....</li>
            <li>My daughter has very thin curly hair and this product works great on her.</li>
            <li>It works fine although it does weigh down hair</li>
            <li>It makes her curls very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Our daily routine consists of wetting hair first, applying her hip peas curl tamer and then brushing.</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have thick hair yet and this did a great job of not weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My daughter (9 months old) was born with a wig, basically.</li>
            <li>At least now most of the hair is in one direction, rather than a &amp;#34;I just woke up from a 36 hour nap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It has a creamy consistency that leaves us with perfectly soft, defined curls.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her curls soft and bouncy but eliminates some frizz and craziness.</li>
            <li>This product boosts her curls, but keeps a soft and separated look.</li>
            <li>I use this for my curly haired 2-year old.</li>
            <li>For my 20 months old, it just makes her hair look like its greasy and unmanaged.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman with tons of curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It also defines my curls and leaves my hair completely manageable and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>The only reasons I gave it four stars out of five is: If you use to much of this you can get a bit of white build up.</li>
            <li>I tried a few other popular brands before this one, and I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long!</li>
            <li>Not a knock on its effectiveness at all - nothing works on my hair, and thus is formulated for kids&#x27; hair which is generally finer and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Ms Jessi&#x27;s and a whole slew of other products to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I spent over $75 trying to find something that would tame her luscious locks, but leave her baby fine hair not looking like a grease mat on her head.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how big the bottle actually is.</li>
            <li>I prefer to spray his hair with a little water first then use the product.</li>
            <li>Really does tame wild &amp; unruly curls.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, even using just a small amount weighed down her hair so much that her curls started to straighten - her hair turned more wavy, rather than full of bouncy curls.  </li>

            <li> Great product to tame young curls.</li>
            <li> Easy to wet her curls for a quick restyle after a car seat smashing when on the go</li>
            <li> Even with just a little product, it nicely covered ALL of her hair.  </li>
            <li> love the light texture and delicate scent for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the grape smell</li>
            <li> It causes her ringlets to really spring up</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to style her hair since I found this product.</li>
            <li> I may be using too much, or maybe it needs to be like that to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter inherited this, but being only two, her texture was vastly different than my own.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or hard like other curl creams sometimes do.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other &#x27;designer&#x27; hair products, and Hip Peas Curl Tamer beats them all.  </li>
            <li> My five year old girl&#x27;s fine, curly hair needs sprayed with water and scrunched to bring out her big, spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> so most products just weigh it down.</li>
            <li> If your toddler has curly messy hair that tangles easy, you MUST buy this!</li>
            <li> hope amazon keeps it online as I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair was softer, more defined and way less frizzy then before.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, the bottle size is generous and a little bit of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My child has curly hair that can look messy pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curl cream a couple of weeks ago after moving to Texas to help deal with the effects of the high heat and humidity on my hair.</li>
            <li> It works better, smells great, and is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell but it gets a little greasy on the baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural!!</li>
            <li> first thing is that I hoped this product will actually help the whole gravity thing.....</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin curly hair and this product works great on her.</li>
            <li> It works fine although it does weigh down hair</li>
            <li> It makes her curls very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Our daily routine consists of wetting hair first, applying her hip peas curl tamer and then brushing.</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty big</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have thick hair yet and this did a great job of not weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My daughter (9 months old) was born with a wig, basically.</li>
            <li> At least now most of the hair is in one direction, rather than a &amp;#34;I just woke up from a 36 hour nap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It has a creamy consistency that leaves us with perfectly soft, defined curls.  </li>
            <li> It keeps her curls soft and bouncy but eliminates some frizz and craziness.</li>
            <li> This product boosts her curls, but keeps a soft and separated look.</li>
            <li> I use this for my curly haired 2-year old.</li>
            <li> For my 20 months old, it just makes her hair look like its greasy and unmanaged.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman with tons of curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It also defines my curls and leaves my hair completely manageable and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li> The only reasons I gave it four stars out of five is: If you use to much of this you can get a bit of white build up.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other popular brands before this one, and I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long!</li>
            <li> Not a knock on its effectiveness at all - nothing works on my hair, and thus is formulated for kids&#x27; hair which is generally finer and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Ms Jessi&#x27;s and a whole slew of other products to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $75 trying to find something that would tame her luscious locks, but leave her baby fine hair not looking like a grease mat on her head.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how big the bottle actually is.</li>
            <li> I prefer to spray his hair with a little water first then use the product.</li>
            <li> Really does tame wild &amp; unruly curls.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even using just a small amount weighed down her hair so much that her curls started to straighten - her hair turned more wavy, rather than full of bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Works well with spirally curls, but you need to later it on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> This will last her a really long time.</li>
            <li> so it will def last a long time.</li>
            <li> A dab of this cream with a little hand sculpting (and sometimes a comb beforehand), and she has lively curls.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to comb through her hair in the morning, no matter how scary it looks.  </li>
            <li> Can only use it when wet though.</li>
            <li> Battles the frizz all day long - even after a nap.</li>
            <li> it does leave her hair a little crunchy if I use too much, just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of products throughout the years to tame the frizz and leave my hair feeling soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly and kinky red hair.  </li>
            <li> It says you can use in dry hair</li>
            <li> Might work well as a hair moisturizer in the dry winter months or for girls with thicker, fuller, stronger curls.</li>
            <li> If I put it on dry, the curls do not get curlier,</li>
            <li> And I use so little of it that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair yet but my advice is don&#x27;t put this on dry hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it said it could be used on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I disagree with this statement because when you use it dry it does not really help with holding curls....</li>
            <li> I have used it on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It says you can use it on dry or wet hair, but with her, it has to be wet.</li>
            <li> so you really only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not surprising, when the second ingredient is actually alcohol...</li>
            <li> and it is not sticky like gel or hairspray or even other baby products out there</li>
            <li> Am eager to try other Hip Peas products.</li>
            <li> (One has ringlets like a number 2 pencil the other has dime sz curls)</li>
            <li> All the other products helped separate and boost my daughters curls, but gave it a wet look and was a little scrunchy.</li>
            <li> With any other product they are limp and flat in a few hours.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly thin hair and this product really does tame it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s biracial with curly thick hair and this just seemed like I was only adding water to his hair</li>
            <li> However, the texture of my hair is not coarse or thick.  </li>
            <li> it just ways down my child&#x27;s hair and leaves it rather unattractive.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Her curls looked shiny &amp; bouncy without being weight down or greasy.</li>
            <li> just less frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight grease on my fingers as I comb it in the morning, but it is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Do I tried a little bit</li>
            <li> This is working wonders on my curly haired little girl.  </li>
            <li> This helps keep his hair tame and every time we use it, I get compliments on his hair.</li>
            <li> First, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> I just go this in the mail today and my daughters hair was crazy as normal.</li>
            <li> Took out the frizz and added a little volume too!</li>
            <li> I usually spray her hair with a water bottle and then put some on, comb and scrunch.</li>
            <li> My almost 2 year old daughter has curly, crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I suspect it would also work well on finer hair types as the product isn&#x27;t very thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair with curls/waves.</li>
            <li> First of all, my daughter&#x27;s curls are outrageous.  </li>
            <li> NOT GREAT.</li>
            <li> Her hair has always been difficult as it is curly and thin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they always run out of it.  </li>
            <li> so unfortunately I&#x27;ve been stuck using it.</li>
            <li> We bought this product because she hates being sprayed with the cold water from the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> but it is actually very faint once it dries.</li>
            <li> Leave in conditioners helped, but it was still a painful morning ritual to get it somewhat presentable, and she could never just wear her hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I hated this product.</li>
            <li> It made my toddler&#x27;s hair sticky and knotty and smelled terrible.</li>

            <li> My daughter (9 months old) was born with a wig, basically. She has curls, and most of her hair always goes against Gravity Laws. Basically, her hair goes up like an over the top Einstein caricature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAYS...... I tried hair clips, bands, you name it. The hair just takes over, emerges the object inside until it surrenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing is that I hoped this product will actually help the whole gravity thing..... It does, for the most part. Some parts of her hair does not give in so easily....  But it&#x27;s ok. At least now most of the hair is in one direction, rather than a &amp;#34;I just woke up from a 36 hour nap&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One BIG thing is the smell..... NOT GREAT. &amp; it does not fade after X amount of time either. The best way I can describe the smell as is like an tangy orange liquor (or maybe apple?). Not surprising, when the second ingredient is actually alcohol...</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair with a fine texture (she&#x27;s 21 months, so it&#x27;s baby hair). Most of the time, she looks a bit like Einstein, as she rubs her head in the car seat and tugs on her hair. A dab of this cream with a little hand sculpting (and sometimes a comb beforehand), and she has lively curls. The cream leaves her curls defined but not crunchy, soft but not droopy, and clean not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit to using it on my own hair (coarse, wavy, frizzy hair) and it&#x27;s moderately successful at defining and reducing frizz. Not a knock on its effectiveness at all - nothing works on my hair, and thus is formulated for kids&#x27; hair which is generally finer and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light texture and delicate scent for my daughter.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair yet but my advice is don&#x27;t put this on dry hair</li>
            <li> I love this product It says you can use in dry hair but I noticed it works best in wet hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it said it could be used on wet or dry hair.  I disagree with this statement because when you use it dry it does not really help with holding curls....it just ways down my child&#x27;s hair and leaves it rather unattractive.  I would not purchase this product again...still looking of the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, and you had to use a ton of product per application.</li>
            <li> I liked it it keeps my baby boys curls frizz free and it is not sticky like gel or hairspray or even other baby products out there the only thing I would change is the smell it&#x27;s not a bad smell I would just prefer something more fruity or ocean smelling over this particular smell lol</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I hated this product. It made my toddler&#x27;s hair sticky and knotty and smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> My child has curly hair that can look messy pretty easily. This helps keep his hair tame and every time we use it, I get compliments on his hair. I prefer to spray his hair with a little water first then use the product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  First of all, my daughter&#x27;s curls are outrageous.  I haven&#x27;t found ANYTHING that works.  Not like Hip Peas.  When running the product through her hair for the first time, I already knew that it was going to work great.  You can feel it in the texture of the product.  Even with just a little product, it nicely covered ALL of her hair.  I absolutely love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> My five year old girl&#x27;s fine, curly hair needs sprayed with water and scrunched to bring out her big, spiral curls.  We bought this product because she hates being sprayed with the cold water from the spray bottle.  Unfortunately, even using just a small amount weighed down her hair so much that her curls started to straighten - her hair turned more wavy, rather than full of bouncy curls.  The fragrance (although not bad) was so strong that I had to immediately wash my hands after applying it - a pain during a busy morning routine.  Might work well as a hair moisturizer in the dry winter months or for girls with thicker, fuller, stronger curls.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Very nice curl definition on my 2 year old.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product! My toddler has super curly fine hair that gets incredibly frizzy when she sleeps or if it is brushed. This is the product I was looking for! At first I couldn&#x27;t rationalize spending 11-12$ on a baby hair product but decided just to give it a shot after reading all of the good reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at how big the bottle actually is. This will last her a really long time. The perfect mix. Not crunchy yet shapes the curls! The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the grape smell but it is actually very faint once it dries.</li>
            <li> Works great in my two year olds hair, smells amazing. Not crunchy. The bottle will probably last us a year.</li>
            <li> This curl cream is amazing! I purchased this curl cream a couple of weeks ago after moving to Texas to help deal with the effects of the high heat and humidity on my hair. I&#x27;m an adult and have no kids, but I figured with the price and excellent reviews why should it matter that the product was intended for kids? The curl cream is made from natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals and leaves my hair looking and feeling amazing every time. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or hard like other curl creams sometimes do. My hair is very thick and course and it works wonderfully. I suspect it would also work well on finer hair types as the product isn&#x27;t very thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, and this product is amazing!!! Every pencil sized curl I have was defined,and shiny! The only reasons I gave it four stars out of five is: If you use to much of this you can get a bit of white build up. Don&#x27;t be heavy handed, and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I am a curly-haired mom with curly-haired kids.  We have tried countless products trying to get the kind of curl results we hope for--defined instead of frizzy, while also soft instead of \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.  We already had fallen in love with Hip Peas Styling Balm and Hip Peas Detangler, so we were excited when the Curl Tamer was introduced to the line.  Let me tell you, we were not disappointed.  It has a creamy consistency that leaves us with perfectly soft, defined curls.  I have tried many other &#x27;designer&#x27; hair products, and Hip Peas Curl Tamer beats them all.  It works better, smells great, and is less expensive.  What more could a curly girl want?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Makes everyone comment on how sweet my daughter&#x27;s curls are! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy. Easy to wet her curls for a quick restyle after a car seat smashing when on the go and it still looks fresh!</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper hair and the gray doesn&#x27;t curl well anymore . I love the way this controls my curls and helps wave the gray.</li>
            <li> I read many rave reviews on this product and decided to try it on my curly haired toddler. She&#x27;s got fine blonde hair, the type that tangles easily and is not that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, but this one is one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down or make it look greasy. It causes her ringlets to really spring up and it also helps me comb it out if it&#x27;s all tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says you can use it on dry or wet hair, but with her, it has to be wet. I usually spray her hair with a water bottle and then put some on, comb and scrunch. If I put it on dry, the curls do not get curlier, just less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on myself, I have wavy hair. It did not make my hair look cute at all. But I love it for my daughter, and it deserves all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If your toddler has curly messy hair that tangles easy, you MUST buy this! It works wonders...we were at the stage of having to cut some of our daughters hair just to get the knots out of her curls. This product is a life saver. The tube is really large and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my sons hair! He&#x27;s biracial with curly thick hair and this just seemed like I was only adding water to his hair😒</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Thought it was too sticky,  Returned</li>
            <li> Some wrote about this product being for adults too. I have thick course hair with curls/waves. I cant stand the crunch from most products. This is perfect. It keep the frizz in check, was soft to the touch and smelled so good. I may never use anythinh else again.</li>
            <li> Works well with spirally curls, but you need to later it on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my curly-haired 3 year old.  It&#x27;s awesome that you can use it on wet or dry hair--I haven&#x27;t found another product for dry hair--and it works great.  It keeps her curls soft and bouncy but eliminates some frizz and craziness. It seems to help her hair from becoming too tangled and I love that it doesn&#x27;t give her hair a crunchy feeling (like gel products).</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly thin hair and this product really does tame it. I love it and so does she!</li>
            <li> I tried a few other popular brands before this one, and I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long! Amazing product. All the other products helped separate and boost my daughters curls, but gave it a wet look and was a little scrunchy. This product boosts her curls, but keeps a soft and separated look. She doesn&#x27;t have thick hair yet and this did a great job of not weighing it down. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin curly hair and this product works great on her. It makes her curls very soft and silky. It is so much easier to style her hair since I found this product. The smell is pleasant, the bottle size is generous and a little bit of product goes a long way. Great product to tame young curls.</li>
            <li> Really does tame wild &amp; unruly curls.  Works beautifully on &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;. Am eager to try other Hip Peas products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I can not say enough about it. My almost 2 year old daughter has curly, crazy hair. This product does everything it says and it smells really good. My daughters hair was softer, more defined and way less frizzy then before. I will continue to buy this for my curly girl and recommend anyone with a curly haired child purchase this. I would give this 10 stars if i could!</li>
            <li> Great for my daughters fine curly hair...it does leave her hair a little crunchy if I use too much, just a little goes a long way. Overall all it was just what I was looking for &amp; at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I just go this in the mail today and my daughters hair was crazy as normal. Do I tried a little bit and I love it! It defined her curls. Took out the frizz and added a little volume too! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I use this for my curly haired 2-year old. He still has fine, baby hair so most products just weigh it down. This takes his morning bedhead (Einstein hair!) and with a little water and a comb makes it beautiful and soft. Plus, the curls last almost all day! With any other product they are limp and flat in a few hours. The smell is kind of chemical-y and gross right from the bottle, but after it&#x27;s dry and on his hair it smells like a grape smartie, which is actually quite nice! I love that it&#x27;s a more appropriate scent for a child than the perfumed stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more, my husband even noticed the difference in his hair!</li>
            <li> First, it smells bad. Second, it thins out her hair. Perhaps better for people with lots of hair. For my 20 months old, it just makes her hair look like its greasy and unmanaged. I use both this product and original sprout (not together) and I like original sprout alot better. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it gets a little greasy on the baby&#x27;s hair. Can only use it when wet though. Glad to be putting something chemical free though.</li>
            <li> It conditioned my 2yo&#x27;s hair perfectly. Her curls looked shiny &amp; bouncy without being weight down or greasy. Our daily routine consists of wetting hair first, applying her hip peas curl tamer and then brushing. It would remove all her little knots (which happens quite often w/curly hair) perfectly without any tugging or tears. I highly recommend this product for anyone with soft, curly hair :)!</li>
            <li> This is working wonders on my curly haired little girl.  Her hair has always been difficult as it is curly and thin.  Add the fact that she likes to rock herself to sleep at night, and it becomes this wooly mass to deal with in the morning.  Leave in conditioners helped, but it was still a painful morning ritual to get it somewhat presentable, and she could never just wear her hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was suggested to me by her kids hairstylist as she said it was the best thing for her hair type.  Unfortunately, they always run out of it.  I was glad to get it on Amazon, and the results have been great.  It is so easy to comb through her hair in the morning, no matter how scary it looks.  She is also able to where her hair down now as it looks perfectly smooth, and not at all kinky.  It does leave a slight grease on my fingers as I comb it in the morning, but it is not an issue. I may be using too much, or maybe it needs to be like that to control the frizz.  It is only after repeatedly running my hands through that I notice it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, life saver!  And I use so little of it that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My daughters both use it and I have had pretty good results with both of their hair types. (One has ringlets like a number 2 pencil the other has dime sz curls) I use it in combination with some kinky curly products (kinky curly knot today and curl custard)and it works magic!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but my daughter hates the smell of it so unfortunately I&#x27;ve been stuck using it. It works fine although it does weigh down hair so you really only need to use a little bit. The tube is pretty big so it will def last a long time. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much other than work as a great detangler!</li>
            <li> Love these hair products-it smells really great and it&#x27;s all natural!! What a bonus!! I I would love to try some more of they&#x27;re great products!!</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the review written by curl magic.  This product is fabulous!!  I am a 40 year old woman with tons of curly hair.  However, the texture of my hair is not coarse or thick.  I have tried hundreds of products throughout the years to tame the frizz and leave my hair feeling soft and touchable.  This does all that.  It also defines my curls and leaves my hair completely manageable and tangle-free.  I have used it on both wet and dry hair.  Love this curl creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope amazon keeps it online as I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly and kinky red hair.  My daughter inherited this, but being only two, her texture was vastly different than my own.  I spent over $75 trying to find something that would tame her luscious locks, but leave her baby fine hair not looking like a grease mat on her head.  I tried Ms Jessi&#x27;s and a whole slew of other products to no avail.  Luckily, this product is light and seems very fitting for little ones&#x27; curliness.  It leaves her hair looking gorgeous without weighing it down.  Battles the frizz all day long - even after a nap.</li>
            <li> If your baby has curls this product is a must have. The smell is great and it really gives a great look to the curls. Also It solved the frizz problem of my baby curls.</li>
