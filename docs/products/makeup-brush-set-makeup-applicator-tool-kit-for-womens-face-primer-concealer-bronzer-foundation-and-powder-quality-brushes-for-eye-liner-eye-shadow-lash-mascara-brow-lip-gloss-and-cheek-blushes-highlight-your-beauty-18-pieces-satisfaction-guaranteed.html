            <li>I looked around a lot for cute and good quality brushes and these are it.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly know if she gets to use all 18 of the brushes but</li>
            <li>The fluffy fan brush is so awesome as well and is perfect for applying highlight over your face, but can also be used for bronzing or sculpting.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes have their own protectors and pockets.</li>
            <li>And she liked the color.  </li>
            <li>Every kind of brush you could need (</li>

            <li>pretty, good quality, exceeded my expectations!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing and been using for more than a month now and non of the brush&#x27;s hairs have started shedding.</li>

            <li>/&gt;These are a good decent set of quality brushes at a fair price.</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes to be creative with.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this set too, so feminine.</li>
            <li>Love the color and package.</li>
            <li>I would love to recommend my friends</li>
            <li>I decided to try buying my brushes online instead and fell in love with this set.</li>
            <li>I was immediately drawn to the purple color and cute organizer case.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased  with this set of make-up</li>
            <li>The quality is better than anticipated for the price.</li>
            <li>Took awhile before I decided to order because I wasn&#x27;t sure what i will be getting.</li>
            <li>But I love this set.</li>
            <li>the delivery was fast, the product is great.</li>
            <li>i love it&lt;</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes are perfect and the case it comes in is a big bonus.</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes and I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend any day.</li>
            <li>BUT I am hoping to figure out how to use the others. :-)</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love that this set comes with a blending eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li>Truthfully I don&#x27;t know a lot about makeup or makeup brushes</li>
            <li>I was able to do my eyes, lips and face without looking all over for brushes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes are made out of some type of plastic that won&#x27;t pick up or hold any powder at all.</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li>I love that it folds and snaps</li>
            <li>I love that not only is it a cute pattern, but it is a nice durable case that will help preserve and keep the brushes safe and is also great for travel and on the go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i recommended this product to everybody who wants a cheap brush set but with great quality :)</li>
            <li>These are pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>I also love that every brush has a separate spot to slide it in and out easily</li>
            <li>If you have a big makeup box like me then it will fit perfectly in the bottom.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am having fun being creative with my makeup application again!</li>
            <li>first impression was how nicely packaged and cute the case that these brushes were in.</li>
            <li>I love the way they are stored within their own pocket keeping them organized, all in one place, and ready to use.</li>
            <li>but I was drawn to this particular set by the beautiful purple color (my wife&#x27;s favorite) and the reasonable cost of it.</li>
            <li>Fine brush set for the money but the bristles were not the quality that my wife has come to expect.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and they came so quickly!</li>
            <li>Even still, I can figure all of that out with a quick Internet search!</li>
            <li>The foldable case is durable, has a super cute pattern, and I can easily wipe it clean if needed.  </li>
            <li>The purple makes them very pretty as well!</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t consider it a huge deal.</li>
            <li>It held the color &amp; felt silky &amp; as light as a feather on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>the rollup case keeps all the brushed together and in great condition.</li>
            <li>You have every size possible in this great set.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using these brushes.  </li>
            <li>fantastic brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were nice, but they didn&#x27;t really have the ones that I needed.  </li>
            <li>The handles however feel a bit light weight.</li>
            <li>Overall great value for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Sooo happy with my purchase, definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li>So far I have loved these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a beautiful purple color and are made with a good quality synthetic fiber that will last for years to come with proper cleaning and care.</li>
            <li>More money on fewer high quality brushes would have been better.</li>
            <li>I would love to have bough some better ones but for the people who are new to makeup</li>
            <li>I may just buy more as gifts for my bridesmaids ;)</li>
            <li>it has so many brushes, 18 to be exact.</li>
            <li>When I got this set, there are so many brushes, I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with them all!</li>
            <li>these most certainly are not!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are soft and nicely made.</li>
            <li>I just got mine today and I am in love with the whole</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice &amp; soft &amp; hold color</li>
            <li>They are very well made and I can tell that the bristles are not going to just fall out like so many brushes.</li>
            <li>The product came very fast and I was able to use all of the brushes right away.</li>
            <li>The brush makes all the difference on blending, the right sizes and shapes to fit contours of the face, etc.  </li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a large set of various brushes will be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush set!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and gentle of my skin and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to only using one or two brushes for all the makeup that I put on, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate or creative with what I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You just need to always clean the brushes after use, I also cleaned the brushes right after I received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a very pretty set.</li>
            <li>I know it may sound strange, but I honestly like putting my makeup on more now because of how soft these brushes are and how smooth they apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the purple tips, and I know they will keep my brushes looking new.  </li>
            <li>, I know that I will be good for a very long time.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Thanks! !</li>
            <li>The brushes inside are almost too pretty to use!</li>
            <li>The brushes them selves have soft bristles and are nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out all the new brushes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to apply real intense color yet</li>
            <li>I have rosacea to deal with and these brushes allow me to cover blemishes more accurately, blend more smoothly, and they are more delicate on the skin which is particularly important for the under eye area especially for those of us over 50!</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>did I get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup brush set that makes applying makeup much easier and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Other than that, when applying makeup its pretty nice!</li>
            <li>now I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>make up brush set and right</li>
            <li>(As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate with my makeup, so I don&#x27;t know what the average size of most makeup products are these days.</li>
            <li>the brushes are very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>You not only get the essential brushes needed for your every day makeup routine, but also extra tools/brushes that are fun to play with and that help to execute your make up flawlessly.</li>
            <li>so much I bought another one for my sister too!</li>
            <li>I also think this collection should be a bit larger and include more eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the big fan brush.  </li>
            <li>I recommended this brush set as I feel it would complement any exciting brush set you may all ready have.</li>
            <li>So I had to hot glue most of them back on</li>
            <li>what I do know is that she definitely uses some of them and that this brush set has a prominent place on her makeup table.</li>
            <li>They are pretty colored though.</li>
            <li>The case is durable and very convenient for travel!  </li>
            <li>They come with a brush guard on top that you can reuse when cleaning or when wanting to bring individual brushes in a purse, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She liked the wide range of brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes also just happen to be as pretty as they are functional.</li>
            <li>The makeup is spread more evenly, and I can definitely tell a difference after using this product compared to what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to my friends or buy this set as a gift. :)</li>
            <li>My gf hung it up on her wall next to the sink so that they are right there and can be accessed and stored easily.</li>
            <li>and I can keep my ultra soft brushes organized and clean.</li>
            <li>I always take such a long time before deciding on a purchase because I want to make sure I make a good one, and this definitely was!!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very flimsy and lose strands after first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and pretty.</li>
            <li>I also use the medium blush brush &amp; that&#x27;s where the brush really performs for me.</li>
            <li>These brushes were of better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are made very well, no bristles fall out, sturdy wood</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>and I also found that the angled eyeliner brush worked really well- even with eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>It was a gamble on my part but a gamble that paid off as my wife absolutely loves this brush set.</li>
            <li>The set is large with a decent case to accommodate them .</li>
            <li>I especially like all of the finer tipped brushes that work perfect for dramatic eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Over all I like it and the color and the product more than the other brush collections on amazon.</li>
            <li>using these the first day, she dug through her box of brushes and pulled the old ones</li>
            <li>The brushes seem to be fine in my limited experience.  </li>
            <li>we should be able to write as much as little or as much as we want as a review.</li>
            <li>next noticed how many actually came in the set.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft, and they work very well; They blend eye shadow&#x27;s flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>High quality bristles and brushes are a joy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The downside is, I don&#x27;t use half my brushes, well, ok, I lied; I only use 2 right now</li>
            <li>I am having fun trying all the different shapes and sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li>My old brushes fell apart easily and were rough on my face, but these are SO soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for new make up users like me.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy, and all the bristles are soft and of high quality.  </li>
            <li>Soft too!</li>
            <li>The case is bigger than I thought it would be, but constructed well with a pretty design and snap closure.</li>
            <li>My wife was in need of a new makeup brush set, so I surprised her with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Mind you, those were random brushes I either got free with stuff or purchased based strictly on price, meaning cheap.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and inviting.</li>
            <li>The case is a soft pleather.</li>
            <li>but so far I do like the ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It has completely changed the way I apply my makeup</li>
            <li>old daughter and</li>
            <li>I said WOW...</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft on the skin,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a real heavy makeup user but it was time to replace my old brushes.</li>
            <li>I (like many) need to wash my brushes, and the slightest bit of water should not cause the top to fall off :(.</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up pretty well, the wooden handle hasn&#x27;t separated from the base yet as most all cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li>Up to now I have always used a small sponge to apply pretty much all my makeup.</li>
            <li>closed into a compact case, but opens to a large variety of makeup supplies.  </li>
            <li>The cheap brushes I usually buy are much smaller...</li>
            <li>They are really soft and I&#x27;ve washed them multiply times and the hairs on the brushes have yet to fall out.  </li>
            <li>My wife says each brush has the right soft or hard feel for what each brush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Firstly it is high quality and a lot larger than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Very soft, there is some shedding, but that is to be expected.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I looked around a lot for cute and good quality brushes and these are it.</li>
            <li> However, there was not an eyeliner brush, which would have been a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly know if she gets to use all 18 of the brushes but</li>
            <li> The fluffy fan brush is so awesome as well and is perfect for applying highlight over your face, but can also be used for bronzing or sculpting.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes have their own protectors and pockets.</li>
            <li> And she liked the color.  </li>
            <li> Every kind of brush you could need (</li>

            <li> /&gt;These are a good decent set of quality brushes at a fair price.</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes to be creative with.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this set too, so feminine.</li>
            <li> Love the color and package.</li>
            <li> I would love to recommend my friends</li>
            <li> I decided to try buying my brushes online instead and fell in love with this set.</li>
            <li> I was immediately drawn to the purple color and cute organizer case.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased  with this set of make-up</li>
            <li> The quality is better than anticipated for the price.</li>
            <li> Took awhile before I decided to order because I wasn&#x27;t sure what i will be getting.</li>
            <li> But I love this set.</li>
            <li> the delivery was fast, the product is great.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes are perfect and the case it comes in is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes and I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend any day.</li>
            <li> BUT I am hoping to figure out how to use the others. :-)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love that this set comes with a blending eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li> Truthfully I don&#x27;t know a lot about makeup or makeup brushes</li>
            <li> I was able to do my eyes, lips and face without looking all over for brushes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are made out of some type of plastic that won&#x27;t pick up or hold any powder at all.</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li> I love that it folds and snaps</li>
            <li> I love that not only is it a cute pattern, but it is a nice durable case that will help preserve and keep the brushes safe and is also great for travel and on the go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i recommended this product to everybody who wants a cheap brush set but with great quality :)</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I also love that every brush has a separate spot to slide it in and out easily</li>
            <li> If you have a big makeup box like me then it will fit perfectly in the bottom.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am having fun being creative with my makeup application again!</li>
            <li> first impression was how nicely packaged and cute the case that these brushes were in.</li>
            <li> I love the way they are stored within their own pocket keeping them organized, all in one place, and ready to use.</li>
            <li> but I was drawn to this particular set by the beautiful purple color (my wife&#x27;s favorite) and the reasonable cost of it.</li>
            <li> Fine brush set for the money but the bristles were not the quality that my wife has come to expect.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and they came so quickly!</li>
            <li> Even still, I can figure all of that out with a quick Internet search!</li>
            <li> The foldable case is durable, has a super cute pattern, and I can easily wipe it clean if needed.  </li>
            <li> The purple makes them very pretty as well!</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t consider it a huge deal.</li>
            <li> It held the color &amp; felt silky &amp; as light as a feather on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> the rollup case keeps all the brushed together and in great condition.</li>
            <li> You have every size possible in this great set.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using these brushes.  </li>
            <li> fantastic brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were nice, but they didn&#x27;t really have the ones that I needed.  </li>
            <li> The handles however feel a bit light weight.</li>
            <li> Overall great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Sooo happy with my purchase, definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> So far I have loved these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a beautiful purple color and are made with a good quality synthetic fiber that will last for years to come with proper cleaning and care.</li>
            <li> More money on fewer high quality brushes would have been better.</li>
            <li> I would love to have bough some better ones but for the people who are new to makeup</li>
            <li> I may just buy more as gifts for my bridesmaids ;)</li>
            <li> it has so many brushes, 18 to be exact.</li>
            <li> When I got this set, there are so many brushes, I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with them all!</li>
            <li> these most certainly are not!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are soft and nicely made.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and I am in love with the whole</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice &amp; soft &amp; hold color</li>
            <li> They are very well made and I can tell that the bristles are not going to just fall out like so many brushes.</li>
            <li> The product came very fast and I was able to use all of the brushes right away.</li>
            <li> The brush makes all the difference on blending, the right sizes and shapes to fit contours of the face, etc.  </li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a large set of various brushes will be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and gentle of my skin and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to only using one or two brushes for all the makeup that I put on, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate or creative with what I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You just need to always clean the brushes after use, I also cleaned the brushes right after I received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a very pretty set.</li>
            <li> I know it may sound strange, but I honestly like putting my makeup on more now because of how soft these brushes are and how smooth they apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the purple tips, and I know they will keep my brushes looking new.  </li>
            <li> , I know that I will be good for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Thanks! !</li>
            <li> The brushes inside are almost too pretty to use!</li>
            <li> The brushes them selves have soft bristles and are nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out all the new brushes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to apply real intense color yet</li>
            <li> I have rosacea to deal with and these brushes allow me to cover blemishes more accurately, blend more smoothly, and they are more delicate on the skin which is particularly important for the under eye area especially for those of us over 50!</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> did I get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup brush set that makes applying makeup much easier and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Other than that, when applying makeup its pretty nice!</li>
            <li> now I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> make up brush set and right</li>
            <li> (As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate with my makeup, so I don&#x27;t know what the average size of most makeup products are these days.</li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> You not only get the essential brushes needed for your every day makeup routine, but also extra tools/brushes that are fun to play with and that help to execute your make up flawlessly.</li>
            <li> so much I bought another one for my sister too!</li>
            <li> I also think this collection should be a bit larger and include more eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush is the big fan brush.  </li>
            <li> I recommended this brush set as I feel it would complement any exciting brush set you may all ready have.</li>
            <li> So I had to hot glue most of them back on</li>
            <li> what I do know is that she definitely uses some of them and that this brush set has a prominent place on her makeup table.</li>
            <li> They are pretty colored though.</li>
            <li> The case is durable and very convenient for travel!  </li>
            <li> They come with a brush guard on top that you can reuse when cleaning or when wanting to bring individual brushes in a purse, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She liked the wide range of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes also just happen to be as pretty as they are functional.</li>
            <li> The makeup is spread more evenly, and I can definitely tell a difference after using this product compared to what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to my friends or buy this set as a gift. :)</li>
            <li> My gf hung it up on her wall next to the sink so that they are right there and can be accessed and stored easily.</li>
            <li> and I can keep my ultra soft brushes organized and clean.</li>
            <li> I always take such a long time before deciding on a purchase because I want to make sure I make a good one, and this definitely was!!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very flimsy and lose strands after first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and pretty.</li>
            <li> I also use the medium blush brush &amp; that&#x27;s where the brush really performs for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes were of better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are made very well, no bristles fall out, sturdy wood</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> and I also found that the angled eyeliner brush worked really well- even with eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It was a gamble on my part but a gamble that paid off as my wife absolutely loves this brush set.</li>
            <li> The set is large with a decent case to accommodate them .</li>
            <li> I especially like all of the finer tipped brushes that work perfect for dramatic eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Over all I like it and the color and the product more than the other brush collections on amazon.</li>
            <li> using these the first day, she dug through her box of brushes and pulled the old ones</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be fine in my limited experience.  </li>
            <li> we should be able to write as much as little or as much as we want as a review.</li>
            <li> next noticed how many actually came in the set.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft, and they work very well; They blend eye shadow&#x27;s flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> High quality bristles and brushes are a joy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The downside is, I don&#x27;t use half my brushes, well, ok, I lied; I only use 2 right now</li>
            <li> I am having fun trying all the different shapes and sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> My old brushes fell apart easily and were rough on my face, but these are SO soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for new make up users like me.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy, and all the bristles are soft and of high quality.  </li>
            <li> Soft too!</li>
            <li> The case is bigger than I thought it would be, but constructed well with a pretty design and snap closure.</li>
            <li> My wife was in need of a new makeup brush set, so I surprised her with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, those were random brushes I either got free with stuff or purchased based strictly on price, meaning cheap.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and inviting.</li>
            <li> The case is a soft pleather.</li>
            <li> but so far I do like the ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It has completely changed the way I apply my makeup</li>

            <li> I said WOW...</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft on the skin,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real heavy makeup user but it was time to replace my old brushes.</li>

            <li> My wife says each brush has the right soft or hard feel for what each brush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Firstly it is high quality and a lot larger than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Very soft, there is some shedding, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> and I feel like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and my makeup applications are so much easier &amp; less messy because of them!</li>

            <li> This is the nicest brush set I have purchased! Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. There are so many brushes to be creative with. The brushes are soft and inviting. They are well made, with a great variety of choices. I am having fun being creative with my makeup application again! The case is a soft pleather. This is a perfect material for the case because the residue makeup on the brushes does not stain the case like it does with cloth cases I have owned. I love the color of this set too, so feminine.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush set, It is amazing. Love the color and package. the brushes are very soft and easy to apply. I would love to recommend my friends</li>
            <li> So far I have loved these brushes. They are in an attractive bag/case which has been durable for traveling. The brushes are great quality and are holding up well. I would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes ever! I recently went into a makeup store to price out brushes and was shocked by how expensive just one brush was, let alone an entire set. I decided to try buying my brushes online instead and fell in love with this set. I was immediately drawn to the purple color and cute organizer case. I continued to be impressed with the quality. My makeup looks amazing. I especially like all of the finer tipped brushes that work perfect for dramatic eyeshadow. This is the best value for makeup brushes. I recommended them to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased  with this set of make-up brushes!&lt;br /&gt; They are soft and nicely made. The quality is better than anticipated for the price. The set is large with a decent case to accommodate them . Anyone looking for a large set of various brushes will be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Returned  as the quality was not that great</li>
            <li> pretty, good quality, exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> This brush set is perfect!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and recommend them to all of my friends! The set is great -- a brush for any possible application you may need and the case is great for travel! I may just buy more as gifts for my bridesmaids ;)</li>
            <li> The brushes are very flimsy and lose strands after first use.</li>
            <li> Took awhile before I decided to order because I wasn&#x27;t sure what i will be getting. But I love this set. It&#x27;s so amazing and been using for more than a month now and non of the brush&#x27;s hairs have started shedding. So worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife was in need of a new makeup brush set, so I surprised her with this purchase.  She&#x27;s been very happy with them and loves the color!</li>
            <li> My wife was delighted with this gift. It wasn&#x27;t easy for me to find the best brushes as a surprise gift, but I&#x27;m sure now I made the right choice. My wife says each brush has the right soft or hard feel for what each brush is supposed to do. In a few words, the brushes work well.</li>
            <li> I got these for My daughter, who is a makeup artist and she loves these brushes. She says they are great. It was one of her Christmas gifts. No shedding and they feel great on your skin. I WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and I am in love with the whole make up brush set and right&lt;br /&gt;now I am labeling each and every brush so I know which is which, cant wait to try&lt;br /&gt;it out</li>
            <li> the delivery was fast, the product is great. i love it&lt;br /&gt;i recommended this product to everybody who wants a cheap brush set but with great quality :)</li>
            <li> These are great!  I bought these for my gf for her birthday.  They come all rolled up in a nice travel / storage case/bag.  My gf hung it up on her wall next to the sink so that they are right there and can be accessed and stored easily.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be fine in my limited experience.  An Impressive layout, but had to super glue the tops to the handles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice. The quality of the brushes are perfect and the case it comes in is a big bonus. I like them so much I bought another one for my sister too!</li>
            <li> The glue holding the brush tips to the handle is not strong, or was applied poorly. I (like many) need to wash my brushes, and the slightest bit of water should not cause the top to fall off :(. But the quality of the brushes themselves are great.</li>
            <li> The. Price is good and I feel like they will last a long time. If you have a big makeup box like me then it will fit perfectly in the bottom. but the big fan brush was a little smooshed when it arrived. I also think this collection should be a bit larger and include more eyeshadow brushes. Over all I like it and the color and the product more than the other brush collections on amazon. When these get old in a few months I will buy again. Because for the price I can mess the, up and purchase again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted! They&#x27;re super soft and gentle of my skin and the color is gorgeous. I will have to say that the foundation brush had a lot of fallout when i was using it but i have plenty of other foundation brushes so i didn&#x27;t consider it a huge deal. They come in a beautiful purple case that has purple roses all over it. I really love these brushes and I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend any day.</li>
            <li> The brush do a very good job I like my brushs one thing is that the set do not have a pencil brush in it I would lov err to have one r too pencil brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real heavy makeup user but it was time to replace my old brushes. Mind you, those were random brushes I either got free with stuff or purchased based strictly on price, meaning cheap. Never thought it made any difference what I used. Boy was I wrong. I still don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but I do like experimenting with eye makeup. You can say I&#x27;m just getting into it. I chose these brushes because they came in a set &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to figure out all the brushes that I would need. The downside is, I don&#x27;t use half my brushes, well, ok, I lied; I only use 2 right now BUT I am hoping to figure out how to use the others. :-) (My goal is to use at least half) I still rely a lot on the little sponges that comes with the eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good decent set of quality brushes at a fair price. They seem to hold up pretty well, the wooden handle hasn&#x27;t separated from the base yet as most all cheap brushes do. The bristles are nice &amp; soft &amp; hold color well. I only use the small/medium sized eye shadow brush for my eye color base. I haven&#x27;t tried to apply real intense color yet but I may just stick with the spongy tips for that. I also use the medium blush brush &amp; that&#x27;s where the brush really performs for me. It held the color &amp; felt silky &amp; as light as a feather on my cheeks. The color actually got on my face &amp; didn&#x27;t stay stuck in the bristles. It does stain the brush but a lot of color won&#x27;t remain there. I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a month now &amp; I&#x27;m happy with them. I am also looking forward to learning how to use some more! Do recommend for the moderate user!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes for the price. I love the colors and the bag that they are stowed in is nice. I&#x27;d recommend for new make up users like me.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a loved one. I don&#x27;t know a thing about make up or brushes but I got lots of hugs and kisses. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are nice but not the best . I would love to have bough some better ones but for the people who are new to makeup this is great</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. You&#x27;ll have every brush you could ever need and they are good quality. They wash well and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. The purple color was an added bonus and it gives it a nice feminine flair.</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful. the rollup case keeps all the brushed together and in great condition. The brushes are good quality and I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought them for a  Christmas present so I don&#x27;t know how they work but they appear to be good</li>
            <li> These brushes were of better quality than I expected. Very soft, there is some shedding, but that is to be expected. Bought these for my daughter as a Christmas present and she is very happy with them. The only reason I am giving four stars and not five is because there is a sponge tip applicator in the set and it was stained.</li>
            <li> Please include blending and shading brushes - reason for 4 stars. Other than that, when applying makeup its pretty nice!</li>
            <li> Recommend those brushes to anyone that as a budget in place. I bought those for my wife and she loves them. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that product.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft, and they work very well; They blend eye shadow&#x27;s flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of brushes you get; Great price for premium brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made very well, no bristles fall out, sturdy wood handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to always clean the brushes after use, I also cleaned the brushes right after I received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> One Set to Rule them all (Set of Brushes that is)&lt;br /&gt;I got these for my wife when they were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;Boy did I get my money&#x27;s worth.  Excellent Brushes (so my wife says)&lt;br /&gt;After using these the first day, she dug through her box of brushes and pulled the old ones so she could throw them away.&lt;br /&gt;Now she has a small case of brushes taking up much less room, and she likes that she can just pull out and roll out these brushes every morning.  Since She is happier, I am happier!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set!  I use different kinds of powder - blushes, eye powders and copper powders. The brush makes all the difference on blending, the right sizes and shapes to fit contours of the face, etc.  You have every size possible in this great set.  I use them every day.  High quality bristles and brushes are a joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple cosmetic bag is also very nice and easy to take along on a trip - or store in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes! I looked around a lot for cute and good quality brushes and these are it. I love that this set comes with a blending eyeshadow brush and I also found that the angled eyeliner brush worked really well- even with eyeshadow. I haven&#x27;t tried all of the brushes yet but so far I do like the ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these brushes.  For the price they meet my expectations.  My favorite brush is the big fan brush.  They are really soft and I&#x27;ve washed them multiply times and the hairs on the brushes have yet to fall out.  I recommended this brush set as I feel it would complement any exciting brush set you may all ready have.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes in this set. However, there was not an eyeliner brush, which would have been a nice addition. For the brushes you don&#x27;t need, the price makes up for that.</li>
            <li> fantastic brushes.  we should be able to write as much as little or as much as we want as a review.</li>
            <li> This is an extensive set of brushes. I ordered these over a year ago and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the bristles coming out BUT the actual brush tip comes off all the time. So I had to hot glue most of them back on or they would be lost in various areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. Truthfully I don&#x27;t know a lot about makeup or makeup brushes but I was drawn to this particular set by the beautiful purple color (my wife&#x27;s favorite) and the reasonable cost of it. It was a gamble on my part but a gamble that paid off as my wife absolutely loves this brush set. It comes in a nice case that&#x27;s well organized and great for traveling as well. I don&#x27;t honestly know if she gets to use all 18 of the brushes but what I do know is that she definitely uses some of them and that this brush set has a prominent place on her makeup table.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! The quality is great, I use them every day and they&#x27;re still perfect. No hairs fall out of them and everything!</li>
            <li> The brushes were nice, but they didn&#x27;t really have the ones that I needed.  They are pretty colored though.Soft too!</li>
            <li> I think this is a very pretty set. It is a good one for beginners. The bristles are very soft and feels great on the skin. Not scratchy at all. The variety of brushes are a great mix of sizes for eye makeup application. The fluffy fan brush is so awesome as well and is perfect for applying highlight over your face, but can also be used for bronzing or sculpting. The handles however feel a bit light weight.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush set! It has completely changed the way I apply my makeup and I have already received compliments! The product came very fast and I was able to use all of the brushes right away. This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set!  First I was very impressed by how quickly the product arrived. When I opened it I immediatly loved the case. It&#x27;s very durable and pretty. All of the brushes have their own protectors and pockets.The brushes are great quality and the set comes with every type of brush you could every need. The brushes them selves have soft bristles and are nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out all the new brushes. Thanks! !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are super cute and great quality!  The case is durable and very convenient for travel!  I&#x27;m thinking of buying more as bridesmaids gifts!</li>
            <li> I always take such a long time before deciding on a purchase because I want to make sure I make a good one, and this definitely was!!  I was pleasantly suprised by the size &amp; quality of these brushes considering they were such a great price for all that was included! Not to mention the cute case they come in! The brushes are so soft and my makeup applications are so much easier &amp; less messy because of them! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and they came so quickly! Love the purple too! Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 20 yr. old daughter and this is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was how nicely packaged and cute the case that these brushes were in. I love that not only is it a cute pattern, but it is a nice durable case that will help preserve and keep the brushes safe and is also great for travel and on the go. They come with a brush guard on top that you can reuse when cleaning or when wanting to bring individual brushes in a purse, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I next noticed how many actually came in the set.  In total, there are 18 brushes/tools. For the amount of money, it is a great value. You not only get the essential brushes needed for your every day makeup routine, but also extra tools/brushes that are fun to play with and that help to execute your make up flawlessly. The brushes are a beautiful purple color and are made with a good quality synthetic fiber that will last for years to come with proper cleaning and care. They feel great on the face and are easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to anyone looking into purchasing a good quality, durable set of brushes.</li>
            <li> When I opened the organizer case I said WOW...it has so many brushes, 18 to be exact. The organizer is beautiful and I can carry it anywhere, which is a great plus since I like to travel and I can keep my ultra soft brushes organized and clean. I was able to do my eyes, lips and face without looking all over for brushes. Everything you need to apply flawless makeup is in organizer set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush organizer set by Quoduct is a great gift idea for any women that cares about her skin. I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my daughter for Christmas.  She liked the wide range of brushes.  Quality was good.  And she liked the color.  Overall great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Just received these yesterday.  This really is an amazing value for the price!  Every kind of brush you could need (minus a kabuki brush &amp; beauty blender but those aren&#x27;t necessary all the time) Great set, application is good. Love the variety of brushes and they storage case is gorgeous and easy to travel with.  Obviously they are not MAC quality but if this is the price point you are looking at GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> This set is divine! Firstly it is high quality and a lot larger than I expected it to be. It comes in a nice folding case that will be convenient for travel. It looks so nice that it would make a great gift. I am having fun trying all the different shapes and sizes of brushes. Up to now I have always used a small sponge to apply pretty much all my makeup. I had no idea what a difference it would make to use the proper brushes for the task! I have rosacea to deal with and these brushes allow me to cover blemishes more accurately, blend more smoothly, and they are more delicate on the skin which is particularly important for the under eye area especially for those of us over 50!</li>
            <li> I was so anxious waiting for this order, because my old brushes wasn&#x27;t working well anymore, so I decided to give it a try on this set and I&#x27;m glad I bought them. These brushes are so soft on the skin, when I use them, it makes me feel like makeup artist, the purple tips are really beautiful plus the case it came with, it is adorable, fashion and keep everything well organized. I am very impressed with the quality and variety. I&#x27;m Sooo happy with my purchase, definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Fine brush set for the money but the bristles were not the quality that my wife has come to expect.  More money on fewer high quality brushes would have been better.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are made out of some type of plastic that won&#x27;t pick up or hold any powder at all. You can&#x27;t get any eyeshadow or blush to stick to brushes. They are unusable. So disappointed in the gift. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> My dauhter loves them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just what I was looking for! There are so many brushes, I know that I will be good for a very long time. I love the way they are stored within their own pocket keeping them organized, all in one place, and ready to use. The brushes also just happen to be as pretty as they are functional. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is amazing. I&#x27;m used to only using one or two brushes for all the makeup that I put on, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate or creative with what I do. When I got this set, there are so many brushes, I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with them all! After seeing the description on the product page and matching them up with what I now have, I can say that this set has it ALL. I can definitely get everything done with this product! I will say, the quality of this product is awesome. My old brushes fell apart easily and were rough on my face, but these are SO soft! They are very well made and I can tell that the bristles are not going to just fall out like so many brushes. The purple makes them very pretty as well! The case that they come in is perfect and has a place for all of them, and then folds up nicely to be stored. I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 out of 5 because the case and the brushes are a lot larger than I had imagined them to be. (As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t get too elaborate with my makeup, so I don&#x27;t know what the average size of most makeup products are these days. The cheap brushes I usually buy are much smaller...but then again those are very poorly made and these most certainly are not!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a makeup brush set that makes applying makeup much easier and more enjoyable. I know it may sound strange, but I honestly like putting my makeup on more now because of how soft these brushes are and how smooth they apply my makeup. The makeup is spread more evenly, and I can definitely tell a difference after using this product compared to what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering this product, they arrived in the mail promptly, I think just 2 days after I placed my order. Awesome product!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this makeup brush set.  I was SO impressed with how quickly the order was processed and shipped.  I actually received it in two days with regular shipping (and I ordered it on a Sunday)!  This was almost a week before I anticipated receiving it!  The foldable case is durable, has a super cute pattern, and I can easily wipe it clean if needed.  I love that it folds and snaps closed into a compact case, but opens to a large variety of makeup supplies.  I also love that every brush has a separate spot to slide it in and out easily so they don&#x27;t get all mixed up together.  It has every brush I could possibly need, including ones for eyelashes and brows!  Purple is my favorite color, and this is a great shade of purple.  The brushes are sturdy, and all the bristles are soft and of high quality.  I love the purple tips, and I know they will keep my brushes looking new.  I am definitely very happy that I purchased this item, and I will be purchasing more to give as gifts!  :)</li>
            <li> This brush set is beautiful! The case is bigger than I thought it would be, but constructed well with a pretty design and snap closure. The brushes inside are almost too pretty to use! There are a lot of brushes, some that I don&#x27;t begin to know what to use them for! There are no &#x27;directions&#x27; and the brushes are not labeled. Even still, I can figure all of that out with a quick Internet search! For the price, the quality is awesome! I would definitely recommend to my friends or buy this set as a gift. :)</li>
