            <li>nice product for the price</li>
            <li>My dissatisfaction with this product perhaps comes from my own misconception.  </li>
            <li>Looked great, but wasn&#x27;t what we originally wanted from it.</li>
            <li>I love it was very lovely on bride&#x27;s maids</li>
            <li>Love product nice and sturdy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than I thought, so I&#x27;ll have to figure out a good way to secure it onto my head.</li>
            <li>Very cheap made.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I can use it in my hair whenever I want though, because it is quite lovely!</li>
            <li>Very pretty!!</li>
            <li>I love these for my wedding décor.</li>
            <li>it was lovely paired with my dress and earnings.</li>
            <li>Make sure you look at the close up.  </li>
            <li>stunning accessory</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It looks better in person.</li>
            <li>It looked good in photos though and was worth the  price I paid.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a hair stlye that you can use lots of pins to keep it in.</li>
            <li>when I took it off it fell and broke more.</li>
            <li>but I am sure I will figure it out</li>
            <li>I love you.</li>
            <li>Just be creative to stick it in your hair</li>
            <li>:)   </li>
            <li>very nice and very sturdy</li>
            <li>Bought for my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s 5th grade dance - beautiful accent</li>
            <li>Just beautiful and classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest quality, however, since I&#x27;m only going to wear it for one or two days, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for that.</li>
            <li>I am SO excited to wear it for my wedding!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and the products where wrapped and packaged very safely to prevent damage and bending.  </li>
            <li>Looks really great - classy.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and classy .</li>
            <li>i had to take my time to bend it  to sit in place but other than that it is very beautiful</li>
            <li>so it will shape easily.</li>
            <li>The hair comb is beautiful is the same as in the picture of Sale, but arrived with a piece the flower damaged, I think it will be repaired here, but not expecting it.</li>
            <li>For its cheap price, I think it&#x27;s really pretty and works nicely.</li>
            <li>It would have been a super cute accessory but for those that pay attention to detail, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the peice for you.  </li>
            <li>The item was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Looked great on picture but made with low quality material.</li>
            <li>Broke as soon as I bent it to fit around my head.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made broke trying to put in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, flimsy and feels like it would break</li>
            <li>Looks just like picture, however it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, choice.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, easy to bend to the shape I want and easy to pin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, and I regret purchasing it in the first place, mostly because how cheaply it is made, but also how easily it falls apart.</li>
            <li>The headband is quite pretty, but it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t amazing, but it is quite pretty and well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>as promised, pretty and flexible, love it</li>
            <li>but no just that they feel off the original...</li>
            <li>Took A long time to get it but love it!!</li>
            <li>Not look like Boutique, even for Wedding special day</li>
            <li>Made her more beautiful and that is hard.</li>
            <li>I thought oh cool replacement pieces</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute n for the price can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>This is very nice accesorie, I love it because I can adjust to different hair styles, is not heavy.</li>
            <li>and I was lucky and there were no problems with it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, looks just like picture</li>
            <li>Super glue</li>
            <li>super easy.i don&#x27;t even understand how I&#x27;d put this in my hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, it has pearls and diamonds.</li>
            <li>Its very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty,  looks as pictured.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but doesn&#x27;t come with anything to tie it on with, but can use some ribbon I have.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Although it is well made, study and appears to be of good quality, it is NOT a complete head piece as it looked to me in this picture.  </li>
            <li>Very beautiful, so delicate, exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>So pretty, wish I&#x27;d seen it to order sooner!</li>
            <li>Really Nice, a little bit heavy but looks great!</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>I suppose for the cost, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super pretty for prom</li>
            <li>I could not get it to look right anywhere on my head</li>
            <li>Love it, only thing is im very cautious with it because I dont want it to detach while bending it but other than that its beautiful exactly as in the picture.</li>
            <li>A little heavy, but the are gorgeous and looked great on my daughter for her wedding</li>
            <li>very nice it comes very stiff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Oh well, still pretty</li>
            <li>It broke into pieces after i tried it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>but wasn&#x27;t intended to be that way at first.  </li>
            <li>Broke into pieces at first try.</li>
            <li>This is really pretty but has nothing to support it staying in your hair</li>
            <li>I wish I could get married again</li>
            <li>It was pretty though.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so I wanted something really pretty</li>
            <li>kind of flimsy so handle carefully, but quite pretty</li>
            <li>I like it, it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>But it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty from a distance.</li>
            <li>Also it looks pretty from a distance but up-close</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheep</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but worried it might break shipped folded and seemed like it was already weak once i straightened it out</li>
            <li>The flowers came right off the main band.</li>
            <li>Made a little cheap but worked well just have to be easy with it</li>
            <li>it.you can tell the material is very cheap.for</li>
            <li>I suggest to bend it gently.</li>
            <li>And it is just very flimsy...</li>
            <li>It is very brittle.</li>
            <li>It was straight</li>
            <li>It is really can not use .</li>
            <li>The whole thing is on a metal line which bends, so you can shape it to your head.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of hard to work out the smooth final circular product.</li>
            <li>Took a while to ship, it&#x27;s nice looking not sure how it will look in my hair until I try it in an up-do.</li>
            <li>The second I opened this I thought it was very pretty</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re having an up-do for your event or wedding.</li>
            <li>item came from Chna which added extra time to shipment but worth the wait..</li>
            <li>i had to get a new one and glue it on</li>
            <li>It took a very long time to receive, but it arrived exactly as described in the pictures!</li>
            <li>item looks nice, but very rigid and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>When I tried to straighten it out after I received it, it was left with a huge dent in center.</li>
            <li>I do not know whether this is a real choice, they should have some extra beads (if).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but it completely fell apart after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Was going to be a hair accessory for my 5 year old as a flower girl.  </li>
            <li>came early and looked just like the picture</li>
            <li>This shipped as fast as it could being international.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only wasted 4 bucks on it.</li>
            <li>The big part where there are two big flowers touching is one big flat piece which might not be a problem if you are a blockhead.  </li>
            <li>But very delicate, and breaks very easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t foresee a problem gluing it back on and it doesn&#x27;t even matter since that particular setting is facing inward after twisting the pieces together, but</li>
            <li>shipping took forever  and it looked so cheap and small  </li>
            <li>However, if you bend too much, some of the metal flower pieces might break off (peel off), so you have to be careful not to overbend it.</li>
            <li>Im sure it will only last 1 maybe 2 usages before it will be broken.</li>
            <li>Just seems very delicate and will break easy.</li>
            <li>It was broken but an easy fix.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so fragile, the wire can be broken easily.</li>

            <li> Shipping was very fast and the products where wrapped and packaged very safely to prevent damage and bending.  </li>
            <li> Looks really great - classy.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and classy .</li>
            <li> i had to take my time to bend it  to sit in place but other than that it is very beautiful</li>
            <li> so it will shape easily.</li>
            <li> The hair comb is beautiful is the same as in the picture of Sale, but arrived with a piece the flower damaged, I think it will be repaired here, but not expecting it.</li>
            <li> For its cheap price, I think it&#x27;s really pretty and works nicely.</li>
            <li> It would have been a super cute accessory but for those that pay attention to detail, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the peice for you.  </li>
            <li> The item was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Looked great on picture but made with low quality material.</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I bent it to fit around my head.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made broke trying to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, flimsy and feels like it would break</li>
            <li> Looks just like picture, however it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, choice.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, easy to bend to the shape I want and easy to pin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, and I regret purchasing it in the first place, mostly because how cheaply it is made, but also how easily it falls apart.</li>
            <li> The headband is quite pretty, but it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t amazing, but it is quite pretty and well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> as promised, pretty and flexible, love it</li>
            <li> but no just that they feel off the original...</li>
            <li> Took A long time to get it but love it!!</li>
            <li> Not look like Boutique, even for Wedding special day</li>
            <li> Made her more beautiful and that is hard.</li>
            <li> I thought oh cool replacement pieces</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute n for the price can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> This is very nice accesorie, I love it because I can adjust to different hair styles, is not heavy.</li>
            <li> and I was lucky and there were no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, looks just like picture</li>
            <li> Super glue</li>
            <li> super easy.i don&#x27;t even understand how I&#x27;d put this in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, it has pearls and diamonds.</li>
            <li> Its very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty,  looks as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but doesn&#x27;t come with anything to tie it on with, but can use some ribbon I have.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Although it is well made, study and appears to be of good quality, it is NOT a complete head piece as it looked to me in this picture.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful, so delicate, exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> So pretty, wish I&#x27;d seen it to order sooner!</li>
            <li> Really Nice, a little bit heavy but looks great!</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> I suppose for the cost, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super pretty for prom</li>
            <li> I could not get it to look right anywhere on my head</li>
            <li> Love it, only thing is im very cautious with it because I dont want it to detach while bending it but other than that its beautiful exactly as in the picture.</li>
            <li> A little heavy, but the are gorgeous and looked great on my daughter for her wedding</li>
            <li> very nice it comes very stiff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Oh well, still pretty</li>
            <li> It broke into pieces after i tried it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t intended to be that way at first.  </li>
            <li> Broke into pieces at first try.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty but has nothing to support it staying in your hair</li>
            <li> I wish I could get married again</li>
            <li> It was pretty though.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so I wanted something really pretty</li>
            <li> kind of flimsy so handle carefully, but quite pretty</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> But it is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty from a distance.</li>
            <li> Also it looks pretty from a distance but up-close</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheep</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but worried it might break shipped folded and seemed like it was already weak once i straightened it out</li>
            <li> The flowers came right off the main band.</li>
            <li> Made a little cheap but worked well just have to be easy with it</li>
            <li> it.you can tell the material is very cheap.for</li>
            <li> I suggest to bend it gently.</li>
            <li> And it is just very flimsy...</li>
            <li> It is very brittle.</li>
            <li> It was straight</li>
            <li> It is really can not use .</li>
            <li> The whole thing is on a metal line which bends, so you can shape it to your head.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of hard to work out the smooth final circular product.</li>
            <li> Took a while to ship, it&#x27;s nice looking not sure how it will look in my hair until I try it in an up-do.</li>
            <li> The second I opened this I thought it was very pretty</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you&#x27;re having an up-do for your event or wedding.</li>
            <li> item came from Chna which added extra time to shipment but worth the wait..</li>
            <li> i had to get a new one and glue it on</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to receive, but it arrived exactly as described in the pictures!</li>
            <li> item looks nice, but very rigid and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> When I tried to straighten it out after I received it, it was left with a huge dent in center.</li>
            <li> I do not know whether this is a real choice, they should have some extra beads (if).</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but it completely fell apart after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Was going to be a hair accessory for my 5 year old as a flower girl.  </li>
            <li> came early and looked just like the picture</li>
            <li> This shipped as fast as it could being international.  </li>
            <li> Glad I only wasted 4 bucks on it.</li>
            <li> The big part where there are two big flowers touching is one big flat piece which might not be a problem if you are a blockhead.  </li>
            <li> But very delicate, and breaks very easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t foresee a problem gluing it back on and it doesn&#x27;t even matter since that particular setting is facing inward after twisting the pieces together, but</li>
            <li> shipping took forever  and it looked so cheap and small  </li>
            <li> However, if you bend too much, some of the metal flower pieces might break off (peel off), so you have to be careful not to overbend it.</li>
            <li> Im sure it will only last 1 maybe 2 usages before it will be broken.</li>
            <li> Just seems very delicate and will break easy.</li>
            <li> It was broken but an easy fix.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so fragile, the wire can be broken easily.</li>
            <li> Upside: you can bend the wire so it isn&#x27;t too tight if that is normally a head band issue for you.</li>
            <li> way too small and comes straight.  </li>
            <li> Wire is sturdy enough to bend back into shape, though I was cautious not to over bend.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: the band doesn&#x27;t bend uniformly due to the spots where the decorations are connected to the band.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and beautiful....took too long to receive item, but I wasnt in a hurry</li>
            <li> Oh, and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It covers only half the head.  </li>
            <li> was smaller than expected, but a part literally just fell off when slightly flexed.</li>
            <li> It totally fell apart before we could even get it in my hair, so NOT worth the wait!</li>
            <li> We wound up cutting them into smaller pieces, using the large cluster on the end as an accent to the hair bun on the back of their head.  </li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I was expected to see, don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I expected a headband.  </li>
            <li> move on and look harder.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not much to clasp onto.</li>
            <li> There is a flower that is broken off in multiple places and looks as if it was fixed to be that way</li>
            <li> You will need to clip it down with something, it comes as one flat piece that you have to mold and then clip down.  </li>
            <li> The pearls do fall off easily though but little crazy glue will do the trick...</li>
            <li> It was folded in half in a tiny little envelope with nothing to protect it.</li>
            <li> You can see the glue all around the other pieces..</li>
            <li> Be very careful when handling</li>
            <li> The wire bends, but you must be careful because it&#x27;s a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying</li>
            <li> (so I never even got to the point of figuring out how to pin it down.</li>
            <li> It came bent in an envelope and it left a weird kink in the middle of the piece.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to arrive from China.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone to waste monty on this.</li>
            <li> not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Came bent and is missing a piece...</li>
            <li> never buy this item, received with broken pieces, and emailed to seller and never get respond back.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy piece</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a heavy piece and will not fit to your head</li>
            <li> the downside was that when I opened it  was broken so obviously that was the downside</li>
            <li> As the quality is not great, it won&#x27;t last forever - it IS made in China.</li>
            <li> took too long to get and had to order it twice, not happy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t mad at first because I thought I could fix it like I usually fix my other broken headbands,</li>
            <li> Not sure how to use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with it now.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how that could sell this without having it attached to a comb or something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  pretty, but it is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> How do I use it is like Hard strip .</li>
            <li> Received too late.</li>
            <li> but I ordered it late.</li>
            <li> It will not lie flat and the wire is so thin that I&#x27;m afraid to try too hard in case it breaks.</li>
            <li> It is very hard .</li>
            <li> move on your head ,but when I get it very hard .</li>
            <li> Arrived broken in 2 places and is very hard would not work as a head band.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hairdresser had a hard time manuvering it on my head with the style we were going with.</li>
            <li> but the item it self was broken into 3 pieces.</li>
            <li> Also it was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> Poor material.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> but it broken as soon as i touched;(&lt;br</li>
            <li> after a piece of the headband was broken</li>
            <li> I just used a dollar store thin headband</li>
            <li> I try to bent it can put in my Hair ， it is broken .</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> Received it and ill was broken.</li>
            <li> but I got angry when it came broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the cheapness of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;so sad....</li>
            <li> It was packaged so poorly!</li>
            <li> But have not many ways to put it on!!!!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> the price it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> and now I probably won&#x27;t use it cause it looks bad...</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The item was cheaply made. The flowers came right off the main band.</li>
            <li> This head band is beautiful! The price is great!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, it has pearls and diamonds. It&#x27;s bendy so it will shape easily.</li>
            <li> This piece is so beautiful however one of the flowers broke as soon as I opened it.you can tell the material is very cheap.for the price it isn&#x27;t bad.I will have to use glue to fix it</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty. But very delicate, and breaks very easy. It came all bent into an envelope when it came, and when I tried to bend it back, it broke.  But I still make it work.</li>
            <li> Nice and beautiful :)</li>
            <li> Looked great on picture but made with low quality material. It was delivered in two weeks and the packaging was intact but the item it self was broken into 3 pieces. I would not recommend anyone to waste monty on this.</li>
            <li> The hair comb is beautiful is the same as in the picture of Sale, but arrived with a piece the flower damaged, I think it will be repaired here, but not expecting it.</li>
            <li> is a very cute hair accesorie.</li>
            <li> what I like is that the wire is flexable, and can be used in updos as well.I suggest to bend it gently. When I wear my hair in a  French roll ,I wear it vetically,along the seam,and to hide any pins.Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> It is of course very beautiful, but very VERY CHEAPLY MADE. Yes, it does &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; to shape, but the flowers and pearls become unattached and fall off if you do. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have anything to attach to your head/hair with, so some assembly is required. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, and I regret purchasing it in the first place, mostly because how cheaply it is made, but also how easily it falls apart. Just be informed about what you purchase before you do.</li>
            <li> I wanted a headpiece for my wedding and didn&#x27;t wanna pay a lot of money.  Came across this product and decided to give it a try. .. shipping took forever  and it looked so cheap and small  like something a kid would wear. I ended up giving it to my neighbors daughter</li>
            <li> Really Nice, a little bit heavy but looks great!</li>
            <li> It is very nice, but I lost three balls! I do not know whether this is a real choice, they should have some extra beads (if). Satisfaction. Everyone says how nice. Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> beautiful .. as in the picture</li>
            <li> Beautiful but worried it might break shipped folded and seemed like it was already weak once i straightened it out</li>
            <li> Not sure how to use this but it&#x27;s super pretty for prom</li>
            <li> Not look like Boutique, even for Wedding special day</li>
            <li> Is perfect I loved!!!</li>
            <li> I love these for my wedding décor. I add them to my rental centerpiece designs. Lots of compliments. I have purchased 10.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!! Very happy</li>
            <li> Its very pretty. Only thing is it has no way of clipping it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty,  looks as pictured.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly flimsy and was bent to ship! !!! Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Wore this for my wedding and it looked absolutely beautiful. The wire bends, but you must be careful because it&#x27;s a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Was not what I was expecting but will work in a different way.</li>
            <li> This is really a great quality.  I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, so delicate, exactly like the picture. 👍</li>
            <li> Made a little cheap but worked well just have to be easy with it so it doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> I see that there were mixed feelings about this headwear, but when I received it, it was not damaged. When I adjust it, it does not fall apart. It is actually quite sturdy, and it looks just like the picture shown. For its cheap price, I think it&#x27;s really pretty and works nicely.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my daughter and nieces to wear as flower girls. We just put a garter (elastic) on the bottom to make it stay on...it was easy and looked great. The pearls do fall off easily though but little crazy glue will do the trick...nothing to stop me from getting this again.</li>
            <li> Love product nice and sturdy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the cheapness of the product. Im sure it will only last 1 maybe 2 usages before it will be broken.</li>
            <li> cheap and broken when arrived</li>
            <li> Beautiful. On time delivery</li>
            <li> way too small and comes straight.  When you try to bend into a head band it looks like it is going to break.  It won&#x27;t bend so you can use it as such. Too inflexable</li>
            <li> took too long to get and had to order it twice, not happy</li>
            <li> was smaller than expected, but a part literally just fell off when slightly flexed. very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought myself a pair of these to make a head piece for my wedding. I absolutely loved them!</li>
            <li> Very pretty!! Elegant! Bought for my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s 5th grade dance - beautiful accent</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and beautiful....took too long to receive item, but I wasnt in a hurry</li>
            <li> item looks nice, but very rigid and difficult to apply. not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, beautiful</li>
            <li> A beautiful buy for the price but it&#x27;s so fragile, the wire can be broken easily. Be very careful when handling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful headband that can be worn for an evening out.  It is bendable to any shape head.</li>
            <li> You get what you&lt;br /&gt; paid for here</li>
            <li> Very nice and classy .</li>
            <li> very nice and very sturdy</li>
            <li> It was broken but an easy fix. It was so beautiful .</li>
            <li> A little heavy, but the are gorgeous and looked great on my daughter for her wedding</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful product. Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail and was pleasantly suprised, it is absolutely beautiful and I was lucky and there were no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, looks just like picture</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. Will not stay on head. Save your money on this one</li>
            <li> Took a while to ship, it&#x27;s nice looking not sure how it will look in my hair until I try it in an up-do.</li>
            <li> Received too late. Oh well, still pretty</li>
            <li> nice product for the price</li>
            <li> here was a crystal that feel off i had to get a new one and glue it on</li>
            <li> Came bent and is missing a piece... You can see the glue all around the other pieces.. And it is just very flimsy... Ordered this for my wedding and now I probably won&#x27;t use it cause it looks bad... I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Made her more beautiful and that is hard.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but doesn&#x27;t come with anything to tie it on with, but can use some ribbon I have.</li>
            <li> Love the hair piece my wedding was awesome</li>
            <li> its very nice and elegant I like how it stays in my hair. Just seems very delicate and will break easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  pretty, but it is a piece of crap. It broke into pieces after i tried it on for the first time. It is very brittle.</li>
            <li> Took A long time to get it but love it!!</li>
            <li> I put an elastic band to hold this, because it doesn’t have one, but with it and some pins it was perfect. I wear it to attend a wedding and it was lovely paired with my dress and earnings.</li>
            <li> never buy this item, received with broken pieces, and emailed to seller and never get respond back.</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I bent it to fit around my head.  Get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> The second I opened this I thought it was very pretty but it completely fell apart after 5 minutes.  Not worth buying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this. Make sure you look at the close up.  There is a flower that is broken off in multiple places and looks as if it was fixed to be that way but wasn&#x27;t intended to be that way at first.  It would have been a super cute accessory but for those that pay attention to detail, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the peice for you.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  Was going to be a hair accessory for my 5 year old as a flower girl.  Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with it now.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but I have to find a band to make it stay in my hair. Also it was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> very nice it comes very stiff i had to take my time to bend it  to sit in place but other than that it is very beautiful</li>
            <li> Poor material. Broke into pieces at first try.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty but has nothing to support it staying in your hair&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how that could sell this without having it attached to a comb or something</li>
            <li> This is beautiful! I am SO excited to wear it for my wedding!</li>
            <li> item came from Chna which added extra time to shipment but worth the wait..stunning accessory</li>
            <li> it was damage it&#x27;s not what I was expected to see, don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> This piece was very beautiful. I wish I could get married again so I could use it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, easy to bend to the shape I want and easy to pin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!! I love it. It looks better in person. I was very happy with my purchase. I was impressed with the quality and design. THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, going to buy another!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken in 2 places and is very hard would not work as a head band. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> fell apart when I took it out of the bag</li>
            <li> as promised, pretty and flexible, love it</li>
            <li> It came bent in an envelope and it left a weird kink in the middle of the piece. I never go the kink out and had to use my hair to hide it.  It looked good in photos though and was worth the  price I paid. It is a heavy piece so make sure you have a hair stlye that you can use lots of pins to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered several of these to attach to one another and create a flower crown. They are flexible and I was able to create a BEAUTIFUL crown without issue, and in a matter of minutes. This product isn&#x27;t amazing, but it is quite pretty and well worth the price to me. My reason for deducting a star: one rhinestone popped off of one piece while I was working on it. I don&#x27;t foresee a problem gluing it back on and it doesn&#x27;t even matter since that particular setting is facing inward after twisting the pieces together, but I still don&#x27;t like it when stuff breaks, even $5 jewelry.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but it has taken more than 18 days to arrive GA state !</li>
            <li> Very cheap made. On of The &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; fell off the moment we took it out the box.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to even figure out how to put this in my hair yet.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this head band on me! Very pretty. Fran</li>
            <li> I did not like this item at all it&#x27;s a heavy piece and will not fit to your head you would have to use a lot of pins just to get it to stay on your head</li>
            <li> I expected a headband.  It was straight and when I tried to bend it to put on my head (it attaches with Bobby pins I guess ) I thought it would break.</li>
            <li> It was good for about 4 $</li>
            <li> Received it and ill was broken. Does not have a comb or anyway to fix it into your hair. It was pretty though. Poorly made. I will weld it and weld a comb to it.  ;)</li>
            <li> Love it, only thing is im very cautious with it because I dont want it to detach while bending it but other than that its beautiful exactly as in the picture. Took a while to reach but it was worth it</li>
            <li> The quality is better than pic, and very good but it broken as soon as i touched;(&lt;br /&gt;so sad....</li>
            <li> absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> it I so beautiful but I got angry when it came broken. a flower piece was not connected to the rest of the headband. I wasn&#x27;t mad at first because I thought I could fix it like I usually fix my other broken headbands, howver this one was different!  after a piece of the headband was broken I still tried it on but it looked akward. when I took it off it fell and broke more. its a shame because it looked BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> it broke after 1 day never even got to use it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is gorgeous, but it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;. You basically have to bend it into shape and then add pins. It is absolutely beautiful when you get it secured into your hair. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re having an up-do for your event or wedding.</li>
            <li> I still do not understand how to wear it.  It is just a metal strip with flours on it and two holes on the ends.  It also get&#x27;s caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> just got this acessory the price was good the downside was that when I opened it  was broken so obviously that was the downside</li>
            <li> Cheaply made broke trying to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, one use thing.</li>
            <li> pieces broke off and it looks nothing like it did in the pictures i just threw it away</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my wedding. I decided not to wear a veil so I wanted something really pretty that didn&#x27;t break the bank. Lots of compliments on my hair and hairpeice</li>
            <li> Beautiful, spectacular</li>
            <li> It totally fell apart before we could even get it in my hair, so NOT worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The headband is quite pretty, but it is very cheaply made. It was packaged so poorly! It was folded in half in a tiny little envelope with nothing to protect it. When I tried to straighten it out after I received it, it was left with a huge dent in center. It will not lie flat and the wire is so thin that I&#x27;m afraid to try too hard in case it breaks. I suppose for the cost, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Thought this piece would have some sort of comb or clips attached to it to help keep it in hair but I am sure I will figure it out</li>
            <li> It came bent in a Wierd angle so it&#x27;s kind of hard to work out the smooth final circular product. In Addition two of the pearls were on the bottom of the bag before I opened it. I thought oh cool replacement pieces but no just that they feel off the original... Super glue I love you. It&#x27;s cute n for the price can&#x27;t complain too much. Just be creative to stick it in your hair I just used a dollar store thin headband stuck it in the holes and slipped it on. Voila. Headband.</li>
            <li> I was buy it for my wedding . But when I  receive it . It is a straight,it is not useful，when I try to bent it can put in my Hair ， it is broken . It is really can not use . How do I use it is like Hard strip . It is very hard . How to put in the hair . Before I see it . I think it is very simple that you can do this style then move on your head ,but when I get it very hard . Can not use .</li>
            <li> U get what you pay for. It&#x27;s cheap, flimsy and feels like it would break super easy.i don&#x27;t even understand how I&#x27;d put this in my hair. I will not be wearing this on my wedding day! Glad I only wasted 4 bucks on it.</li>
            <li> This is nice! But have not many ways to put it on!!!!</li>
            <li> thank you very much, very cute</li>
            <li> came early and looked just like the picture</li>
            <li> Just beautiful and classy. The headband is durable and just enough elegance.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it came on time and it&#x27;s just how it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the products where wrapped and packaged very safely to prevent damage and bending.  My dissatisfaction with this product perhaps comes from my own misconception.  I bought six of these, intending that my daughter&#x27;s bridal party would all wear matching hair styles with this decoration their hair.  Although it is well made, study and appears to be of good quality, it is NOT a complete head piece as it looked to me in this picture.  It covers only half the head.  So, if that meets YOUR needs it is an awesome find for you,  If it doesn&#x27;t. move on and look harder.  We wound up cutting them into smaller pieces, using the large cluster on the end as an accent to the hair bun on the back of their head.  Looked great, but wasn&#x27;t what we originally wanted from it.</li>
            <li> Looks just like picture, however it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my finace..........</li>
            <li> Looks really great - classy.  Fantastic, choice.</li>
            <li> I love it was very lovely on bride&#x27;s maids</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Wore this for my 30 year vow renewal!</li>
            <li> You will need to clip it down with something, it comes as one flat piece that you have to mold and then clip down.  The big part where there are two big flowers touching is one big flat piece which might not be a problem if you are a blockhead.  I, however, am not so I could not get it to look right anywhere on my head (so I never even got to the point of figuring out how to pin it down.</li>
            <li> kind of flimsy so handle carefully, but quite pretty</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s pretty. It&#x27;s not the greatest quality, however, since I&#x27;m only going to wear it for one or two days, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for that. As the quality is not great, it won&#x27;t last forever - it IS made in China. But it is really pretty. It&#x27;s heavier than I thought, so I&#x27;ll have to figure out a good way to secure it onto my head. I have really thin hair so there&#x27;s not much to clasp onto. The whole thing is on a metal line which bends, so you can shape it to your head. However, if you bend too much, some of the metal flower pieces might break off (peel off), so you have to be careful not to overbend it. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s really pretty. :)   Oh, and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Upside: you can bend the wire so it isn&#x27;t too tight if that is normally a head band issue for you. Looks pretty from a distance. Flexible wire means you can use it multiple ways. Wire is sturdy enough to bend back into shape, though I was cautious not to over bend.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: the band doesn&#x27;t bend uniformly due to the spots where the decorations are connected to the band. Also it looks pretty from a distance but up-close the pearls are obviously plastic. Took a little while to arrive from China.&lt;br /&gt;Why I am giving it 4 stars: It was pretty cheep so I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations.</li>
            <li> This shipped as fast as it could being international.  I ordered it for my wedding, which it camr in time for. Unfortunately my hairdresser had a hard time manuvering it on my head with the style we were going with. Fortunately, I can use it in my hair whenever I want though, because it is quite lovely!</li>
            <li> This is very nice accesorie, I love it because I can adjust to different hair styles, is not heavy.</li>
            <li> thing broke 1 week later.bad quality .</li>
            <li> Defective item shipped!!!</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to receive, but it arrived exactly as described in the pictures!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!! It didn&#x27;t make it here in time for my wedding but I ordered it late. So pretty, wish I&#x27;d seen it to order sooner!</li>
