    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Tried them all for thinning hair and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Purchasing Nioxin on Amazon is a great savings of about $14.00 and having Prime I don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but it does the job.</li>
            <li>good price and shipped promptly</li>
            <li>A good price, too.</li>
            <li>So far, still the best if you notice hair falling in the sink.  </li>
            <li>Have used Nioxin products for many years, like it and will continue.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair with visibly thinning in the front</li>
            <li>Have been using Nixon system 2 for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Every wash my hair feels clean and full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that truly has been somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older woman and my hair is fine</li>
            <li>Shampoo is nice and has a pleasant faint scent.</li>
            <li>If I wanted shiny straight hair, this would be just right.</li>
            <li>It really does stop hair from falling out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner before, and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo for thin, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>With fine hair after a few uses your hair will not look clean because of build up.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this shampoo and think it is good for my hair and scalp - seems I have less hair loss.</li>
            <li>A bonus is that a little bit of cleanser gets my hair clean without taking too much color out.</li>
            <li>Some shampoos make my hair too soft but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My family has very thin and fine hair and this helps keep me with a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old female and my hair stylist turned me onto this product line about 5 years ago.</li>

            <li> My hair does look thicker, and it seems to stay looking thicker all day long.</li>
            <li> Per my dermatologist I use a small amount of the Rogaine Foam once a day which does grow hair, but being that the foam is for men, and as a woman I have to be very careful where I put it and not use to much because I&#x27;ll end up with fascial hair.</li>
            <li> but I find that the Bosley hair products will dry my hair out</li>
            <li> Nothing will grow back all lost hair, but this one can slow it way down to a level you can live with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> My thin hair is naturally curly but this makes it straighten out.</li>
            <li> and I truly believe if I had not been using this product I&#x27;d have even less hair in the front.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for at least 2 years.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> good price and shipped promptly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> So far, still the best if you notice hair falling in the sink.  It really does stop hair from falling out. Whenever I go  to another product, I always need to come back to this.  I&#x27;m an older woman and my hair is fine--I need to keep every strand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner before, and really like it. A good price, too.</li>
            <li> Every wash my hair feels clean and full. It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Have used Nioxin products for many years, like it and will continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old female and my hair stylist turned me onto this product line about 5 years ago. I have baby fine hair with visibly thinning in the front and I truly believe if I had not been using this product I&#x27;d have even less hair in the front.  It doesn&#x27;t grow in hair but it helps keep what I do have. I also use the conditioner. To mix things up I will trade off with the Bosley hair system which does the same thing as Nioxin but I find that the Bosley hair products will dry my hair out so I&#x27;ll use it for a month maybe a couple times in a year. Per my dermatologist I use a small amount of the Rogaine Foam once a day which does grow hair, but being that the foam is for men, and as a woman I have to be very careful where I put it and not use to much because I&#x27;ll end up with fascial hair. Yikes!  Purchasing Nioxin on Amazon is a great savings of about $14.00 and having Prime I don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for years.  My family has very thin and fine hair and this helps keep me with a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is nice and has a pleasant faint scent. My thin hair is naturally curly but this makes it straighten out. If I wanted shiny straight hair, this would be just right.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair and leaves it soft without weighing it down.  Also does not strip the color out of my hair.</li>
            <li> product works as described in my case; stops the loss of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Nioxin products.  With fine hair after a few uses your hair will not look clean because of build up.  This product I have been using for years and it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that truly has been somewhat effective. Nothing will grow back all lost hair, but this one can slow it way down to a level you can live with. Tried them all for thinning hair and this is the best. The rest are just ineffective hype.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nixon system 2 for fine hair. After I start coloring my hair, I changed to system 4. It reserves color and prevent hair loss like system 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo for thin, color-treated hair.  Have used it for at least 2 years.  Some shampoos make my hair too soft but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for about three weeks. My hair does look thicker, and it seems to stay looking thicker all day long.All in all the product is working as promised.A bonus is that a little bit of cleanser gets my hair clean without taking too much color out.</li>
            <li> Product description is deceptive, it is 10.1 ounces.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this shampoo and think it is good for my hair and scalp - seems I have less hair loss.</li>
            <li> There is what I order it!</li>
