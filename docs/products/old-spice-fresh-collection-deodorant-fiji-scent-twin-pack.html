    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on well, lasts all day and like the smell.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of the deodorant but it seems to only last 6-8 hours. while im used to 12-24 hour protection of other brands.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the smell of the Fiji scent. Having said that this product directly caused chemical burns that hurt a lot and took a while to heal once I stopped use of this product. I have since switch to Dove Mens+ Care and could not be happier. I was told that Dove Mens+ Care does not have the ingredient that causes the the chemical burns. This Old Spice Product should not be sold to the public.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed to receive Anti-Perspirant and not Deodorant as advertised</li>
            <li> I like the solids more, I never feel fully dry with this kind of deodorant but it&#x27;s a preference maybe for some. I do like the old spice but I&#x27;ll stick to the powder / dry.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and loves it.  We both like the scent and he prefers deodorant alone (vs. antiperspirant and deodorant), so this is a great fit for him.  He has been using Old Spice and found he likes this scent and the Original.  So if you&#x27;re looking to try a new scent and already like Original, give this a try.  This is on our Subscription list so he never runs out.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I seek this particular brand and scent out every time now.  The only reason there are any negative reviews is because those people seemed to get the wrong one, but apparently Amazon has fixed that problem because I got the correct deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Found it in the grocery store and now I get it in here for the best price around.</li>
            <li> I orderd 10 (2 separate orders) of the Old Spice ANTI-PERSPIRANT &amp; DEODORANT only to get OLD SPICE Deodorant (not anti-perspirant AND deodorant).  Now I have to ship back, very irritating.  This is what happened to me last November (2011) also (I was lucky my local Kmart allowed me to exchange even thou I bought it thru Amazon).  This is so frustrating.  Now for the pruduct (the right product) it is the best AP/Deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> Really like this line of products.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to deodorant. I love the Fiji scent. I tried the white, &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; variety and didn&#x27;t like how that one felt or how it left residue on my shirt. No such problems with this one.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough to cover up any bad smells. I put it on daily and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my husband and I use it too</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy deodorant online without being familiar with the scent, but I&#x27;m too lazy to go to the store and I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  Best Old Spice I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Used the first time 4/13/15. So far no armpit gremlins have begun, like crazy itching or rash :)</li>
            <li> It makes you spell good.</li>
            <li> Nice new scent at a value size- a double bonus.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents from Old Spice. My husband smells great! He is sensitive to many other deodorants, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out.</li>
            <li> Great price. My teens love this deodorant and scent. Like the two pack...one for home and one for the backpack.</li>
