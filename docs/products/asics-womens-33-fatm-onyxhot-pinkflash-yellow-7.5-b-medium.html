    <ol>
            <li>Works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It is superb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and years, it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Its great for getting rid of ants and great for my dogs sesitive skins.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>....and a great lotion too.</li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>Started using it to keep insects away  and continued to use it all year because it was so good .</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Unlike most insect repellents, it smells good!</li>
            <li>I use it for repelling bugs, and did still seem to be effective in doing that.</li>
            <li>It was nice finding it here rather than trying to find someone else to buy it from</li>
            <li>totally thrilled to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, effective, and pleasant smelling without an odor to offend.</li>
            <li>She had tried many products.</li>
            <li>This is the most functional.</li>
            <li>I noticed one or two bites at most.</li>
            <li>I like it better for that than use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE that it moisturizes my skin and keeps the mosquitos away . . .</li>
            <li>I have always used this product for more than 10 years as a mosquito repellant .</li>
            <li>It is the best product for curing dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Better than deet and easy on the skin too.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it so easy for me to get whatever I need (or want), and using the *PRIME* service you don&#x27;t have to wait for days and days for delivery.</li>
            <li>so soft lotions I have loved for many</li>
            <li>And it goes on so smooth with no greassy left-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 94 yr old grandmother who knows good quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original smell.</li>
            <li>I made sure to slather it all over our 16 month old and he was bite free the whole vacation.</li>
            <li>we actually got this to put on our dogs for fleas but it make then so soft to they are silky and smells great</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion, but i didn&#x27;t really like it, the original one has been discontinued and i can&#x27;t find it anymore</li>
            <li>This quality helps it to spread easily all over my skin, and makes my skin extremely soft without being sticky.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was because it was so hot when it arrived to me.</li>
            <li>, i suffer from very dry skin, this one made me breakout at times, but overall it was still pretty good</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, no problems, just what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li>It really seemed to work for a while.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I was suffering from insect bites (it turned out to be bird mites) and this stuff really helped keep them off me and made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I live in the country and would not be without it.</li>
            <li>She knows what works and doesnt fall for the new smell ideas.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it .</li>
            <li>This is a product that I totally love but have had a hard time purchasing because I don&#x27;t have access to an Avon rep at this time.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all and what it does have does not last.  </li>
            <li>i have used skin so soft all my life</li>
            <li>My husband is from the south and when we go visit his family I get eaten alive.</li>
            <li>So, for what is intended for, soft skin, yes it works.</li>
            <li>Out 3 year old pot belly pig, loves this stuff, seems to keep his skin from cracking and pealing.&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>
            <li>No other lotion I have tried compares .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if the bottle was old or if it was the extreme heat, but the product didn&#x27;t have the usual strong eucalyptus smell of SSS.</li>
            <li>To trip, I used skin so soft and only had an issue the one time I went outside without it.</li>

            <li> It also still maintained it&#x27;s extreme moisturizing qualities, that quite literally make my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t noticed mosquitos in southern CA in a long time).</li>
            <li> Its smell reminded me of flat soda.</li>
            <li> Shipping was not cheap but clearly was used as a profit point for the seller from the snail pace shipping used.</li>
            <li> Works good for dry skin and keeps the mosquitos away without applying repellent to our skin.</li>
            <li> UPS tracking only states it shipped on May 14 and is due to arrive by June 4!!  </li>
            <li> but since using this, the bites have been extremely lowered.</li>
            <li> I plan to bring at least 2 bottles with me next year.</li>
            <li> Even after cooling down it never regained</li>
            <li> Lotion is very thin, does not soften skin very well.  </li>
            <li> Beware!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have the actual product my rating is mearely on past usage of the same product purchased elsewhere and the poor business practices of the seller.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d hate the smell but its really quite soft and not as noticeable as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I was a little grossed out by the fact that there was hair and what appeared to be sand under the packing tape.</li>
            <li> I think if you applied the lotion a few times a day every day (I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as that)</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands and elbows which get dry and scaly from working outside in the wind and cold.</li>
            <li> Unlike other lotions, which I find thick, waxy, and difficult to spread, SSS is extremely watery and thin.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for at least 30 years .</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you want an alternative to harsh mosquito repellent; apparently Avon took that ingredient out and put it in another product.</li>
            <li> Worse part for me is I thought it would help keep bugs away.  </li>
            <li> If you want a thin moisturizer that smells like grandma, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few lotions that bugs hate and it keeps them off me.</li>
            <li> how can you go wrong with that?</li>
            <li> I always thought it was crazy that a lotion could repel bugs</li>
            <li> The disappointment has come in from the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product on May 12.</li>
            <li> Bug repellent, yes it works as well !</li>

            <li> All Avon skin so soft lotions I have loved for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Very silky, non greasy product this is on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave&lt;br /&gt;residue on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, no problems, just what I ordered and needed. I use it when I work outside. It is one of the few lotions that bugs hate and it keeps them off me. I live in the country and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so soft.  I always thought it was crazy that a lotion could repel bugs but since using this, the bites have been extremely lowered.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time.  It is the best product for curing dry skin.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 94 yr old grandmother who knows good quality. She knows what works and doesnt fall for the new smell ideas. She had tried many products. This is the most functional. Works good for dry skin and keeps the mosquitos away without applying repellent to our skin.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very thin, does not soften skin very well.  Worse part for me is I thought it would help keep bugs away.  It does not.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all and what it does have does not last.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Will use forever! This product soothes the skin without a greasy finish. It is gentle, effective, and pleasant smelling without an odor to offend.</li>
            <li> I brought this with me to Italy to help prevent getting bit by mosquitos (I haven&#x27;t noticed mosquitos in southern CA in a long time). It really seemed to work for a while. I noticed one or two bites at most. One bottle lasts about a month. I think if you applied the lotion a few times a day every day (I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as that) it would work well. I plan to bring at least 2 bottles with me next year.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep mosquitos away. I like it better for that than use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i have used skin so soft all my life and i LOVE that it moisturizes my skin and keeps the mosquitos away . . . how can you go wrong with that?</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I am looking for. Its great for getting rid of ants and great for my dogs sesitive skins.</li>
            <li> My husband is from the south and when we go visit his family I get eaten alive. To trip, I used skin so soft and only had an issue the one time I went outside without it. I made sure to slather it all over our 16 month old and he was bite free the whole vacation. I thought I&#x27;d hate the smell but its really quite soft and not as noticeable as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Does not keep mesquitos away as I was told. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> This product came in the heat of summer. The seller had used packing tape over the bottle to keep the lotion from leaking en route. I was a little grossed out by the fact that there was hair and what appeared to be sand under the packing tape. I can&#x27;t say if the bottle was old or if it was the extreme heat, but the product didn&#x27;t have the usual strong eucalyptus smell of SSS. Its smell reminded me of flat soda. I thought maybe it was because it was so hot when it arrived to me. Even after cooling down it never regained it&#x27;s original smell. I use it for repelling bugs, and did still seem to be effective in doing that. It also still maintained it&#x27;s extreme moisturizing qualities, that quite literally make my skin so soft. It&#x27;s the only lotion I will use. Unlike other lotions, which I find thick, waxy, and difficult to spread, SSS is extremely watery and thin. This quality helps it to spread easily all over my skin, and makes my skin extremely soft without being sticky.</li>
            <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s oily and leaves a sheen. I use it on my hands and elbows which get dry and scaly from working outside in the wind and cold. Works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for at least 30 years . Started using it to keep insects away  and continued to use it all year because it was so good . Can&#x27;t live without it . No other lotion I have tried compares .</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of it&#x27;s reputation of keeping the Mosquitoes  from biting in the Florida Keys. Yes it works, not just a Urban legend. So, for what is intended for, soft skin, yes it works. Bug repellent, yes it works as well !</li>
            <li> I have always used this product for more than 10 years as a mosquito repellant . It is superb. iMY  relative used to recommend it to me and sell it to me also.</li>
            <li> we actually got this to put on our dogs for fleas but it make then so soft to they are silky and smells great</li>
            <li> If you want a thin moisturizer that smells like grandma, this is for you. Don&#x27;t get this if you want an alternative to harsh mosquito repellent; apparently Avon took that ingredient out and put it in another product.</li>
            <li> I use this every night. This is a great product.  I highly recommend it!  What do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> I was suffering from insect bites (it turned out to be bird mites) and this stuff really helped keep them off me and made my skin so soft.  Unlike most insect repellents, it smells good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and years, it is a wonderful product. And it goes on so smooth with no greassy left-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Amazon makes it so easy for me to get whatever I need (or want), and using the *PRIME* service you don&#x27;t have to wait for days and days for delivery.</li>
            <li> I got some of this from an ex-coworker who sold Avon some time ago.  It was nice finding it here rather than trying to find someone else to buy it from</li>
            <li> Used it for years...good stuff. One thing about the Avon lady...ya&#x27; don&#x27;t have to write a dissertation to leave a critique.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion, but i didn&#x27;t really like it, the original one has been discontinued and i can&#x27;t find it anymore, i suffer from very dry skin, this one made me breakout at times, but overall it was still pretty good</li>
            <li> Out 3 year old pot belly pig, loves this stuff, seems to keep his skin from cracking and pealing.&lt;br /&gt;Wife sez her hands are smoother from rubbing it on the pig</li>
            <li> ....and a great lotion too. Used it during my trip to Hawaii. Better than deet and easy on the skin too.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I totally love but have had a hard time purchasing because I don&#x27;t have access to an Avon rep at this time.&lt;br /&gt;Was totally thrilled to find this on Amazon.  The disappointment has come in from the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product on May 12. As of today, May 21 the item has not been received.  UPS tracking only states it shipped on May 14 and is due to arrive by June 4!!  Unbelievable! Contact the seller, no response! Shipping was not cheap but clearly was used as a profit point for the seller from the snail pace shipping used. Beware!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have the actual product my rating is mearely on past usage of the same product purchased elsewhere and the poor business practices of the seller.</li>
