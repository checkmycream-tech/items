            <li>arrived on time and the price was great for a pack of three lasted forever.</li>
            <li>It does not do miracles, but it is a good product (good ingredients), at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li>It works great and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I am loving this!</li>
            <li>This product is priced well, arrived in great time however if you have severe or fairly severe acne</li>
            <li>This is a favorite with our teenagers--not greasy, does not leave marks or residue in the tab, and very pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>This body wash was awesome and does not have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a good soap for people with body breakouts, although it is not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li>Its a good soap.</li>
            <li>Read good reviews about this stuff</li>
            <li>Might be good for someone else, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Good value if you subscribe for auto delivery.</li>
            <li>It is a good cleanser, but not too drying.</li>
            <li>Although must be balanced with a good soap &amp; moisturizer</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>what I DO think this is good for is PREVENTING additional ones from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is GREAT and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>and im glad i did!</li>
            <li>I can wear my strapless tops and dresses confidently again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love a pre-emptive multi-purpose skincare product!</li>
            <li>The scent was definitely more pleasant, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s medicinal scent however the consistency was like water.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing</li>
            <li>Did nothing to help our acne issues, neither hers nor my own infrequent pimple or two.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>And i found that almost none of them were effective.....</li>
            <li>its effective and</li>
            <li>Product works great and smells wonderful, I&#x27;ve been having problems with back blemishes</li>
            <li>Really good body wash for acne, seems to work better if you use some kind of body scrubber and leave it in about a minute.</li>
            <li>I find this exceptional for anykind of skin problem most times you can get results in a week.</li>
            <li>To make things even better it did so in about two weeks or so all with a pleasant smell that is enjoyable even for a guy, which I am.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very happy and we are ready to order more in case run out...</li>
            <li>This is a great mild acne soap.</li>
            <li>It has a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Very strong, makes me taste it.</li>
            <li>It gave me smooth, shiny (in a good way) skin, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my blemishes.  </li>
            <li>We were hesistant to purchase this product and go for something like Proactive, but he has sensitive skin so this option seemed perfect!</li>
            <li>The most effective thing for me is Sun + Swimming (chlorine) --</li>
            <li>and I would still recommend using it, but Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash is much more effective in my case and from now on I will be using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this lightly scented, highly effective product.</li>
            <li>It has very nice light clean smell.  </li>
            <li>but now he seems to be getting more acne, so</li>
            <li>This of course made for even more lather than it inherantly provided.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Phisoderm better...</li>
            <li>Added to that PHISODERM smells better</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>I knew there was no way I would be able to afford that</li>
            <li>When I found this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would work.</li>
            <li>But I am really glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my pores rise just a tad, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this soap, but everytime I order 1 of the 3 soaps always leaks (all 4 times ive order this).</li>
            <li>Although you get 12 oz, you end up using more because it comes out so watery.  </li>
            <li>Have bought more than once and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>and I like this better.  </li>
            <li>You get 12oz instead of the 8.5oz with the Neutrogena for a better price.</li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, I would definitely recommend it...</li>
            <li>I called in once about it, and the Customer Service representative was most helpful.    </li>
            <li>The soap feels like it has more salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li>We love this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely</li>
            <li>Otherwise, love the product.</li>
            <li>I found I get better results by just using my facewash on my arms.</li>
            <li>Infact after I have stopped using it my breakouts have increased even more.</li>
            <li>It seemd like no matter what I did, it wouldn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>This product has been able to keep my skin at a better pH balance and prevented this from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m an engineer -- how&#x27;d you guess?  :)</li>
            <li>that combo is like magic for clearing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and okay job.</li>
            <li>It also seems to work better on my face than my body for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>I purchased Phisoderm about a month ago hoping to get better results.</li>
            <li>She is now requesting we stock up with more.</li>
            <li>If anything, my blemishes have become more irritated and pronounced.  </li>
            <li>The product delivers the results most of us are looking for (anti-blemish).</li>
            <li>My acne is clearing up nicely and I love the clean scent.</li>
            <li>It does leave you feeling very clean...</li>
            <li>It smells great and is light and won&#x27;t leave too much scent on your sking.</li>
            <li>amazing product and shipped so quick</li>
            <li>Great to help clear up blemishes on skin.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a product to clear up body blemishes and lathers great, and phisoderm has deffently work for me</li>
            <li>Smells nice, unisex fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>this seemed to really have a clean feeling after scrubbing well, a nice smell to go along with it too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this product a full five stars because its cheaper!</li>
            <li>Easy refund for item through Amazon.com, though.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too powerful or overwhelming which bothers me about many products.</li>
            <li>to put on easy to wash off easy to use</li>
            <li>Although it feels very mild, you can feel that it is help with the blemishes.</li>
            <li>but as I mentioned in the title, it has a really strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong bodywash to rid all of your acne</li>
            <li>It appears to be clearing her skin just fine after about 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a prevention and maintenance product for medium to mild acne.  </li>
            <li>I used it once and my skin feels very smooth and it smells so fresh...</li>
            <li>You get three huge bottles of the stuff.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t felt this comfortable in my skin in forever.</li>
            <li>Great for the shower and daily use.</li>
            <li>However, for its relatively cheap price tag and the differences it did make, I believe I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li>but the scent is light and not too feminine</li>
            <li>Also they used to offer this for $10 for 3 with free shipping when I ordered it before</li>
            <li>You get a discount, and free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing: clears sweat &amp; light dust in one lather &amp; rinse (as from running &amp; biking).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that has worked for me; I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>I was concerned with my skin at the time and thought i needed to be more aware of what was in my body wash.</li>
            <li>It is great for oily skin or if you have acne, but still has some moisturizers that don&#x27;t leave you feeling dry and scaly.</li>
            <li>In an attempt to clean it up, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena and Zenmed.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t let the water rinse it off right away)!  </li>
            <li>It also smells really nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>We have hard, salty, city water and this stuff still lathers wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I actually got complements how good the skin on my face looked about a week after I started using it.</li>
            <li>Simply, the best product available for fighting bacne (acne on the back)!</li>
            <li>From my experience I can say that salicylic acid based products are much more effective than benzoyl peroxide products, which dry your skin a lot and may cause skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up quickly even when using well water.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product is too mild to do anything.</li>
            <li>Again mild acne</li>
            <li>This is a mild body wash and you do not have to use a lot in order to create a good lather, which is good because it is rather thin.  </li>
            <li>Will update at a later time to confirm whether my acne has completely vanished or if it makes a return, but first impressions are very good.</li>
            <li>So Much!!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth giving this wash a try if you&#x27;re oily like me.</li>
            <li>If I do break out, which is RARELY</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve tried, after a few months it seems like it stops working as effectively.</li>
            <li>plus that backwasher is golden.  </li>
            <li>But, the result is worth it.</li>
            <li>but then how effective can a product be with such infrequency?   </li>
            <li>Defiantly worth getting.</li>
            <li>The fragrance on this product is very mild, which I like because i am often allergic to ones that are highly scented.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations after reading so many positive reviews and immediately ordered this product.</li>
            <li>Each bottle was individualy wrapped no mess:)</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal used of this body wash since I first tried it about 8-9 years ago as a teenager.</li>
            <li>THis product is serious excellent and really does work.</li>
            <li>In a week I&#x27;m gonna right another review...</li>
            <li>and he was right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing: FAST and extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and clean!</li>
            <li>if this product was worth it, he&#x27;s still on the first bottle</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>good product, but is now two ounces less per bottle and price per bottle went up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and no problems from this seller.</li>
            <li>I saw that laureth sulfate was pretty close to the end of the ingredient list (on most cleansers, it&#x27;s toward the top) and that one of the main ingredients was aloe vera with salicylic acid being the active ingredient</li>
            <li>It smells fairly neutral, a little flowery maybe.</li>
            <li>But you have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day.</li>
            <li>We will know more later.    </li>
            <li>He is washing his face with it too, and it was working pretty well,</li>
            <li>So, I will most likely purchase more here at Amazon because no one locally sells it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores and this really helped calm my backne during the summer months.</li>
            <li>This body wash definitely works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews on it and got worried that my back would break out more or nothing would help.</li>
            <li>glad I did because I already see such an improvement</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the company would choose such a potent fragrance and not mention it in the description.</li>
            <li>I first learned about Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, because a surgeon recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I bought this three pack about two years ago and only now do I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s viscosity is very low, close to water so there is always a chance of taking more out of the bottle than you want.  </li>
            <li>I think it leaved his skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>His acne has slowly diminished and he&#x27;s happy with it</li>
            <li>I finally gave this a try, and it has made them go away, something no doctor was ever able to do, ironically.     </li>
            <li>The product seemed to work at first.   </li>
            <li>So, ok, its does the job also expecially on my back.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, its the only things that works on my skin without drying me out.</li>
            <li>this will actually irritate your skin more.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought new laundry detergent it was called Tide Free and gentle for senstive skin..</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to use, but other than that</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be too good to be true, an acne body wash that was half the cost of the big name items.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried looking up ProActiv body wash, but when I saw how much money it cost</li>
            <li>I tried quite a few other washes and this one is probably the best I have used.</li>
            <li>This product has alwys left a clean fresh feeling for your skin.  </li>
            <li>My current regimen right now is Tide Free and Gentle to wash my clothes with...</li>
            <li>I wish I bought only 1 instead of 3, but I highly doubt I&#x27;ll wait til I finish all 3 before returning to my good old trusted Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a regular body wash, but it doesn&#x27;t accomplish what it claims.</li>
            <li>Lingers in bathroom beyond shower time too, so it is very bothersome to me.</li>
            <li>I ended up really liking it and</li>
            <li>That said, it does foam really well.</li>
            <li>it is watery and comes out of the bottle fast.)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had anything get rid of my acne so fast and keep it away.     </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product to anyone having an issue with body acne.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the Neutrogena which was minimal.</li>
            <li>After twelve years of using it, I switched to Cetaphil Gentle liquid soap.</li>
            <li>It is, however, VERY watery.</li>
            <li>I tried all of the anti-acne body washes and never made it through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I asked my dermatologist why my face is breaking out so much</li>
            <li>It is the only thing vie found that keeps my scalp free of sores.  </li>
            <li>This has a really light scent and leaves my skin moisturized while treating the blemishes on my back.</li>
            <li>value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am subscribed and managed to fit in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>So, i would really recommend this product to my friends and anyone.</li>
            <li>Neither of them really cleared up my problem.</li>
            <li>Gentle but thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>But you blink and the whole bottle is gone</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it&#x27;s not too harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin.</li>
            <li>Lets see if it would clear my skin!!!</li>
            <li>I love how just a little product lathers up so much!</li>
            <li>It leaves my body nice and clean without feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li>I used it every single time I showered (which is almost every day) and my back looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and it clears the breakouts pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective this is since I am using it with another product</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective this product is since I am using it with another product.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is as effective as everyone says it is</li>
            <li>I do still get an occasional pimple but not nearly as bad as my skin was before.</li>
            <li>and I love the consistency... slightly liquid.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance and got this over the more expensive products.</li>
            <li>It did a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product considering the reviews, but if it does nothing it does nothing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and this was so highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week very thoroughly, and so far 0 results.    </li>
            <li>This product really does make a difference in the clarity of my skin and it rinses off completely.</li>
            <li>For better application, after you have soaped up, leave it on your skin for as long as possible</li>
            <li>I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first, but after reading all the good reviews about it, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount to get a good lather</li>
            <li>I rarely get breakouts on my body, though they come back if I run out and use something else.</li>
            <li>my daughter has not complained about the smell or anything else about it.  </li>
            <li>It definitely takes some time to clear you skin even for mild acne.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is different from most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, decent smell, and leaves the body feeling clean with no real residue.</li>
            <li>Right product, but unfortunately only 1 bottle in box rather than the three that is described.</li>
            <li>Some times I still break out and other times, it is smooth for a while.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent new acne from coming up, but it does get rid of all the scars and blemishes they leave.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>A complete no brainer!</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well and barely has a smell to it.</li>
            <li>product has also become a favorite as a facial wash in the house among other members here that have had acne problems..</li>
            <li>turn around, soap the other, and the first side will be all rinsed without any special extra effort.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely watery, so it really pours right out of bottle onto body sponge &amp; of course, the floor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the phisoderm body wash for the acne on my back for a year or two by the time i finished the first bottle it was completely clear</li>
            <li>and this is very soothing and does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>It tookma dose of strong antibiotic for a few week, then phisoderm after thatnto keep theses at bay.     </li>
            <li>I am 19 years old with VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I admit buying this product online is very costly as I live outside US.</li>
            <li>I have used many different body washes trying to get rid of my chronic backne, but none had worked previously to Phisoderm.  </li>
            <li>I tire of my back periodically breaking out during certain times of the month....</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after I developed a large cystic pimple on my back which I had to go to the derm to have it drained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have him stop to see if things clear up.      </li>
            <li>So i realize that I needed acne body wash... plus senstive skin laundry detergent and AHA lotion to keep my skin clear.    </li>
            <li>And nothing seemed to clear it up.</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks, the darker ones have started to clear.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say, compared to neutrogena body clear body wash, which I used to use before</li>
            <li>Like others have said it does clear everything up by the end of your 1st bottle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff, and my bacne started to clear up within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I still have scars, but over time, my dermatologist said they will clear up.</li>
            <li>So I just stopped using it until I was clear.</li>
            <li>This soap helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>(Neither did Neutrogena Clear Body Wash).</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used the Phisoderm for about a week and so far, no rash.  </li>
            <li>Got this for very acne-laden teen daughter &amp; also used for myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can even use it to wash my face and it cleans off all the dirt and makeup without causing me to flake.</li>
            <li>, phisoderm makes my skin feel soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase again as it is cheaper now than when I purchased and I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>I use this with a sensitive skin astringent and the results have allowed me to wear v-necks again.</li>
            <li>Non-scented but not \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; non-scented</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and healthier.</li>
            <li>I think of this body wash as an exfoliant to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to completely get rid of it either though.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me since a little went a long way and seems to be more beneficial than using alot.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean without harsh drying effects.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t notice any particular scent to it, so it can be used by any sex.     </li>
            <li>I still have the occasional spot and when that happens, I just make sure to scrub that area a little extra with the body wash and within a day or 2</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to use as much because my skin isn&#x27;t too dry.</li>
            <li>It is hard to fine in stores.</li>
            <li>It seems odd that I&#x27;d order 3...will have to be more careful in future</li>
            <li>I have a few comments on the other aspects of this soap, but most of it&#x27;s been said before or is a matter of taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much completely cleared up the face, very minimal effect on my back.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would finally clear up the blemishes on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li>Second, it just didn&#x27;t clear up my arm acne</li>
            <li>I used to get occasional break outs on my shoulders and this body wash cleared them up and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 13 year old who is having back &amp; chest acne.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped my acne, but it has cleared me up 70% which says a lot to me considering all the different cleansers I&#x27;ve tried and the fact that part of my problem with acne is hormonal.</li>
            <li>It has not entirely rid my backne, but it has made a marked improvement.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from acne on my back and face and even though i figured this wouldn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li>used this when i was really young then recently found it again.</li>
            <li>Only downside we have learned you really need to lather it on and sit with it on skin for several minutes prior to rinsing to get ultimate benefit.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells nice and is very thin.</li>
            <li>It rinses off so much easier than any other soap I&#x27;ve used that I can soap one side,</li>
            <li>Did not dry my skin at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married in a few months and</li>
            <li>product does not really have a heavy smell like other salicidic acid washes do and I have been able to use it without irritation to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a very, very long time - and since my beauty regime is very simple (face wash, natural facial oil at night and sunscreen for day)</li>
            <li>My whole life I have had little bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>I use this daily to treat/prevent occasional body acne breakouts, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell like other acne bodywashes.  </li>

            <li> Good value if you subscribe for auto delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser, but not too drying.</li>
            <li> Although must be balanced with a good soap &amp; moisturizer</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>

            <li> This is GREAT and my skin has never looked better.  </li>

            <li> and im glad i did!</li>
            <li> I can wear my strapless tops and dresses confidently again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love a pre-emptive multi-purpose skincare product!</li>
            <li> The scent was definitely more pleasant, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s medicinal scent however the consistency was like water.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing</li>
            <li> Did nothing to help our acne issues, neither hers nor my own infrequent pimple or two.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> And i found that almost none of them were effective.....</li>
            <li> its effective and</li>
            <li> Product works great and smells wonderful, I&#x27;ve been having problems with back blemishes</li>
            <li> Really good body wash for acne, seems to work better if you use some kind of body scrubber and leave it in about a minute.</li>
            <li> I find this exceptional for anykind of skin problem most times you can get results in a week.</li>
            <li> To make things even better it did so in about two weeks or so all with a pleasant smell that is enjoyable even for a guy, which I am.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very happy and we are ready to order more in case run out...</li>
            <li> This is a great mild acne soap.</li>
            <li> It has a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Very strong, makes me taste it.</li>
            <li> It gave me smooth, shiny (in a good way) skin, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my blemishes.  </li>
            <li> We were hesistant to purchase this product and go for something like Proactive, but he has sensitive skin so this option seemed perfect!</li>
            <li> The most effective thing for me is Sun + Swimming (chlorine) --</li>
            <li> and I would still recommend using it, but Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash is much more effective in my case and from now on I will be using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this lightly scented, highly effective product.</li>
            <li> It has very nice light clean smell.  </li>
            <li> but now he seems to be getting more acne, so</li>
            <li> This of course made for even more lather than it inherantly provided.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Phisoderm better...</li>
            <li> Added to that PHISODERM smells better</li>
            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> I knew there was no way I would be able to afford that</li>
            <li> When I found this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would work.</li>
            <li> But I am really glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my pores rise just a tad, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, but everytime I order 1 of the 3 soaps always leaks (all 4 times ive order this).</li>
            <li> Although you get 12 oz, you end up using more because it comes out so watery.  </li>
            <li> Have bought more than once and will buy again.  </li>
            <li> and I like this better.  </li>
            <li> You get 12oz instead of the 8.5oz with the Neutrogena for a better price.</li>
            <li> It is okay.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I would definitely recommend it...</li>
            <li> I called in once about it, and the Customer Service representative was most helpful.    </li>
            <li> The soap feels like it has more salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells lovely</li>
            <li> Otherwise, love the product.</li>
            <li> I found I get better results by just using my facewash on my arms.</li>
            <li> Infact after I have stopped using it my breakouts have increased even more.</li>
            <li> It seemd like no matter what I did, it wouldn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> This product has been able to keep my skin at a better pH balance and prevented this from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m an engineer -- how&#x27;d you guess?  :)</li>
            <li> that combo is like magic for clearing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and okay job.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work better on my face than my body for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I purchased Phisoderm about a month ago hoping to get better results.</li>
            <li> She is now requesting we stock up with more.</li>
            <li> If anything, my blemishes have become more irritated and pronounced.  </li>
            <li> The product delivers the results most of us are looking for (anti-blemish).</li>
            <li> My acne is clearing up nicely and I love the clean scent.</li>
            <li> It does leave you feeling very clean...</li>
            <li> It smells great and is light and won&#x27;t leave too much scent on your sking.</li>
            <li> amazing product and shipped so quick</li>
            <li> Great to help clear up blemishes on skin.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a product to clear up body blemishes and lathers great, and phisoderm has deffently work for me</li>
            <li> Smells nice, unisex fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> this seemed to really have a clean feeling after scrubbing well, a nice smell to go along with it too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a full five stars because its cheaper!</li>
            <li> Easy refund for item through Amazon.com, though.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too powerful or overwhelming which bothers me about many products.</li>
            <li> to put on easy to wash off easy to use</li>
            <li> Although it feels very mild, you can feel that it is help with the blemishes.</li>
            <li> but as I mentioned in the title, it has a really strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong bodywash to rid all of your acne</li>
            <li> It appears to be clearing her skin just fine after about 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a prevention and maintenance product for medium to mild acne.  </li>
            <li> I used it once and my skin feels very smooth and it smells so fresh...</li>
            <li> You get three huge bottles of the stuff.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t felt this comfortable in my skin in forever.</li>
            <li> Great for the shower and daily use.</li>
            <li> However, for its relatively cheap price tag and the differences it did make, I believe I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> but the scent is light and not too feminine</li>
            <li> Also they used to offer this for $10 for 3 with free shipping when I ordered it before</li>
            <li> You get a discount, and free shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing: clears sweat &amp; light dust in one lather &amp; rinse (as from running &amp; biking).  </li>
            <li> This is a great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has worked for me; I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned with my skin at the time and thought i needed to be more aware of what was in my body wash.</li>
            <li> It is great for oily skin or if you have acne, but still has some moisturizers that don&#x27;t leave you feeling dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to clean it up, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena and Zenmed.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t let the water rinse it off right away)!  </li>
            <li> It also smells really nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> We have hard, salty, city water and this stuff still lathers wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I actually got complements how good the skin on my face looked about a week after I started using it.</li>
            <li> Simply, the best product available for fighting bacne (acne on the back)!</li>
            <li> From my experience I can say that salicylic acid based products are much more effective than benzoyl peroxide products, which dry your skin a lot and may cause skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up quickly even when using well water.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product is too mild to do anything.</li>
            <li> Again mild acne</li>
            <li> This is a mild body wash and you do not have to use a lot in order to create a good lather, which is good because it is rather thin.  </li>
            <li> Will update at a later time to confirm whether my acne has completely vanished or if it makes a return, but first impressions are very good.</li>
            <li> So Much!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth giving this wash a try if you&#x27;re oily like me.</li>
            <li> If I do break out, which is RARELY</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve tried, after a few months it seems like it stops working as effectively.</li>
            <li> plus that backwasher is golden.  </li>
            <li> But, the result is worth it.</li>
            <li> but then how effective can a product be with such infrequency?   </li>
            <li> Defiantly worth getting.</li>
            <li> The fragrance on this product is very mild, which I like because i am often allergic to ones that are highly scented.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations after reading so many positive reviews and immediately ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Each bottle was individualy wrapped no mess:)</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal used of this body wash since I first tried it about 8-9 years ago as a teenager.</li>
            <li> THis product is serious excellent and really does work.</li>
            <li> In a week I&#x27;m gonna right another review...</li>
            <li> and he was right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing: FAST and extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and clean!</li>
            <li> if this product was worth it, he&#x27;s still on the first bottle</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li> good product, but is now two ounces less per bottle and price per bottle went up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and no problems from this seller.</li>
            <li> I saw that laureth sulfate was pretty close to the end of the ingredient list (on most cleansers, it&#x27;s toward the top) and that one of the main ingredients was aloe vera with salicylic acid being the active ingredient</li>
            <li> It smells fairly neutral, a little flowery maybe.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day.</li>
            <li> We will know more later.    </li>
            <li> He is washing his face with it too, and it was working pretty well,</li>
            <li> So, I will most likely purchase more here at Amazon because no one locally sells it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in stores and this really helped calm my backne during the summer months.</li>
            <li> This body wash definitely works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on it and got worried that my back would break out more or nothing would help.</li>
            <li> glad I did because I already see such an improvement</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the company would choose such a potent fragrance and not mention it in the description.</li>
            <li> I first learned about Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, because a surgeon recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I bought this three pack about two years ago and only now do I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s viscosity is very low, close to water so there is always a chance of taking more out of the bottle than you want.  </li>
            <li> I think it leaved his skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> His acne has slowly diminished and he&#x27;s happy with it</li>
            <li> I finally gave this a try, and it has made them go away, something no doctor was ever able to do, ironically.     </li>
            <li> The product seemed to work at first.   </li>
            <li> So, ok, its does the job also expecially on my back.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, its the only things that works on my skin without drying me out.</li>
            <li> this will actually irritate your skin more.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought new laundry detergent it was called Tide Free and gentle for senstive skin..</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use, but other than that</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be too good to be true, an acne body wash that was half the cost of the big name items.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried looking up ProActiv body wash, but when I saw how much money it cost</li>
            <li> I tried quite a few other washes and this one is probably the best I have used.</li>
            <li> This product has alwys left a clean fresh feeling for your skin.  </li>
            <li> My current regimen right now is Tide Free and Gentle to wash my clothes with...</li>
            <li> I wish I bought only 1 instead of 3, but I highly doubt I&#x27;ll wait til I finish all 3 before returning to my good old trusted Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a regular body wash, but it doesn&#x27;t accomplish what it claims.</li>
            <li> Lingers in bathroom beyond shower time too, so it is very bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> I ended up really liking it and</li>
            <li> That said, it does foam really well.</li>
            <li> it is watery and comes out of the bottle fast.)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything get rid of my acne so fast and keep it away.     </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product to anyone having an issue with body acne.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the Neutrogena which was minimal.</li>
            <li> After twelve years of using it, I switched to Cetaphil Gentle liquid soap.</li>
            <li> It is, however, VERY watery.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the anti-acne body washes and never made it through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist why my face is breaking out so much</li>
            <li> It is the only thing vie found that keeps my scalp free of sores.  </li>
            <li> This has a really light scent and leaves my skin moisturized while treating the blemishes on my back.</li>
            <li> value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am subscribed and managed to fit in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> So, i would really recommend this product to my friends and anyone.</li>
            <li> Neither of them really cleared up my problem.</li>
            <li> Gentle but thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> But you blink and the whole bottle is gone</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it&#x27;s not too harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin.</li>
            <li> Lets see if it would clear my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I love how just a little product lathers up so much!</li>
            <li> It leaves my body nice and clean without feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I used it every single time I showered (which is almost every day) and my back looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and it clears the breakouts pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective this is since I am using it with another product</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective this product is since I am using it with another product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is as effective as everyone says it is</li>
            <li> I do still get an occasional pimple but not nearly as bad as my skin was before.</li>
            <li> and I love the consistency... slightly liquid.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance and got this over the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product considering the reviews, but if it does nothing it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and this was so highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week very thoroughly, and so far 0 results.    </li>
            <li> This product really does make a difference in the clarity of my skin and it rinses off completely.</li>
            <li> For better application, after you have soaped up, leave it on your skin for as long as possible</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first, but after reading all the good reviews about it, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to get a good lather</li>
            <li> I rarely get breakouts on my body, though they come back if I run out and use something else.</li>
            <li> my daughter has not complained about the smell or anything else about it.  </li>
            <li> It definitely takes some time to clear you skin even for mild acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is different from most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, decent smell, and leaves the body feeling clean with no real residue.</li>
            <li> Right product, but unfortunately only 1 bottle in box rather than the three that is described.</li>
            <li> Some times I still break out and other times, it is smooth for a while.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent new acne from coming up, but it does get rid of all the scars and blemishes they leave.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> A complete no brainer!</li>
            <li> It lathers up really well and barely has a smell to it.</li>
            <li> product has also become a favorite as a facial wash in the house among other members here that have had acne problems..</li>
            <li> turn around, soap the other, and the first side will be all rinsed without any special extra effort.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely watery, so it really pours right out of bottle onto body sponge &amp; of course, the floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the phisoderm body wash for the acne on my back for a year or two by the time i finished the first bottle it was completely clear</li>
            <li> and this is very soothing and does not dry me out.</li>
            <li> It tookma dose of strong antibiotic for a few week, then phisoderm after thatnto keep theses at bay.     </li>
            <li> I am 19 years old with VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I admit buying this product online is very costly as I live outside US.</li>
            <li> I have used many different body washes trying to get rid of my chronic backne, but none had worked previously to Phisoderm.  </li>
            <li> I tire of my back periodically breaking out during certain times of the month....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I developed a large cystic pimple on my back which I had to go to the derm to have it drained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have him stop to see if things clear up.      </li>
            <li> So i realize that I needed acne body wash... plus senstive skin laundry detergent and AHA lotion to keep my skin clear.    </li>
            <li> And nothing seemed to clear it up.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, the darker ones have started to clear.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say, compared to neutrogena body clear body wash, which I used to use before</li>
            <li> Like others have said it does clear everything up by the end of your 1st bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff, and my bacne started to clear up within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I still have scars, but over time, my dermatologist said they will clear up.</li>
            <li> So I just stopped using it until I was clear.</li>
            <li> This soap helps keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> (Neither did Neutrogena Clear Body Wash).</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used the Phisoderm for about a week and so far, no rash.  </li>
            <li> Got this for very acne-laden teen daughter &amp; also used for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can even use it to wash my face and it cleans off all the dirt and makeup without causing me to flake.</li>
            <li> , phisoderm makes my skin feel soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again as it is cheaper now than when I purchased and I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> I use this with a sensitive skin astringent and the results have allowed me to wear v-necks again.</li>
            <li> Non-scented but not \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; non-scented</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and healthier.</li>
            <li> I think of this body wash as an exfoliant to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to completely get rid of it either though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me since a little went a long way and seems to be more beneficial than using alot.  </li>
            <li> Rinses clean without harsh drying effects.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t notice any particular scent to it, so it can be used by any sex.     </li>
            <li> I still have the occasional spot and when that happens, I just make sure to scrub that area a little extra with the body wash and within a day or 2</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to use as much because my skin isn&#x27;t too dry.</li>
            <li> It is hard to fine in stores.</li>
            <li> It seems odd that I&#x27;d order 3...will have to be more careful in future</li>
            <li> I have a few comments on the other aspects of this soap, but most of it&#x27;s been said before or is a matter of taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty much completely cleared up the face, very minimal effect on my back.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would finally clear up the blemishes on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li> Second, it just didn&#x27;t clear up my arm acne</li>
            <li> I used to get occasional break outs on my shoulders and this body wash cleared them up and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 13 year old who is having back &amp; chest acne.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped my acne, but it has cleared me up 70% which says a lot to me considering all the different cleansers I&#x27;ve tried and the fact that part of my problem with acne is hormonal.</li>
            <li> It has not entirely rid my backne, but it has made a marked improvement.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from acne on my back and face and even though i figured this wouldn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> used this when i was really young then recently found it again.</li>
            <li> Only downside we have learned you really need to lather it on and sit with it on skin for several minutes prior to rinsing to get ultimate benefit.  </li>
            <li> The soap smells nice and is very thin.</li>
            <li> It rinses off so much easier than any other soap I&#x27;ve used that I can soap one side,</li>
            <li> Did not dry my skin at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in a few months and</li>
            <li> product does not really have a heavy smell like other salicidic acid washes do and I have been able to use it without irritation to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a very, very long time - and since my beauty regime is very simple (face wash, natural facial oil at night and sunscreen for day)</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had little bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to treat/prevent occasional body acne breakouts, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell like other acne bodywashes.  </li>
            <li> My back acne is pretty bad and a bit cystic, though it would all go away using this with with a strong spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked any better than the other two, maybe even slightly worse.</li>
            <li> This is a body wash that once you clear your skin (took about 1 1/2 weeks for me), you can maintain by using it every other day instead of every day (saves you money).</li>
            <li> Since high school, I have had a lot of trouble fighting acne on my back (and sometimes chest would break out too).</li>
            <li> It also seems to last a fairly long time, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m constantly going through it.</li>
            <li> I have minor occasional acne break outs on my back.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who has suffered with back acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased Neutrogena&#x27;s Body Clear body wash to help with my husband&#x27;s body acne.  </li>
            <li> peroxide soaps and body washes and creams and only thing they did was dry my skin and did not clear acne.</li>
            <li> The only downside is, like other people have said, if I use anything else, my breakouts seem to come back.</li>
            <li> So far no break outs just little blemishes here</li>
            <li> and my skin is almost spotless and i only spent 9 bucks on it.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally very oily and during the summer months its even worse, so this product dried up the oily placed fast.</li>
            <li> As a long term acne (on face) sufferer, I do understand that some products just dont work for some.</li>
            <li> (so long as your Doctor approves).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to have to say it&#x27;s a little to soon to say good or bad about this.</li>
            <li> I found that other products after continual use would actually start to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B001EUS62Y Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit, 8.5 Ounces]]for couple of years which did help a little</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bottle is smaller that your average body-wash bottle and you end up going through it quickly so it could get expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more of a liquid than I expected, but a little goes a LONG way - I barely use any of it each time as it suds up like crazy.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin</li>
            <li> However, my skin all over started to become irritatingly dry.</li>
            <li> I was also worried it would dry my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can shower over and over and my skin will neither dry out nor</li>
            <li> so the chances of it slipping out of your hands and landing on your big toe is minimal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any single improvement since then.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t done that, and it has limited the amount of breakouts I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Also, a bottle lasts a long time (about 6-8 months when used daily) because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, but I tried Phisoderm because it was cheaper (12 oz</li>
            <li> First, I felt that the consistency of this was really thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistency is somewhat like water and if you drop it in the tub, you will loose some product.</li>
            <li> a year and a half later, still rely on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed it helping with my slight scars on my shoulders.     </li>
            <li> Years later the packaging looks different, but I&#x27;m hoping it works as well as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> Less acne on my back since I have been using it there.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re not used to such a thin soap you may waste a lot of it at first.</li>
            <li> instead I broke out more and with knobby painful blemishes...</li>
            <li> I bought this randomly because I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that cleaned my oily Italian skin without really drying me out to work.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about the smell, but it&#x27;s really not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> (Be careful with this stuff.....</li>
            <li> the bottles are roughly $7</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never really had this problem before</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read it carefully.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for roughly one week</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months and there is absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Not much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never had trouble with sensitive skin, so it must be really harsh.  </li>
            <li> The only time it sort of dries is during winter when I&#x27;m less oily but the rest of the year, it&#x27;s a charm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products with no results, so I was pretty skeptical of this Phisoderm stuff.</li>
            <li> Its not a very powerful anti-blemish wash.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking to see if any other products can do the job.</li>
            <li> No complaints other than price.  </li>
            <li> the other stuff cost me 50 bucks.</li>
            <li> way before the the other stuff I was using.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 months or so and am definitely going to re-order when I run out.</li>
            <li> I started using this because all other body washes made me break out and to was embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 1 month now, and I have no more pimples on my back.</li>
            <li> So reduce the usage to every other day.</li>
            <li> Then I began to use it over other day.</li>
            <li> This brand makes me feel cleaner than other comparable brands (neutragena)</li>
            <li> also do triathlons, which means I take 2~3 showers a day due to training.  </li>
            <li> They both have 2% salicylic acid as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It also helps with dry itchy skin by exfoliating dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that I have to buy it online because it is not available in stores near me.</li>
            <li> It is tough on my sensitive skin and leaves a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> First of all, the price of $15 for a total of 36oz is not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve not seen anyone else bring up yet is that this soap actually speeds up showering (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t heavy with scent and you don&#x27;t have to choose between smelling like chemicals or pink grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other acne type body washes, like proactive, that dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, and sadly it did not deliver.</li>
            <li> I timed it a few times and I save about 3~5m over my previous soap.  </li>
            <li> , I see little to no effect.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I want to wait a little longer to see if it continues to work for me.</li>
            <li> Since puberty, I&#x27;ve had problems with acne, and while the acne on my face has mostly cleared up in the past few years (I&#x27;m 22), my back is just riddled with the nasty things.</li>
            <li> as a tip to phisoderm, people will think your product is fragrance-free or maybe faintly scented when you have a clear liquid and market as being pH balanced)</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce skin irritations and breakouts while not feeling harsh or abrasive.    </li>
            <li> Another waste of time, hope, and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to update this review in a few weeks/months once I see the end results.</li>
            <li> Any smell this may have is wasted away with the soap.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble with scalp sores for years till I discovered phisoderm.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now as an everyday soap.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on heavy dirt --</li>
            <li> not available in canada.</li>
            <li> It cleared acne in just few washes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing because I&#x27;ve been looking around for a decent body wash for a while now</li>
            <li> I really get bad breakouts when it is that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I gave up on dealing with harsher drying cleansers because no matter what, I&#x27;m still an oil slick by mid-day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i will buy again</li>
            <li> I noticed my acne disapearing at an almost unbelievable rate.   </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works overtime</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the past, but then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with body acne before until this past summer.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would smell terrible like most acne body washes, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Using this had no notable effect on my acne.</li>
            <li> Works ok, the way they were shipped was terrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from body acne for the past 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find other than online.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to completely rinse out of sponge.</li>
            <li> Its also hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> However, at least it didn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li> Alot of reviewers complained about it being watery.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t work as well as Neutrogena in terms of controlling acne, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Usually at least one bottle is leaked when I received the package.  </li>
            <li> i was at least hoping it would lessen the severity a bit, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> sucks</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean, it is truly unscented.</li>
            <li> been a long time since I was really dirty.</li>
            <li> and there nothing serious.    </li>
            <li> I was seriously amazed</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> If your acne problem is bad go with a different option.</li>
            <li> Kids are teenagers and are breaking out badly and this product seems to help the breakout on their back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I used to have really bad back acne and breakouts on my chest.</li>
            <li> Too bad its availability is so limited.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make anything worse, but it doesn&#x27;t fix anything either.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this 3 times, and am sad that Amazon no longer carries this product.</li>
            <li> As for its anti-blemish quality, I would say it was mediocre.</li>
            <li> John skillman     Dekalb ill</li>
            <li> They either smelled horrible or made my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d attempt to avoid the break out by cutting off the cycle..</li>
            <li> One day I got sick of it and just started doing extentive research just for products for my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: mildly unpleasant medical/herbal tang,</li>
            <li> I had bad bacne.</li>
            <li> While I did not have a bad case of body acne, I did tend to break out a bit after I worked out and it was annoying.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the scent.</li>
            <li> but when I do it&#x27;s awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This body wash does work. But you have to use it consistently and don&#x27;t miss a day. And I does not start working off the get go. It definitely takes some time to clear you skin even for mild acne.</li>
            <li> This product has alwys left a clean fresh feeling for your skin.  It lathers up quickly even when using well water.  It has helped reduce skin irritations and breakouts while not feeling harsh or abrasive.    I reccommend this product</li>
            <li> Right product, but unfortunately only 1 bottle in box rather than the three that is described. Easy refund for item through Amazon.com, though.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased Neutrogena&#x27;s Body Clear body wash to help with my husband&#x27;s body acne.  He used it a couple of days and ended up with a rash.  He&#x27;s never had trouble with sensitive skin, so it must be really harsh.  He&#x27;s used the Phisoderm for about a week and so far, no rash.  His back appears to be clearing up.  We will know more later.    I orginally purchased this for my son-because he was starting to get body acne.  It seems to be working for him too.  He is washing his face with it too, and it was working pretty well, but now he seems to be getting more acne, so I&#x27;m going to have him stop to see if things clear up.      Either way, both of them have cleaned up the acne on their bodies and that is what this is meant for.  So, I will most likely purchase more here at Amazon because no one locally sells it (purchased it at a drug store in another town when visiting my mother).</li>
            <li> Just got it today... I used it once and my skin feels very smooth and it smells so fresh... In a week I&#x27;m gonna right another review... Lets see if it would clear my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 13 year old who is having back &amp; chest acne.  When he uses it the product works great! His blemishes are cleared within a day or two and if he used it consistantly he would have no acne at all.  I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be too good to be true, an acne body wash that was half the cost of the big name items.  So glad I took a chance and got this over the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference in body acne after using this product for several months. I will keep looking to see if any other products can do the job.</li>
            <li> Got this for very acne-laden teen daughter &amp; also used for myself. Did nothing to help our acne issues, neither hers nor my own infrequent pimple or two. This is extremely watery, so it really pours right out of bottle onto body sponge &amp; of course, the floor. This of course made for even more lather than it inherantly provided. Very difficult to completely rinse out of sponge. Worst of all, the scent. Very strong, makes me taste it. Lingers in bathroom beyond shower time too, so it is very bothersome to me. However, at least it didn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this randomly because I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that cleaned my oily Italian skin without really drying me out to work. I gave up on dealing with harsher drying cleansers because no matter what, I&#x27;m still an oil slick by mid-day. I saw that laureth sulfate was pretty close to the end of the ingredient list (on most cleansers, it&#x27;s toward the top) and that one of the main ingredients was aloe vera with salicylic acid being the active ingredient so I gave it a shot. I ended up really liking it and a year and a half later, still rely on it! It leaves my body nice and clean without feeling tight and dry. It also has a nice smell. The only time it sort of dries is during winter when I&#x27;m less oily but the rest of the year, it&#x27;s a charm! It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can even use it to wash my face and it cleans off all the dirt and makeup without causing me to flake. I use an spf moisturizer afterward anyway but I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to use as much because my skin isn&#x27;t too dry. It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped my acne, but it has cleared me up 70% which says a lot to me considering all the different cleansers I&#x27;ve tried and the fact that part of my problem with acne is hormonal. One bottle lasts a while too. It&#x27;s worth giving this wash a try if you&#x27;re oily like me.</li>
            <li> The phisoderm body wash is great.  I have all of my kids using it.  If you are prone to breakouts...  this stuff is wonderful.  Subscribe and Save is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Does nothing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week very thoroughly, and so far 0 results.    I still am getting acne along my arms and shoulders.    Another waste of time, hope, and money. I&#x27;ll use the rest of the product even though it&#x27;s not going to do anything. I had high hopes for this product considering the reviews, but if it does nothing it does nothing.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap for people with body breakouts, although it is not a miracle cure. The soap smells nice and is very thin. It&#x27;s consistency is somewhat like water and if you drop it in the tub, you will loose some product. That said, it does foam really well. Its a good soap.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores and this really helped calm my backne during the summer months.</li>
            <li> My husband have severe body blemish since a teenager. I bought this for myself and he started to use it too...we saw obvious improvement on his body blemish for about 2 weeks...He&#x27;s very happy and we are ready to order more in case run out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had body acne for years!!! I&#x27;ve tried all the body wash products MURAD, OXY, Neutrogena.. And i found that almost none of them were effective..... After years and years i finally found what the problem was... It was my laundry detergent! I went ahead and bought new laundry detergent it was called Tide Free and gentle for senstive skin.. And it cleared me up within weeks! After figuring out that it was my laundry detergent that was causing my body acne especially my back acne i tried to get rid of body wash to save money.. Acne came back!!! So i realize that I needed acne body wash... plus senstive skin laundry detergent and AHA lotion to keep my skin clear.    Anyways i found that all of the bodywash work the same! I like Neurogena and Phisoderm the best... But since Phisoderm is cheaper and has the same ingredients as the Neutrogena body wash I prefer Phisoderm better... Added to that PHISODERM smells better and they&#x27;ve also added the extra Vitamin E, Aloe &amp; Chamomil. So PHISODERM is the winner for me! Neutrogena smelled like chemicals too me! They had the grapefruit too but im a guy!     So if you&#x27;ve suffered from body acne for years and tried all the products try looking at your laundry detergent too..... That might be the cause. My current regimen right now is Tide Free and Gentle to wash my clothes with... I also sleep shirtless... Then i use PHISODERM for my body wash and AM LACTIN (AHA) as my lotion/moisturizer.. So far no break outs just little blemishes here and there nothing serious.    I&#x27;ve given this product a full five stars because its cheaper! its effective and the smell is just really good! With the added Vitamin E, Aloe &amp; Chamomile! This is definately work five stars! salicylic acid and ph balanced! i love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years. I haven&#x27;t seen any single improvement since then. I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> This body wash definitely works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It smells nice, it&#x27;s not too harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin. It leaves skin soft and it clears the breakouts pretty well. The price is great and it works too!</li>
            <li> Read good reviews about this stuff so I bought it and im glad i did! It has helped my bacne So Much!! I will use this stuff forever!</li>
            <li> Since high school, I have had a lot of trouble fighting acne on my back (and sometimes chest would break out too). I went to the doctors and they would prescribe me with all types of lotions, body washes, etc. And nothing seemed to clear it up. After going through the years of being too embarrassed to wear tanktops, summer dresses, etc. I decided to stop going to the doctors and try and find something that will ACTUALLY work. At first I tried looking up ProActiv body wash, but when I saw how much money it cost I knew there was no way I would be able to afford that (I&#x27;m a college student trying to pay back my loans etc). When I found this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would work. I read a lot of reviews on it and got worried that my back would break out more or nothing would help. But I am really glad I took the risk. After paying what was not even a lot of money and was a deal (comes with 3 bottles) my back cleared up within the next two weeks. I was seriously amazed and I haven&#x27;t felt this comfortable in my skin in forever. I used it every single time I showered (which is almost every day) and my back looks amazing. My sister has even complimented on it saying that she wants to buy it for her husband because he fights the same trouble of back-acne. If I do break out, which is RARELY, it&#x27;s like ONE TINY blemish/pimple, but goes away literally within that week. THis product is serious excellent and really does work. It also smells really nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. Definitley a buy.</li>
            <li> Had a breakout after using. Might be good for someone else, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I am loving this! Smells great and works! I have always had body acne (on mmy chest and back) and this has worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I have been using Phisoderm for about a month and have  been happy with the results.  I have used many different body washes trying to get rid of my chronic backne, but none had worked previously to Phisoderm.  It has not entirely rid my backne, but it has made a marked improvement.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective this is since I am using it with another product but it seems to work great.  It doesn&#x27;t over-dry your skin either.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bottle is smaller that your average body-wash bottle and you end up going through it quickly so it could get expensive.  I only use it once a day and use a regular body-wash if i have to take a second shower that day.  Seems to work great though.  No complaints other than price.  Not sure if i will buy again only b/c I am not sure how effective this product is since I am using it with another product. However, my skin is clearing up greatly.  i would recommend it for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and it did not do anything what so ever. i also purchased the facial wash as well and that also did not do anything at all. so i bought Clearasil acne facial wash and i use that for my back and face and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and my skin is almost spotless and i only spent 9 bucks on it. the other stuff cost me 50 bucks. I would say not to buy this but everyone&#x27;s skin reacts different to it so its up to you.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would finally clear up the blemishes on my chest and back.  I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit Body Wash; went through 2 bottles.  It gave me smooth, shiny (in a good way) skin, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my blemishes.  After 3 weeks of using phisoderm, I&#x27;ve noticed my lighter blemishes have noticeably cleared up.  After 6 weeks, the darker ones have started to clear.  Alot of reviewers complained about it being watery.  It didn&#x27;t bother me since a little went a long way and seems to be more beneficial than using alot.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars b/c I&#x27;ve noticed my pores rise just a tad, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to update this review in a few weeks/months once I see the end results. However, upon using this product for only 4 days, I can already see results. Since puberty, I&#x27;ve had problems with acne, and while the acne on my face has mostly cleared up in the past few years (I&#x27;m 22), my back is just riddled with the nasty things. I&#x27;ve tried a few different products with no results, so I was pretty skeptical of this Phisoderm stuff. However, in 4 days, using it once a day while showering, my back appears to be rapidly clearing. I&#x27;m simply amazed.  You get three huge bottles of the stuff. It&#x27;s much more of a liquid than I expected, but a little goes a LONG way - I barely use any of it each time as it suds up like crazy. A lot of people complain about the smell, but it&#x27;s really not overpowering.  Will update at a later time to confirm whether my acne has completely vanished or if it makes a return, but first impressions are very good.</li>
            <li> These are an awesome deal for the price. Especially since you can&#x27;t find this anymore.[[ASIN:B000Y038CS Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I appear to have clearer skin after using Phisoderm body wash.  I use it with a loofah.  For better application, after you have soaped up, leave it on your skin for as long as possible (don&#x27;t let the water rinse it off right away)!  Do your body-washing 1st, then hair (fellas).      (Be careful with this stuff.....it is watery and comes out of the bottle fast.)</li>
            <li> This is a great mild acne soap. I recommend using with a 5% - 10% benzoyl peroxide cream for modereate - severe acne sufferers. I really love this soap, but everytime I order 1 of the 3 soaps always leaks (all 4 times ive order this). Do not order with items that can be damaged by this leak - its just a hassle. Great soap though.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, but I tried Phisoderm because it was cheaper (12 oz vs 8 oz for Neutrogena) and supposedly smelled nicer.  The scent was definitely more pleasant, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s medicinal scent however the consistency was like water.  Although you get 12 oz, you end up using more because it comes out so watery.  It also doesn&#x27;t work as well as Neutrogena in terms of controlling acne, at least for me.  I wish I bought only 1 instead of 3, but I highly doubt I&#x27;ll wait til I finish all 3 before returning to my good old trusted Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite with our teenagers--not greasy, does not leave marks or residue in the tab, and very pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use, but other than that, I see little to no effect. I&#x27;ve always had plenty of break out/blemish on my back, using this product doesn&#x27;t help a bit. I use it on my face as well and see no effect either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who&#x27;s body is going threw the teenage years,he says he hasn&#x27;t seen any change so I can&#x27;t really say yet if this product was worth it, he&#x27;s still on the first bottle and he&#x27;s got 3 of them. so I&#x27;m going to have to say it&#x27;s a little to soon to say good or bad about this.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. Have bought more than once and will buy again.  Great to help clear up blemishes on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the phisoderm body wash for the acne on my back for a year or two by the time i finished the first bottle it was completely clear but I can no longer find it in walmart stores...Thank goodness for amazon i got a three pack for $10 in stores the bottles are roughly $7 each so def a bargain.</li>
            <li> Product works great and smells wonderful, I&#x27;ve been having problems with back blemishes and it is something that is very recent for me, I&#x27;ve never really had this problem before so I didn&#x27;t even know where to start so I googled things and came across this, glad I did because I already see such an improvement I can wear my strapless tops and dresses confidently again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now.  While I did not have a bad case of body acne, I did tend to break out a bit after I worked out and it was annoying.  This is a mild body wash and you do not have to use a lot in order to create a good lather, which is good because it is rather thin.  Cannot purchase this wash in any physical store and I like the option of purchasing in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first, but after reading all the good reviews about it, I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve never had anything get rid of my acne so fast and keep it away.     Week 1 - Inflamation was almost unnoticable, on my shoulders, chest, and back.  Week 2 - I noticed my acne disapearing at an almost unbelievable rate.   Week 3 - My acne was almost non-existent.  Week 4 - I&#x27;ve actually noticed it helping with my slight scars on my shoulders.     I absolutely recommend this product to anyone having an issue with body acne. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is different from most products I&#x27;ve tried. I personally don&#x27;t notice any particular scent to it, so it can be used by any sex.     The only downside is, like other people have said, if I use anything else, my breakouts seem to come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months now and I have to say, compared to neutrogena body clear body wash, which I used to use before, phisoderm makes my skin feel soft and moisturized after. My acne is clearing up nicely and I love the clean scent. I give it 4 stars because I want to wait a little longer to see if it continues to work for me. Most products I&#x27;ve tried, after a few months it seems like it stops working as effectively.</li>
            <li> Great for the shower and daily use. My husband uses it for his back,this is the only way I can get him to \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; and care for is skin.</li>
            <li> This has cleared up my husband&#x27;s back acne that he has had for years before he met me.  I ordered this 3 times, and am sad that Amazon no longer carries this product. You can, however, still get it online elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great price for 3 bottles.  It has very nice light clean smell.  I have used the Neutrogena Acne body wash and I like this better.  You get 12oz instead of the 8.5oz with the Neutrogena for a better price. I just started using it so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works overtime but I&#x27;m sure it works as well as the Neutrogena which was minimal. They both have 2% salicylic acid as the active ingredient. I would definitely purchase again as it is cheaper now than when I purchased and I really like the scent. Its also hard to find in the store. I&#x27;ve only seen it at Walgreens and it was over $6.00 there.</li>
            <li> It is okay.  I am using Neutrogena body wash instead.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s \\&quot;anti-blemish\\&quot; properties but as I mentioned in the title, it has a really strong perfume smell. I don&#x27;t know why the company would choose such a potent fragrance and not mention it in the description. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read it carefully. Anyway, just wanted to warn others that unless you are the type to spray yourself 3+ times with perfume every morning, you will definitely not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and as a tip to phisoderm, people will think your product is fragrance-free or maybe faintly scented when you have a clear liquid and market as being pH balanced)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I would definitely recommend it...way before the the other stuff I was using. It does not leave my skin all try...I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> First of all, the price of $15 for a total of 36oz is not too bad at all. The smell is not too powerful or overwhelming which bothers me about many products. This does have aloe in it, so I found it nice after getting a sunburn. :D As for its anti-blemish quality, I would say it was mediocre. Its not a very powerful anti-blemish wash. It does work and help a bit, but doesn&#x27;t take care of everything. It works well for your face though. I actually got complements how good the skin on my face looked about a week after I started using it. All in all, it is not the best anti-blemish wash you can buy. However, for its relatively cheap price tag and the differences it did make, I believe I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and still get acne on my back from time to time.  This stuff is the only soap product i&#x27;ve found that works well on body acne.  I bought a back-washer from Amazon (the Aquis exfoliating one) and this soap plus that backwasher is golden.  If i break out at all, i also use Glytone spray (also on Amazon!).  The combo is lethal on body acne .. try them all out !</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband and son, who both suffer from back acne. They have only used it three times and already I see a big difference in their skin. This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Zit-free back in just 1 week!!!  Buy it with [[ASIN:B000I20Q72 Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber]] and they work wonders!  You can show off your back wherever, whenever!</li>
            <li> I first learned about Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, because a surgeon recommended it.  This body wash was awesome and does not have a strong scent.  I ordered it via subscribe &amp; save.  Usually at least one bottle is leaked when I received the package.  I called in once about it, and the Customer Service representative was most helpful.    Update 2016: The formula in this soap seems different. The soap feels like it has more salicylic acid in it. It is tough on my sensitive skin and leaves a burning sensation. After twelve years of using it, I switched to Cetaphil Gentle liquid soap.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  We use it on our face and on our back.  Smells nice, unisex fresh scent.  Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems with acne - but I still need to wash my face - and it is gentle enough to wash my face using a dime sized bit on my face and save me the trouble of buying a face cleanser every month or so.  Lasts a very, very long time - and since my beauty regime is very simple (face wash, natural facial oil at night and sunscreen for day) - it&#x27;s a home run!</li>
            <li> I was devastated when this was no longer sold in stores. I switched over to Nuetrogena body wash but it just wasn&#x27;t the same. This isn&#x27;t heavy with scent and you don&#x27;t have to choose between smelling like chemicals or pink grapefruit. Any smell this may have is wasted away with the soap. It is, however, VERY watery. In fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thickness is on par with water. You only need a small amount to get a good lather but if you&#x27;re not used to such a thin soap you may waste a lot of it at first. This product really does make a difference in the clarity of my skin and it rinses off completely. No gross filmy feeling or skin irritation after wards.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal used of this body wash since I first tried it about 8-9 years ago as a teenager. I tried all of the anti-acne body washes and never made it through a whole bottle. They either smelled horrible or made my skin feel dry. This is perfect and I hope they never stop making it. It smells lovely (I get compliments all the time and I never wear perfume!) but the scent is light and not too feminine (my boyfriend also uses this). It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and clean! I rarely get breakouts on my body, though they come back if I run out and use something else. My only real complaint is that I have to buy it online because it is not available in stores near me. Also, a bottle lasts a long time (about 6-8 months when used daily) because a little goes a long way. I bought this three pack about two years ago and only now do I need to buy more. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and did what it was supposed to. It cleared my back, chest, and neck of acme. To make things even better it did so in about two weeks or so all with a pleasant smell that is enjoyable even for a guy, which I am. In any case, if you are looking to get rid of body acme and even face acme I would recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have always had acne issues. One day I got sick of it and just started doing extentive research just for products for my troubled skin. I have say I&#x27;ve been using Phisoderm for about 3 months and my upper arms and chest has cleared up and my upper back. I have less breakouts. I really get bad breakouts when it is that time of the month. I am going to stick it out with Phisoderm because I believe it has potentially I just have to be patient with this product. So people if you have problems skins issues give a try and be patient.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product for anyone. Like others have said it does clear everything up by the end of your 1st bottle. Great results!</li>
            <li> I just received this so I will see if it works.  I used to use this in the past, but then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in stores.  Years later the packaging looks different, but I&#x27;m hoping it works as well as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> This product was very effective for my auntie!  She was experiencing a problem with her skin and this product helped to resolve this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never to soon to start thinking about summer tanks and &#x60;backne&#x27;. I love a pre-emptive multi-purpose skincare product! I don&#x27;t get acne often but when I do it&#x27;s awful.  I&#x27;m loving this lightly scented, highly effective product.</li>
            <li> I admit buying this product online is very costly as I live outside US. But, the result is worth it. One week after use, I can notice the difference. Seriously. Now, I can wear tank with confidence.</li>
            <li> It does not do miracles, but it is a good product (good ingredients), at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist why my face is breaking out so much (this was 10 years ago).  He mentioned that I should use Phisoderm and since then my skin is a lot happier.  This product has no smell, something I was looking for.  It&#x27;s viscosity is very low, close to water so there is always a chance of taking more out of the bottle than you want.  Otherwise, love the product.</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old with VERY sensitive skin. I had breakouts on my shoulders and chest. This is a body wash that once you clear your skin (took about 1 1/2 weeks for me), you can maintain by using it every other day instead of every day (saves you money). I do still get an occasional pimple but not nearly as bad as my skin was before. I use this with a sensitive skin astringent and the results have allowed me to wear v-necks again. I love how just a little product lathers up so much! It reduces redness as well and has actually helped reduces razorburn after shaving. Non-scented but not \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; non-scented if you know what I mean, it is truly unscented. I also have dry skin and this is very soothing and does not dry me out. I have been using this for the past 6 months or so and am definitely going to re-order when I run out. This body wash works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have used it for years.  It has become unavailable locally, so this was a terrific find for us.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  Keeps blemishes away and helps with skin condition hidradenitis suppurativa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in a few months and I tire of my back periodically breaking out during certain times of the month....So I thought I&#x27;d attempt to avoid the break out by cutting off the cycle..instead I broke out more and with knobby painful blemishes...nothing I want seen in a strapless dress...thus I&#x27;m off to find another product. Also they used to offer this for $10 for 3 with free shipping when I ordered it before, now I see they&#x27;ve doubled the price.</li>
            <li> Could have sworn I ordered 1 bottle only. It seems odd that I&#x27;d order 3...will have to be more careful in future</li>
            <li> smells and works great&lt;br /&gt;takes careof your acne&lt;br /&gt;great product for great price workss great&lt;br /&gt;easy to put on easy to wash off easy to use</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, and sadly it did not deliver. First, I felt that the consistency of this was really thin. Second, it just didn&#x27;t clear up my arm acne like I had anticipated. I found I get better results by just using my facewash on my arms. So, now I have 2 bottles of this stuff just sitting in my bathroom. I think I&#x27;ll just buy a face wash bar, and use it.</li>
            <li> This comes ina three pack from Amazon. The bottle is not too big so the chances of it slipping out of your hands and landing on your big toe is minimal. It smells great and is light and won&#x27;t leave too much scent on your sking. Lathers wonderfully. Rinses clean without harsh drying effects. I feel smoother and clearer all over... But I don&#x27;t have scientific proof to back that one up. Good value if you subscribe for auto delivery. You get a discount, and free shipping. And it shows up at the doorstep once every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months. A complete no brainer!</li>
            <li> The phisoderm body wash is a great product. It is the only thing vie found that keeps my scalp free of sores.  It was recommended by my dr and he was right. I always had trouble with scalp sores for years till I discovered phisoderm. It tookma dose of strong antibiotic for a few week, then phisoderm after thatnto keep theses at bay.     John skillman     Dekalb ill</li>
            <li> I started using this because all other body washes made me break out and to was embarrassing.  SInce I started using Phisoderm I no longer breakout and my skin feels soft and healthier. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT..!!!!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. I have been using it for roughly one week and I can totally see the blemishes start going away. I have not gotten any me you break out this product is amazing I will continue using it. Very very very happy with this purchase. I would recommend it to anyone who has blemishes I want to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to treat/prevent occasional body acne breakouts, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell like other acne bodywashes.  We found however that this doesn&#x27;t work the same for my teenager, I had to buy a stronger brand to combat his acne.  It works great to help prevent breakouts but if you have existing ones it doesn&#x27;t work so well to get rid of it.  I combine this with the Phisoderm facial wash on my arms to get rid of that stubborn acne.  If you are looking for a strong bodywash to rid all of your acne this probably isn&#x27;t it, it&#x27;s more of a prevention and maintenance product for medium to mild acne.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for severe acne.</li>
            <li> It works great! It doesn&#x27;t prevent new acne from coming up, but it does get rid of all the scars and blemishes they leave.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  body wash. It is a good cleanser, but not too drying. It is great for oily skin or if you have acne, but still has some moisturizers that don&#x27;t leave you feeling dry and scaly. Buying in the pack also saves you money. Very fast shipping and no problems from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with body acne before until this past summer.  It was so embarrassing to put on tank tops or my strapless summer dresses.  I thought about getting the proactive body wash, but decided to give phisoderm body wash a try.  The product doesn&#x27;t work immediately, but after 3-4 weeks, my chest and back acne were gone.  I still have the occasional spot and when that happens, I just make sure to scrub that area a little extra with the body wash and within a day or 2 it is gone.  For the price, this product became the miracle I was looking for and helped get rid of my body acne.</li>
            <li> This has a really light scent and leaves my skin moisturized while treating the blemishes on my back. I have noticed an improvement and will definitely keep on using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allegric to perfumes, so this stuff is great.  Leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  It also helps with dry itchy skin by exfoliating dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> amazing product and shipped so quick</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for controlling acne.  Although must be balanced with a good soap &amp; moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had bad bacne. My dermatologist put me on dioxycycline hyclate, and it didn&#x27;t work. I ordered this stuff, and my bacne started to clear up within 2 weeks. I still have scars, but over time, my dermatologist said they will clear up. I&#x27;ve been using for 1 month now, and I have no more pimples on my back. Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations after reading so many positive reviews and immediately ordered this product. I do have breakouts on my upper arms, elbows and thigh. I used this product for 2 months and there is absolutely no difference. Infact after I have stopped using it my breakouts have increased even more. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The fragrance on this product is very mild, which I like because i am often allergic to ones that are highly scented. Although it feels very mild, you can feel that it is help with the blemishes. Just becareful when you shave, sometimes it can burn!</li>
            <li> I find this exceptional for anykind of skin problem most times you can get results in a week.My dermatologist recommeded this about 4 years ago and i still use it when the skin problem comes back.</li>
            <li> smelled great and makes plenty lather</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who has suffered with back acne for a long time. He loves it! I think it leaved his skin feeling soft and smooth. His acne has slowly diminished and he&#x27;s happy with it and so am I! We were hesistant to purchase this product and go for something like Proactive, but he has sensitive skin so this option seemed perfect!</li>
            <li> Simply, the best product available for fighting bacne (acne on the back)! Too bad its availability is so limited. Very hard to find other than online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for my body and face for over a month now and must say im dissapointed. I suffer from acne on my back and face and even though i figured this wouldn&#x27;t get rid of it completely i was at least hoping it would lessen the severity a bit, but it hasn&#x27;t. Only reason it gets 3 stars is because i actually like it as a body wash. Lathers well, decent smell, and leaves the body feeling clean with no real residue. If your acne problem is bad go with a different option.</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had little bumps on my arms. I finally gave this a try, and it has made them go away, something no doctor was ever able to do, ironically.     The minute I use a different soap, the bumps come back; and the minute I reuse this, they go away.      For me, a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I developed a large cystic pimple on my back which I had to go to the derm to have it drained. The product seemed to work at first.   My skin is naturally very oily and during the summer months its even worse, so this product dried up the oily placed fast. However, my skin all over started to become irritatingly dry. I than began to break out in places I never had pimples. So reduce the usage to every other day. But I still continued to break out. So I just stopped using it until I was clear. Then I began to use it over other day. And guess what?! You bet! Break outs came back. So I stopped using it.  Maybe it will work if I used it once a week? or month? lol but then how effective can a product be with such infrequency?   As a long term acne (on face) sufferer, I do understand that some products just dont work for some. I wish everyone luck!</li>
            <li> My back acne is pretty bad and a bit cystic, though it would all go away using this with with a strong spray.&lt;br /&gt;It only cleaned up a bit of my back, nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a teenager so it&#x27;ll come back now and again.&lt;br /&gt;But this seemed to really have a clean feeling after scrubbing well, a nice smell to go along with it too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It worked but it did not eliminate my problem.&lt;br /&gt;Good product though its just not for my acne though</li>
            <li> Kids are teenagers and are breaking out badly and this product seems to help the breakout on their back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;Good value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other acne type body washes, like proactive, that dried my skin out. This product hasn&#x27;t done that, and it has limited the amount of breakouts I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> Struggled with breakouts on my back and chest for months.  After changes to diet, laundry soap and multiple body washes I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!  We have hard, salty, city water and this stuff still lathers wonderfully.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance. Defiantly worth getting.</li>
            <li> I take immunosuppressant drugs so must use this to keep my skin from developing wounds.  It works great and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I used to have really bad back acne and breakouts on my chest. It seemd like no matter what I did, it wouldn&#x27;t get better. Then I tried this body wash. This is the ONLY product that has worked for me; I LOVE it!! It lathers up really well and barely has a smell to it. I was worried it would smell terrible like most acne body washes, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. I was also worried it would dry my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the perfect balance of acne treatment and a moisturizing body wash. It also seems to last a fairly long time, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m constantly going through it. I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned with my skin at the time and thought i needed to be more aware of what was in my body wash. Their solid. I am subscribed and managed to fit in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Some times I still break out and other times, it is smooth for a while.  Not sure if this is as effective as everyone says it is but maybe it depends on  your skin.</li>
            <li> This brand makes me feel cleaner than other comparable brands (neutragena) and I love the consistency... slightly liquid. I think of this body wash as an exfoliant to keep my skin soft. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have clogged pores that benefit from this. It is hard to fine in stores. Not much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I know you don&#x27;t buy a product solely on how it smells.  So, ok, its does the job also expecially on my back.  Less acne on my back since I have been using it there.  The smells helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now as an everyday soap.  I had problems with foliculitous (ingrown hairs).  This product has been able to keep my skin at a better pH balance and prevented this from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not really have a heavy smell like other salicidic acid washes do and I have been able to use it without irritation to my skin.  I found that other products after continual use would actually start to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has also become a favorite as a facial wash in the house among other members here that have had acne problems..</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve not seen anyone else bring up yet is that this soap actually speeds up showering (at least for me).  It rinses off so much easier than any other soap I&#x27;ve used that I can soap one side, turn around, soap the other, and the first side will be all rinsed without any special extra effort.  I timed it a few times and I save about 3~5m over my previous soap.  Yes, I&#x27;m an engineer -- how&#x27;d you guess?  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do triathlons, which means I take 2~3 showers a day due to training.  Saving time in the shower adds up.  I have a few comments on the other aspects of this soap, but most of it&#x27;s been said before or is a matter of taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: mildly unpleasant medical/herbal tang, but it&#x27;s gender-neutral.  You don&#x27;t have to worry you&#x27;ll end up smelling like spice &amp; leather or baby powder &amp; flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne: zero effect, but then I&#x27;ve not found any soap or lotion that helps me there.  The most effective thing for me is Sun + Swimming (chlorine) -- that combo is like magic for clearing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying/Oiling: none.  I can shower over and over and my skin will neither dry out nor oil up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing: FAST and extremely clean.  One rinse, no \\&quot;scrubbing it off again\\&quot; required.  Skin feels like skin after, not skin covered with stuff you can&#x27;t get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing: clears sweat &amp; light dust in one lather &amp; rinse (as from running &amp; biking).  I can&#x27;t comment on heavy dirt -- been a long time since I was really dirty.</li>
            <li> not available in canada. i think it does and okay job. smells great. used this when i was really young then recently found it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  This soap helps keep my skin clear.  I actually have it on auto ship monthly so I don&#x27;t run out and have to search around town for it.</li>
            <li> I have minor occasional acne break outs on my back. I have been using [[ASIN:B001EUS62Y Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit, 8.5 Ounces]]for couple of years which did help a little and I would still recommend using it, but Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash is much more effective in my case and from now on I will be using it. It cleared acne in just few washes. Did not dry my skin at all (Neither did Neutrogena Clear Body Wash). From my experience I can say that salicylic acid based products are much more effective than benzoyl peroxide products, which dry your skin a lot and may cause skin irritation. I have used benz. peroxide soaps and body washes and creams and only thing they did was dry my skin and did not clear acne. So, i would really recommend this product to my friends and anyone. It is really good.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena for years, and saw the great deal Amazon had with Phisoderm. This is GREAT and my skin has never looked better.  I will keep on buying this!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does leave you feeling very clean... especially if you have oily skin like me. However it won&#x27;t get rid of visible black-heads even after months of use. ....what I DO think this is good for is PREVENTING additional ones from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using this product in addition to whatever your dermatologist prescribes. (so long as your Doctor approves).</li>
            <li> Using this had no notable effect on my acne. It smells fairly neutral, a little flowery maybe. It works fine as a regular body wash, but it doesn&#x27;t accomplish what it claims. It&#x27;s disappointing because I&#x27;ve been looking around for a decent body wash for a while now and this was so highly recommended. It won&#x27;t make anything worse, but it doesn&#x27;t fix anything either.</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t a miracle drug or anything, but it seems to help reduce my acne a bit. It doesn&#x27;t seem to completely get rid of it either though. It also seems to work better on my face than my body for whatever reason. Pretty much completely cleared up the face, very minimal effect on my back. I have only been using it a week though, so will see.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a product to clear up body blemishes and lathers great, and phisoderm has deffently work for me it&#x27;s all i use. Each bottle was individualy wrapped no mess:) arrived on time and the price was great for a pack of three lasted forever. Very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> Works ok, the way they were shipped was terrible.  It leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from body acne for the past 5 years or so. In an attempt to clean it up, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena and Zenmed. Neither of them really cleared up my problem. They&#x27;ve only kept it in check. I purchased Phisoderm about a month ago hoping to get better results. It hasn&#x27;t worked any better than the other two, maybe even slightly worse. I&#x27;ll have to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its the only things that works on my skin without drying me out.</li>
            <li> Really good body wash for acne, seems to work better if you use some kind of body scrubber and leave it in about a minute. I tried quite a few other washes and this one is probably the best I have used.</li>
            <li> my daughter has not complained about the smell or anything else about it.  It appears to be clearing her skin just fine after about 2-3 weeks.  She is now requesting we stock up with more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for probably 3 years now. I used to get occasional break outs on my shoulders and this body wash cleared them up and keeps my skin clear. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me at all. It has a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This product is priced well, arrived in great time however if you have severe or fairly severe acne I feel this product is too mild to do anything. I switched to pro-active body wash which is more expensive but it helped me. Again mild acne this product may work for you anything severe it just wont do.</li>
            <li> good product, but is now two ounces less per bottle and price per bottle went up.&lt;br /&gt;somebody did not get the recession memo.</li>
            <li> Gentle but thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I am disappointed.  No improvement whatsoever with body &amp; face acne.  If anything, my blemishes have become more irritated and pronounced.  So why 2 star and not 1?  Well, no products I have tried seem to work for clearing up my skin, and at its basic value it is still cleaning me.</li>
            <li> The product delivers the results most of us are looking for (anti-blemish). But you blink and the whole bottle is gone (maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s sold in a 3-pack?)</li>
            <li> My teen has severe back acne and is on daily meds for it.  Prior to the meds we were only using this.  It did a decent job.  Only downside we have learned you really need to lather it on and sit with it on skin for several minutes prior to rinsing to get ultimate benefit.  Also you cannot get this in the stores... I wish you could</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially for the price. If definitely helped keep my body breakouts under control to the point where I don&#x27;t even have to use it anymore!</li>
            <li> this will actually irritate your skin more. It caused me to breakout and even my family who used it. sucks</li>
    </ol>
