            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect iron for about a year</li>
            <li>But when it does work, it works GREAT!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, just one that would get the (BKT) job done.   </li>
            <li>So, even though I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, I wound up buying what I had deemed the best flatiron: the Croc Infrared.</li>
            <li>THE BEST I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>and I am very happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I used it once a week and got perfect results every time.</li>
            <li>This setting worked best for me and gave me salon quality strait hair (and eliminated almost all my frizz).  </li>

            <li>When it worked it was amazing.</li>
            <li>the iron came with a nice clip for the wires, so you wouldnt have to twist it around the iron.</li>
            <li>The grip is great on this, and overall I am very impressed on how well built this straightener was made.    </li>
            <li>I saw so many good reviews</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m loving it for it&#x27;s speed and easy-do&amp;#34;ness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am taking the time to write this review because I am so impressed with how fast the item came in.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast and makes my wavey shoulder length hair smooth as silk in a minuteeeeeee!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise we&#x27;re thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>she really liked</li>
            <li>The croc Infrared flat iron is the best I have ever used, it won&#x27;t pinch the hair while service, and leaves hair feeling and looking healthy, everyone who has had it on their hair said they loved it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it!!</li>
            <li>Now I am getting a new haircut to go with this awesome iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and works great.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li>Although this could change at any time, the best price, by far, that I could find for this iron</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If I haven&#x27;t updated yet it means my straightener is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I have had many straighteners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>And, the best part is that my hair stayed straight on a humid day with light rain.  </li>
            <li>Great hot iron.  </li>
            <li>It is very cute and it makes my hair soft and beautiful :) get this product</li>
            <li>so apparently the best straightener on the planet doesnt even have a waranty.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look like it would be very smooth.  </li>
            <li>when i first got this product i was IN LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTNER.</li>
            <li>So it is better, and it lasts longer, and looks better then the CHI.</li>
            <li>So for me, it is worth it and was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I used to be IN LOVE with my SEDU</li>
            <li>The design of it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I simply use 300, which is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ll give it a try &#x27;cause one thing&#x27;s for sure:</li>
            <li>At the time, I thought I was ordering more flatiron than I needed</li>
            <li>And free shipping,too!</li>
            <li>Now I wonder if this was authentic.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a better product</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>It took more than one pass on a couple sections but that is my fault for using it on damp hair.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the iron.</li>
            <li>I love the iron.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Granted, it works better than the $30.00 replacement I ran out to Sally&#x27;s to buy when this one crapped out, but many irons do</li>
            <li>if you are thinking of buying this product, I suggest you keep looking and spend your money on a better brand.  </li>
            <li>Now some people dont like this straightner, but i can tell you that personally its awesome!!</li>
            <li>i discovered this by accident and am sure i didn&#x27;t always have the infared on until i figured this out.</li>
            <li>she had it, but i feel for what i paid for it, it should have lasted for more than five months..</li>
            <li>On top of that it does its job in the straightening department.</li>
            <li>My sister has even more and it straightens better than any straightener I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>I thought this infrared technology sounded interesting and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>Better than a chi.</li>
            <li>thanks CROC with the help of your great product</li>
            <li>my hair is silky, healthy and shiny,,,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;v got a smooth shiny bob in 15 minutes that lasts for 4 days!  </li>
            <li>ok, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t able to turn it on at all.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get the infrared one because I thought that it would be even better.</li>
            <li>Here is Croc&#x27;s website for more Q&amp;A about warranty/repair/and replacements    </li>
            <li>However, this iron is better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the croc.  </li>
            <li>This flat-iron is so much better than the CHI.  </li>
            <li>It was for a Christmas present and it turned out awesome.</li>
            <li>bought this for my wife in Christmas of 2011 and it is still in tip top shape today.</li>
            <li>Im sure they have this problem for this product all the time.</li>
            <li>your better off with a $20 staightener than one from this company.</li>
            <li>my wife was completely pleased with the product</li>
            <li>This  is one of the best hair care products I have ever used - the safety features are terrific, too.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so shiny  and healthy.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how well this straightener works.</li>
            <li>Croc is one of is not the best flat iron there is.</li>
            <li>My hair smelled really nice, felt nice, and no nasty product buildup on the pretty iron.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>However, the humidity isn&#x27;t that high right now, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed yet.</li>
            <li>It glides very easily and smoothly through the hair.</li>
            <li>I love how you can set your own temperature and how quickly the iron heats up.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up super quick, and is super light, which I love!!!</li>
            <li>I had the Chi straightener and beat it up pretty good</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I dont know to much about infrared, but i guess it helps, lol, just seems like a light to me.</li>
            <li>it feels very cool).</li>
            <li>the thing is that because of the infrared lights there is a break in the plates on one side, so the iron doesnt glide smoothly along the hair and instead snags the hair and pulls, causing more breakage.</li>
            <li>So far it is great.  </li>
            <li>She loved it when she used it the first time, made her hair look smooth and shiny..</li>
            <li>and I had it the following Tuesday, which is incredible because Monday was the Presidents Day holiday.</li>
            <li>I loved the results so much.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flatiron that I have ever used, and I have used Chi,T3 as well as other brands.</li>
            <li>More than worth it!</li>
            <li>Took very good care of this iron, it worked fine the first few months, my hair looked great.</li>
            <li>Hair-styling is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong after a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because my stylist had a Classic Croc and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>On top of this, I don&#x27;t see how this straightener is anything special.  </li>
            <li>it powered on nicely, and it does get seriously seriously hot.</li>
            <li>average amount of hair).The size of the iron is also perfect for curls if you know how to make them.</li>
            <li>I had a normal ceramic Croc for years and really loved it, so maybe it is just this model that is defective.  </li>
            <li>my hair fine</li>
            <li>The fact it glides so easily and is so light and sleek looking</li>
            <li>and I advise anyone with fine color treated hair to put the oil on your ends before curling.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li>Super product, love the inrared heat.</li>
            <li>My hair stylists says its world record worthy!</li>
            <li>I can straighten my hair fairly quickly and it stays all day!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this SOOOO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and I must say this flat iron is exceptional!</li>
            <li>(Also, who knows if the 280 degrees is accurate--</li>
            <li>I like how smooth and silky the infrared makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>i bought this iron not even 2 months ago and the infrared light dosent work already its not like i use it alot for the light not to be working</li>
            <li>It is simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying this iron, it really is worth the money, I would pay more than 88 dollars.</li>
            <li>I like the swivel cord and digital display, both are great features.  </li>
            <li>I have recieved a lot of compliments on my hair since using it, because my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person that I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my hair</li>
            <li>The product does heat up nicely and it is very well made.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Product worked great for 1 year - then heating element died suddenly on vacation.</li>
            <li>But the best part is that it is completely, I repeat, completely, snag free.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you register it you get a free one year warranty.</li>
            <li>With the Croc, my hair is smooth, silky and doesn&#x27;t get knotted.  </li>
            <li>Now when i bought it a couple weeks ago i got it for 76 dollars and free shipping</li>
            <li>Her hair is shiny and smooth after use of the Croc.</li>
            <li>AND my hair looks shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that important to me, because i always need it on the highest setting (450 F &#x3D; 230 C)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m thinking there is a reason the irons are so cheap here</li>
            <li>but it turns out almost a year later that the infrared technology really is great.</li>
            <li>The plates glided smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have had this iron for several years and it has always worked great.  </li>
            <li>The whole design of the box was so nice and</li>
            <li>After four days my hair still looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I turn the infrared lights, the iron leaves my hair glossy and really natural looking, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure if it would be authentic or real</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Awesome hair straightener, use of the infrared technology part definitely makes your hair stay straight through inclement weather</li>
            <li>but i cant safely say that, so far, it is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get this flat iron at such a great price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even compare to anything else I&#x27;ve used, it takes the frizz right out :)</li>
            <li>I didnt think much of it because the flat iron still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that i have only had this straightner for about 2 weeks now, but i must tell everybody how much i love it!!</li>
            <li>This is my third croc absolutely love the infrared lights , it&#x27;s saved my hair!!</li>

            <li>I really had just wanted to test it before loading my hair with choclatey toxic chemicals to make sure I could do the procedure.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m using this iron almost every day, which is okay with me because it&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li>Amazon however did a full refund of the product.</li>
            <li>it was so cool and fancy</li>
            <li>Your better off buying somewhere else with longer warranty if you really want one..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad odor, it&#x27;s just that it smells like an ironed shirt</li>
            <li>The Infrared beams make it super cool</li>
            <li>Easy to order , the product was exactly what they described.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not burn your hair and makes it very smooth without having to go over it several times.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>it arrived, it came in this big box that seemed more appropriate for skater shoes, but it was really cool</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon compared to other sites.</li>
            <li>That was ok, because it was still way better than my original flat iron.</li>
            <li>Purchased this flat iron after I loved how my hair felt when my hairdresser used it.  </li>
            <li>The product works exactly as advertised, and doesn&#x27;t damage my daughter&#x27;s fine hair at all.  </li>
            <li>So before I bought this iron, I had a CHI, that also lost heat quickly, and it took me about 45 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>so it is quick.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal croc user.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the others do for them to break so quickly.</li>
            <li>I know there are better straighteners out there that won&#x27;t loose heat as fast, but I think this was good for the price.</li>
            <li>Recommend if you do more than a couple of passes on high heat.     </li>
            <li>Highly unsatisfied and would not recommend buying from this seller since you will not be able to obtain a replacement if your product breaks.</li>
            <li>I need to straighten my hair at a higher temperature for it be effective, so now I have to look for a new one.</li>
            <li>I think this is accurate, as it gets really really hot.</li>
            <li>I got this flatiron because my hairdresser uses it and swears by it for consistently holding the temperature and putting a smooth sheen on frayed ends.  </li>
            <li>the hair iron is excellent, the use and the hair is much softer and looks better the tips the best irons I have purchased is the only detail that brings no case: (</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t frizz, lasts long, all good things.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron and love that it lets you know just how hot it is!</li>
            <li>Great straightening, less damage to the hair, choice of temperature.</li>
            <li>But overall, I think it is a pretty good straightener.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot in seconds &amp; my hair shines after I iron it!</li>
            <li>and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>When the package came, it was kind of like Christmas, because, by this time, I was only waiting on this flatiron to do the BKT.</li>
            <li>but this one makes your hair smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Take it from me, its SO worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use this professionally for keratin treatments, so you may not be going as fast on your own hair.</li>
            <li>It has to be replaced about once a year, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I want to tell you that I am a hairdresser and this works better than the professional models.</li>
            <li>And while It will still be my #1 straightener of all time, this one matches right up with it and is 1/3 the cost.     </li>
            <li>right on time for me to use it ..</li>
            <li>I used the iron about 3 times, it worked all right.</li>
            <li>Heating up is SUPER FAST, and it tells you the temperature digitally which is nice.</li>
            <li>It straightens hair quickly and effortlessly, which is especially important for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li>i reviewed the iron because i was thrilled to find it at such a phenomenal price and was i was GOING to buy it as a back up to the croc i&#x27;ve owned for 2.5 years (with no issues).  </li>
            <li>I took my dogs out for a nice long walk in this steam haven</li>
            <li>This flat iron is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Leave the full of body and give the hair a natural gloss!!!</li>
            <li>I have gone through several flat irons and this is by far one of the best!</li>
            <li>After using the Croc, my hair is super silky and straight.</li>
            <li>Only if it will last at-least 2 years it can be great product for $100.</li>
            <li>and I just LOVED how soft and shiny it left my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, but it is very wavy</li>
            <li>/&gt; heats up very fast, with regulator&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Because it was so smooth on the hair, it was still fast and fun doing my locks which are now near (gasp!)</li>
            <li>Product was intact, brand new and, in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>even with all the customer reviews saying it would break i was willing to take my chances.</li>
            <li>I was thinking i would break this the first</li>
            <li>(But I recommend to NOT drop it ;)  )</li>
            <li>I love the digital heat settings which range from 250 to 450, I think!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking to straighten many different types of hair!!!</li>
            <li>My hair remains sleek and straight all day!  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>I just used mine for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>And for most hair types you really only need to go up to about 350-370.</li>
            <li>Only used this once or twice a week at the most.</li>
            <li>The Croc Infrared Iron makes my hair look like it is naturally straight and without frizz!  </li>
            <li>I also no longer have to use tons of product to make my hair straight and the infrared option makes my hair shinier!  </li>
            <li>and I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li>It truly made my hair smooth and soft as promised.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, and styles hair unbelieveably!</li>
            <li>It came in the mail yesterday and I tried it out first thing.  </li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>The first Croc I received was defective.</li>
            <li>The iron leaves my hair silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of a better iron for the same price (I paid $85), although I have tried others that are comparable (HAI, CHI, Sedu).  </li>
            <li>This is my second one in many many years, I left my first one at the hotel in Mexico, so that is why I needed another.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my stylist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>FOLICA.COM is the only online retailer of authentic CROC products.  </li>
            <li>It still gets hot.</li>
            <li>I only use the infra-red setting and love the sleek look that it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>this iron delivers high heat and super shine.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it for my wife and she loved it due to its high quality</li>
            <li>This was the 1st time I used Amazon so I freaked out when I realized it was FREE to ship this product and was even more amazed when I got the product in less than a week.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what you should know:       - Heats up SUPER FAST     - Digital temp display and changing temperatures is really easy.</li>
            <li>I have had MOST of the flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li>This works better than the Chi flat irons that the stylists try to use on my hair at the salons.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have recieved more compliments on my hair with this iron than any other, so don&#x27;t hesitate, if you really want it and want an honest opinion on choosing this or another one of the same value, go with this one, Croc will not disspoint!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>i love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>and it is pretty easy to burn yourself with, but that seems to be a universal problem with hot iron tools.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the various qualities of  the product--it sounded good, especially in regard to not being damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this flat iron when I popped open the box and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>My previous iron was a chi, but I am so glad I switched!</li>
            <li>And it also leaves my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li>And now when i wake up in the morning after having straightned my hair the day before it still is pretty straight</li>
            <li>I anticipated buying this straightener, and I even went directly to a beauty supply store and paid full price.</li>
            <li>IT IS EASY TO USE AND NO PRODUCT IS NECESSARY.</li>
            <li>Well, the trouble with doing research is it makes you pretty enthusiastic for whatever it is you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>i also have been treating my hair with PURE 100% KERATIN that does not have whatsoever any chemicals on it.</li>
            <li>Her advice was to send it in for a $50 repair plus shipping both directions, or buy a new one!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons in the past and have found some very good ones.  </li>
            <li>While it was working it was fine, but a company with such crummy customer service doesn&#x27;t deserve your business!!</li>
            <li>I am very busy right now dealing with the dr and disability from work</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get what people are raving about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up extremly fast, when am rushing</li>
            <li>Hence it would leave me to believe that in this case its not a matter of whether this Croc unit being sold on Amazon is a counterfeit or not, but simply that Croc in general does not have a good history of dependability in general.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item arrived two days after the order was placed.</li>
            <li>This product, however, leaves my hair straighter, shinier and sleeker than EVER to the point where people think I have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>Well, dontcha know, my flatiron died that very night.</li>
            <li>(translation: I could have gotten away with a much cheaper one) as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be using it much.</li>
            <li>Seems very durable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Croc Infrared!</li>
            <li>and it makes their hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Also, I used it on somewhat damp hair and the iron did not act unusual in any way.</li>
            <li>I really feel ripped off.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even commented on how much softer my hair was.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was very helpful in it&#x27;s return and credit.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>This really helps to protect my hair from damage and yet get it the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li>and they DO NOT cost this much.  </li>
            <li>i use to have to run it over one section of hair about 2-3 times to get it straight</li>
            <li>She also reports that it heats up very quickly--which she likes, and does not burn her hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a very risky side of me.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is cheapest price I found on-line.  </li>
            <li>and I really didnt know if this \\&quot;infrared\\&quot; thing was a legit selling point</li>
            <li>heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>and i tried it already .. and very suprised with the results..</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny,silky and stick straight.</li>
            <li>so I have very curly, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, I&#x27;ve been using it almost weekly since August</li>
            <li>Cools fast, too.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and has auto shut-off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>wife loves it and it&#x27;s very durable</li>
            <li>For almost two-hundred dollars- I expected better.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast too.</li>
            <li>do waves, straight iron out.</li>
            <li>The 450 degree temperature is enough heat to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for thick hair, leaves hair super straight with a single pass.  </li>
            <li>Most flat irons start to smell after a while... like old burnt color and hair and electricity all bundled up</li>
            <li>Flat iron was great but went dead after 8 months...</li>
            <li>She tells me this iron makes her hair look better than any of the other ones she has tried</li>
            <li>Thats how much i paid for it brand new!</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>After much debate on which high end iron to order, I decided on the Croc Infrared.</li>
            <li>THIS FLAT IRON GIVES A SMOOTH FINISH ALONG WITH A SILKY FEEL AND A HIGH SHINE WITHOUT ADDING PRODUCTS TO THE HAIR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even been raining and humid for the last 2 days and my hair is still super straight.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Hai flat iron for the past 2 years and have been happy.</li>
            <li>I went out the first night that I used it and got compliments on my hair from people who thought it was natural.</li>
            <li>i bought this full price on another site and decided to get a back up and saw this price on amazon and am all over it!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the company will fix this problem as it is a really good iron, it just needs to last a little longer.</li>
            <li>I heart my new flatiron!</li>
            <li>He thought I was just using a new shampoo!</li>
            <li>Company will not ship out new one!</li>
            <li>I really wish this iron had worked for me and maybe my hair is just too fragile to handle it, but I&#x27;m going to return this for a more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li>As many have said, I have had no problem with my previous croc.</li>
            <li>I use the iron personally now, and it it hot enough for my fine to medium hair density.</li>
            <li>Wife LOVES it better than her previous Chi.</li>
            <li>And anyway, when I walk outside in the super humid climate, it immediately frizzes.</li>
            <li>initially gave it 5 stars, but reduced it to 2 after it died so quickly.</li>
            <li>I am still a loyal croc customer but THIS croc will be going back immediately!</li>
            <li>It could just be a glitch with this particular manufacturing set.  </li>
            <li>I returned it for the Classic Croc.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to chime in and say that I love and will not use any other straight irons besides Croc 1-1/2 titanium (not black titanium).  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this one on my hair and she advised that she highly recommended this brand.  </li>
            <li>If your looking to invest in a straighten iron, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron after comparing products and reviews from many different sites.  </li>
            <li>Products are not apparently made to hold up since I see sooo many reviews saying the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the swivel cord and the little thingee attached to the cord so you can bundle the cords and make them all stay neatly in place and to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected because of the fact that I was very iffy about ordering a high end flat iron on line</li>
            <li>As for someone who is using a flat iron on a daily basis on your hair, it most definitely does not need to be any higher than 400...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different flat irons and none of them come close to how soft and silky this one made my hair.  </li>
            <li>That was a red flag right there.</li>
            <li>So, right now it works out to be about the same as Amazon&#x27;s pricing, and you get a warranty with the purchase!  </li>
            <li>EXTENSION HAIR, LEAVING REUSED HAIR EXTENSIONS LOOKING BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li>I tried to get a new one since my Chi was on</li>
            <li>I was going to call CROC myself and explain to them how they are going to send me a brand new straightener with no cost because her $20 straightener that she is using now</li>
            <li>but when i contacted amazon the company i purchased this from told me they would send me a new one if i shipped this with a $35 money order.</li>
            <li>(I still wonder if that is a bunch of BS or if its for real, but either way I think it&#x27;s cool), and it glides so smoothly down the hair.</li>
            <li>I have only owned a Tigi flat iron in the past with Tourmaline plates and didn&#x27;t get great results</li>
            <li>It made going through my super long locks a breeze (the 1.5\\&quot; is lighter than my old 1\\&quot; SEDU).</li>
            <li>I might even be willing to try a different croc.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden it just wouldn&#x27;t go higher than 280 degrees and the infrared would not turn on.</li>
            <li>My hair is super-straight, silky, soft and is bouncy!  </li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because it does get HOT</li>
            <li>apparently this is a very cheaply-made iron with a sleek package and hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>It would not heat past 186 degrees, no matter how many times I replugged it in.</li>
            <li>I do however like the 1 in better :/</li>
            <li>: It is now a little over 4 years, and the iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and does not feel cheap or fragile, its body is heavy-duty and feels like it could be dropped multiple times and last</li>
            <li>I have owned many different brands of flat irons; the last 6 brands were CHI, Sedu, Hai, Helen Of Troy, Tigi BedHead, and Paul Mitchell!</li>
            <li>Other than that a great little flat iron.</li>
            <li>I think I had the temperature too high because it looks dry at first</li>
            <li>we call Florida, and my hair STAYED STYLED and pretty much flat.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much experience with other irons as many of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than the other flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li>Especially the 1.5&amp;#34; beacause she can get more  done in less time.  </li>
            <li>The company had a good return policy, and about 10 days after shipping back the broken iron, we received her new one.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get super straight, soft, and shiny hair that lasts a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past were ok, in that my hair was straight after using them, but nothing like this Croc flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My technique to get the most out of this iron is to wash hair the night before, after washing and while hair is still damp, apply a moisturizing heat protectant (I use Aveda&#x27;s pre-treatment for straightening), the next day when hair is completely dry, heat the flat iron to 450 degrees, section hair, and go for it.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair looking polished every time and has completely eliminated the need for me to use any product in my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I really did like this iron; however, after using this for 10 months it has a short in it.</li>
            <li>But I have never had one leave my hair as soft and silky without additional use of products.  </li>
            <li>I was in complete awe at how glossy and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li>I can simply turn it on wait 5 seconds and its ready.</li>
            <li>I chose the 1.5 inch because my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>The Croc actually kept my hair fairly straight in the heat in Playa del Carmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this iron.  </li>
            <li>my hair can look as straight as a geisha&#x27;s on one day, and blow chaka and diana out the water on the next.  </li>
            <li>Received and used about 4 times so far.  </li>
            <li>I still have my old croc.</li>
            <li>I bought the professional Croc 1 1/2 \\&quot; to use when I would perform Brazilian Blow outs on my clients.  </li>
            <li>i am completely astonished with how shiny and soft is my hair now..</li>
            <li>what iam doing to my hair that is so soft and superrrr shiny...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going fast it needs a second or two to recover the correct temperature.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3  so far.  </li>
            <li>The croc make natural hair look like a relaxer.</li>
            <li>There is a blue light that stays on even when the iron is off that I wish would turn off because it always makes me think I&#x27;ve left it on but not a big deal!</li>
            <li>I was surprised despite the five-star reviews</li>
            <li>I ordered this straightner for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas 2011.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my thick curly hair silky straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick, coarse hair and this iron leaves my hair feeling smooth, shiny and super straight for a long time!</li>
            <li>The ONLY and most severe problem is they simply dont last long.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about how the new hair saving infrared croc straightener was the next big thing.</li>
            <li>believe there is a manufacturing issue with this iron or a particular part of it since it does the same thing to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this specific brand because I had received positive feedback from several friends.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be switching back to a GHD - it&#x27;s well worth the money and actually lasts.</li>
            <li>While I did get several years out of it, it is very disappointing to have it in perfect working condition and never having dropped it or damaged it, it just will not stay on.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is b/c I haven&#x27;t used enough to be certain it has longevity.  </li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and shipping rates can be costly, so that&#x27;s a big factor when deciding to purchase a product online.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida aka Frizz Central.</li>
            <li>I had been aching for a new iron and was stuck to straightening only my bangs, and suffering over the tore up hair each time.</li>
            <li>You simply expect it to last a lot longer for as much as you pay though.</li>
            <li>I noticed after a few weeks that the blue light that lights up once it is plugged in began to fade.</li>
            <li>But once I forked out the $170.00 after my much cheaper and WAY better no-name iron died, I was not impressed at all with the product.  </li>
            <li>It normally takes me two hours or more to flat iron my coarse, thick, curly, Polynesian hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was a mess from having my ponytail partially fall out while sleeping the night before, and within 5-7 minutes my hair looks as though it is freshly washed and styled!!</li>
            <li>just one with two flat plates and the normal hair iron design i&#x27;m accustomed to.</li>
            <li>Paid $85.00 for flat iron that normally sells for about $160 on sale @</li>
            <li>If you read the reviews on there you will see that many of them have the same problem with the units only lasting a few months to a year.</li>
            <li>Right now, they have their black friday sale....</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have tried a Brazillian blow out, I have tried every flat iron and hair product known to man.</li>
            <li>1.5 inche wide amazed me, it works fast</li>
            <li>So, I never really try to wear it straight in the summer.   </li>
            <li>apparently it&#x27;s set to like 350</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s worse is that I am out of the country for months and wont be able to return it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this the first of January of 2014 and it is already shutting down.  </li>
            <li>but other then that it straight</li>
            <li>The iron does not ruin or create split ends like other irons, it really seems to help my hair.</li>
            <li>On the advice of my professional hair stylist, I purchased the croc infrared flat iron for my upper teen who has naturally curly hair, but likes to straighten it.  </li>
            <li>My Sedu died on a trip a few months ago and I have been stuck with a revlon that snags and breaks my hair all the time, is super heavy, doesn&#x27;t get close to my head and leaves kinks next to the root, burns fingers, and just doesn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed that even though the 2 times I did use it the result was great, the iron itself doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and i just did recently, hair mask MACADAMIA NATURAL OILS, in my hair and plus using this flat iron, it gave the look that everybody that sees me is asking,</li>
            <li>So after I submitted my warranty to Croc, they sent it back because apparently they do not honor it if you buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wish I had listened to the negative reviews about this straightener, they are all true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what the life expectancy of a flat iron should be, but I would hope to get at least 2 good years out of a flat iron for the price and technology.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that holds smells.</li>
            <li>Try something a little more expensive that hopefully is made with higher quality parts.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect iron for about a year</li>
            <li> But when it does work, it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, just one that would get the (BKT) job done.   </li>
            <li> So, even though I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, I wound up buying what I had deemed the best flatiron: the Croc Infrared.</li>

            <li> and it still looks amazing.</li>

            <li> When it worked it was amazing.</li>
            <li> the iron came with a nice clip for the wires, so you wouldnt have to twist it around the iron.</li>
            <li> The grip is great on this, and overall I am very impressed on how well built this straightener was made.    </li>
            <li> I saw so many good reviews</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to anyone who wants their hair to look awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it for it&#x27;s speed and easy-do&amp;#34;ness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am taking the time to write this review because I am so impressed with how fast the item came in.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast and makes my wavey shoulder length hair smooth as silk in a minuteeeeeee!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise we&#x27;re thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> she really liked</li>
            <li> The croc Infrared flat iron is the best I have ever used, it won&#x27;t pinch the hair while service, and leaves hair feeling and looking healthy, everyone who has had it on their hair said they loved it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it!!</li>
            <li> Now I am getting a new haircut to go with this awesome iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and works great.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li> Although this could change at any time, the best price, by far, that I could find for this iron</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t updated yet it means my straightener is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I have had many straighteners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> And, the best part is that my hair stayed straight on a humid day with light rain.  </li>
            <li> Great hot iron.  </li>
            <li> It is very cute and it makes my hair soft and beautiful :) get this product</li>
            <li> so apparently the best straightener on the planet doesnt even have a waranty.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like it would be very smooth.  </li>
            <li> when i first got this product i was IN LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTNER.</li>
            <li> So it is better, and it lasts longer, and looks better then the CHI.</li>
            <li> So for me, it is worth it and was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to be IN LOVE with my SEDU</li>
            <li> The design of it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I simply use 300, which is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll give it a try &#x27;cause one thing&#x27;s for sure:</li>
            <li> At the time, I thought I was ordering more flatiron than I needed</li>
            <li> And free shipping,too!</li>
            <li> Now I wonder if this was authentic.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a better product</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> It took more than one pass on a couple sections but that is my fault for using it on damp hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the iron.</li>
            <li> I love the iron.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Granted, it works better than the $30.00 replacement I ran out to Sally&#x27;s to buy when this one crapped out, but many irons do</li>
            <li> if you are thinking of buying this product, I suggest you keep looking and spend your money on a better brand.  </li>
            <li> Now some people dont like this straightner, but i can tell you that personally its awesome!!</li>
            <li> i discovered this by accident and am sure i didn&#x27;t always have the infared on until i figured this out.</li>
            <li> she had it, but i feel for what i paid for it, it should have lasted for more than five months..</li>
            <li> On top of that it does its job in the straightening department.</li>
            <li> My sister has even more and it straightens better than any straightener I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I thought this infrared technology sounded interesting and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Better than a chi.</li>
            <li> thanks CROC with the help of your great product</li>
            <li> my hair is silky, healthy and shiny,,,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;v got a smooth shiny bob in 15 minutes that lasts for 4 days!  </li>
            <li> ok, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t able to turn it on at all.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get the infrared one because I thought that it would be even better.</li>
            <li> Here is Croc&#x27;s website for more Q&amp;A about warranty/repair/and replacements    </li>
            <li> However, this iron is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the croc.  </li>
            <li> This flat-iron is so much better than the CHI.  </li>
            <li> It was for a Christmas present and it turned out awesome.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife in Christmas of 2011 and it is still in tip top shape today.</li>
            <li> Im sure they have this problem for this product all the time.</li>
            <li> your better off with a $20 staightener than one from this company.</li>
            <li> my wife was completely pleased with the product</li>
            <li> This  is one of the best hair care products I have ever used - the safety features are terrific, too.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so shiny  and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how well this straightener works.</li>
            <li> Croc is one of is not the best flat iron there is.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled really nice, felt nice, and no nasty product buildup on the pretty iron.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> However, the humidity isn&#x27;t that high right now, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed yet.</li>
            <li> It glides very easily and smoothly through the hair.</li>
            <li> I love how you can set your own temperature and how quickly the iron heats up.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up super quick, and is super light, which I love!!!</li>
            <li> I had the Chi straightener and beat it up pretty good</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I dont know to much about infrared, but i guess it helps, lol, just seems like a light to me.</li>
            <li> it feels very cool).</li>
            <li> the thing is that because of the infrared lights there is a break in the plates on one side, so the iron doesnt glide smoothly along the hair and instead snags the hair and pulls, causing more breakage.</li>
            <li> So far it is great.  </li>
            <li> She loved it when she used it the first time, made her hair look smooth and shiny..</li>
            <li> and I had it the following Tuesday, which is incredible because Monday was the Presidents Day holiday.</li>
            <li> I loved the results so much.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flatiron that I have ever used, and I have used Chi,T3 as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> More than worth it!</li>
            <li> Took very good care of this iron, it worked fine the first few months, my hair looked great.</li>
            <li> Hair-styling is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Still going strong after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I was so excited because my stylist had a Classic Croc and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> On top of this, I don&#x27;t see how this straightener is anything special.  </li>
            <li> it powered on nicely, and it does get seriously seriously hot.</li>
            <li> average amount of hair).The size of the iron is also perfect for curls if you know how to make them.</li>
            <li> I had a normal ceramic Croc for years and really loved it, so maybe it is just this model that is defective.  </li>
            <li> my hair fine</li>
            <li> The fact it glides so easily and is so light and sleek looking</li>
            <li> and I advise anyone with fine color treated hair to put the oil on your ends before curling.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li> Super product, love the inrared heat.</li>
            <li> My hair stylists says its world record worthy!</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair fairly quickly and it stays all day!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this SOOOO MUCH!!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I must say this flat iron is exceptional!</li>
            <li> (Also, who knows if the 280 degrees is accurate--</li>
            <li> I like how smooth and silky the infrared makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> i bought this iron not even 2 months ago and the infrared light dosent work already its not like i use it alot for the light not to be working</li>
            <li> It is simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying this iron, it really is worth the money, I would pay more than 88 dollars.</li>
            <li> I like the swivel cord and digital display, both are great features.  </li>
            <li> I have recieved a lot of compliments on my hair since using it, because my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person that I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my hair</li>
            <li> The product does heat up nicely and it is very well made.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Product worked great for 1 year - then heating element died suddenly on vacation.</li>
            <li> But the best part is that it is completely, I repeat, completely, snag free.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you register it you get a free one year warranty.</li>
            <li> With the Croc, my hair is smooth, silky and doesn&#x27;t get knotted.  </li>
            <li> Now when i bought it a couple weeks ago i got it for 76 dollars and free shipping</li>
            <li> Her hair is shiny and smooth after use of the Croc.</li>
            <li> AND my hair looks shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that important to me, because i always need it on the highest setting (450 F &#x3D; 230 C)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m thinking there is a reason the irons are so cheap here</li>
            <li> but it turns out almost a year later that the infrared technology really is great.</li>
            <li> The plates glided smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for several years and it has always worked great.  </li>
            <li> The whole design of the box was so nice and</li>
            <li> After four days my hair still looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I turn the infrared lights, the iron leaves my hair glossy and really natural looking, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure if it would be authentic or real</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair straightener, use of the infrared technology part definitely makes your hair stay straight through inclement weather</li>
            <li> but i cant safely say that, so far, it is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this flat iron at such a great price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even compare to anything else I&#x27;ve used, it takes the frizz right out :)</li>
            <li> I didnt think much of it because the flat iron still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that i have only had this straightner for about 2 weeks now, but i must tell everybody how much i love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my third croc absolutely love the infrared lights , it&#x27;s saved my hair!!</li>

            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/28/10:</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to use it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use a different kind again!</li>
            <li> Furthermore I think a 1\\&quot; is far more manageable and leads to better</li>
            <li> It works quickly and my hair stays smooth.  </li>
            <li> It gives an amazing shine and it leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> I just recieved it an hour ago and i can already tell that this is by far THE BEST FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> So far I think it is one of the best flat irons I have used.  </li>
            <li> By far, one of the best flat irons out there.</li>
            <li> there are so many other good reviews of this product..</li>
            <li> It heats up super quick and it leaves your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up, the temperature control, size and the length of the cord.  </li>
            <li> I really had just wanted to test it before loading my hair with choclatey toxic chemicals to make sure I could do the procedure.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m using this iron almost every day, which is okay with me because it&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li> Amazon however did a full refund of the product.</li>
            <li> it was so cool and fancy</li>
            <li> Your better off buying somewhere else with longer warranty if you really want one..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad odor, it&#x27;s just that it smells like an ironed shirt</li>
            <li> The Infrared beams make it super cool</li>
            <li> Easy to order , the product was exactly what they described.</li>
            <li> I love that it does not burn your hair and makes it very smooth without having to go over it several times.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> it arrived, it came in this big box that seemed more appropriate for skater shoes, but it was really cool</li>
            <li> Great price on amazon compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> That was ok, because it was still way better than my original flat iron.</li>
            <li> Purchased this flat iron after I loved how my hair felt when my hairdresser used it.  </li>
            <li> The product works exactly as advertised, and doesn&#x27;t damage my daughter&#x27;s fine hair at all.  </li>
            <li> So before I bought this iron, I had a CHI, that also lost heat quickly, and it took me about 45 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> so it is quick.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal croc user.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the others do for them to break so quickly.</li>
            <li> I know there are better straighteners out there that won&#x27;t loose heat as fast, but I think this was good for the price.</li>
            <li> Recommend if you do more than a couple of passes on high heat.     </li>
            <li> Highly unsatisfied and would not recommend buying from this seller since you will not be able to obtain a replacement if your product breaks.</li>
            <li> I need to straighten my hair at a higher temperature for it be effective, so now I have to look for a new one.</li>
            <li> I think this is accurate, as it gets really really hot.</li>
            <li> I got this flatiron because my hairdresser uses it and swears by it for consistently holding the temperature and putting a smooth sheen on frayed ends.  </li>
            <li> the hair iron is excellent, the use and the hair is much softer and looks better the tips the best irons I have purchased is the only detail that brings no case: (</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t frizz, lasts long, all good things.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron and love that it lets you know just how hot it is!</li>
            <li> Great straightening, less damage to the hair, choice of temperature.</li>
            <li> But overall, I think it is a pretty good straightener.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot in seconds &amp; my hair shines after I iron it!</li>
            <li> and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> When the package came, it was kind of like Christmas, because, by this time, I was only waiting on this flatiron to do the BKT.</li>
            <li> but this one makes your hair smell fresh.</li>
            <li> Take it from me, its SO worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this professionally for keratin treatments, so you may not be going as fast on your own hair.</li>
            <li> It has to be replaced about once a year, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I want to tell you that I am a hairdresser and this works better than the professional models.</li>
            <li> And while It will still be my #1 straightener of all time, this one matches right up with it and is 1/3 the cost.     </li>
            <li> right on time for me to use it ..</li>
            <li> I used the iron about 3 times, it worked all right.</li>
            <li> Heating up is SUPER FAST, and it tells you the temperature digitally which is nice.</li>
            <li> It straightens hair quickly and effortlessly, which is especially important for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> i reviewed the iron because i was thrilled to find it at such a phenomenal price and was i was GOING to buy it as a back up to the croc i&#x27;ve owned for 2.5 years (with no issues).  </li>
            <li> I took my dogs out for a nice long walk in this steam haven</li>
            <li> This flat iron is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Leave the full of body and give the hair a natural gloss!!!</li>
            <li> I have gone through several flat irons and this is by far one of the best!</li>
            <li> After using the Croc, my hair is super silky and straight.</li>
            <li> Only if it will last at-least 2 years it can be great product for $100.</li>
            <li> and I just LOVED how soft and shiny it left my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, but it is very wavy</li>
            <li> /&gt; heats up very fast, with regulator&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Because it was so smooth on the hair, it was still fast and fun doing my locks which are now near (gasp!)</li>
            <li> Product was intact, brand new and, in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> even with all the customer reviews saying it would break i was willing to take my chances.</li>
            <li> I was thinking i would break this the first</li>
            <li> (But I recommend to NOT drop it ;)  )</li>
            <li> I love the digital heat settings which range from 250 to 450, I think!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking to straighten many different types of hair!!!</li>
            <li> My hair remains sleek and straight all day!  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> I just used mine for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> And for most hair types you really only need to go up to about 350-370.</li>
            <li> Only used this once or twice a week at the most.</li>
            <li> The Croc Infrared Iron makes my hair look like it is naturally straight and without frizz!  </li>
            <li> I also no longer have to use tons of product to make my hair straight and the infrared option makes my hair shinier!  </li>
            <li> and I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> It truly made my hair smooth and soft as promised.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, and styles hair unbelieveably!</li>
            <li> It came in the mail yesterday and I tried it out first thing.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> The first Croc I received was defective.</li>
            <li> The iron leaves my hair silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of a better iron for the same price (I paid $85), although I have tried others that are comparable (HAI, CHI, Sedu).  </li>
            <li> This is my second one in many many years, I left my first one at the hotel in Mexico, so that is why I needed another.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my stylist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> FOLICA.COM is the only online retailer of authentic CROC products.  </li>
            <li> It still gets hot.</li>
            <li> I only use the infra-red setting and love the sleek look that it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> this iron delivers high heat and super shine.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife and she loved it due to its high quality</li>
            <li> This was the 1st time I used Amazon so I freaked out when I realized it was FREE to ship this product and was even more amazed when I got the product in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what you should know:       - Heats up SUPER FAST     - Digital temp display and changing temperatures is really easy.</li>
            <li> I have had MOST of the flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li> This works better than the Chi flat irons that the stylists try to use on my hair at the salons.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have recieved more compliments on my hair with this iron than any other, so don&#x27;t hesitate, if you really want it and want an honest opinion on choosing this or another one of the same value, go with this one, Croc will not disspoint!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> i love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> and it is pretty easy to burn yourself with, but that seems to be a universal problem with hot iron tools.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the various qualities of  the product--it sounded good, especially in regard to not being damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this flat iron when I popped open the box and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> My previous iron was a chi, but I am so glad I switched!</li>
            <li> And it also leaves my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li> And now when i wake up in the morning after having straightned my hair the day before it still is pretty straight</li>
            <li> I anticipated buying this straightener, and I even went directly to a beauty supply store and paid full price.</li>
            <li> IT IS EASY TO USE AND NO PRODUCT IS NECESSARY.</li>
            <li> Well, the trouble with doing research is it makes you pretty enthusiastic for whatever it is you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> i also have been treating my hair with PURE 100% KERATIN that does not have whatsoever any chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> Her advice was to send it in for a $50 repair plus shipping both directions, or buy a new one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons in the past and have found some very good ones.  </li>
            <li> While it was working it was fine, but a company with such crummy customer service doesn&#x27;t deserve your business!!</li>
            <li> I am very busy right now dealing with the dr and disability from work</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get what people are raving about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up extremly fast, when am rushing</li>
            <li> Hence it would leave me to believe that in this case its not a matter of whether this Croc unit being sold on Amazon is a counterfeit or not, but simply that Croc in general does not have a good history of dependability in general.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item arrived two days after the order was placed.</li>
            <li> This product, however, leaves my hair straighter, shinier and sleeker than EVER to the point where people think I have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> Well, dontcha know, my flatiron died that very night.</li>
            <li> (translation: I could have gotten away with a much cheaper one) as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be using it much.</li>
            <li> Seems very durable.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Croc Infrared!</li>
            <li> and it makes their hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Also, I used it on somewhat damp hair and the iron did not act unusual in any way.</li>
            <li> I really feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even commented on how much softer my hair was.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was very helpful in it&#x27;s return and credit.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> This really helps to protect my hair from damage and yet get it the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li> and they DO NOT cost this much.  </li>
            <li> i use to have to run it over one section of hair about 2-3 times to get it straight</li>
            <li> She also reports that it heats up very quickly--which she likes, and does not burn her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a very risky side of me.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is cheapest price I found on-line.  </li>
            <li> and I really didnt know if this \\&quot;infrared\\&quot; thing was a legit selling point</li>
            <li> heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> and i tried it already .. and very suprised with the results..</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny,silky and stick straight.</li>
            <li> so I have very curly, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, I&#x27;ve been using it almost weekly since August</li>
            <li> Cools fast, too.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and has auto shut-off.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> wife loves it and it&#x27;s very durable</li>
            <li> For almost two-hundred dollars- I expected better.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast too.</li>
            <li> do waves, straight iron out.</li>
            <li> The 450 degree temperature is enough heat to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for thick hair, leaves hair super straight with a single pass.  </li>
            <li> Most flat irons start to smell after a while... like old burnt color and hair and electricity all bundled up</li>
            <li> Flat iron was great but went dead after 8 months...</li>
            <li> She tells me this iron makes her hair look better than any of the other ones she has tried</li>
            <li> Thats how much i paid for it brand new!</li>
            <li> It gets hot fast and leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> After much debate on which high end iron to order, I decided on the Croc Infrared.</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON GIVES A SMOOTH FINISH ALONG WITH A SILKY FEEL AND A HIGH SHINE WITHOUT ADDING PRODUCTS TO THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even been raining and humid for the last 2 days and my hair is still super straight.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Hai flat iron for the past 2 years and have been happy.</li>
            <li> I went out the first night that I used it and got compliments on my hair from people who thought it was natural.</li>
            <li> i bought this full price on another site and decided to get a back up and saw this price on amazon and am all over it!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the company will fix this problem as it is a really good iron, it just needs to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I heart my new flatiron!</li>
            <li> He thought I was just using a new shampoo!</li>
            <li> Company will not ship out new one!</li>
            <li> I really wish this iron had worked for me and maybe my hair is just too fragile to handle it, but I&#x27;m going to return this for a more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> As many have said, I have had no problem with my previous croc.</li>
            <li> I use the iron personally now, and it it hot enough for my fine to medium hair density.</li>
            <li> Wife LOVES it better than her previous Chi.</li>
            <li> And anyway, when I walk outside in the super humid climate, it immediately frizzes.</li>
            <li> initially gave it 5 stars, but reduced it to 2 after it died so quickly.</li>
            <li> I am still a loyal croc customer but THIS croc will be going back immediately!</li>
            <li> It could just be a glitch with this particular manufacturing set.  </li>
            <li> I returned it for the Classic Croc.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to chime in and say that I love and will not use any other straight irons besides Croc 1-1/2 titanium (not black titanium).  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this one on my hair and she advised that she highly recommended this brand.  </li>
            <li> If your looking to invest in a straighten iron, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after comparing products and reviews from many different sites.  </li>
            <li> Products are not apparently made to hold up since I see sooo many reviews saying the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the swivel cord and the little thingee attached to the cord so you can bundle the cords and make them all stay neatly in place and to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected because of the fact that I was very iffy about ordering a high end flat iron on line</li>
            <li> As for someone who is using a flat iron on a daily basis on your hair, it most definitely does not need to be any higher than 400...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different flat irons and none of them come close to how soft and silky this one made my hair.  </li>
            <li> That was a red flag right there.</li>
            <li> So, right now it works out to be about the same as Amazon&#x27;s pricing, and you get a warranty with the purchase!  </li>
            <li> EXTENSION HAIR, LEAVING REUSED HAIR EXTENSIONS LOOKING BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li> I tried to get a new one since my Chi was on</li>
            <li> I was going to call CROC myself and explain to them how they are going to send me a brand new straightener with no cost because her $20 straightener that she is using now</li>
            <li> but when i contacted amazon the company i purchased this from told me they would send me a new one if i shipped this with a $35 money order.</li>
            <li> (I still wonder if that is a bunch of BS or if its for real, but either way I think it&#x27;s cool), and it glides so smoothly down the hair.</li>
            <li> I have only owned a Tigi flat iron in the past with Tourmaline plates and didn&#x27;t get great results</li>
            <li> It made going through my super long locks a breeze (the 1.5\\&quot; is lighter than my old 1\\&quot; SEDU).</li>
            <li> I might even be willing to try a different croc.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden it just wouldn&#x27;t go higher than 280 degrees and the infrared would not turn on.</li>
            <li> My hair is super-straight, silky, soft and is bouncy!  </li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it does get HOT</li>
            <li> apparently this is a very cheaply-made iron with a sleek package and hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li> It would not heat past 186 degrees, no matter how many times I replugged it in.</li>
            <li> I do however like the 1 in better :/</li>
            <li> : It is now a little over 4 years, and the iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and does not feel cheap or fragile, its body is heavy-duty and feels like it could be dropped multiple times and last</li>
            <li> I have owned many different brands of flat irons; the last 6 brands were CHI, Sedu, Hai, Helen Of Troy, Tigi BedHead, and Paul Mitchell!</li>
            <li> Other than that a great little flat iron.</li>
            <li> I think I had the temperature too high because it looks dry at first</li>
            <li> we call Florida, and my hair STAYED STYLED and pretty much flat.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have as much experience with other irons as many of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> This is far better than the other flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li> Especially the 1.5&amp;#34; beacause she can get more  done in less time.  </li>
            <li> The company had a good return policy, and about 10 days after shipping back the broken iron, we received her new one.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get super straight, soft, and shiny hair that lasts a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past were ok, in that my hair was straight after using them, but nothing like this Croc flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My technique to get the most out of this iron is to wash hair the night before, after washing and while hair is still damp, apply a moisturizing heat protectant (I use Aveda&#x27;s pre-treatment for straightening), the next day when hair is completely dry, heat the flat iron to 450 degrees, section hair, and go for it.  </li>
            <li> leaves my hair looking polished every time and has completely eliminated the need for me to use any product in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I really did like this iron; however, after using this for 10 months it has a short in it.</li>
            <li> But I have never had one leave my hair as soft and silky without additional use of products.  </li>
            <li> I was in complete awe at how glossy and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li> I can simply turn it on wait 5 seconds and its ready.</li>
            <li> I chose the 1.5 inch because my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> The Croc actually kept my hair fairly straight in the heat in Playa del Carmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this iron.  </li>
            <li> my hair can look as straight as a geisha&#x27;s on one day, and blow chaka and diana out the water on the next.  </li>
            <li> Received and used about 4 times so far.  </li>
            <li> I still have my old croc.</li>
            <li> I bought the professional Croc 1 1/2 \\&quot; to use when I would perform Brazilian Blow outs on my clients.  </li>
            <li> i am completely astonished with how shiny and soft is my hair now..</li>
            <li> what iam doing to my hair that is so soft and superrrr shiny...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going fast it needs a second or two to recover the correct temperature.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3  so far.  </li>
            <li> The croc make natural hair look like a relaxer.</li>
            <li> There is a blue light that stays on even when the iron is off that I wish would turn off because it always makes me think I&#x27;ve left it on but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> I was surprised despite the five-star reviews</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightner for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas 2011.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my thick curly hair silky straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair and this iron leaves my hair feeling smooth, shiny and super straight for a long time!</li>
            <li> The ONLY and most severe problem is they simply dont last long.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about how the new hair saving infrared croc straightener was the next big thing.</li>
            <li> believe there is a manufacturing issue with this iron or a particular part of it since it does the same thing to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this specific brand because I had received positive feedback from several friends.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be switching back to a GHD - it&#x27;s well worth the money and actually lasts.</li>
            <li> While I did get several years out of it, it is very disappointing to have it in perfect working condition and never having dropped it or damaged it, it just will not stay on.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is b/c I haven&#x27;t used enough to be certain it has longevity.  </li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and shipping rates can be costly, so that&#x27;s a big factor when deciding to purchase a product online.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida aka Frizz Central.</li>
            <li> I had been aching for a new iron and was stuck to straightening only my bangs, and suffering over the tore up hair each time.</li>
            <li> You simply expect it to last a lot longer for as much as you pay though.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a few weeks that the blue light that lights up once it is plugged in began to fade.</li>
            <li> But once I forked out the $170.00 after my much cheaper and WAY better no-name iron died, I was not impressed at all with the product.  </li>
            <li> It normally takes me two hours or more to flat iron my coarse, thick, curly, Polynesian hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a mess from having my ponytail partially fall out while sleeping the night before, and within 5-7 minutes my hair looks as though it is freshly washed and styled!!</li>
            <li> just one with two flat plates and the normal hair iron design i&#x27;m accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Paid $85.00 for flat iron that normally sells for about $160 on sale @</li>
            <li> If you read the reviews on there you will see that many of them have the same problem with the units only lasting a few months to a year.</li>
            <li> Right now, they have their black friday sale....</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have tried a Brazillian blow out, I have tried every flat iron and hair product known to man.</li>
            <li> 1.5 inche wide amazed me, it works fast</li>
            <li> So, I never really try to wear it straight in the summer.   </li>
            <li> apparently it&#x27;s set to like 350</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I am out of the country for months and wont be able to return it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this the first of January of 2014 and it is already shutting down.  </li>
            <li> but other then that it straight</li>
            <li> The iron does not ruin or create split ends like other irons, it really seems to help my hair.</li>
            <li> On the advice of my professional hair stylist, I purchased the croc infrared flat iron for my upper teen who has naturally curly hair, but likes to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> My Sedu died on a trip a few months ago and I have been stuck with a revlon that snags and breaks my hair all the time, is super heavy, doesn&#x27;t get close to my head and leaves kinks next to the root, burns fingers, and just doesn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that even though the 2 times I did use it the result was great, the iron itself doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and i just did recently, hair mask MACADAMIA NATURAL OILS, in my hair and plus using this flat iron, it gave the look that everybody that sees me is asking,</li>
            <li> So after I submitted my warranty to Croc, they sent it back because apparently they do not honor it if you buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews about this straightener, they are all true.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the life expectancy of a flat iron should be, but I would hope to get at least 2 good years out of a flat iron for the price and technology.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that holds smells.</li>
            <li> Try something a little more expensive that hopefully is made with higher quality parts.</li>
            <li> The croc infrared 1.5 was OK, not exactly as great as I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I did a rather extensive search and review of flat irons before I decided to purchase this as a present for my upper teen daughter.</li>
            <li> (it was her present), the flat iron suddenly died on her.  </li>
            <li> My next flat iron will definitely be a Chi.</li>
            <li> She has used this flat iron faithfully every day since February, and now 9 months later, the second croc flat iron suddenly died, and won&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> and surprised it takes small kinks out (broken hairs flatten and seamlessly flow with rest of hair).&lt;br /&gt;A heat protector for the flatiron and the thermal hair protector is important in the process.</li>
            <li> My hair has really improved and is less dry after switching to this straightener.</li>
            <li> - Warranty card in the box, which I intend to send in, as other reviews all over the Internet indicate this product has a history of dying while still young.      </li>
            <li> The Croc has not dried out my hair like other flat irons and it actually curls my hair too!!  </li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron that has done this well in those conditions.  </li>
            <li> After having my last flat iron broke I decided yet again to change brands, since I had not found \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> This flat iron has TOTALLY eliminated my need for relaxing my unruly, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I spritz my hair with a citrusy smelling cologne prior to flat ironing my tresses</li>
            <li> Well, using this flat iron, will make you have the same results as having a Brazilian straightener applied to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I received this flat iron in the middle of September 2011.</li>
            <li> However, my hairdresser recently used a Croc flat iron</li>
            <li> I placed my order of the Croc Infrared flat iron with standard shipping on a Friday afternoon and it came in Monday!!!</li>
            <li> Only flat I ever use.  </li>
            <li> Totally recommend this flat iron for those that want to have bone-straight hair that is silky!</li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing my hair for 5+ years now, and I&#x27;ve had the low-end Walmart flat irons to the salon brands such as CHI, SEDU, Bed Head, etc, and this iron BLOWS THEM AWAY!    </li>
            <li> In the past I have used Chi Ultra ($100+) and a GHD Pure ($300).</li>
            <li> For the past 8 years I have been a very faithful CHI user.</li>
            <li> She really likes it, not sure if we will get another one..</li>
            <li> THE FLAT IRON REVITALIZES HAIR</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> have read several reviews about how long the Croc lasts.</li>
            <li> This flat iron sucked the life out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a flat iron before.  </li>
            <li> In addition my $20 flat iron still works today after years of use and now this one that i forked out well over $150</li>
            <li> Chi has always been my go to flat iron.</li>
            <li> Also want to note that the pictures shown with this flat iron shows it says \\&quot;Croc 2\\&quot; on it.</li>
            <li> I used her flat Iron when I was staying with her</li>
            <li> This flat iron lasted me 5yrs.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 2 years ago to assist with my Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> this flat iron, was well cared for and died after 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> I have a solia flat iron that i bought from folica in 2008</li>
            <li> Well the week before Thanksgiving, my flat iron started shorting out and wouldnt stay on.</li>
            <li> I kept the flat iron in the box.</li>
            <li> I have had $20 flat irons that lasted longer than this.</li>
            <li> I have long, think hair and what used to take 45 minutes to style now only takes about 10.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is used on diff hair types on diff settings.</li>
            <li> This flat iron met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> My sister bought this flat iron at the ISSE show in Long Beach last February</li>
            <li> works very well on my thick hair and only requires a third of the time to do the job.</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> I think that is just a problem with all flat irons!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this Croc flat iron up!</li>
            <li> This flat iron has changed my life!</li>
            <li> flat iron is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I did like this but after spending this much money you would expect it to last at least a year.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and takes me half the time to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I am cognizant that had I not smelled the smoke and noticed the melting quickly, the outcome could have been much worse</li>
            <li> and I am hoping that this flat iron&#x27;s performance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It heats up as usual, but loses heat very quickly as you use it.</li>
            <li> I went to hair school and have used all kinds of flat irons for my crazy curly hair, and this is the first one that has made my hair look like it&#x27;s naturally straight.</li>
            <li> - The infrared, which I initially thought was a little gimmicky, really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve never really liked flatirons because I don&#x27;t like my hair stick straight.</li>
            <li> That makes it take a long time to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I like to take a long time to straighten my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t shine as much as I expected compared to the one time I tried an iron of Jose Eber&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> After paying over $100 for this product, I fully expected it to last longer than six months.</li>
            <li> After hearing a strange sizzling noise, I turned the iron off in fear it might damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had drugstore brands that have lasted twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Chi and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Since they are not direct distributors of our product, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of their products sold.</li>
            <li> Has a long cord that swivels.</li>
            <li> I have thick, spirally, curly hair, but like to style it straight sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It straigtened my extremely thick, curly, and unruly hair very quckly.</li>
            <li> so finding a flat iron that actually makes my hair straight and remain straight is a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> In attempting to resolve this issue by hopefully receiving a replacement product I am not able to even get a new one.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive scalp or plain just want to keep your hair intact</li>
            <li> for the former look, i need to put some work (read some serious time) into it and high heat</li>
            <li> AVOID ANY CROC PRODUCTS - Dangerous defect: melting, risk of fire:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first five minutes of use of my new Croc Infrared Flat Iron, it began producing smoke, the plates melted off and became dislodged.</li>
            <li> i have frizzy, coarse, thick hair, being of japanese and african american parents.  </li>
            <li> Everyone compliments me on how shiny and long my hair is now!</li>
            <li> And after only 2 months it doesn&#x27;t heat up no longer and shuts off due to an error message.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Although this iron did make my hair softer, it only lasted me a little over 3 months and that was with moderate use (1-2 times a week).</li>
            <li> and i expected this flat iron to make straightening my hair easier and faster</li>
            <li> It is nearly $100 less than some other sites.</li>
            <li> This hair styler does wonders for me, and it has worked for  very long time.</li>
            <li> (sometimes damp dry)</li>
            <li> , I let it air dry and then used my Croc iron.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I would say about the straightener, is that it loses heat quickly.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that it only took about 20 minutes because like I said I have really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to believe it burned out because I dont use a flat iron half as much as some people.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried several times after with no success.  </li>
            <li> one might think it was broken by not going higher than 230 when that is the highest temp in celsius.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is down to low 300s.</li>
            <li> Sounds like alot of people are having problems with the product breaking down or not working properly...</li>
            <li> line: this thing leaves my hair fried, tired, dead, broken, and it takes me over an hour to do my whole head when with my cheap knockoff iron</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and has been damaged from previous flat irons, hair coloring, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to give my hair a blowout anymore before I straighten it, just paddle brush and blow dry and then straighten away!</li>
            <li> Based on other feedback and refferal from other users,  the Crock Infrared Iron meets expectations but review is too soon to provide a solid feedback as to longevity.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend got a little spring at Home Depot and fixed it in less than 10 minutes.    </li>
            <li> waist long!!!    </li>
            <li> The manufacturer told me these irons are being sold illegally, the only company that can sell them legally is Ion.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the instructions don&#x27;t mention that to turn on the infared (the lights in the middle)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did not get all my curls out, it was difficult to straighten long hair with, caught strands of hair and pulled them out, as well as took an hour to straighten my below-the-shoulders-hair; as opposed to the twenty minutes my Chi takes.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly hair, and i wear it straight.</li>
            <li> After careful research for my type hair (curly and course)</li>
            <li> I am hoping it will last me a few years.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few days later hoping it was a fluke but no luck!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, after EXTENSIVE (and i do mean extensive) research</li>
            <li> And when I say fix, I mean he had to solder the tiny wires inside back together all 3 times.  </li>
            <li> After having trouble with other straighteners leaving my hair with kinks and frizz, I finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li> It stinks that it dies so quickly, but my $250 flat iron dies in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is this one does not remember my heat setting like the previous (same model) did.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and 10 minutes means extra strain on my wrists.</li>
            <li> So I decided to check the ratings/reviews on Folica (a licensed seller of Croc and all other salon hair products).</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working.  </li>
            <li> So, I did some research of other brands.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed (no, really!)</li>
            <li> I should have listtened to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews now, I&#x27;m wondering if they send faulty items to Amazon customers because they know they will not honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> Does CROC honor warranties from EBAY or other online retail sites?    </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that used to take me 90 minutes to straighten and the next day or even half way through the day it would start to curl/frizz.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful</li>
            <li> I usually have to put hair oil on before I flat iron, but I used nothing and turned on the infrared.</li>
            <li> I have been using a generic brand knockoff chi for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> just not right</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this iron is it sometimes (NOT ALL the time, i&#x27;d say 20-30% of the time)</li>
            <li> 15 minutes later she was done straightning my incredibly thick frizzy curly hair</li>
            <li> Living in DEEP south Alabama, we have to deal with humidity that is so thick you can practically see it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> it cuts the hair work time in half at least, which is a big deal</li>
            <li> Just click the up or down arrow accordingly.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is that the plates are too small.</li>
            <li> It heats up in less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> But the reviews I read were slightly misleading.</li>
            <li> I get my hair straightened in 15 mins or less</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 15 minutes to straighten my hair (I have wavy hair and  </li>
            <li> I had this straightener for less than three months before it broke.</li>
            <li> Still wish the timing was less.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it less then 30 times and</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 3 months..</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my previous that died after 4 years.</li>
            <li> the common thread seems to be that the iron dies after a few months and cannot be replaced or serviced by croc because their policy states they will only cover items purchased from authorized dealers, a group of which amazon does not belong.  </li>
            <li> I do not see that it cools off any faster than any previous iron Ive had.</li>
            <li> Black glue was oozing from the product.</li>
            <li> I am black with no relaxer.</li>
            <li> With this iron, it takes about half an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Less than a year</li>
            <li> then after having it for less than a year it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> According to the reviews I had read a heat protective pad was suppose to ce with it, which I looked forward to because my daughters old iron left marks on the furniture if it was accidently set there, sooo that was kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> But after a mere ten minutes of flatironing, I went from Frizzy to Flat.</li>
            <li> However, after six months of use it now starts heating up and will then flash &amp;#34;Err&amp;#34; within a few seconds and shut down.</li>
            <li> so i thought that it was time for a new one, althought there is nothing wrong with the solia.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve had problems with electric hair tools dying with little use</li>
            <li> I have read other product reviews saying that there&#x27;s died within a few months, so I promise to follow up!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and had been wearing it in a bun all day; I sprayed some heat protector in and combed through it until it was a big frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> but what I have are waves; shapeless, all over the place, frizzy waves</li>
            <li> The iron worked like a charm, and continues to work everyday.     </li>
            <li> It takes forever having to \\&quot;reheat\\&quot; it every few swipes.</li>
            <li> Ive had this iron for about a week and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is frustrating that it only lasted 9 months.  </li>
            <li> This was NOT a genuine product.</li>
            <li> It also cut my straightening time in half!</li>
            <li> It worked just as well as my less expensive flat iron(amika).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter that I had used it very little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how my hair changes in the summer.</li>
            <li> it stopped heating up past 230 degrees.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about sectioning my mega thick hair off and blow drying it with a round brush before straightening.  </li>
            <li> It wont heat up past 280 degrees, and I cant turn on the infared feature.  </li>
            <li> I believe it gets hotter, but I&#x27;m not sure of the temperature.</li>
            <li> so not sure why the pad wasn&#x27;t in there.</li>
            <li> being a serious online shopper, i feel i must always perform due diligence, so i read the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> ,I work hard and don&#x27;t mind paying for something.</li>
            <li> With all the other ones, my hair always felt dry and brittle and would get knotted on the ends really bad throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It sucks..  </li>
            <li> I ignored the negative feedback</li>
            <li> My hair is just too thick.</li>
            <li> i bought this item as a gift for a friend that has really thick hair..</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair</li>
            <li> Thats lower than the prices of awful flat irons in the professional stores I shop in.</li>
            <li> i mean when i run it through my hair now it just starts changing temperature..</li>
            <li> The iron is too expensive regardless of where you get it for it to stop working in less than a years time.</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> It looks as tough as it feels.</li>
            <li> But please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, don&#x27;t think it won&#x27;t happen to you!!!</li>
            <li> No more tore up hair for me!!</li>
            <li> What makes a company not stand behind its product.  </li>
            <li> and she just phoned to ask if it could be returned because its broken..</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this magnitude of defect in a product before.</li>
            <li> broken normal.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with how short the lifespan was.</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical @ 1st.</li>
            <li> A month ago I went to get my haircut and the hair stylist used this weird looking straightner, so I asked her what it was.</li>
            <li> i purchased mine from folica which is, the unfortunate people here bought from amazon.  </li>
            <li> but i was absolutely wrong.</li>
            <li> this was an expensive purchase for me that I did a lot of research on for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> It was terribly uncomfortable and frankly I could not finish styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I unplugged it while it was heating one day, and it stopped getting any hotter than 250 on the display.</li>
            <li> Warranty is not covered and unfortunately 30 days had passed so</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> no matter what website I went to, that this straightener was as mediocre as a drug store brand.</li>
            <li> I am so very disgusted and angry that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> (I broke it in half by dropping it, RIP Sedu :&#x27;( )</li>
            <li> This is incredibly dangerous, and whoever facilitated this should be sued.</li>
            <li> The iron is also seriously uncomfortable to hold!</li>
            <li> SORRY!  </li>
            <li> and it was a bad solder</li>
            <li> So disappointed in the Croc...</li>
            <li> I am appalled by this situation.</li>
            <li> This is just a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> HERE&#x27;S THE WORST PART</li>
            <li> HATED IT!!!!</li>
            <li> the company should stand behind products !!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the product. My daughter bought for me for my birthday. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Very good.</li>
            <li> The Croc has not dried out my hair like other flat irons and it actually curls my hair too!!  Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have had many straighteners and this is by far the best. It heats up in less than 10 seconds. Hair-styling is easy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTNER. MY GIRLS AND I HAVE CURLY FRIZZY HAIR AND AFTER USING THE CROC YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT. IT IS EASY TO USE AND NO PRODUCT IS NECESSARY.</li>
            <li> had it only two months but i cant safely say that, so far, it is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned. paid close to 100 dollars for it and it is worth every penny. works very well on my thick hair and only requires a third of the time to do the job. leaves my hair looking polished every time and has completely eliminated the need for me to use any product in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron about two months ago. I like it! It works pretty well. I straightens my hair well, doesn&#x27;t frizz, lasts long, all good things. I like how smooth and silky the infrared makes my hair feel. The only negative thing I would say about the straightener, is that it loses heat quickly. So while I am doing a layer of my hair, I will have to wait in between a couple of pieces to let the iron heat up again. That makes it take a long time to straighten my hair. It takes me about 25 or 30 minutes to straighten my hair. I like to take a long time to straighten my hair anyway. So before I bought this iron, I had a CHI, that also lost heat quickly, and it took me about 45 minutes to straighten my hair. So it is better, and it lasts longer, and looks better then the CHI. So for me, it is worth it and was a good purchase. I know there are better straighteners out there that won&#x27;t loose heat as fast, but I think this was good for the price. But the reviews I read were slightly misleading. A lot of them make the iron sound flawless, which it is not. But overall, I think it is a pretty good straightener.</li>
            <li> this product is very good, with one stroke the hair is smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is very good, with one stroke the hair is smooth.&lt;br /&gt; heats up very fast, with regulator&lt;br /&gt; temperature, one can control</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get what people are raving about.&lt;br /&gt; I iron my hair every day. I have thin, curly hair, and i wear it straight. I have been using a generic brand knockoff chi for the past year and a half and i&#x27;ve never had any problems, but recently my dog chewed on it (it was off, thank god!) and dented the plates and I decided it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;So, after EXTENSIVE (and i do mean extensive) research I purchased the croc infrared 1.5 inch iron. even with all the customer reviews saying it would break i was willing to take my chances. It sounded THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, it came in this big box that seemed more appropriate for skater shoes, but it was really cool and i was excited to use it for storage. the iron came with a nice clip for the wires, so you wouldnt have to twist it around the iron. When i held it in my hand, i squeezed it shut and felt next to no resistance, and the plates squirming against eachother. It just didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy. I was thinking i would break this the first day.&lt;br /&gt;But it powered on nicely, and it does get seriously seriously hot. the thing is that because of the infrared lights there is a break in the plates on one side, so the iron doesnt glide smoothly along the hair and instead snags the hair and pulls, causing more breakage. The iron is also seriously uncomfortable to hold! I dont know how you hold your iron, but i use more the inside of my palm than my thumb fingerpads to press against the bottom of the iron, and this design is really uncomfortable for me. Furthermore I think a 1\\&quot; is far more manageable and leads to better results.&lt;br /&gt;bottom line: this thing leaves my hair fried, tired, dead, broken, and it takes me over an hour to do my whole head when with my cheap knockoff iron it only takes me 15-20mins! I really wish this iron had worked for me and maybe my hair is just too fragile to handle it, but I&#x27;m going to return this for a more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; flat iron. I might even be willing to try a different croc. just one with two flat plates and the normal hair iron design i&#x27;m accustomed to.</li>
            <li> I really did like this iron; however, after using this for 10 months it has a short in it. It turns on sometimes and then while I am straightening my hair it will turn off. Frustrating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons in the past and have found some very good ones.  But I have never had one leave my hair as soft and silky without additional use of products.  And, the best part is that my hair stayed straight on a humid day with light rain.  This is the only flat iron that has done this well in those conditions.  I&#x27;m now looking to see if I can find this in a travel version with dual voltage capability.  I don&#x27;t want to leave home without it.</li>
            <li> After careful research for my type hair (curly and course) I decided on the Croc for not only the reviews I found but for the price.  There are more expensive out there but I found this Iron was just as good as all the rest.  I love how fast it heats up, the temperature control, size and the length of the cord.  My hair does not need the hottest setting and considering I was using an over the counter brand that burnt my ends, my hair looks great after I straighten it.</li>
            <li> i bought this iron not even 2 months ago and the infrared light dosent work already its not like i use it alot for the light not to be working but other then that it straight my hair fine it dosent leave it as shine as i want it but its preety good..</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON GIVES A SMOOTH FINISH ALONG WITH A SILKY FEEL AND A HIGH SHINE WITHOUT ADDING PRODUCTS TO THE HAIR. THE FLAT IRON REVITALIZES HAIR THAT HAS BEEN DAMAGED AND WORKS WELL ON EXTENSION HAIR, LEAVING REUSED HAIR EXTENSIONS LOOKING BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing my hair for 5+ years now, and I&#x27;ve had the low-end Walmart flat irons to the salon brands such as CHI, SEDU, Bed Head, etc, and this iron BLOWS THEM AWAY!    I was in complete awe at how glossy and shiny it made my hair. The Infrared beams make it super cool (I still wonder if that is a bunch of BS or if its for real, but either way I think it&#x27;s cool), and it glides so smoothly down the hair. Heating up is SUPER FAST, and it tells you the temperature digitally which is nice. I used to be IN LOVE with my SEDU (I broke it in half by dropping it, RIP Sedu :&#x27;( ) And while It will still be my #1 straightener of all time, this one matches right up with it and is 1/3 the cost.     The design of it is fantastic! It is very sturdy and does not feel cheap or fragile, its body is heavy-duty and feels like it could be dropped multiple times and last (But I recommend to NOT drop it ;)  ) It looks as tough as it feels. The grip is great on this, and overall I am very impressed on how well built this straightener was made.    My only complaint about this iron is it sometimes (NOT ALL the time, i&#x27;d say 20-30% of the time) will leave a burnt smell or just a funky smell, but it eventually goes away after 20 minutes or so, and that could be because I have it on 440ºF.    I recommend this flat iron to EVERYONE! It is simply fantastic. I get my hair straightened in 15 mins or less and it is PIN straight, and super healthy! I have recieved more compliments on my hair with this iron than any other, so don&#x27;t hesitate, if you really want it and want an honest opinion on choosing this or another one of the same value, go with this one, Croc will not disspoint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect iron for about a year and I think I found it! The iron heats up extremly fast, when am rushing I can simply turn it on wait 5 seconds and its ready. The iron has one power button, but when pressed twice it turns on the infrared lights. Honestly, when I turn the infrared lights, the iron leaves my hair glossy and really natural looking, which I LOVE. It takes me less than 15 minutes to straighten my hair (I have wavy hair and  average amount of hair).The size of the iron is also perfect for curls if you know how to make them. I love the digital heat settings which range from 250 to 450, I think! I simply use 300, which is perfect for my hair. The iron does not ruin or create split ends like other irons, it really seems to help my hair. I recommend trying this iron, it really is worth the money, I would pay more than 88 dollars. If you have any question just comment and i&#x27;ll try to answer them.</li>
            <li> Croc is one of is not the best flat iron there is. The ONLY and most severe problem is they simply dont last long. Many people keep thinking the ones on here are counterfeits and they very well maybe! So I decided to check the ratings/reviews on Folica (a licensed seller of Croc and all other salon hair products). If you read the reviews on there you will see that many of them have the same problem with the units only lasting a few months to a year. Hence it would leave me to believe that in this case its not a matter of whether this Croc unit being sold on Amazon is a counterfeit or not, but simply that Croc in general does not have a good history of dependability in general. But when it does work, it works GREAT! You simply expect it to last a lot longer for as much as you pay though.</li>
            <li> I have owned many different brands of flat irons; the last 6 brands were CHI, Sedu, Hai, Helen Of Troy, Tigi BedHead, and Paul Mitchell! After having my last flat iron broke I decided yet again to change brands, since I had not found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, I decided to listen to my longtime friend, stylist, and fashion savior and try the Croc! I just recieved it an hour ago and i can already tell that this is by far THE BEST FLAT IRON I HAVE EVER OWNED!! My hair was a mess from having my ponytail partially fall out while sleeping the night before, and within 5-7 minutes my hair looks as though it is freshly washed and styled!! I even decided to go without products after straightening, which I never do, and my hair still looks and feel amazing!! Definitely worth every penny!! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking to straighten many different types of hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have had MOST of the flat irons on the market. From $70 to $250 ones. This is by far the BEST. It does not snag or pull your hair at all. It glides very easily and smoothly through the hair. I have extremely thick, coarse hair and this iron leaves my hair feeling smooth, shiny and super straight for a long time! The only problem is....it doesn&#x27;t last long! I bought mine about a year ago, and yesterrday instead of the degrees going up, they started going backwards. Today...it would not even heat up! That is why I am only giving it 4 stars. It is a great product and I am off to buy another one. It stinks that it dies so quickly, but my $250 flat iron dies in less than a year. I think that is just a problem with all flat irons!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great. It gets hot fast and leaves hair soft and shiny.  Great for thick hair, leaves hair super straight with a single pass.  Great customer service from vendor. Fast shipping, item arrived two days after the order was placed.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has TOTALLY eliminated my need for relaxing my unruly, wavy hair. If I had curls,I&#x27;d leave them well enough alone but what I have are waves; shapeless, all over the place, frizzy waves and I hate &#x27;em! This product, however, leaves my hair straighter, shinier and sleeker than EVER to the point where people think I have naturally straight hair. PLUS, it heats up in seconds... literally. There is, however, one caveat: for about one hour after its use, my hair smells IRONED. It&#x27;s not a bad odor, it&#x27;s just that it smells like an ironed shirt (my husband says he doesn&#x27;t notice it and nobody has said anything as of yet). A friend suggested I spritz my hair with a citrusy smelling cologne prior to flat ironing my tresses and I think I&#x27;ll give it a try &#x27;cause one thing&#x27;s for sure: I&#x27;m not giving this Croc flat iron up! Wholly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter for easter. Super product, love the inrared heat. We share it, but I&#x27;m going to have to buy one too. We haven&#x27;t had any issues, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron for a couple of weeks now. So far it is great.  It leaves my thick curly hair silky straight and smooth.  Great price on amazon compared to other sites. After reading other reviews I hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working.  So far I think it is one of the best flat irons I have used.  It straightens my hair with just one pass. I don&#x27;t have to go over a piece twice so it is quick. I like the swivel cord and digital display, both are great features.  I have recieved a lot of compliments on my hair since using it, because my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and shipping rates can be costly, so that&#x27;s a big factor when deciding to purchase a product online.  This was the 1st time I used Amazon so I freaked out when I realized it was FREE to ship this product and was even more amazed when I got the product in less than a week.  Paid $85.00 for flat iron that normally sells for about $160 on sale @ a local salon so I was skeptical @ 1st. The skepticism subsided once I got the product. By far, one of the best flat irons out there. My hair remains sleek and straight all day!  The only setback is that the instructions didnt mention anything about having to press the on/off button twice to turn on the infrared. Realized it when I accidently pressed the on/off button twice and the holes between the red and white plates turned red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person that I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my hair but, croc infrared iron 1.5 inche wide amazed me, it works fast and you don&#x27;t need to do it so slow.leave my hair silky and so shiny is just perfect my hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> The product does heat up nicely and it is very well made.  The only thing I have noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t shine as much as I expected compared to the one time I tried an iron of Jose Eber&#x27;s.  A sales rep demonstrated that one and who knows perhaps the iron had some of the serum they use when I asked that none would be used on my hair.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida aka Frizz Central. It&#x27;s unbelievable how my hair changes in the summer. However, I&#x27;ve never really liked flatirons because I don&#x27;t like my hair stick straight. And anyway, when I walk outside in the super humid climate, it immediately frizzes. I swear I can almost hear my hair going boing-g-g-g, boing-g-g. So, I never really try to wear it straight in the summer.   Then one day after getting my haircut, I decided I should do a Brazilian Keratin Treatment to try and de-pouf it, and ordered the QOD from Amazon. Well, dontcha know, my flatiron died that very night. And with the QOD on its way, I knew I had to replace it.  Because I&#x27;ve had problems with electric hair tools dying with little use (I have a review on one here on Amazon if you want to know the brand), I&#x27;ve been staying away from a..ahem...certain \\&quot;hot\\&quot; brand. So, I did some research of other brands. I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, just one that would get the (BKT) job done.   Well, the trouble with doing research is it makes you pretty enthusiastic for whatever it is you&#x27;re looking for. So, even though I wasn&#x27;t looking for the best, I wound up buying what I had deemed the best flatiron: the Croc Infrared. I chose the 1.5 inch because my hair is pretty long and I thought it might speed up the BKT process a bit.   At the time, I thought I was ordering more flatiron than I needed (translation: I could have gotten away with a much cheaper one) as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be using it much. But after using the Croc, I totally changed my mind. Really!  When the package came, it was kind of like Christmas, because, by this time, I was only waiting on this flatiron to do the BKT. I gleefully tore open the package, plugged it in and immediately flatironed my entire frizzy head...   And was totally blown away!  I really had just wanted to test it before loading my hair with choclatey toxic chemicals to make sure I could do the procedure. But after a mere ten minutes of flatironing, I went from Frizzy to Flat. And my hair was styled!   So I took my formerly frizzy head for a test run-- I opened the door and went outside. No Boing-g-g. Hmm, I thought, it&#x27;s only a matter of time. But no! I took my dogs out for a nice long walk in this steam haven we call Florida, and my hair STAYED STYLED and pretty much flat. I was so amazed (no, really!) I almost didn&#x27;t use the BKT.   But BKT, I did. The iron worked like a charm, and continues to work everyday.     Here&#x27;s what you should know:       - Heats up SUPER FAST     - Digital temp display and changing temperatures is really easy. Just click the up or down arrow accordingly. Duh! Even I can do that!     - Maxes out at 450 degrees F. I think this is accurate, as it gets really really hot. I mean, HOT! I burned my fingers after 3 passes with each strand when doing the BKT. When I do the BKT again, I will get a heat glove. Recommend if you do more than a couple of passes on high heat.     - The infrared, which I initially thought was a little gimmicky, really seems to make a difference. Don&#x27;t ask me how, but my hair bows to the red. And my frizzy hair never bows to anything.     - Warranty card in the box, which I intend to send in, as other reviews all over the Internet indicate this product has a history of dying while still young.      - Although this could change at any time, the best price, by far, that I could find for this iron ANYWHERE is here on Amazon. It is nearly $100 less than some other sites. And free shipping,too! Love!    Btw, the BKT worked. So well, in fact, that my hair won&#x27;t take a curl. So now I&#x27;m using this iron almost every day, which is okay with me because it&#x27;s so fast. I heart my new flatiron!</li>
            <li> For the past 8 years I have been a very faithful CHI user. A month ago I went to get my haircut and the hair stylist used this weird looking straightner, so I asked her what it was. She said a Croc. 15 minutes later she was done straightning my incredibly thick frizzy curly hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe it took her 15 minutes. I just used mine for the first time this morning and I could not be happier. Will never use any other flat iron. It goes up to 450 degrees, it heats up in seconds. And for most hair types you really only need to go up to about 350-370. It&#x27;s amazing. I am hoping it will last me a few years. Seems very durable.</li>
            <li> Purchased in August of 2011. Took very good care of this iron, it worked fine the first few months, my hair looked great. 5 months later, January 2012- it stopped heating up past 230 degrees. Only used this once or twice a week at the most. Croc will not take this item back. Now I wonder if this was authentic.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that used to take me 90 minutes to straighten and the next day or even half way through the day it would start to curl/frizz.  This straightener is fantastic.  I can straighten my hair in 15 minutes and it lasts until I wash my hair.  Everyone compliments me on how shiny and long my hair is now!</li>
            <li> I have big, 80s hair so straightening is a daily routine for me. In the past I have used Chi Ultra ($100+) and a GHD Pure ($300). I loved my GHD and thought it couldn&#x27;t be beat as it put the Chi Ultra to shame. My GHD finally gave out after 2 years. I heard my hair stylist cousin talking about the Croc, so I decided to try it (also hoping the infrared would protect my elbow length hair). After using the Croc, my hair is super silky and straight. However, the humidity isn&#x27;t that high right now, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed yet. Living in DEEP south Alabama, we have to deal with humidity that is so thick you can practically see it. So, I waited to write this review after my trip to Mexico. The Croc actually kept my hair fairly straight in the heat in Playa del Carmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read several reviews about how long the Croc lasts. Just a heads up - Croc does not recognize the warranty if purchased from Amazon. I sent mine in and the company returned it saying Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Folica.com was the only online authorized dealer according to their letter. So if it breaks, you&#x27;re out of luck if you purchase it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/16/12 - After not even 5 months of use, it is dying. It heats up as usual, but loses heat very quickly as you use it. I start off at 400 degrees and after 3 swipes in the hair it is down to low 300s. It takes forever having to \\&quot;reheat\\&quot; it every few swipes. I will definitely be switching back to a GHD - it&#x27;s well worth the money and actually lasts. So disappointed in the Croc... it worked great when it worked though. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially gave it 5 stars, but reduced it to 2 after it died so quickly.</li>
            <li> After paying over $100 for this product, I fully expected it to last longer than six months. It didn&#x27;t, in fact it broke after just 5 months of use. After hearing a strange sizzling noise, I turned the iron off in fear it might damage my hair. When I tried to turn it back on, the product would not power on. In attempting to resolve this issue by hopefully receiving a replacement product I am not able to even get a new one. Highly unsatisfied and would not recommend buying from this seller since you will not be able to obtain a replacement if your product breaks. Try something a little more expensive that hopefully is made with higher quality parts.</li>
            <li> Product worked great for 1 year - then heating element died suddenly on vacation.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!  I have thick, spirally, curly hair, but like to style it straight sometimes.  After having trouble with other straighteners leaving my hair with kinks and frizz, I finally found one that works.  The Croc Infrared Iron makes my hair look like it is naturally straight and without frizz!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about sectioning my mega thick hair off and blow drying it with a round brush before straightening.  If I am in a hurry, I just blow it out and the Croc takes care of the rest.  I also no longer have to use tons of product to make my hair straight and the infrared option makes my hair shinier!  This works better than the Chi flat irons that the stylists try to use on my hair at the salons.  I would highly recommend the Croc Infrared!</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews about this straightener, they are all true.  I had this straightener for less than three months before it broke. All of a sudden it just wouldn&#x27;t go higher than 280 degrees and the infrared would not turn on. I need to straighten my hair at a higher temperature for it be effective, so now I have to look for a new one. (Also, who knows if the 280 degrees is accurate-- it feels very cool). On top of this, I don&#x27;t see how this straightener is anything special.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with the infrared technology.   I had a normal ceramic Croc for years and really loved it, so maybe it is just this model that is defective.  But please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, don&#x27;t think it won&#x27;t happen to you!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it. I got this for my birthday in August and here we are about 10 weeks later and it just died. Apparentely there is no way to get a refund although I am going to write the company. This is bs! I will not buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Great hot iron.  Still wish the timing was less.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this flat iron!  THE BEST I have ever owned!  I am bi-racial so finding a flat iron that actually makes my hair straight and remain straight is a little difficult.  The ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past were ok, in that my hair was straight after using them, but nothing like this Croc flat iron.  I know women with wavy/curly hair who have used the Brazilian straightener and it makes their hair bone straight.  Well, using this flat iron, will make you have the same results as having a Brazilian straightener applied to your hair.  My hair is super-straight, silky, soft and is bouncy!  Totally recommend this flat iron for those that want to have bone-straight hair that is silky!</li>
            <li> I have gone through several flat irons and this is by far one of the best! I have curly hair and with Croc Infrared Iron I only have to use it once maybe twice on each sectioned hair! I can now be done in 20 minutes! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> E COMPRADO 2 PLANCHAS CROC Y CON LAS 2 E TENIDO EL MISMO INCONVENIENTE. Al poco tiempo de uso me empieza a indicar que hay un error y la plancha se apaga sola... al poco tiempo deja de encender.. tiene que haber una respuesta para esto....</li>
            <li> Was delivered February 10th 2015, used maybe 4 times. And after only 2 months it doesn&#x27;t heat up no longer and shuts off due to an error message.</li>
            <li> This flat iron sucked the life out of my hair. I returned it immediately... Spend your money on a better product</li>
            <li> UPDATE 02/04/15: It is now a little over 4 years, and the iron is still going strong. I use it every time I wash my hair, and have traveled abroad with it. The only thing that ever broke was the spring that keeps it open. However, (I do not recommend this - do not try this at home) my boyfriend got a little spring at Home Depot and fixed it in less than 10 minutes.    ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/28/10: My Sedu died on a trip a few months ago and I have been stuck with a revlon that snags and breaks my hair all the time, is super heavy, doesn&#x27;t get close to my head and leaves kinks next to the root, burns fingers, and just doesn&#x27;t straighten very well. I had been aching for a new iron and was stuck to straightening only my bangs, and suffering over the tore up hair each time. After much debate on which high end iron to order, I decided on the Croc Infrared. I LOVE IT!!!    The iron heats up super quick, and is super light, which I love!!! It made going through my super long locks a breeze (the 1.5\\&quot; is lighter than my old 1\\&quot; SEDU). But the best part is that it is completely, I repeat, completely, snag free. No more tore up hair for me!!! The fact it glides so easily and is so light and sleek looking makes it a pleasure to use and I love it&#x27;s meant for use with no hair products. My hair smelled really nice, felt nice, and no nasty product buildup on the pretty iron. Also, I used it on somewhat damp hair and the iron did not act unusual in any way. It took more than one pass on a couple sections but that is my fault for using it on damp hair. Because it was so smooth on the hair, it was still fast and fun doing my locks which are now near (gasp!) waist long!!!    I am in love with the iron. I also bought the 3 year squaretrade warranty just in case. Woohoo!!! Now I am getting a new haircut to go with this awesome iron.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a flat iron before.  My hairdresser used this one on my hair and she advised that she highly recommended this brand.  She advised that she uses it on all her clients even though at her salon they also sell the more expensive ones. I decided to purchase this brand and I am very happy I made this purchase. It is very simple to use and I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I have always been a CHI lover, but once I tried the Croc I realized that there is something else out there. Great straightening, less damage to the hair, choice of temperature. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this flat iron when I popped open the box and used it for the first time. It truly made my hair smooth and soft as promised.I used it once a week and got perfect results every time. Now 3 months later my croc died it just stopped working one day. Its hard to believe it burned out because I dont use a flat iron half as much as some people. In addition my $20 flat iron still works today after years of use and now this one that i forked out well over $150 just stops working. I am soooo upset about this. I noticed after a few weeks that the blue light that lights up once it is plugged in began to fade. I didnt think much of it because the flat iron still worked perfectly. What&#x27;s worse is that I am out of the country for months and wont be able to return it. I really feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I saw so many good reviews so I was persuaded. I think I had the temperature too high because it looks dry at first but not I&#x27;m etting the hang of it. I use chi silk infusion and I advise anyone with fine color treated hair to put the oil on your ends before curling. It made a BIG difference. I love the iron. It is very cute and it makes my hair soft and beautiful :) get this product</li>
            <li> This iron is like the rolls-Royce of irons! It heats up fast, and styles hair unbelieveably! I would recommend this item to anyone who wants their hair to look awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it less then 30 times and all of a sudden it stopped working, it would heat up and error out. I believe this was a safegaurd built in as the unit would over heat. My husband took it apart and it was a bad solder and we threw it away. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY SISTER, she had hers two months, she was the one that recommended this product to me. This iron did do a great job when it worked.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is hands down the best. Plus, if you register it you get a free one year warranty. It straightens hair quickly and effortlessly, which is especially important for thick hair like mine. Only 4 stars because it does get HOT and it is pretty easy to burn yourself with, but that seems to be a universal problem with hot iron tools.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different flat irons and none of them come close to how soft and silky this one made my hair.  With all the other ones, my hair always felt dry and brittle and would get knotted on the ends really bad throughout the day.  With the Croc, my hair is smooth, silky and doesn&#x27;t get knotted.  Not to mention it holds up in the humidity.  This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My boyfriend even commented on how much softer my hair was.  He thought I was just using a new shampoo! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Although this iron did make my hair softer, it only lasted me a little over 3 months and that was with moderate use (1-2 times a week). It just stopped working one day. I didn&#x27;t want to risk spending the money for another one and having it die on my in another 3 months, so I went with a different brand. Hopefully the company will fix this problem as it is a really good iron, it just needs to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after comparing products and reviews from many different sites.  It came in the mail yesterday and I tried it out first thing.  I have very thick, curly hair and had been wearing it in a bun all day; I sprayed some heat protector in and combed through it until it was a big frizzy mess.  I set the iron on 380 and ran it through my tresses in sections.  It worked pretty well but I had to go over each section about three times so I turned it up to 450.  This setting worked best for me and gave me salon quality strait hair (and eliminated almost all my frizz).  I was also surprised that it only took about 20 minutes because like I said I have really thick hair.  I would definitely recommend this product for similar hair types.  I have only owned a Tigi flat iron in the past with Tourmaline plates and didn&#x27;t get great results so I don&#x27;t have as much experience with other irons as many of the other reviewers.  It worked great for me though and I am hoping that this flat iron&#x27;s performance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, coarse hair. My hair stylists says its world record worthy! Chi has always been my go to flat iron. I tried to get a new one since my Chi was on it&#x27;s last leg and decided to try Karmin G3. Didn&#x27;t work AT ALL for my hair type. My hair is just too thick. My sister has a croc infrared that I tried and I LOVED it! It doesn&#x27;t even compare to anything else I&#x27;ve used, it takes the frizz right out :) I have read other product reviews saying that there&#x27;s died within a few months, so I promise to follow up! If I haven&#x27;t updated yet it means my straightener is still going strong! My sister has had hers for 6 months and no problems if that helps at all!</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 3 months.. LAMEEEEEEEEE it did wonders while it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first Croc I received was defective. Amazon was very helpful in it&#x27;s return and credit. I reordered another Croc. It works very well. My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I should have listtened to the other reviews.  9 months after I bought it, it stopped working.  It wont heat up past 280 degrees, and I cant turn on the infared feature.  Not that it matters tho, since it wont heat up.  I have had drugstore brands that have lasted twice as long.  I will never buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this iron. Mine quit within 2 months, and Amazon or Supersaver will not replace it or refund my money. I will never order from them again. This thing was great while it lasted, but read more reviews. These things do not last. I was told to contact the manufacturer for a replacement, I did. The manufacturer told me these irons are being sold illegally, the only company that can sell them legally is Ion. DO NOT BUY THIS IRON!!! If it quits working after the 30 day return policy, you are screwed!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this flat iron at such a great price. I have used it for a couple weeks and I love it. It works quickly and my hair stays smooth.  The only concern I have with this iron is that company will not honor the warranty when you but it on amazon.  What makes a company not stand behind its product.  I am hoping that the quality is there so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about not having a warranty.</li>
            <li> This is the best flatiron that I have ever used, and I have used Chi,T3 as well as other brands. This really helps to protect my hair from damage and yet get it the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li> Amazon should have a &#x27;0 Stars&#x27; rating!  Do NOT waste your money on this iron.  I bought one because it was all my hairdresser used and she RAVED about it constantly.  But once I forked out the $170.00 after my much cheaper and WAY better no-name iron died, I was not impressed at all with the product.  Granted, it works better than the $30.00 replacement I ran out to Sally&#x27;s to buy when this one crapped out, but many irons do and they DO NOT cost this much.  ******HERE&#x27;S THE WORST PART****** it quit working after 3 months.  Turned it on one day and 10 seconds later it beeped and shut off, showing an &#x27;Err&#x27; message.  That&#x27;s all it does now...ten seconds then it dies.  I know I spend a lot of time looking for reviews on beauty products so this is my way of helping those like me....if you are thinking of buying this product, I suggest you keep looking and spend your money on a better brand.  I am not the only one who has had this problem...apparently this is a very cheaply-made iron with a sleek package and hefty price tag.  Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that i have only had this straightner for about 2 weeks now, but i must tell everybody how much i love it!! Now when i bought it a couple weeks ago i got it for 76 dollars and free shipping so im glad i bought it when i did! I use to have a Chi hair straightner but after about 2 years it finally gave out, so i went an found what the best straightner out there was now a days and i found mixed reviews about the croc line. Well after using it let me tell you it is a wonderful straightner, with my chi i use to have to run it over one section of hair about 2-3 times to get it straight but with the croc once is enough. And it also leaves my hair super soft and silky! And now when i wake up in the morning after having straightned my hair the day before it still is pretty straight considering i toss and turn alot in my sleep. Now some people dont like this straightner, but i can tell you that personally its awesome!!</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my previous that died after 4 years. So far so good. Only complaint is this one does not remember my heat setting like the previous (same model) did. Other than that a great little flat iron.</li>
            <li> I did a rather extensive search and review of flat irons before I decided to purchase this as a present for my upper teen daughter. I was intrigued by the various qualities of  the product--it sounded good, especially in regard to not being damaging to the hair. My daughter loves it!  Her hair is long and has been damaged from previous flat irons, hair coloring, etc. Her hair is shiny and smooth after use of the Croc. She also reports that it heats up very quickly--which she likes, and does not burn her hair.</li>
            <li> The croc Infrared flat iron is the best I have ever used, it won&#x27;t pinch the hair while service, and leaves hair feeling and looking healthy, everyone who has had it on their hair said they loved it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron. I went to hair school and have used all kinds of flat irons for my crazy curly hair, and this is the first one that has made my hair look like it&#x27;s naturally straight. I went out the first night that I used it and got compliments on my hair from people who thought it was natural. I&#x27;m on day 3 without washing it and it still looks amazing. It&#x27;s even been raining and humid for the last 2 days and my hair is still super straight. If you have stubborn hair or hair that frizzes even after you&#x27;ve spend all day fixing it, this is for you! It also cut my straightening time in half!</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron!  i have frizzy, coarse, thick hair, being of japanese and african american parents.  my hair can look as straight as a geisha&#x27;s on one day, and blow chaka and diana out the water on the next.  for the former look, i need to put some work (read some serious time) into it and high heat is one factor.  this iron delivers high heat and super shine.  no three or four pass throughs needed!  it cuts the hair work time in half at least, which is a big deal AND my hair looks shiny and smooth.  i&#x27;ve had/have a ghd, chi and sedu and they don&#x27;t come close.  i bought this full price on another site and decided to get a back up and saw this price on amazon and am all over it!  my only complaint is that the instructions don&#x27;t mention that to turn on the infared (the lights in the middle), you need to push the on button again.  i discovered this by accident and am sure i didn&#x27;t always have the infared on until i figured this out. also, i read somewhere online that some button combo changes the temp display from fahrenheit to celsius.  somehow i did that by accident and am unsure how to change it back.  it&#x27;s not that important to me, because i always need it on the highest setting (450 F &#x3D; 230 C) but if you didn&#x27;t realize that your display had changed (or i hear some are set to display celsius over fahrenheit out of the box) one might think it was broken by not going higher than 230 when that is the highest temp in celsius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* review update 12/24/2012 *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this iron has been in my cart since i posted the above review. i reviewed the iron because i was thrilled to find it at such a phenomenal price and was i was GOING to buy it as a back up to the croc i&#x27;ve owned for 2.5 years (with no issues).  i never got around to purchasing it and was cleaning out my \\&quot;saved in cart\\&quot; and was deciding whether or not i still wanted the back up. being a serious online shopper, i feel i must always perform due diligence, so i read the negative reviews.  the common thread seems to be that the iron dies after a few months and cannot be replaced or serviced by croc because their policy states they will only cover items purchased from authorized dealers, a group of which amazon does not belong.  i purchased mine from folica which is, the unfortunate people here bought from amazon.  i&#x27;m thinking there is a reason the irons are so cheap here (i paid 180 for mine on sale).  these may be lemons, phonies or refurbs and supports crocs policy of not covering non authorized dealer sales.</li>
            <li> I did like this but after spending this much money you would expect it to last at least a year.  They won&#x27;t GTD it if you buy it on Amazon or Ebay so if it breaks you are out of luck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a very risky side of me. I wasnt sure if it would be authentic or real but i was absolutely wrong. This hair styler does wonders for me, and it has worked for  very long time. I hear a lot of people saying tht it doesnt last, and its the way you treat it. I LOVE this SOOOO MUCH!!</li>
            <li> i bought this item as a gift for a friend that has really thick hair.. She loved it when she used it the first time, made her hair look smooth and shiny.. i purchased it on nov 9 2010, it is april 21 2011 and she just phoned to ask if it could be returned because its broken.. apparently it&#x27;s set to like 350 and it goes all the up to the highest setting then shuts off.. its burning her hair.. it worked great for the five plus months she had it, but i feel for what i paid for it, it should have lasted for more than five months.. She really likes it, not sure if we will get another one.. maybe we just got a lemon.. there are so many other good reviews of this product..</li>
            <li> Received and used about 4 times so far.  Works very well and is cheapest price I found on-line.  Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is b/c I haven&#x27;t used enough to be certain it has longevity.  Also want to note that the pictures shown with this flat iron shows it says \\&quot;Croc 2\\&quot; on it. But, the Croc 2 is the 1\\&quot; iron.  The product you will receive will say \\&quot;Croc Infrared\\&quot; which is the 1.5\\&quot; iron.  As I understand it, width is the only difference between \\&quot;Croc 2\\&quot; and \\&quot;Croc Infrared\\&quot; irons (on the Croc models with the infrared plate.)</li>
            <li> this was an expensive purchase for me that I did a lot of research on for my type of hair. It would not heat past 186 degrees, no matter how many times I replugged it in. Amazon however did a full refund of the product.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned. It gets really hot in seconds &amp; my hair shines after I iron it!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I must say this flat iron is exceptional! My sister bought this flat iron at the ISSE show in Long Beach last February and I really didnt know if this \\&quot;infrared\\&quot; thing was a legit selling point but it turns out almost a year later that the infrared technology really is great. Most flat irons start to smell after a while... like old burnt color and hair and electricity all bundled up but this one makes your hair smell fresh. I used her flat Iron when I was staying with her and my husband even said he could smell a difference and I didnt even ask the man if he did or didnt. He was just passing by the bathroom and commented. On top of that it does its job in the straightening department. I have medium coarse hair and lots of it! My sister has even more and it straightens better than any straightener I have used over the years. Take it from me, its SO worth it. Not to mention its way cheaper now than ever! Im buying one for my Mom for Christmas this year and I am so happy because I thought I would be paying close to 200 for this and now its lowered to 77 here on amazon. Thats lower than the prices of awful flat irons in the professional stores I shop in. More than worth it!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal croc user. As many have said, I have had no problem with my previous croc. I thought this infrared technology sounded interesting and wanted to try it. I was so excited when I got it!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out immediately. HATED IT!!!! The bottom line...it hurt! On one side there are two separate plates which pull the hair. It was terribly uncomfortable and frankly I could not finish styling my hair. Thank gosh I still have my old croc. If you have a sensitive scalp or plain just want to keep your hair intact I would stay away from this version of the croc. I am still a loyal croc customer but THIS croc will be going back immediately!</li>
            <li> Ive had this iron for about a week and use it everyday. My previous iron was a chi, but I am so glad I switched! I color my hair , have highlights &amp; each month Im doing some type of damaging process to my hair. The iron leaves my hair silky soft and smooth. I love how you can set your own temperature and how quickly the iron heats up. It also has an automatic shut off, after like an hour of no use the iron turns itself off! I do not see that it cools off any faster than any previous iron Ive had. I hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> in my opinion these Croc infrared iron it&#x27;s amazing I love it ...!!!! I am very very satisfied how it works ....</li>
            <li> AVOID ANY CROC PRODUCTS - Dangerous defect: melting, risk of fire:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first five minutes of use of my new Croc Infrared Flat Iron, it began producing smoke, the plates melted off and became dislodged. Black glue was oozing from the product. I was concerned that the entire tool might catch on fire based on the amount of melting and smoke that occurred (see attached photos). Not only did the product turn out to be defective, it actually melted and left my home and hair smoky. I am cognizant that had I not smelled the smoke and noticed the melting quickly, the outcome could have been much worse if the iron caught on fire or burned my hair. I am appalled by this situation. I have never experienced this magnitude of defect in a product before. Buys beware: No one should ever experience this degree of risk to their safety by using a styling tool. Take your business elsewhere</li>
            <li> This flat iron lasted me 5yrs. It just broke today and I plan on buying another croc. I don&#x27;t know what the others do for them to break so quickly.</li>
            <li> heats up fast.  Easy to use.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Iron stopped working!! this is july!! I now find out only one month return policy!!! just not right,I work hard and don&#x27;t mind paying for something. the company should stand behind products !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this iron. It straigtened my extremely thick, curly, and unruly hair very quckly. However, after six months of use it now starts heating up and will then flash &amp;#34;Err&amp;#34; within a few seconds and shut down. Very disappointed with how short the lifespan was. Warranty won&#x27;t cover since I bought the product from amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought the professional Croc 1 1/2 \\&quot; to use when I would perform Brazilian Blow outs on my clients.  I loved that it reached 450 degrees. It never felt like product was built up on it. It glided thru the hair as needed. The digital display allowed me to see the temperature. All of that would make this a 5 star. Unfortunately, I unplugged it while it was heating one day, and it stopped getting any hotter than 250 on the display. I believe it gets hotter, but I&#x27;m not sure of the temperature. I use the iron personally now, and it it hot enough for my fine to medium hair density. I spoke with another client I had and she told me the same happened to her. As for someone who is using a flat iron on a daily basis on your hair, it most definitely does not need to be any higher than 400...even that is pushing it.</li>
            <li> hello , I purchased this product for my wife 7-8 months ago and yesterday it started to smell like burning and we saw the infrared part fell apart from the plastic piece. picture attached.</li>
            <li> Awesome. It makes my hair so soft and takes me half the time to straighten it. Better than a chi.</li>
            <li> i both it for my wife and she love it, i&#x27;m waiting for the energy bill :) she is very happy with it</li>
            <li> This is my third croc absolutely love the infrared lights , it&#x27;s saved my hair!! I do however like the 1 in better :/</li>
            <li> This iron does the job. I don&#x27;t know of a better iron for the same price (I paid $85), although I have tried others that are comparable (HAI, CHI, Sedu).  The digital screen does not seem to be working already so I may return.</li>
            <li> bought it yesterday 12/24/13 it got here 12/26/13. right on time for me to use it .. and i tried it already .. and very suprised with the results.. i am completely astonished with how shiny and soft is my hair now.. i also have been treating my hair with PURE 100% KERATIN that does not have whatsoever any chemicals on it. and i just did recently, hair mask MACADAMIA NATURAL OILS, in my hair and plus using this flat iron, it gave the look that everybody that sees me is asking, what iam doing to my hair that is so soft and superrrr shiny... thanks CROC with the help of your great product my hair is silky, healthy and shiny,,,</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my daughter when her cheapie from Walmart broke.  She loves it!!  Especially the 1.5&amp;#34; beacause she can get more  done in less time.  Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this the first of January of 2014 and it is already shutting down.  Since I purchased it on Amazon the warranty is not valid.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 2 years ago to assist with my Keratin treatment. In 2 years I used it maybe 10 times. Last night while using it to seal the keratin....it died. Imagine that! Halfway through the treatment. Bottom line...this flat iron, was well cared for and died after 10 uses.  I called the company in California and they told me the warranty is 1 year which I was over. It didn&#x27;t matter that I had used it very little. They also told me that because I bought it on Amazon, even if it was within the warranty period they wouldn&#x27;t do anything because Amazon is  not an authorized vendor. Her advice was to send it in for a $50 repair plus shipping both directions, or buy a new one!! I have to say neither suggestion works for me. While it was working it was fine, but a company with such crummy customer service doesn&#x27;t deserve your business!! I would have given no stars, but I gave 1 to commemorate the 10 times it worked!!</li>
            <li> Love!!!! Best one on market</li>
            <li> it just come on time, i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had the Chi straightener and beat it up pretty good and yet it still lasted for years!!! I took good care of this one and it died after 1.5 years!!! GARBAGE!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this flatiron because my hairdresser uses it and swears by it for consistently holding the temperature and putting a smooth sheen on frayed ends.  I&#x27;m loving it for it&#x27;s speed and easy-do&amp;#34;ness&amp;#34;.  My hair is fine and wavy so I part my sections (sometimes damp dry) go one pass with the flatiron at 410* and I&#x27;v got a smooth shiny bob in 15 minutes that lasts for 4 days!  If I want curls I have a totally different regimen, because this iron is all about straightness, softness, and shine.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair so nice, better than others irons, I love it!!!!! I use it almost every day and my hair is healty</li>
            <li> I bought this iron and initially loved it! Heats up quick and works great. In saying that, I have used it maybe 20 times in the last year and the last time I went to use it would not get above 210 degrees! I tried it a few days later hoping it was a fluke but no luck! For the price of this thing, it should last a heck of a lot longer!</li>
            <li> I have a solia flat iron that i bought from folica in 2008 so i thought that it was time for a new one, althought there is nothing wrong with the solia. So im using them both on my hair comparing. I must say the croc does leave my hair silkier then the solia. I am african american, with a perm. however my hair is still coarse. I turn the heat up all the way and may hair looks like i just got it done. I love this flat iron. So glad i didnt go with a chi! Try this, you will keep it. I dont know to much about infrared, but i guess it helps, lol, just seems like a light to me. All in all i read the reviews,and tried it out and am so happy i did.</li>
            <li> Broke after 8 weeks. The manufacturer won&#x27;t honor the year warranty because I purchased from Amazon. Very disappointed. The iron worked well for the short amount of time, as it should for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was amazing. The plates glided smoothly through my hair. I&#x27;ve had the Chi and it lasted a long time. My hair dresser uses the Croc Brand and each one doesn&#x27;t even last a year! She&#x27;s on her 6th one! I don&#x27;t know why she keeps on buying this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this simply because it was dual-voltage and I was in need of a straightener that would travel with me to Europe. It works great there. My major complaint is that the plates are too small. I compared the length to my Babyliss 1&#x27; straightener and it was over an INCH shorter in the heating element length. This equates to extra time to straighten my hair. I have thick, long hair and 10 minutes means extra strain on my wrists. Which come to think of it, the grip knubs on the straightener actually hurt my fingers, maybe I have kung-foo grip, who knows...ok, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This is my second one in many many years, I left my first one at the hotel in Mexico, so that is why I needed another.  Very good, I will be loyal to Croc Infrared</li>
            <li> On the advice of my professional hair stylist, I purchased the croc infrared flat iron for my upper teen who has naturally curly hair, but likes to straighten it.  She loves the way it feels on her hair.  About 2 months after Christmas (it was her present), the flat iron suddenly died on her.  She wasn&#x27;t able to turn it on at all.  The company had a good return policy, and about 10 days after shipping back the broken iron, we received her new one.  She has used this flat iron faithfully every day since February, and now 9 months later, the second croc flat iron suddenly died, and won&#x27;t turn on.  The product works exactly as advertised, and doesn&#x27;t damage my daughter&#x27;s fine hair at all.  She loves the feel of the titanium/ceramic plates, and doesn&#x27;t want to use another product.  It is frustrating that it only lasted 9 months.  Therefore I have to rate it just 4 stars.  It could just be a glitch with this particular manufacturing set.  I&#x27;m not really sure what the life expectancy of a flat iron should be, but I would hope to get at least 2 good years out of a flat iron for the price and technology.</li>
            <li> I am black with no relaxer. This flat iron is amazing! I usually have to put hair oil on before I flat iron, but I used nothing and turned on the infrared. My hair is shiny,silky and stick straight. I&#x27;m a 3c. This flat iron has changed my life! And you cannot beat the price that Amazon is selling it for.</li>
            <li> I love it,it straightens may hair very quickly and my hair is very wavy.  It heats up super quick and it leaves your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought the iron in dec 2010. I was out of us for 2 months so I started using it in february. I used it two to three times. I loved the results so much.  I haven&#x27;t found anything like it.. And one day (after just 3 uses!) it stopped working. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Warranty is not covered and unfortunately 30 days had passed so can&#x27;t return.  It sucks..  Only if it will last at-least 2 years it can be great product for $100.</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron in the middle of September 2011. I was so excited because my stylist had a Classic Croc and it was amazing! I decided to get the infrared one because I thought that it would be even better. I was so wrong. First of all, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my stylist&#x27;s. That was ok, because it was still way better than my original flat iron. It straightened my hair and I had lots of body. So after I submitted my warranty to Croc, they sent it back because apparently they do not honor it if you buy it on Amazon. That was a red flag right there. Well the week before Thanksgiving, my flat iron started shorting out and wouldnt stay on. I am very good about taking care of my things. I kept the flat iron in the box. I never wrapped the cord around it. I never dropped it. I was very careful so I know it was nothing I did. This is just a piece of crap. I have had $20 flat irons that lasted longer than this. It doesnt heat up like it did because its dying. I will never ever ever buy another Croc. Looking at other reviews now, I&#x27;m wondering if they send faulty items to Amazon customers because they know they will not honor the warranty. I am so very disgusted and angry that I wasted my money. My next flat iron will definitely be a Chi.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair straightener, use of the infrared technology part definitely makes your hair stay straight through inclement weather (I&#x27;m puertorican so I have very curly, frizzy hair). Heats up fast, I&#x27;ve been using it almost weekly since August and it hasn&#x27;t died on me, Amazon has the best pricing on it! I love the swivel cord and the little thingee attached to the cord so you can bundle the cords and make them all stay neatly in place and to avoid tangles. Cools fast, too. Definitely worth the money. Saves a lot of time and gets the job done well. I don&#x27;t even need to give my hair a blowout anymore before I straighten it, just paddle brush and blow dry and then straighten away!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Hai flat iron for the past 2 years and have been happy. However, my hairdresser recently used a Croc flat iron and I just LOVED how soft and shiny it left my hair. Plus, she straightened my hair in record time. I just received mine today and I&#x27;m excited to use it tomorrow. It came in just as described. I am taking the time to write this review because I am so impressed with how fast the item came in. I placed the order on a Saturday and I had it the following Tuesday, which is incredible because Monday was the Presidents Day holiday. I would DEFINATELY order from this seller in the future!!</li>
            <li> One pass iron. Point. Blank. Period. If you&#x27;re going fast it needs a second or two to recover the correct temperature. I use this professionally for keratin treatments, so you may not be going as fast on your own hair. The double plates and infrared option are smoothing, and add tons of shine. Might buy another for a back-up!</li>
            <li> I placed my order of the Croc Infrared flat iron with standard shipping on a Friday afternoon and it came in Monday!!! Product was intact, brand new and, in its original packaging. Better than I expected because of the fact that I was very iffy about ordering a high end flat iron on line but I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this iron! I have bought several.</li>
            <li> I found this on the Croc Website for anyone thinking about buying a Croc styling tool from Amazon or anywhere else. Sounds like alot of people are having problems with the product breaking down or not working properly...hope this helps    \\&quot;15.

            <li> Only flat I ever use.  Works great.  I have fine curly hair and this iron is the best.  It has to be replaced about once a year, but worth every penny.  I have purchased 3  so far.  I have used the In Styler and Chi.  However, this iron is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the croc.  This flat-iron is so much better than the CHI.  I only use the infra-red setting and love the sleek look that it gives my hair.  Heats up fast and has auto shut-off.  A must have for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this specific brand because I had received positive feedback from several friends.  I got it and was very happy with the results.  On the third time I tried to use it, the temperature would not rise and eventually, I would get an error code and the iron would turn off automatically.  I tried several times after with no success.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that even though the 2 times I did use it the result was great, the iron itself doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The croc infrared 1.5 was OK, not exactly as great as I had expected it to be. It worked just as well as my less expensive flat iron(amika). My hair doesn&#x27;t feel any different after using the croc. I have curly thick hair and i expected this flat iron to make straightening my hair easier and faster but it did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  It normally takes me two hours or more to flat iron my coarse, thick, curly, Polynesian hair.  With this iron, it takes about half an hour or so.  My technique to get the most out of this iron is to wash hair the night before, after washing and while hair is still damp, apply a moisturizing heat protectant (I use Aveda&#x27;s pre-treatment for straightening), the next day when hair is completely dry, heat the flat iron to 450 degrees, section hair, and go for it.  You&#x27;ll get super straight, soft, and shiny hair that lasts a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome and works wonders on my hair....when it&#x27;s working.  Thank god my boyfriend is handy and was able to fix it for me - not once, not twice, but three times!  And when I say fix, I mean he had to solder the tiny wires inside back together all 3 times.  I know you must be thinking, \\&quot;This girl had to have banged this thing around.\\&quot;  Nope; I am as o.c.d. as they come.  I take really, really good care of my things.  This thing was just a piece of junk in terms of durability.  I have since replaced it with a CHI, and will never go back.</li>
            <li> The croc make natural hair look like a relaxer. Leave the full of body and give the hair a natural gloss!!!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron and love that it lets you know just how hot it is! There is a blue light that stays on even when the iron is off that I wish would turn off because it always makes me think I&#x27;ve left it on but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> I used the iron about 3 times, it worked all right. The third time, the plates came off and the surrounding plastic started to melt from the heat, and I saw that the plates had just been taped on! This was NOT a genuine product. The plates had been taped together! This is incredibly dangerous, and whoever facilitated this should be sued.</li>
            <li> when i first got this product i was IN LOVE!! it was so cool and fancy i loved it but then... a year later... the temperature starts to drop when i straighten my hair. i mean when i run it through my hair now it just starts changing temperature.. now that i straighten my hair with this.. my hair is still frizzy!!! i look like i have a lions mane or something(probably because i havent gotten a hair cut in along time(my hair got thicker)</li>
            <li> Less than a year I&#x27;ve had this iron and it would not turn on this morning. No noise no lights, nothing. I ignored the negative feedback and I now regret it. Do not purchase this iron without the research. As I understand it the warranty is not honored if not purchased through the CROC authorized dealer. The iron is too expensive regardless of where you get it for it to stop working in less than a years time. I probably used the thing a total of 20 times as I am a regular to the salon. It was stored properly too. I&#x27;m just at a loss.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for several years and it has always worked great.  I love that it does not burn your hair and makes it very smooth without having to go over it several times.&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I go to use it and the temp will only go to 80 degrees and then it shuts off.  While I did get several years out of it, it is very disappointing to have it in perfect working condition and never having dropped it or damaged it, it just will not stay on.  Products are not apparently made to hold up since I see sooo many reviews saying the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I believe there is a manufacturing issue with this iron or a particular part of it since it does the same thing to everyone.  I don&#x27;t want to spend another $100 because of a possible thermostat problem,  This should be a type of recall with everyone having the same issue.</li>
            <li> the hair iron is excellent, the use and the hair is much softer and looks better the tips the best irons I have purchased is the only detail that brings no case: (</li>
            <li> Easy to order , the product was exactly what they described. It was for a Christmas present and it turned out awesome. Thanks</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife in Christmas of 2011 and it is still in tip top shape today. wife loves it and it&#x27;s very durable</li>
            <li> Based on other feedback and refferal from other users,  the Crock Infrared Iron meets expectations but review is too soon to provide a solid feedback as to longevity.</li>
            <li> very good price she was very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is far better than the other flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li> I anticipated buying this straightener, and I even went directly to a beauty supply store and paid full price. The first time I used it, I did not get all my curls out, it was difficult to straighten long hair with, caught strands of hair and pulled them out, as well as took an hour to straighten my below-the-shoulders-hair; as opposed to the twenty minutes my Chi takes. I was surprised despite the five-star reviews no matter what website I went to, that this straightener was as mediocre as a drug store brand. For almost two-hundred dollars- I expected better. I&#x27;ll stick to my eighty dollar Chi.  Notes: My hair is of Mexican-American and Native American Descent.</li>
            <li> The infared technology works instantly once it touches your hair ! It gives an amazing shine and it leaves your hair feeling very soft. The whole design of the box was so nice and the straighten iron itself is very nice to handle, easy grip. If your looking to invest in a straighten iron, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast and makes my wavey shoulder length hair smooth as silk in a minuteeeeeee!!!!!!  Shuts itself off if you forget too. Easy to see the temp of the iron if your vision isn&#x27;t perfect.  Has a long cord that swivels. Great product!</li>
            <li> Flat iron was great but went dead after 8 months... Company will not ship out new one! Your better off buying somewhere else with longer warranty if you really want one..</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair has really improved and is less dry after switching to this straightener. highly recommended</li>
            <li> I heard so much about how the new hair saving infrared croc straightener was the next big thing. i bought it for my girlfriend and i didnt notice a thing about her hair not getting so damaged because they  &amp;#34;supposedly&#x27; use infrared technology. then after having it for less than a year it just stopped working. one day it just wouldnt turn on anymore. i looked this problem up and contacted croc and this problem seems to happen a lot and guess what, CROC told my girlfriend to send them the straightener with an $80 money order to fix it. Thats how much i paid for it brand new! so apparently the best straightener on the planet doesnt even have a waranty. i don&#x27;t even remember the product coming with any paperwork. I was going to call CROC myself and explain to them how they are going to send me a brand new straightener with no cost because her $20 straightener that she is using now she has had for 4 years and had not one problem with it. but when i contacted amazon the company i purchased this from told me they would send me a new one if i shipped this with a $35 money order. I am very busy right now dealing with the dr and disability from work so i will probably save the hassle and just send it with the $35 money order to e shop(i believe the companies name is). So the company is a great company to deal with with out even explaining what the product did they offered me a replacement after over a year of having the product(even tho it broke 5 months ago). Im sure they have this problem for this product all the time. GIRLS OR BOYFRIENDS... DO NOT BUY TURBOLON CROC STRAIGHTENERS. your better off with a $20 staightener than one from this company. However still buy products from E shop</li>
            <li> I loved this iron and it works great on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have longevity though, since this is my second Croc that broke within only a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a christmas gift for my sister. Didnt occur to me to test it before i wrapped it and gave it to her. When she tried it, it kept on beeping error after like 10 secs and turn off. Tried the reset i saw online and eventually it stoppeddoing that. However, it would never heat up.</li>
            <li> According to the reviews I had read a heat protective pad was suppose to ce with it, which I looked forward to because my daughters old iron left marks on the furniture if it was accidently set there, sooo that was kinda disappointing. Otherwise we&#x27;re thrilled with it. Does anyone know where or how I could get one of the pads? Mine was box was still factory sealed so not sure why the pad wasn&#x27;t in there.</li>
            <li> The one I received did not turn on.  It didn&#x27;t look like it would be very smooth.  I returned it for the Classic Croc.</li>
            <li> This is a great flatiron. One of the best on the market. It stayed in use for a year before it gave out</li>
            <li> my wife was completely pleased with the product I&#x27;m so happyand she really liked it think that the best thing that they were made</li>
            <li> This  is one of the best hair care products I have ever used - the safety features are terrific, too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this flat iron after I loved how my hair felt when my hairdresser used it.  I ordered this straightner for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas 2011.  When you pay $75 for a hair straightner, you&#x27;d hope the cord wouldn&#x27;t short out 9 months later, but yeah here we are.  I thought I was in luck as the invoice was on amazon&#x27;s account history and I called Croc.  SORRY!  You didn&#x27;t purchase this straightner from an approved dealer so our 1 year warranty doesn&#x27;t apply.  Call Amazon.  Well, Amazon&#x27;s not going to help after 30 days and CROC won&#x27;t help.  Never again!</li>
            <li> The greatest flatiron ever</li>
            <li> This item was a gift.  She tells me this iron makes her hair look better than any of the other ones she has tried and she does not feel it damages her hair.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to chime in and say that I love and will not use any other straight irons besides Croc 1-1/2 titanium (not black titanium).  I&#x27;ve had the same issues as the others who have purchased from Amazon retailers - breaks after 6 months, and no warranty.  The only online retailer that has the 1-1/2 titaniums is at Folica.com.  Right now, they have their black friday sale....you get $25 off, so it works out to be $100 and no tax.  So, right now it works out to be about the same as Amazon&#x27;s pricing, and you get a warranty with the purchase!  You can go to turboion.com and click on policy to review this information.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST hair product I have ever used. I have wavy frizzie hair. I live in Florida and have tried a Brazillian blow out, I have tried every flat iron and hair product known to man. The first time I used my Croc iron I washed my hair as usual, I let it air dry and then used my Croc iron. My hair has never looked so shiny  and healthy. After four days my hair still looked fabulous. I recommend buy one today.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after a couple of years. Wife LOVES it better than her previous Chi.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how well this straightener works. I have long, think hair and what used to take 45 minutes to style now only takes about 10. Great price. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many straighteners, but this one takes the prize! I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, but it is very wavy and I have a LOT of hair. I can straighten my hair fairly quickly and it stays all day! I love it! I have had it for almost a year and it still works GREAT! It heats up really fast too. If you&#x27;re contemplating because of the price? Trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is used on diff hair types on diff settings. Coarse hair , my daughters, and my hair, broken normal.&lt;br /&gt;We do waves, straight iron out. and surprised it takes small kinks out (broken hairs flatten and seamlessly flow with rest of hair).&lt;br /&gt;A heat protector for the flatiron and the thermal hair protector is important in the process. Don&#x27;t forget to purchase those in conjunction.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife and she loved it due to its high quality</li>
            <li> I want to tell you that I am a hairdresser and this works better than the professional models. Great buy for the money........</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have super thick hair that holds smells. This straightener does not leave a burn smell in my hair like others have before. It leaves my hair silky smooth and soft. I&#x27;ll never use a different kind again!</li>
            <li> This flat iron met my expectations.  I would recommend it to anyone with thick, coarse hair.  The 450 degree temperature is enough heat to smooth my hair.  Great product!</li>
