    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>The best whitening toothpaste ever!  </li>
            <li>I was very glad it arrived on time and in great condition!</li>
            <li>I was happy to read the toothpaste is not supposed to cause tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It did a great job whitening her teeth after just one brushing.  </li>
            <li>yes and I will be ordering more !!</li>
            <li>I INSTANTLY LOVED THE WAY</li>
            <li>would do good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because It has good reviews</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be good</li>
            <li>But it tastes good...</li>
            <li>She laughed and told me about Luster NOW.  </li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster &amp; let me tell you that it is awesome.</li>
            <li>It took about three brushings for me to notice a difference, but I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but after one brush I saw amazing results literally a shade</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s picky and he even noticed an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>Service excellent and fast.</li>
            <li>I LIKED IT</li>
            <li>The turn around was great though, very prompt arrival!</li>
            <li>It also leaves a pleasant taste &amp; leaves your breathe fresh.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for two weeks and have noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will be purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I think if someone already had paper-white teeth, it would enhance the appearance, but in my case, I probably would be better off getting whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love the taste, the texture and the results.</li>
            <li>not like I had that many stains.  </li>
            <li>but I had to search since most of the stores in my area did not carry them.  </li>
            <li>Not going to lie, I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>After using the Luster NOW toothpaste for two weeks I was actually able to see a visible difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even better then the dentist&#x27;s paste and molds.</li>
            <li>The dye came right off anyway with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The taste is very pleasant and you don&#x27;t get that burning mint flavor that I associate with many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>only twice before I had amazing results that kind of blew my mind.</li>
            <li>that is what people saw most of the time my smile was on.  </li>
            <li>I personally had a great experience with this product.</li>
            <li>a blueing toothpaste is available, this is not that product.</li>
            <li>They did however send me free of charge another toothpaste with peroxide in it that is supposed to whiten teeth in days.  </li>
            <li>It tastes and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was really excited about this product....</li>
            <li>way overpriced,not worth the money !</li>
            <li>Totally excited to try the product.</li>
            <li>I usually clean with my regukar toothpaste</li>
            <li>I also noticed that this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean as well as crest whitening toothpaste, luster now doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth with that squeaky clean</li>
            <li>The toothpaste was nothing special but,it arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re rushing to a cocktail party or a work event, it&#x27;s exactly what you want to make sure your smile is sparkly when you get there.</li>
            <li>so I honestly would  not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I’m not a fan of overly sweet toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teen loved this product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I brushed with this I did not see a huge improvement but my teeth did look bright and clean.  </li>
            <li>I first read about this product on allure.com, and I was skeptical, but it&#x27;s actually kind of awesome.</li>
            <li>After having tried other products like whitening trays and strips that did not work, I am happy to have found a product that did.  </li>
            <li>AND HOW CLEAN AND FRESH MY MOUTH TASTED...</li>
            <li>They have a decent amount of product in each tube and it really is a great value for just ten dollars a box!  </li>
            <li>Really whitens!!</li>
            <li>At least it was pleasant tasting!</li>
            <li>I would have been happy with even just a temporarily whiter smile for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I recommend giving it a try to gradually whiten your smile.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem pearly and distinctly whiter.</li>
            <li>(warm reds tend to leave my teeth looking yellow)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I believe the Luster products would help the averaged person whiten and maintain a brighter and whiter smile.</li>
            <li>A temporary boost to my smile?</li>
            <li>Kind of like when makeup artists suggest you use a blue-toned red lipstick as opposed to orange-toned to make your teeth look whiter.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note though, my teeth did feel clean not filmy after brushing.</li>
            <li>and although at first it was super brite, that toned downed.  </li>
            <li>at all right after I used it.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t happen right after, but after an hour or two, look again or take another picture</li>
            <li>I would say use it right before other wise use the real teeth whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li>before, was well pleased with the results, but the idea of instant optical illusion whitening intrigued me.</li>
            <li>do think that the mixed reviews have more to do with the porosity of the enamel than anything else.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this tooth paste for the value and how well the blue coloring contrasts with the color of your teeth to make them look brighter.</li>
            <li>So this is my first ever review</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be better keep brushing with regular toothpaste and the Luster Toothpaste (mix it)</li>
            <li>If you’re a non-smoker or coffee drinker your results could prove better and last longer than mine did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only positives are that it does taste better than the baking soda toothpastes (though they are more effective long term) and it was a good travel size (albeit a really expensive one).</li>
            <li>...I tried it, and I gave a tube to a cousin getting married.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t look in the mirror right after I brush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are already pretty bright and white, but I have some yellow areas from when I was a kid and probably could use some help offsetting years of my soda habit.</li>
            <li>Well, the title of my review pretty much sums it up.  </li>
            <li>It is not a permanent whitening product which is good because it does not leave your teeth feeling sensitive like other whitening products.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>The results lasted all day, sure they faded a bit but that was to be expected</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to supplement their tooth whitening regimen.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH THAT SOME OF MY NEICES AND NEPHEWS ARE GETTING A TUBE IN THEIR STOCKINGS FOR CHRISTMAS!![[ASIN</li>
            <li>I used it for weeks without seeing much of a result.</li>
            <li>I saw it on some show that it&#x27;s supposed to create a brightening effect for up to 3 hours or something after use but really have no idea if you can tell or not.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t believe my teeth could get noticeably whiter after using a toothpaste once or twice.</li>
            <li>You do not have to use as much as you&#x27;d think, either.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a whitening effect at all.</li>
            <li>then I brush this on and leave for a few minutes (my own guidelines).  </li>
            <li>My smile does not have a fake or unnatural look, but a clean, bright, natural whiteness.</li>
            <li>It definitely met expectations the very first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this if you&#x27;re trying to give you teeth a normal whitening.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the texture of the Luster NOW toothpaste; it’s a little different from what I’m accustom to, and the color is a bright blue.</li>
            <li>It did not leave my teeth feeling sensitive and really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will say that I already have a pretty white smile but not gleaming white.  </li>
            <li>I found this stuff and didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectation.</li>
            <li>I tend to think it&#x27;s the Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes syndrome.  </li>
            <li>After having braces for about a year, I really neglected my teeth and the color was very uneven(portion of teeth above and below my brackets closest to the gum</li>
            <li>like was yellowed more severely than the center portions) and my teeth (and even braces) were yellowing to a not too severe, but noticeable shade of yellow.</li>
            <li>I had pretty yellow teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how healthy it is for your teeth</li>
            <li>but ummm, wow!</li>
            <li>At first you won&#x27;t notice a huge difference but check back in a half hour.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this would be a less permanent but pain free alternative to teeth bleaching strips.  </li>
            <li>I been using this product for the past 5 days (two times a day, which it says is safe to do) and have noticed a considerable change on the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is because I didn&#x27;t necessarily see the results \\&quot;now\\&quot; as it claims (I mean on my first brush), just don&#x27;t expect this stuff to lift too many shades in the first wash, for me it wasn&#x27;t until day 2 that I was able to see this stuff was working, that would mean a number of things though, and it&#x27;s my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I normally use my own peroxide whitening trays but they only get your teeth as white as your teeth will get and mine are pretty white but not super white</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive gums</li>
            <li>wow.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I really believed the advertisement when it said instant now.  </li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Over time, my teeth did start to look whiter throughout the day and the next few days after I had used it more often.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool little optical illusion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably alternate with a normal toothpaste, but</li>
            <li>After picking this toothpaste up again and using it regularly my teeth, and actual braces, have returned to a very pleasing pearly white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their \\&quot;White 7 for Sensitive Teeth\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It works for a week but then goes back old ways.  </li>
            <li>The Luster does not have like protect the sensitive, cavities, bacteria such as gingivitis, etc.</li>
            <li>only when I am going to constantly talk, maybe take pics or meet new people.</li>
            <li>but it is just enough to add a little brightness to your smile.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see that it was available on Amazon since it was virtually impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I only gave four stars because it took about 3 days for me to notice &amp; the packaging states &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s still much quicker than I really expected.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I flash a smile in the mirror at the door when I get home and see a small gleamer.  </li>

            <li> The first thing I noticed was the texture of the Luster NOW toothpaste; it’s a little different from what I’m accustom to, and the color is a bright blue.</li>
            <li> It did not leave my teeth feeling sensitive and really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will say that I already have a pretty white smile but not gleaming white.  </li>
            <li> I found this stuff and didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectation.</li>
            <li> I tend to think it&#x27;s the Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes syndrome.  </li>
            <li> After having braces for about a year, I really neglected my teeth and the color was very uneven(portion of teeth above and below my brackets closest to the gum</li>
            <li> like was yellowed more severely than the center portions) and my teeth (and even braces) were yellowing to a not too severe, but noticeable shade of yellow.</li>
            <li> I had pretty yellow teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how healthy it is for your teeth</li>
            <li> but ummm, wow!</li>
            <li> At first you won&#x27;t notice a huge difference but check back in a half hour.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping this would be a less permanent but pain free alternative to teeth bleaching strips.  </li>
            <li> I been using this product for the past 5 days (two times a day, which it says is safe to do) and have noticed a considerable change on the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is because I didn&#x27;t necessarily see the results \\&quot;now\\&quot; as it claims (I mean on my first brush), just don&#x27;t expect this stuff to lift too many shades in the first wash, for me it wasn&#x27;t until day 2 that I was able to see this stuff was working, that would mean a number of things though, and it&#x27;s my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I normally use my own peroxide whitening trays but they only get your teeth as white as your teeth will get and mine are pretty white but not super white</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums</li>
            <li> wow.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I really believed the advertisement when it said instant now.  </li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Over time, my teeth did start to look whiter throughout the day and the next few days after I had used it more often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool little optical illusion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably alternate with a normal toothpaste, but</li>
            <li> After picking this toothpaste up again and using it regularly my teeth, and actual braces, have returned to a very pleasing pearly white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their \\&quot;White 7 for Sensitive Teeth\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It works for a week but then goes back old ways.  </li>
            <li> The Luster does not have like protect the sensitive, cavities, bacteria such as gingivitis, etc.</li>
            <li> only when I am going to constantly talk, maybe take pics or meet new people.</li>
            <li> but it is just enough to add a little brightness to your smile.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that it was available on Amazon since it was virtually impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I only gave four stars because it took about 3 days for me to notice &amp; the packaging states &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s still much quicker than I really expected.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I flash a smile in the mirror at the door when I get home and see a small gleamer.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you use half of what you&#x27;d normally use.</li>
            <li> with \\&quot;White 7\\&quot;, this product has a fresh taste and long lasting clean without being overly minty, which I find extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I noticed just a slight difference, but nothing major, and results are definitely NOT instant.</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a long leap to conclude that my teeth have some holes for the dye to grip</li>
            <li> The only thing I did notice was a little blue hue to my teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste is not so different from other whitening toothpaste, so</li>
            <li> OVER THE YEARS I HAVE SPENT A SMALL FORTUNE ON OTHER BRANDS AND WAS NEVER REALLY HAPPY OR SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> blue reflective idea was also taken up by a cosmetics company for a line of lipsticks with more of a blue base.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if my teeth were less white</li>
            <li> BEFORE I WAS THROUGH WITH MY TUBE, I ORDERED IT TO ENSURE I WOULD RECEIVE IT BEFORE MY TUBE WAS EMPTY...</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no change in lightening or brightening of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The order arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I am going to begin checking reviews on amazon.com religiously because I don&#x27;t have the money to waste on things like this.</li>
            <li> This might be a less expensive alternative to visiting the dentist for a full on whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> Plus its small enough to throw in a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li> I do not drink coffee or soda, so maybe it&#x27;s for extreme cases</li>
            <li> Not in the mirror, but to other people and on camera.</li>
            <li> However since I don’t see myself giving up coffee any time soon I’m not sure how well the effects actually are.</li>
            <li> I am very curious to see how this works over time and if my teeth do get whiter.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I have tried just about all of the other whitening tooth pastes out there.  </li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are whiter than others and the whiter ones got slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> after brushing my teeth with this they do appear to be brighter and slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> It comes just as the picture shows with three little tubes in one box.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned it worked after a few days but the product name is misleading.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I will have to finish using the toothpaste until it&#x27;s gone so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> It is not a huge difference</li>
            <li> Used everyday and usually after meals going on 2 months now and results aren&#x27;t noticeable</li>
            <li> But, sad to say it left my teeth unevenly colored.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> The BzzAgent program sent me a few samples of Luster NOW!</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money !</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to review.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I had high hopes from the write-up.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to half of the other reviews, I only received two &#x27;tubes&#x27; and the product was terrible.</li>
            <li> this stuff seriously works I also used the stain remover one with my whitening one</li>
            <li> (ridiculous product name) toothpaste</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product is terrible only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Poor taste with no effect on color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I saw no difference and its</li>
            <li> not happy with results!</li>
            <li> Sorry that is not what they advertise</li>
            <li> Utterly useless, did not even give the illusion of temporarily whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would work for me because I have tetracycline stains and very thin enamel.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that my teeth look whiter, but they weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I used it and was disappointed,</li>
            <li> Disappointed to see the toothpaste is from China.. won&#x27;t be using this, don&#x27;t trust chemicals I injest from China.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful but was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t hate.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m Very Disappointed I have used it as the direcctions says and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks and have noticed a huge difference! It did not leave my teeth feeling sensitive and really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster &amp; let me tell you that it is awesome. It is not a permanent whitening product which is good because it does not leave your teeth feeling sensitive like other whitening products. Instantly after brushing your teeth you can see that they appear to be whiter. I love this stuff and will be purchasing it.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I just bought it to try it out.  But it works.  I usually clean with my regukar toothpaste then I brush this on and leave for a few minutes (my own guidelines).  I think it works.  I feel like I should be on a commercial. I really don&#x27;t look in the mirror right after I brush.  At the end of the day, I flash a smile in the mirror at the door when I get home and see a small gleamer.  I just imaginethat that is what people saw most of the time my smile was on.  But I have to say: I did get my teeth bleached in the spring and although at first it was super brite, that toned downed.  When I use this paste, it &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; my current color.  Like radiance for my teeth.  I dont use it every day- only when I am going to constantly talk, maybe take pics or meet new people.</li>
            <li> After having braces for about a year, I really neglected my teeth and the color was very uneven(portion of teeth above and below my brackets closest to the gum like was yellowed more severely than the center portions) and my teeth (and even braces) were yellowing to a not too severe, but noticeable shade of yellow. After picking this toothpaste up again and using it regularly my teeth, and actual braces, have returned to a very pleasing pearly white. The taste is very pleasant and you don&#x27;t get that burning mint flavor that I associate with many other toothpastes. I&#x27;d highly recommend this if you&#x27;re trying to give you teeth a normal whitening. Plus its small enough to throw in a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff and didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to it&#x27;s name. I use it every time I go out with my friends and someone always tells me how white my teeth are and asks me how I got them so white. I love this stuff! Just brush your teeth and they&#x27;re white! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> My husband and I were using this toothpaste for a week, brushing twice a day. I noticed just a slight difference, but nothing major, and results are definitely NOT instant. I think if someone already had paper-white teeth, it would enhance the appearance, but in my case, I probably would be better off getting whitening strips. A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well, the title of my review pretty much sums it up.  I will say that I already have a pretty white smile but not gleaming white.  Maybe if my teeth were less white I might have noticed?  I have really sensitive gums so I was hoping this would be a less permanent but pain free alternative to teeth bleaching strips.  It wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I love the taste, the texture and the results. My teeth were whiter and shinier instantly. The results lasted all day, sure they faded a bit but that was to be expected so I can&#x27;t hate. I am very curious to see how this works over time and if my teeth do get whiter. So far I love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I personally had a great experience with this product. I&#x27;ve used their \\&quot;White 7 for Sensitive Teeth\\&quot; before, was well pleased with the results, but the idea of instant optical illusion whitening intrigued me. The paste did stain my face where I let the foam escape, but who freaking cares when your teeth are suddenly whiter?! The dye came right off anyway with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that the mixed reviews have more to do with the porosity of the enamel than anything else. I&#x27;ve peroxide-bleached my teeth twice before, and I have the aforementioned sensitivity; I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a long leap to conclude that my teeth have some holes for the dye to grip into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with \\&quot;White 7\\&quot;, this product has a fresh taste and long lasting clean without being overly minty, which I find extremely painful. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to supplement their tooth whitening regimen.</li>
            <li> Service excellent and fast. The product is terrible only lasts for a few hours. It is like paining your teeth. Would never use again but would buy from seller.</li>
            <li> A FRIEND HAD ORDERED \\&quot;LUSTER WHITENING TOOTHPASTE\\&quot; AND GAVE ME A TUBE OF IT...I INSTANTLY LOVED THE WAY MY TEETH SPARKLED AND HOW CLEAN AND FRESH MY MOUTH TASTED...BEFORE I WAS THROUGH WITH MY TUBE, I ORDERED IT TO ENSURE I WOULD RECEIVE IT BEFORE MY TUBE WAS EMPTY...OVER THE YEARS I HAVE SPENT A SMALL FORTUNE ON OTHER BRANDS AND WAS NEVER REALLY HAPPY OR SATISFIED. I ALSO HAD NEVER SEEN ANY RESULTS...UNTIL I STARTING USING \\&quot;LUSTER\\&quot;..I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT SOME OF MY NEICES AND NEPHEWS ARE GETTING A TUBE IN THEIR STOCKINGS FOR CHRISTMAS!![[ASIN:B004XMC3AQ Luster NOW! Instant Whitening Toothpaste]]</li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are whiter than others and the whiter ones got slightly whiter. However, the not-as-white teeth seemed to stay the same. I used it for weeks without seeing much of a result.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for the past 5 days (two times a day, which it says is safe to do) and have noticed a considerable change on the shade of my teeth. It tastes and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth. The reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is because I didn&#x27;t necessarily see the results \\&quot;now\\&quot; as it claims (I mean on my first brush), just don&#x27;t expect this stuff to lift too many shades in the first wash, for me it wasn&#x27;t until day 2 that I was able to see this stuff was working, that would mean a number of things though, and it&#x27;s my personal experience with the product. I recommend giving it a try to gradually whiten your smile.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just for the claims of instant results.  I was hoping to use it for my wedding.  I wanted whitening that was noticable but not appressive to my enamel.  Unfortunately I saw no difference and its not like I had that many stains.  I do not drink coffee or soda, so maybe it&#x27;s for extreme cases but I will continue to use it to see if multiple uses is the key.  On a positive note though, my teeth did feel clean not filmy after brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product today and used it twice.  I&#x27;ve seen no results what so ever.  Another reviewer mentioned it worked after a few days but the product name is misleading.  I gave it two stars because it worked as a toothpaste</li>
            <li> This is really only temporary! In the commercials it makes you think it whitens as you brush. Well it has a blue hue so it just stains the teeth. Only for about 2-3 hours.if you are having photos taken then I would say use it right before other wise use the real teeth whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I was told to try this by a woman at my work who swore by it.  I was a little hesitant because I have tried just about all of the other whitening tooth pastes out there.  I found it at Walgreens but I had to search since most of the stores in my area did not carry them.  I was so excited to see that it was available on Amazon since it was virtually impossible to find in stores.  It comes just as the picture shows with three little tubes in one box.  They have a decent amount of product in each tube and it really is a great value for just ten dollars a box!  The first time I brushed with this I did not see a huge improvement but my teeth did look bright and clean.  Over time, my teeth did start to look whiter throughout the day and the next few days after I had used it more often.  It is not a huge difference but it is just enough to add a little brightness to your smile.  I did notice that my teeth look whiter, but they weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  I am pleased with this tooth paste for the value and how well the blue coloring contrasts with the color of your teeth to make them look brighter.</li>
            <li> I first read about this product on allure.com, and I was skeptical, but it&#x27;s actually kind of awesome. At first you won&#x27;t notice a huge difference but check back in a half hour. My teeth seem pearly and distinctly whiter. Downside is it&#x27;s not permanent, you need to use it a couple times a day-but if you&#x27;re rushing to a cocktail party or a work event, it&#x27;s exactly what you want to make sure your smile is sparkly when you get there. Beware though, if you get it on your lips you&#x27;ll look like you need oxygen!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was really excited about this product....read about it in a mag and thought wow.....I normally use my own peroxide whitening trays but they only get your teeth as white as your teeth will get and mine are pretty white but not super white like I want them to be...it&#x27;s just the max whiteness my teeth will get.  That being said I thought for 8.99 on sale I would try this since the contrasting color effect made a lot of sense.  I used it and was disappointed, my husband and I both did not notice any difference at all right after I used it.  But in 15 minutes or so the blue molecules must have penetrated my teeth because they became really white.....so those of you who are bummed that it doesn&#x27;t work immediately wait a bit and re-check, you&#x27;ll definately see a difference.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product, but to my surprise, it works. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any results for about a week. In my opinion, this product is a great/cheaper option to maintain white teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I really believed the advertisement when it said instant now.  I have wasted my money.  I have seen absolutely no change in lightening or brightening of my teeth.  A $2 tube of toothpaste would have done just as well a job.</li>
            <li> this is not the product requested. a blueing toothpaste is available, this is not that product. way overpriced,not worth the money !</li>
            <li> The order arrived sooner than expected. I also noticed results after use without sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> yes and I will be ordering more !!</li>
            <li> I just have no idea if this works or not. I saw it on some show that it&#x27;s supposed to create a brightening effect for up to 3 hours or something after use but really have no idea if you can tell or not. So then what&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectation. Used everyday and usually after meals going on 2 months now and results aren&#x27;t noticeable</li>
            <li> So this is my first ever review but I had to leave one I had pretty yellow teeth but after one brush I saw amazing results literally a shade whiter then at night I brushed again ...I now have pearly whites this stuff seriously works I also used the stain remover one with my whitening one and it&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as advertised.  not happy with results!</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I LOVE this stuff. For white teeth anyway. I&#x27;m not sure how healthy it is for your teeth so I use it sparingly. It&#x27;s a noticeable difference, too. Not in the mirror, but to other people and on camera. Give it time to whiten your teeth. It won&#x27;t happen right after, but after an hour or two, look again or take another picture and you&#x27;ll have those pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Totally excited to try the product. Disappointed to see the toothpaste is from China.. won&#x27;t be using this, don&#x27;t trust chemicals I injest from China. The rinse and gel are from Canada, will try these and see how they work.</li>
            <li> This product was guaranteed to instantly whiten teeth.  I used it for several days to no avail.  I e-mailed them and the response was &amp;#34;well it works with people who have very yellow teeth&amp;#34;  Sorry that is not what they advertise so I honestly would  not waste your money.  They did however send me free of charge another toothpaste with peroxide in it that is supposed to whiten teeth in days.  We will see.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all, even after using two tubes!  Disappointed because I had high hopes from the write-up.  May work for others, but not me.</li>
            <li> It works for a week but then goes back old ways.  Maybe it would be better keep brushing with regular toothpaste and the Luster Toothpaste (mix it) would do good.  The Luster does not have like protect the sensitive, cavities, bacteria such as gingivitis, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to review. It definitely met expectations the very first use. But, sad to say it left my teeth unevenly colored. Which makes sense since it&#x27;s not something you evenly concentrate to each tooth. I&#x27;d definitely call it a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe my teeth could get noticeably whiter after using a toothpaste once or twice. My teeth are already pretty bright and white, but I have some yellow areas from when I was a kid and probably could use some help offsetting years of my soda habit. I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my teeth any whiter without expensive bleaching. The BzzAgent program sent me a few samples of Luster NOW! toothpaste to try, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Luster NOW! (ridiculous product name) toothpaste only twice before I had amazing results that kind of blew my mind. They look like I had them done at the dentist! I put on a reddish lipstick just to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me (warm reds tend to leave my teeth looking yellow) but ummm, wow! I&#x27;ll probably alternate with a normal toothpaste, but Luster NOW! will be a fixture in our house from now on. My husband tried the toothpaste just once and had noticeable results as well. He&#x27;s picky and he even noticed an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ! Saw 0% improvement . I was so hopeful but was so disappointed. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This product truly whitened my teeth &amp; maintains the whiteness. My smile does not have a fake or unnatural look, but a clean, bright, natural whiteness. It also leaves a pleasant taste &amp; leaves your breathe fresh. You do not have to use as much as you&#x27;d think, either. I suggest you use half of what you&#x27;d normally use. I only gave four stars because it took about 3 days for me to notice &amp; the packaging states &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s still much quicker than I really expected. Give this a try!</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend purchasing this item. I didn&#x27;t notice any change at all. I would definitely stick with whitening strips in the future. The only thing I did notice was a little blue hue to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I used Luster Now for 30 days and had no change in the whiteness of my teeth.  This product is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the texture of the Luster NOW toothpaste; it’s a little different from what I’m accustom to, and the color is a bright blue. The taste is not so different from other whitening toothpaste, so that with a plus. I’m not a fan of overly sweet toothpaste. I was happy to read the toothpaste is not supposed to cause tooth sensitivity. I drink around two mugs off coffee every morning, and we all know that causes stains. After using the Luster NOW toothpaste for two weeks I was actually able to see a visible difference in the color of my teeth. However since I don’t see myself giving up coffee any time soon I’m not sure how well the effects actually are. If you’re a non-smoker or coffee drinker your results could prove better and last longer than mine did.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I believe the Luster products would help the averaged person whiten and maintain a brighter and whiter smile. This might be a less expensive alternative to visiting the dentist for a full on whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> Utterly useless, did not even give the illusion of temporarily whitening my teeth.  Total waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was nothing special but,it arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because It has good reviews and I thought it would be good but I&#x27;m Very Disappointed I have used it as the direcctions says and It DIDN&#x27;T work...so people don&#x27;t spend your money on it!</li>
            <li> I, too, read this in a magazine and purchased it based on the glowing recommendation (when will I learn?).  Instant tooth whitening without the sensitivity issues?  A temporary boost to my smile? Sign me up.  I have now tried every iteration suggested--wait 15 minutes, wait 30 minutes, try it twice a day, use it over the course of a week--all to no avail and no noticeable results.  None.  I did not expect a miracle, but I did expect to see something.  Anything.  I would have been happy with even just a temporarily whiter smile for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blue reflective idea was also taken up by a cosmetics company for a line of lipsticks with more of a blue base.  That didn&#x27;t work either and they eventually abandoned the marketing campaign.  I tend to think it&#x27;s the Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes syndrome.  The only positives are that it does taste better than the baking soda toothpastes (though they are more effective long term) and it was a good travel size (albeit a really expensive one).</li>
            <li> ...I tried it, and I gave a tube to a cousin getting married. I really don&#x27;t see a whitening effect at all. But it tastes good...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that after several uses my teeth are going to Luster.  I do know that after drinking red wine this toothpaste kicks butt!  I was very glad it arrived on time and in great condition!</li>
            <li> The best whitening toothpaste ever!  Even better then the dentist&#x27;s paste and molds.</li>
            <li> A lot of hype, just didn&#x27;t whiten like a I thought or hoped it would. At least it was pleasant tasting! The turn around was great though, very prompt arrival!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool little optical illusion. Kind of like when makeup artists suggest you use a blue-toned red lipstick as opposed to orange-toned to make your teeth look whiter.  About 10-20 min. after brushing my teeth with this they do appear to be brighter and slightly whiter. I have braces so I&#x27;m constantly brushing my teeth throughout the day.  I use my regular toothpaste in the morning and before bed but Luster Now is my choice after snacks/meals/coffee.  I also like that this comes in packs of 3 mini-tubes. I keep one tube at home, one at the office and one in my purse.  Temper your expectations and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Still using it.  Feel like its working, however, still waiting.</li>
            <li> My teen loved this product.  It did a great job whitening her teeth after just one brushing.  I was skeptical that it would work for me because I have tetracycline stains and very thin enamel.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It took about three brushings for me to notice a difference, but I am very pleased with the results.  After having tried other products like whitening trays and strips that did not work, I am happy to have found a product that did.  My husband used it, and he saw instant results.  I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s teeth were visibly whiter and I asked her if she had been to the dentist to whiten.  She laughed and told me about Luster NOW.  Really whitens!!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to half of the other reviews, I only received two &#x27;tubes&#x27; and the product was terrible. Poor taste with no effect on color.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have veneers and this was the only product that seems to whiten them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the color of my teeth. I bought this product because it promised &amp;#34;whiter teeth after one brushing&amp;#34;. The only thing it did was leave a bluish residue on my teeth.. I guess that is what is supposed to make your teeth look whiter? I will stick to using whitening toothpaste. I am going to begin checking reviews on amazon.com religiously because I don&#x27;t have the money to waste on things like this. I will have to finish using the toothpaste until it&#x27;s gone so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste. I also noticed that this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean as well as crest whitening toothpaste, luster now doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth with that squeaky clean (when you can hear the squeaking from your toothbrush while brushing your teeth).</li>
            <li> Been using it for three weeks and there is no difference at all in my teeth . Waste of money, don&#x27;t bother</li>
