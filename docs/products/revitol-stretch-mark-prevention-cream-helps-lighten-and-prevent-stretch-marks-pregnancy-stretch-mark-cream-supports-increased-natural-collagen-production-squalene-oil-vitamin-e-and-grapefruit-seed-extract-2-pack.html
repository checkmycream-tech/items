            <li>and I so happy !!!!</li>
            <li>Everything was OK!!  :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, it absorbs very quick</li>
            <li>Works way good with the roller before putting on, roller exfoliates</li>
            <li>and I started using it to avoid getting more stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so it seeps in better.</li>
            <li>I use many  </li>
            <li>So I will finish my bottle and hope to see better results.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>so I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>My daughter like&#x27;s her roller better than the cream for aiding with her stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and they have filled out more and are lighter in color.</li>
            <li>Loved this cream, it really seemed like it made the stretch marks disappear.</li>
            <li>I was overly confident and used the Mama Bee&#x27;s or something like that in the yellowish tub with the cute pregnant mama bee on the label, by month 9</li>
            <li>I use a lot of different products for stretch marks but never see good results</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I love it!</li>
            <li>but my old stretch marks have significantly faded!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to keep using and see what will happen later!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more, and add additional essential oils to it as well.</li>
            <li>well I think it&#x27;s more for long term use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it make my stretch marks lighter but still very visible.</li>
            <li>So it hasn&#x27;t worked much for me.</li>
            <li>Who knows if this stuff is really the miracle that I think it may be</li>
            <li>I think its going to take some time to really see any results.</li>
            <li>My order did come in quite fast though which was very pleasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery, and really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to tighten the skin or lighten strecth marks.</li>
            <li>But I do know that I used it with my first pregnancy and not my second and sure enough</li>
            <li>I have old stretch marks from my first pregnancy(10yrs ago).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 7 1/2 months pregnant with my second</li>
            <li>SO now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my 3rd</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell it works good since i used only for a week .</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark with my first (and you&#x27;d think with the first you see more hard core stretching).  </li>
            <li>With the use of a derma roller to penetrate my skin to the dermis level first, then following up with this cream, my marks on my arms definitely diminished from the first two bottles used.</li>
            <li>mine are over 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that not only am I not getting new marks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using revitol for a little over a month, but haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks now. I have old stretch marks from my first pregnancy(10yrs ago). I&#x27;m now 7 1/2 months pregnant with my second and I started using it to avoid getting more stretch marks. I&#x27;ve noticed that not only am I not getting new marks but my old stretch marks have significantly faded! I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, it absorbs very quick so you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy, waiting forever for the product to absorb or getting it all over your clothes. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> I used this during my entire pregnancy and I have zero stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I used this just topical for 2 weeks saw minimal results. Just had twins in December so I got STRETCHED! Stopped regime and started 2 weeks ago after showers but before I put it on I roll my belly with a derma roller (look into this product to!) and they have filled out more and are lighter in color. Works way good with the roller before putting on, roller exfoliates so it seeps in better.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not yet, but it definitely makes your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I use many  and I did not see any change</li>
            <li> Notice a small change in skin complexion but not sure if it is from this lotion or from other products.</li>
            <li> So I usually don&#x27;t try stretch mark stuff because nothing seems to work. But everybody was raving about retivol so I decided to give it a try. You know things like this take time so I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it make my stretch marks lighter but still very visible. So it hasn&#x27;t worked much for me. It&#x27;s not greasy but it&#x27;s not really mostirizing either so I&#x27;m bit a fan of how it feels well I think it&#x27;s more for long term use. So I will finish my bottle and hope to see better results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell it works good since i used only for a week . however it lightened my stretch mark!! I&#x27;d love to keep using and see what will happen later!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say whether the cause of stretch marks is genetic or depends on the sex of your baby or the quality of your stretch mark cream.  But I do know that I used it with my first pregnancy and not my second and sure enough, I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark with my first (and you&#x27;d think with the first you see more hard core stretching).  With my second I was overly confident and used the Mama Bee&#x27;s or something like that in the yellowish tub with the cute pregnant mama bee on the label, by month 9 I was ravaged!!!!  I&#x27;ll never be the same.  SO now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my 3rd I&#x27;m stocking up. Who knows if this stuff is really the miracle that I think it may be but hopefully it helps.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. mine are over 10 years old. With the use of a derma roller to penetrate my skin to the dermis level first, then following up with this cream, my marks on my arms definitely diminished from the first two bottles used. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more, and add additional essential oils to it as well.</li>
            <li> Loved this cream, it really seemed like it made the stretch marks disappear. Buying my 2nd 2 pack for the last 5 weeks of pregnancy...</li>
            <li> The tube burst under the weight of different freight.&lt;br /&gt;I am very sorry to see this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using revitol for a little over a month, but haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement. I think its going to take some time to really see any results. I&#x27;m going to continue using revitol and will update on my results. My order did come in quite fast though which was very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Not the results I wanted but stretch marks definitely faded</li>
            <li> Ecxellent !!!!! I use a lot of different products for stretch marks but never see good results , now I use Revitol and I so happy !!!! Thnx</li>
            <li> Minimal results thus far .....&lt;br /&gt;and its been about a month. ..so I will give it more time. Patience is a virtue atleast I hope so.</li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t seen results and I&amp;#34;ve been using the product for about a month now. It&#x27;s very watery, and really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to tighten the skin or lighten strecth marks. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter like&#x27;s her roller better than the cream for aiding with her stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Everything was OK!!  :D</li>
