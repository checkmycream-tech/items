            <li> Have tried other similar products off and on and always end up going back to this.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel and look more full without feeling nasty.</li>
            <li> It works about the same as any other voluminizer.</li>
            <li> use it every time i wash my hair to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> put it in my hair while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I think it works a little in terms of adding volume.</li>
            <li> then I stopped using it because I noticed my hair lost its shine/luster and started to feel like dried hay.</li>
            <li> Gives lift and body without making it stiff and then needing a chisel to comb it.  </li>
            <li> It just made my hair feel dirty and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Really tough call.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and although it doesn&#x27;t thicken it up dramatically, I can feel the texture difference and like it.</li>

            <li> Another winner. Makes a big difference . One of my favorite of this product line</li>
            <li> I use Stay and Play hairspray, and this thickening spray replaces the mousse I had been using.  I like it a lot, it mists on right where you want it, and leaves hair very soft and nice.  I have very thin hair and although it doesn&#x27;t thicken it up dramatically, I can feel the texture difference and like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray, it does seem to do what it should, dense up my hair. However, don&#x27;t over-use it. I overdid it the first time I used the spray and it left white flakes in my hair. It must have been too much. And no, I don&#x27;t have dandruff. Now I used it every day, just a spritz or two, work through my hair, and that&#x27;s all you need. Otherwise, great product. Make sure you get a good shampoo, don&#x27;t want this to cake up in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my super fine, lifeless hair.  use it every time i wash my hair to blow dry.  I wear my hair short and this gives it some life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still undecided, not because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says, but because I&#x27;m not a fan of&lt;br /&gt;stiff hair. I like, and I don&#x27;t. Really tough call.</li>
            <li> I think it works a little in terms of adding volume. I used it twice then I stopped using it because I noticed my hair lost its shine/luster and started to feel like dried hay. It might be suitable for people who are spiking their hair or shaping their hair but I like mine semi-soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and find it is the best for my fine hair.  Have tried other similar products off and on and always end up going back to this.  It is great for volume and umph!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this. It makes my hair look and feel sooo much fuller and I have great volume. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but it is fine.  This spray thickens it up and makes a big difference, this is the best hair thickening product I could find.  Their mousse is also very good.</li>
            <li> Used it on my hair and really seen the difference love it&lt;br /&gt; will buy it again love all the Sexy products but, never had tried  this one but, love it ♥</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My BFF is a hair stylist, she gave me a sample to try. I fell in love. Makes your hair feel and look more full without feeling nasty.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My hair is grateful for it.  Gives lift and body without making it stiff and then needing a chisel to comb it.  Great service as always.</li>
            <li> Another product that doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s advertising. It works about the same as any other voluminizer. I feel all the &amp;#34;Big Sexy Hair&amp;#34; products are highly over rated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any thickening of my hair. It just made my hair feel dirty and weighed down.</li>
            <li> SOO useful. You will notice the difference when using this before your styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in my hair while my hair is still wet. It helps spread this product throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t feel any thicker. It does nothing</li>
