            <li>Absolutely stunning color!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOR!  </li>
            <li>I liked the color but the consistency of the gel is not the most desirable ..</li>
            <li>Awesome bright Barbie Pink.  </li>
            <li>Nice and bright color, makes my nails look hot, love love love this color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the Gelish neons.</li>
            <li>I love this color for summer.</li>
            <li>Stays on for up to 2 weeks for me, as most of my Gelish nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I just wish it went on the nail better.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure my salon did not run out of it, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li>They are not kidding when they say Brights. :)</li>
            <li>and I love free shipping.</li>
            <li>This color is fun and spunky! :)</li>
            <li>So far the best bright pink I have bought yet.  </li>
            <li>It is very bright electric pink that also glows under UV light, so</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color and the price was great, but it&#x27;s a little challenging to get an even coat.</li>
            <li>Gelish is a must buy if you enjoy having polished nails.  </li>
            <li>Before I put it under the uv light I have to brush each nail again and sometimes it has still receded away from the end and edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this color a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fluorescent corally pink and it is great for summer.</li>
            <li>Three coats are needed to achieve the true color.  </li>
            <li>But I really like the orange better.</li>
            <li>Cool colour.</li>
            <li>Love this color so much, I bought 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li>Now, if I could only find a good match for my toes?</li>
            <li>Took some practice with the gelish colors to get my painting up to par, but very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>This is a really bright, neon pink.</li>
            <li>This is my very favorite pink</li>
            <li>Overall, the color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the larger size</li>
            <li>I love all of them and have several!</li>
            <li>It will look pretty for Spring.  </li>
            <li>Think it is more for the younger generation.</li>
            <li>Still a fun, summery color, but it looks more orange than pink.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this for the summer.</li>
            <li>It is neon which I didn&#x27;t really want</li>
            <li>pink over top of it</li>
            <li>The one time I wore this polish there were at least 30 strangers who approached me telling me how much they loved my nails.  </li>
            <li>After other reviews I thought I finally had found a bright coral/peach.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice pink I would call it a low profile pink not to bright but still not washed out, it appears to be a creme color I would recommend adding either Vegas Nights for a color boost or Ambience to give it a low shimmer.</li>
            <li>the color shown on my (and maybe your) computer screen for this product is much more pink than the actual color of this polish, which is very neon.</li>
            <li>Cures beautifully, no shrinkage and gorgeous color.  </li>
            <li>Indoors, it looks like a really pretty hot pink with a hint of melon.</li>
            <li>Love Gelish nail colors, but not sure about this one.  </li>
            <li>Great Barbie pink color and fast shipping, just too thin for my liking!</li>
            <li>Well let me tell the trith, it is Hot Pink.  </li>
            <li>I have another gelish that is Hot Pink</li>
            <li>It is closer to a hunter-vest-orange than a hot pink (which is what we wanted).</li>
            <li>The polish is thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Thin liquid buy goes on easy</li>
            <li>It is not too thick, not too thin and applies smoothly, 2-3 layers give true opaque color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Last very long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a highlighter fluorescent pink that definitely stands out!</li>

            <li> Kind of disappointed - it&#x27;s nothing like what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> ; I tend to buy pink colors.</li>
            <li> This is a eye popping neon pink.</li>
            <li> or if you were doing a PINK OUT.  </li>
            <li> and it toned it down.</li>
            <li> but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting a coat of white polish underneath because its thin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago -</li>
            <li> (I hear it can go longer, but I grow bored with the same color after two weeks.)</li>
            <li> Even three coats did not do the trick it is just so thin!</li>
            <li> I think with a neutral/white base that would help, but I do not recommend using this without a colored base.</li>

            <li> I love the color- bright, and perfect for spring. Takes at least three thin coats to get good coverage though, so I took a star off for that.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely wonderful.  It&#x27;s bright and cheery and great for summer.  This color was opaque in two coats and applied evently. I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the Gelish neons.</li>
            <li> I love this color for summer. It is a bright orange/pink color. The polish is thin and easy to apply. Three coats are needed to achieve the true color.  I also bought &amp;#34;you make me blink pink.&amp;#34; I tend to buy pink colors. But I really like the orange better.</li>
            <li> Cures beautifully, no shrinkage and gorgeous color.  Gelish is a must buy if you enjoy having polished nails.  Mine always last-no chipping for two weeks! (I hear it can go longer, but I grow bored with the same color after two weeks.)</li>
            <li> After other reviews I thought I finally had found a bright coral/peach.  The picture looked  like a peach.  Well let me tell the trith, it is Hot Pink.  I have another gelish that is Hot Pink and they match.  Why would they sell two?  I don&#x27;t know but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is a eye popping neon pink. I used silver craft glitter on tips (before cleansing second coat) for an even prettier effect. Lots of compliments on these nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color!  Awesome bright Barbie Pink.  This is my very favorite pink and I have a ton.  Great summer color or if you were doing a PINK OUT.  Gelish is awesome.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted great price and I love free shipping.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I tried this. It is closer to a hunter-vest-orange than a hot pink (which is what we wanted). Still a fun, summery color, but it looks more orange than pink.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for summer. I recommend putting a coat of white polish underneath because its thin. I noticed pretty much all neons are thin, so be prepared for 3 coats!</li>
            <li> Nice and bright color, makes my nails look hot, love love love this color.  A must have color for summer. Got my five stars.</li>
            <li> This is a must have gelish color. Gorgeous bright neon pink/coral color. Very happy with this polish. I did 3 coats of polish.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to be so bright. It is very bright electric pink that also glows under UV light, so it&#x27;s a great choice for a girls night out. I receive compliments on it a lot too. It is not too thick, not too thin and applies smoothly, 2-3 layers give true opaque color. Stays on for up to 2 weeks for me, as most of my Gelish nail polishes. I would certainly recommend this for the summer.</li>
            <li> This is a really bright, neon pink. Indoors, it looks like a really pretty hot pink with a hint of melon. In sunlight, it&#x27;s neon. Creamy, no glitter or sparkle. Applies evenly. A great color for summer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color and the price was great, but it&#x27;s a little challenging to get an even coat. I have put it on two different times and each time I paint a nail, it seems to shrink up. Before I put it under the uv light I have to brush each nail again and sometimes it has still receded away from the end and edges of the nail. This is the only color I&#x27;ve had these problems with. Overall, the color is fantastic! It&#x27;s a fluorescent corally pink and it is great for summer. I just wish it went on the nail better.</li>
            <li> love this color, I get so many compliments on it.. perfect for the summer.</li>

            <li> So far the best bright pink I have bought yet.  I get lots of compliments, from both women and Men!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cool colour. Last very long time👍💅😄</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright fluorescent color and beautiful orange/pink. Love the larger size .5oz cause these brights seem to all need 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> Color is BRIGHT. Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Love this color so much, I bought 2 bottles.  This is the only color I have worn all summer!</li>

            <li> I was looking for a Gelish color that is a bit brighter but this is VERY bright.  It is neon which I didn&#x27;t really want but I put  alight  pearl pink over top of it and it toned it down. It will look pretty for Spring.  They are not kidding when they say Brights. :)</li>
