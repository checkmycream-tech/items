            <li>It works great!!!!!</li>
            <li>The pop-out trimmer works excellently, also.    </li>
            <li>He has had it now for about 3 weeks, and again yesterday ( and for about the 100th time ) he says, \\&quot;This is the best shaver I have ever had</li>
            <li>&quot; the shave is as good as any strait blade razor!!!  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8077s Vortex met my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>He tryed it Christmas Day in the shower and said it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>i am very happy.</li>
            <li>But after I shave with the Panasonic she is very happy.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I never used the Braun system, but the Panasonic \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; system is very, very impressive from the technological standpoint.  </li>
            <li>It makes the razor \\&quot;smell better\\&quot; and I think it cuts best after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use the cleaning system, but after trying it, I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>I purchased at Best Buy at a close out price of $71, rather than $100</li>
            <li>I was not looking for the best priced razor, I was looking for the best razor!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent razor and I would buy another one tommorrow if it was necessay.</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>He loves it, which is the best part!  </li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>in all, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used, and that list includes a number of Norelcos and Brauns.</li>
            <li>worked perfectly.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed!    </li>
            <li>My skin seems to have adjusted perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I would now give the product a perfect 5!)  </li>
            <li>THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE</li>
            <li>Excellent wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>To this day I still don&#x27;t understand their rationale, but I figured it was a perfect time to take another look at electrics.</li>
            <li>Best Buy</li>
            <li>self-cleaning unit does a perfect job of eliminating all the hair and residue from the razor (another reason I purchased this model...</li>
            <li>And the shaver runs perfectly after rinsing it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the shave quality.  </li>
            <li>However now he is very happy with it and can shave as often as he needs to without having rashes.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>But this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this razor, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Best of all worlds!</li>
            <li>I always used blades and was always in search for the best one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The design of the unit is in my opinion the best on the market of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>best part is that it is not required for charging.</li>
            <li>The shaver does an excellent job, providing a closer shave than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This shaver was the greatest.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Absolutly perfect!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very happy shaver!</li>
            <li>and it is still shaving excellent.  </li>
            <li>my neck area, the Vortex isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li>Each time I thought that THIS ONE was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had that was not done with shaving foam and a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Excellent.  </li>
            <li>&quot;.. anyway, I found one at Best Buy..</li>
            <li>Seems I do it best if I quit thinking in \\&quot;shaving mode\\&quot; and act like I&#x27;m someone else shaving my neck.. \\&quot;Does that make sense?\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>I am totally impressed!  </li>
            <li>, just received this panasonic and am getting the best shave of my life with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The Hydraclean System does an excellent job of cleaning and preserving the blades for extended use.</li>
            <li>All in all a excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>BUT to get the best shave do you have to learn how move this raizor, because on the contrary you will some areas with no shave.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li>Excellent price and purchase</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for over a month, and the battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li>all\\&quot; even with the best of BRAUN&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor ever.</li>
            <li>I reviewed a ton of products and this came up the best for being versitile and the best shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>if you want a great razor get this one!</li>
            <li>On top of that, IT WASN\\&quot;T SHAVED!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>This panasonic electric wet/dry razor is very good.  </li>
            <li>AS VERY GOOD</li>
            <li>Unit is lighter than my Norelco&#x27;s and the head movement is very good.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very good.</li>
            <li>The price was very good since there was a $[...]</li>
            <li>very good product ,you are not going to get result like a razer</li>
            <li>All in all the Panasonic ES8077S is a very good deal for the money</li>
            <li>also, for some reason, it isn&#x27;t very good at using it to get the stray whisker.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Incredible.</li>
            <li>MY FACE MOISTURING SHAVE, an incredibly lubricating shaving lotion</li>
            <li>- I replaced it with a Braun PocketGo 370 for $20, which works brilliantly.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as perfectly close as a blade on my beard area, but for the speed and savings, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>just the Panasonic is noticibely superior!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>self cleaning feature is really a great plus</li>

            <li>Besides that it&#x27;s a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great.</li>
            <li>In their defense, it does do a great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8077 is a great razor.</li>
            <li>also use it before going out at night if I have a bit of a shadow, and it works great for that too.  </li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning function is great too.  </li>
            <li>I bought him the Panasonic Vortex shaver and he&#x27;s just happy as a clam.  </li>
            <li>This product is great....</li>
            <li>This Panasonic electric shaver turned out to be a great gift for my husband.  </li>
            <li>The lithium-ion battery is great.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry option is great -</li>
            <li>and when I get home it looks great.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy to see there didn&#x27;t appear to be any stray whiskers in there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been generally happy with the quality and closeness of the shave I get from these</li>
            <li>I was quite happy with my ES8077.  </li>
            <li>Great product for men and women.</li>
            <li>Close shave and works great on legs as well.</li>
            <li>rinse everything off, and it&#x27;s in great shape.</li>
            <li>ES8077 gives a great shave, which is ninety percent of the battle when using any razor.</li>
            <li>Great value from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>If you want to know the trick I used to shave under the chin and neckline and get a great shave just try to shave the way your beard grows.</li>
            <li>in all, there are a lot of great shavers out there.</li>
            <li>in all, there are a lot of great shavers out there.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver is a great unit.</li>
            <li>Great piece.</li>
            <li>You can use the Vortex Hydraclean system, which does a great job of cleaning out the shaver.</li>
            <li>Here is what I experienced with this razor:  </li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced (but still suboptimal).</li>
            <li>I think Panasonic has done it again with a very nice reasoniable cost unit.</li>
            <li>Use in the shower or at the sink poses no problems, this is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>The Braun comes with a very nice leather pouch and, with a bit if playing around, it will contiune to serve as the carrier for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Positives: Very nice design -</li>
            <li>A very nice shaver -</li>
            <li>The cleaning feature is very nice, too.</li>
            <li>But Panasonic is very good , Nice linear shaver.</li>
            <li>Superior quality, give great shave.</li>
            <li>cleaning system may be the difference between good and great shaves using Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>How do you get any better than the best shave you have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>After reading the good reviews and getting a great deal on this one for eighty dollars I decided to give it a thirty day trial &lt;br</li>
            <li>the panasonic es8077s is the best shaver i have ever owned, love the wet&amp;dry .</li>
            <li>I was nervous when I made the purchase, knowing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it if it didn&#x27;t work out, but I am very happy I took the chance.    </li>
            <li>I almost bought into the latest and greatest of Brauns&#x27;, but kept reading and comparing ......</li>
            <li>I am learning tips to make it work better on my neck, so it&#x27;s almost perfect, even on those</li>
            <li>all are so easy and perfect!    </li>
            <li>The cleaner works good.  </li>
            <li>So I returned that razor and searched online for reviews that said something along the lines of \\&quot;as good as Braun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The Panasonic seemed like a good option</li>
            <li>Unit has a good ergonomic feel.</li>
            <li>but I believe it will be good too just based on how good the shaver is to use.</li>
            <li>It gives him a good shave in/out of the shower.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good...    </li>
            <li>You feel like you are dragging the Pana across your skin, even with a good preshave in use.  </li>
            <li>but I feel that the Braun cleaning system is superior.  </li>
            <li>almost as good.  </li>
            <li>but my decision to try out Panasonic was a good one.  </li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>this is a great razor rated 3rd best from cunsumer reports but for the money this is the best you can buy</li>
            <li>A good electric razor for a good price.</li>
            <li>This shaver looked like a good one</li>
            <li>But it gives a good close shave otherwise.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>AND WHEN I TRIED TO FIND A BRAUN REPLACEMENT FOR A FAIR PRICE</li>
            <li>I get a good close shave, so say the ladies, and no nicks.</li>
            <li>but I needed an electric while recovering from shoulder surgery on my good arm.    </li>
            <li>Good shave but takes some time.  </li>
            <li>The reviews looked good</li>
            <li>Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior.  </li>
            <li>This unit gives a superior shave for me, however.    </li>
            <li>I guess the foil razor is just not as good for me.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I did get a couple of nicks with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>is also a good shaver.</li>
            <li>is also a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Saw lots of good reviews for this Panasonic and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this electric razor.</li>
            <li>The Panasonics are superior to the Brauns.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but i think can be moore cheaper.</li>
            <li>And this works just as good, and there are instructions how to do this, in the box.</li>
            <li>According to my husband: This razor does a good job.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of &#x27;Panasonic&#x27; for a good razor, so</li>
            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>It is the best shaver I ever had,and I am over 81 yrs.old,but I think it is a ripoff to buy the cleaning system when they tell you all you have to do is use some liquid soap and water to clean the shaver,and don&#x27;t need the cleaning system to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li>Well, this shaver has all of that: close, clean shaves but zero skin irritation, and the self-cleaning system is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic does excellent job to clean neck area</li>
            <li>Needed something to replace a Braun 7075, which I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>bought this shaver on my b&#x27;day after reading all the reviews here and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift and the &#x27;receiver&#x27; is very satisfied with the shaver/cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Good battery life and nice grip on the shaver.</li>
            <li>Excellent close shave; no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;; quite operation; Pivotal shaving head; easy cleaning procedure.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are excellent, but couldn&#x27;t do a better or faster job than my Gilette.</li>
            <li>i am fully pleased with this shaver and all components connected to it, the best electric shaver i have ever used, smooth with no irritations.</li>
            <li>a good feature - cleaning is very easy.  </li>
            <li>I could not ask for more!</li>
            <li>(make sure you have finished shaving before you start it cleaning!)  </li>
            <li>(Either are better than what I didn&#x27;t do before!)</li>
            <li>I think it has more technology than the razor!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Basically, I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Sure!</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is so much better!</li>
            <li>it was able to catch those left-over hairs below the surface!</li>
            <li>this to say, make sure you use the cartridge system it tells you to!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li>at first, i was very happy with the Activator.  </li>
            <li>and it was much more successful around my neck.  </li>
            <li>After years of this I decided to try an electric shaver and chose this model based on reviews and Amazon.com&#x27;s \\&quot;Gold\\&quot; recommendation (top tier shaver!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and have been able to shave every day with no irritation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on the over $200 units!&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on the over $200 units!</li>
            <li>Then I read all these \\&quot;Best thing since sliced bread\\&quot; reviews on this particular shaver and was persuaded to buy thanx to Amazon&#x27;s good return policy I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being saddled with a $100 shaver I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Certainly one of the best in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li>It shaves amazingly close.  </li>
            <li>AND IT PROVIDES A GREAT COMFORTABLE SHAVE EITHER WAY.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>It feels great in the hand and the pivoting head will follow the contour of your face precisely.</li>
            <li>I feel I got a great level of shaver for about as cheap as it gets.</li>
            <li>I feel I got a great level of shaver for about as cheap as it gets.</li>
            <li>It is also nice if you had to use in the shower, although I&#x27;m not one to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>if you get caught, it&#x27;s your own fault.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is a nice feature that works well when shaving the jaw line.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that after a year of use</li>
            <li>I really liked the Braun but decided to give the Panasonic a try based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Still loving it.</li>
            <li>braun&#x27;s cleaner had lemony scent which is nice, panasonic has no scent, just like out of the box.</li>
            <li>I am trying to be honest in this review so someone buying this will know my feelings about this product.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great back-up, does a very close shave, has a trimmer for sideburns and neck, and works great</li>
            <li>I liked this razor a lot.  </li>
            <li>but this is a nice option.    </li>
            <li>This very well might be the best electric razor out there</li>
            <li>He really liked it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice feel in my hand and</li>
            <li>Braun is a good razor, but the Panasonic is better by a two-star margin.</li>
            <li>I am a quality kind of guy.  </li>
            <li>And the cleaning unit is really nice also.  </li>
            <li>I hope to get many good years from this unit.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try to rinse it off each time on my own and use the brush which came with the razor.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is not as good as most people here seem to think.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice    </li>
            <li>The best electric razor I have used by far!!!</li>
            <li>Does a very good job of cleaning &#x3D;) Quite economical too!</li>
            <li>as a person who really enjoyed almost 6 good years of use from my Braun, I am very happy with the new Panasonic and do not regret for a moment the switch.</li>
            <li>This one is the best - mainly because of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Cool package and all the cleaning and charging stuff worked great</li>
            <li>The shave I get from my new Panasonic is awesome.  </li>
            <li>and she said the she loved how easy that was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good in my hand, and is easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>The hydraclean system works great and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery lasts for four shaves with 3-day stubble; quite good in my opinion; 3) The shaver can be used in the shower, and with warm water and a light layer of shaving cream applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>Probably the best electric shaver out there and pretty cheap for the amazing quality it provides....</li>
            <li>I originally bought this shaver to replace a Norelco one that just did not shave as good as I liked.  </li>
            <li>It is far and away the best I have ever owned, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate this product as excellent product but its not for sensitive skin as you can still get razor burns.</li>
            <li>It gave a good shave; it could be used in the shower; and, it worked well with shaving gel for a really smooth shave without any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product so far.</li>
            <li>It is the best electric razor I have used by far.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is -- don&#x27;t expect a real clean shave unless you&#x27;ve got a baby-face beard.</li>
            <li>This shaver is awesome, it works good when used dry but even better with a nice lather on your face.</li>
            <li>For best results I use it with shaving foam but still get good results dry.</li>
            <li>When I wiped my face clean it looked almost as good as a blade shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a great job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>for a good razor, so I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got...</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this is a great shaver for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Yes, the system is easy to use and does a good job, but you can do an equally good job with just some running water and Remington Shaver Saver spray (that stuff is great for cleaning and lubing the shaver -- makes your blades and foils last longer and work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth shave (think baby butt).  </li>
            <li>The razor feels very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It is an effective product which basically does what is promissed: an easy, close shave.</li>
            <li>Cleaning with just soap and water is easy and effective, but I paid for the cleaning station and it should work as designed.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cleans itself and shaves nice with or without lotion.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle takes nearly 3 hours, and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>They were both OK.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>THE CLEANING IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BRAUN &lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED MANY BRANDS OF ELECTRIC SHAVERS .</li>
            <li>you may discover that the newest models are still better than your rebuilt one anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li>Was expecting much more from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>, I shave my head also, which poses a problem for so many razors designed for face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Faster cut, I found that more areas that I shaved didn&#x27;t need to be gone over as many times as I did with the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Seems to get more with every pass.  </li>
            <li>And where it went, was nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;HydraClean Syatem\\&quot;  I find I get a nice smooth shave .</li>
            <li>After receiving  my Panasonic wet/dry ES8077S shaver,I am greatly pleased with the system.</li>
            <li>so this was a going to be interesting.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s battery life is more than ample.  </li>
            <li>I also dont bother with the cleaner because it doesn&#x27;t do much better than just rinsing off in the sink.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors in my life and none have given me a shave like this one.</li>
            <li>, it is lighter and fits better in my hand.</li>
            <li>Interesting cleaning and charging station</li>
            <li>* Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to shave the hair on my chin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it seems that it works for most folks.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I had no transition period....</li>
            <li>This is a much better product.</li>
            <li>it shave better than the Braun Synchro?  </li>
            <li>This is an OK electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It is not so good on the neck area, especially if you have ingrows, but does a great job on my face.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed by this razor that I bought two more as christmas presents last year.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>however the longer he uses it the better performance he is getting out of it.</li>
            <li>I now shave my entire head and this shaver is the best thing I could have bought this year for christmas.</li>
            <li>, had you dolphin-blocked her one too many times.</li>
            <li>and I get more cuts and abrasions from the damn trimmer than from the shaver, even though the usage is probably 100 times more for the shaver than the trimmer.</li>
            <li>, I love it!!\\</li>
            <li>The shave is closer and more &#x27;blade-like&#x27; than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to get the most favorable ones.  </li>
            <li>Remington does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not to sure what it does</li>
            <li>Because reviewers gave the Panasonic better reviews.</li>
            <li>Sure, but why?  </li>
            <li>The best way I can compare performance is this: let&#x27;s say that if you shave with a blade, your beard will become noticeable 10 hours later.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what this magic stuff is, but it works.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco, by comparison, is better able to get into the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself touching up after EVERY shave with a Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li>( better you should use that).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic ES8003 linear shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>and it may take more time for my skin to gets use to it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it partically for the trimmer and the fact its one of the most recommended shaver.</li>
            <li>the panasonics do a better job of hugging the contours of your face than the brauns as the head pivots in more directions.</li>
            <li>handle is also more contoured for gripping too, braun is just a brick shape.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get refills from Amazon 3-pack for $8.88.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HyrdraClean Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System really gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the ES8077S shaver six months ago, after I gave up on getting replacement batteries for my ES8033--both are linear-motor powered--that gave me four-years of satisfying use.  </li>
            <li>Initial impressions are that this is the best that I&#x27;ve owned.    </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied.    </li>
            <li>and I am in search of a better replacement.</li>
            <li>In that time I have used most all brands.</li>
            <li>The one I have used most is the Remington.</li>
            <li>but I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>For that type of money I was expecting something better.  </li>
            <li>But gilette will not get much more money from me..</li>
            <li>panasonic could have given a better travel pouch for the shaver.</li>
            <li>When they are working I love these razors for their close wet/dry shave.</li>
            <li>My latest ES8077S razor started exhibiting this behavior 2 weeks ago and now won&#x27;t even turn on at all despite repeated cleanings/chargings.</li>
            <li>I love the option of cream or no cream.  </li>
            <li>a top end razor should.  </li>
            <li>I would totally Recommend this product, its the best item for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Overall this is an excellent razor</li>
            <li>I had to run it across my neck so many times that it would always get irritated.</li>
            <li>This shaver is all the others have said and more. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>top of everything else, this Panasonic shaver is cheaper than the competitors in this space.   </li>
            <li>...order the Panasonic and treat yourself to a better shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the Panasonic and would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li>More water came out.</li>
            <li>Many moons ago.</li>
            <li>how many passes I&#x27;d try.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Glad I parked it.</li>
            <li>glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li>The problem with my skin is that I can&#x27;t shave more often than once in four days</li>
            <li>I look for quality over price most all of the time.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews here.    </li>
            <li>There also has to be a better way of throughly cleaning the unit inbetween cartridge changings.  </li>
            <li>Mine grows sideways(in that area only) and with the linear head the shaver works superb with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions and shave with a 90 degree angle you will go over that area many times before your beard disappears.</li>
            <li>Others say the difference is not at all meaningful.</li>
            <li>I went for this model since it was quite a bit cheaper than the convex head models (and the replacement heads are cheaper as well), but still gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>But, like most guys, I like my toys, so I got one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning refills are also a bit more money than the Panasonic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, like most guys, I like my toys, so I got one.  </li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning refills are also a bit more money than the Panasonic ones.  </li>
            <li>whole purchase process was great also.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is better than a blade and no cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li>The circular motions you use with a rotary razor seem to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned mostly rotary shavers over the years and been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>On the sides of my face, the shave closeness WAS outstanding.  </li>
            <li>*Not an OUTSTANDING shave.     </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that I can feel my stubble more at the end of the  day than with a blade.  </li>
            <li>This has been the next best thing.</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>i would have gladly sacrificed that for a better neck area shave.   </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have never had a self-cleaning wet/dry razor before and am really enjoying this one.</li>
            <li>I have owned Panasonic wet/dry razors for several years and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for many years.</li>
            <li>This razor is way better than the Braun.</li>
            <li>The ONLY problem I found is that it does not do a real good job along the neck line area below the chin.</li>
            <li>I threw that in for free!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 1 year to see if it held up</li>
            <li>Hav&#x27;t had to use the side trimmer yet . :)</li>
            <li>This one worked much better.  </li>
            <li>While it did take more time to shave, never once did this shaver get upset.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic linear shaver is a safe choice</li>
            <li>and I do not believe you can purchase a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li>After a lot of searching and reading the reviews on here, I decided to purchase this model to replace a Braun I have had for many years.</li>
            <li>almost ordered one or two more ......</li>
            <li>I never imagined a shaver that would shave as close as a blade with much more comfort.  </li>
            <li>They had it on sale @ Circuit City, but here at Amazon it was a better deal.</li>
            <li>this razor seems kind of light.</li>
            <li>I will return it for a refund and get a better brand.</li>
            <li>- It shaves tricky areas like the neck much better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>- Better grip than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Is it really better than my Norelco?  </li>
            <li>thats awesome enough for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does an okay job on my face.  </li>
            <li>It also the self cleaner works very well and is a great added bonus.     </li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>though admittedly never their top</li>
            <li>I like the overall quality of Panasonic shavers and I think that they are the best electric shavers on the market.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the shaver, feel it right and feel it good when holding, let aside that I can shave while showering.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the price and quick delivery from [...].</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product, based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>The auto clean is a nice feature as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and liked it but will clean my shaver manually and use the cleaner about once per week.</li>
            <li>This is nice on the face, because it allows you to shave more quickly.  </li>
            <li>That worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>With this method it does work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li>All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that the the ES8092 or ES8077S shavers are great if you can justify buying a new one every six months.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle does a great job and the razor feels brand new each time I shave.</li>
            <li>So easy does it, is better.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice quick job.</li>
            <li>The shaver is excellent and generally better than the Braun although it seems to accumulate water if you use it wet.  </li>
            <li>However, as good as it is it still does not give as close a shave as a good standard razor.  </li>
            <li>Granted, it worked okay in the first 6 months even though I felt that my old trusty Braun foil shaver did the work perfectly for years, in comparison.  </li>
            <li>Why in the world does it take 3 hours to clean a shaver???!    </li>
            <li>My husband thinks this shaver is excellent and is enjoying it more than his previous one because of its cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>but he says it does a great job and is always clean and ready to use.</li>
            <li>hygienic selfcleaning system  looks very cool  </li>
            <li>these turned out to be true, however I am getting better with it and my skin is getting more used to it</li>
            <li>The fact that I can shave into the beard with the regular heads without nicking makes this Panasonic ideal.  </li>
            <li>: For wet shave quality, this is the best of the Panasonic product series in my experience.</li>
            <li>so it surprised me he was sooo happy with it.  </li>
            <li>some might say the panasonic feels cheaper/more flimsy, but i feel that the shave outcome is more important.</li>
            <li>It did work better on my smooth cheek</li>
            <li>The best part is you still get the \\&quot;wet shave\\</li>
            <li>The shaver is fantastic, like all the top Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li>far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>i am getting the closest, most comfortable shave with it</li>
            <li>I did found if i use this shaver first then finish off with my old norelco, I can get the best close shave ever!  </li>
            <li>Since I skip a day shaving often, I was worried it would pull more on those days, but it&#x27;s really fantastic on longer-stubble days with no added discomfort, so viva la</li>
            <li>On the whole a good purchase.</li>
            <li>(and shaving a head is a fair amount of real estate)     </li>
            <li>I was very apprehensive about just how good a shave</li>
            <li>and it keeps everything nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I read good reviews on it and have promising hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got...</li>
            <li>I am sure a brand new Braun could be as good</li>
            <li>The shave is close and smooth, and it is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the shave is any better with the new \\&quot;Vortex\\&quot; shape and the new 30 degree angle blades, but it&#x27;s the best I can get with an electric.  </li>
            <li>Very quick and easy, and -- so far -- it&#x27;s given me a great shave.</li>
            <li>Nice and light, comfortable to hold, quiet, and great results, and</li>
            <li>It is remarkably easy to clean even though it comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning station, which I&#x27;ve used sparingly, as it&#x27;s so easy to clean manually.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that I can shave in the shower and it is so easy to clean  </li>
            <li>He was sold on how easy &amp; close this shaver works.</li>
            <li>The vortex cleaning system makes that an easy task.</li>
            <li>Where I would wind up with stray growths with the Braun, the Pana seems to take care of them easily.</li>
            <li>The ES8077S cuts through my wiskers easily, even with two days of growth, and with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is also easy - just use hand</li>
            <li>The cleaning and recharging is easy</li>
            <li>It can be easily cleaned, too, without all the folderol of the hydraclean system (which I have yet to use).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-REALLY convenient (easy to touch up the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow)</li>
            <li>I decided that rather than replacing it with another pricey Panasonic, I would try out a (relatively) cheap Norelco ($44) and so far have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>Battery charges lasts over a week, so it can easily be taken out of town without the charger.</li>
            <li>- Easy cleaning by rinsing under a faucet.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit takes up a fair amount amount of counter space, and unless you are a sound sleeper, don&#x27;t run the cleaning cycle while you are trying to sleep; it is noisy.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend Panasonic linear shaver.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend the Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but not this model.</li>
            <li>it has a strong motor</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this shaver,it has plenty of power far better than the Braun Shaver that I replaced,the pivoting head works fine on the neck ,it is very easy to clean even without using</li>
            <li>Not having done much on the internet, I was apprehensive, but am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor or electric shaver I have ever used of any kind that does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also gives a very good dry shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that my situation turned out more favorably--I sent the shaver portion back via UPS with my original receipt (with a note that pointed out that the shaver was never waterproof).</li>
            <li>parked a perfectly good Norelco floating head razor that had relatively new heads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, smooth, easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The shaver still works fine and the charger works, the cleaning system just won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>- The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.    </li>
            <li>just decided from that point on to keep the shaver away from water, and everything was fine.</li>
            <li>The battery is fine, but the razor is shot.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>However, after we called Panasonic and asked detailed questions about using it and were guided through it by a representative, it became easy to use.</li>
            <li>have not used the cleaning system; I just rinse the shaver parts under water and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>, the cleaning goes fine.</li>
            <li>When my husband needed a new razor we were stumped as to which one, but thanks to the great internet we were able to check reviews and ratings and that&#x27;s how we decided on this brand and model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and cuts fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought MANY products from Amazon over the years and this is the FIRST item I&#x27;ve returned! &lt;</li>
            <li>As many others says cleaning process is kind of loud, but it doesnt bother us since my husband shaves</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver fits comfortably in my hand as I shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>As a plus my Wife gets much closer now with my nice stuble</li>
            <li>I enjoy this shaver, PERIOD.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>Electrics while they seem like an attractive option simply don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>The best features of this shaver are: 1) It shaves very close and relatively irritation free.</li>
            <li>, it also works great for personal areas.  </li>
            <li>comfortable shaving foils  </li>
            <li>I am old enough (71) to have gone through many electric razors and this is the best I&#x27;ve yet found.      </li>
            <li>capactiy is great; I have taken a ten day trip and made it without recharging.</li>
            <li>The razor does NOT do well on the all important throat and neck area</li>
            <li>At the sale price and the free shipping, this is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean which is an advantage.</li>
            <li>- The popup clipper is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth quality shave.  </li>
            <li>:  The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.    </li>
            <li>- Came with a cheap travel bag.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>When I got this thing it was great.... very quiet and worked well.</li>
            <li>If I had not have gotten such a great deal on the Panasonic, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is not all that important.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is not all that important.</li>
            <li>I SHAVE MY HEAD WITH THIS MACHINE AND ITS SOOOOOOOO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;ve been really happy with the Panasonic after using it daily for over four years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i figured it would be worth it to buy the top of the line shaver.  </li>
            <li>if i had to offer one criticism of the Vortex, i guess i&#x27;d say it is not as quiet as the SoftTouch, but with its more powerful motor, i would gladly sacrifice the quietness for a good shave and no pulling.   </li>
            <li>Also, in neck area, Barun was not doing such a great job  &lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers since they were called \\&quot;Smooth Operators.\\</li>
            <li>The razor is a beaut, smooth and close shave everytime.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews are accurate, the ES8077S gives a quick clean shave, and it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charge and clean.</li>
            <li>works just terrific, my friend gave me as a gift - which was a great selection.</li>
            <li>I am a happy person who does not have to go around with red cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>more than money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly comfortable and my face did not need any time to adjust to the shaver.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide as smoothly as the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Thinks it&#x27;s a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very simple -- running the blade under water, or using soap, seems to work better than the cartridge system, which is good if you want to avoid that expense.  </li>
            <li>But since this can be cleaned just with hand soap and water, i&#x27;ll likely use that method most often and just use the built in system every couple months for a good semi annual clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to purchase a $100 shaver, but I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass.</li>
            <li>usually right before he leaves the house :)</li>
            <li>IT REALLY IS OUTSTANDING RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m amazed the full cleaning process takes a whole 3 hours \\&quot;I&#x27;m sure its quite thorough!\\&quot; for a 5 minute shave!..   </li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t feel very powerful to me, but to my surprise it shaved a teensy bit closer than the Activator</li>
            <li>And while it is true blades are always the closer shave, they also cause the most damage to sensitive skin or to anything other than the most smoothe and perfect head.     </li>
            <li>I was very suprised on how close the shave was when I first used it and being able to use it in the shower is really nice.</li>
            <li>Both razors work great for the first 366 days and then the cleaning device completely dies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower, though I mainly just use it in my car.</li>
            <li>First time I have ever been able to shave with an electric and still be smooth at 6 or 7 pm.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver I have had that genuinely shaves better - it is substantially smoother when I shave and</li>
            <li>I wish it had more power, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The company won&#x27;t repair it and you are stuck shelling out another $300 for a whole new system, despite the fact that the razor still works great.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, solid and reliable product.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to pick up and have a quality clean shave within minutes.</li>
            <li>The ability to shave with shaving cream is a great feature, is more comfortable than dry, and far more comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li>Have used Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry Shavers for a long time, over 25 years &amp; have been happy with them.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s 8077 is nothing to get excited about,so save your money unless you are into wet/dry shaving with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my original blades.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>First you have to start with a clean face, this is important!</li>
            <li>Bought the top of the line Braun at the same time and have to say the Panasonic is far superior!  </li>
            <li>It takes 2-3 attempts to get it to clean, then charge.  </li>
            <li>I clean and recharge the razor every weekend.</li>
            <li>I never shaved my face this clean and close with electric shaver.</li>
            <li>but the razor gets clean.</li>
            <li>are the wet/dry feature and the fact that you can clean it under water using liquid soap.</li>
            <li>but you can clean this shaver using liquid soap and tap water.  </li>
            <li>She loves to touch my clean shaven face.</li>
            <li>- The Wet/dry feature (which I&#x27;ve yet to try) provides the opportunity to use shaving lather, as well as the ability to clean the shaver without using the Hydraclean system (I do use the system).    </li>
            <li>You can clean it yourself with soap and water if you wish to save on cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I take off the head to see how clean</li>
            <li>I have yet to try to cleaning unit, but here is a breakdown of the time it should take to clean, according to the manual:  </li>
            <li>Since you can rinse it under water, I can get the shaver just as clean as the stand can, and a lot faster.   </li>
            <li>It never got totally clean.  </li>
            <li>The downside is that you HAVE to use the cleaning station -- you can&#x27;t run a Braun 360 under water to clean it like you</li>
            <li>The downside is that you HAVE to use the cleaning station -- you can&#x27;t run a Braun 360 under water to clean it like you</li>
            <li>Another benefit of keeping them clean</li>
            <li>and if i flip up the trimmer, i can easily clean up what it misses, again with no pain or irritation.  </li>
            <li>the Vortex is far and away the best of the 3 shavers in my opinion and this is without even using one of its key features.  </li>
            <li>If your gonna have a docking station and actually use it, its nice to be able to put the shaver in and charge your batteries without fear of developing memory.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The price offered by Amazon for this shaver is among the lowest I found, and the free super saver shipping made it the lowest price over all.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li>It cuts clean and close.  </li>
            <li>This is an extremely POSITIVE review by a MANY year Braun and razor user.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get the Pana to show any battery drain even if I keep it out of the charger for a couple weeks!   </li>
            <li>All my razors have been adquate at best, normally I would have to use a safety razor and \\&quot;dry shave\\</li>
            <li>gives me a very close, very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>its very lightweight and comfortable; great to be able to use it like a manual razor - wet with shaving creme; no razor burn, or irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable, quiet,and shaves very closely.</li>
            <li>HAVE USED BRAUN FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS,THE PANASONIC IS SUPERIOR.</li>
            <li>However, the cleaning stand died quickly and won&#x27;t clean anymore.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t quite there, but good enough</li>
            <li>very well pleased.</li>
            <li>* Looks cool &lt;</li>
            <li>think the model with the convex shaver head would be even better for me</li>
            <li>They say to give your skin two weeks to adjust and I believe that it is true.    </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this so much</li>
            <li>It pulls and requires many passes to get a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried shaving in the shower, but you can&#x27;t shave and wash at the same time, since you must hold the razor as well as the washcloth, and you need a good mirror on the wall of the shower or in your hand.  </li>
            <li>It is true that it takes time for skin to adjust to any electric shaver, but not 30 days as noted in the documentation.  </li>
            <li>Best to start that cycle as you&#x27;re on your way out the door in the morning, or at least while crunching on some corn flakes.</li>
            <li>and I get a fairly close shave, almost as close as the Gillette V mach fusion razor which I was using prior.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked good enough on my face.  </li>
            <li>Shaving performance is good for daily shaves, the shave is reasonably close and comparable to the Norelco, maybe even better.</li>
            <li>To be fair to the shaver, I am semi-retired and I only shave about twice a week.  </li>
            <li>the pivoting head action is nice.</li>
            <li>(Not knowing this, I had almost been ready to pay more at Costco.com just for the returnability but decided to take a chance.)</li>
            <li>It works well, but it&#x27;s not necessary to have to keep your shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li>It works well, but it&#x27;s not necessary to have to keep your shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li>I prefer to follow the quick clean tips that come with the shaver and use the hydraclean every 60 days.</li>
            <li>This shaver is much better and gives me a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>MUCH TO MY AMAZEMENT, THIS RAZOR MORE THAN DOES THE JOB.  </li>
            <li>Shaver works well if it has a full charge.  </li>
            <li>and this is more gentle.</li>
            <li>Die-hard blade shavers will tell you that there&#x27;s no closer shave than a blade, and that&#x27;s certainly true,</li>
            <li>Now, my cheeks are full of scars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad it shaves your face close and cleans its self</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase</li>
            <li>Overall, if you want a quick fairly close shave with a minimum of pulling and irritation, give it a try.</li>
            <li>my main priority in shaving is to have a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>This type of foil razor takes some adjustment as it is easy to burn your skin when you are first adjusting to it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much else new to add; the razor is comfortable in the hand, is relatively quiet, the cleaning sytem is fantastic, battery life is very good, does quick work, and does not irritate my skin at all.    </li>
            <li>I am getting great shaves,no skin bites as with other shavers.</li>
            <li>I had great expectations for this razor after reading about it on this and other sites.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I did, the wet shave is superior to my old one.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic pays a little more and puts in superior LiIon batteries.    </li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is very good - far better than my previous Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li>They should just sell this without the stand, but of course they want to make more money by having you buy new cleaning cartridges!</li>
            <li>This shaver is very smoth, the battery last almost 3 weeks and the cleaning system is great.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s so effective that even when i don&#x27;t, it still does a good job.    </li>
            <li>But i often want a quick shave without the hassle of shaving cream and wetting my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to the razor, and the water inside it starts to stink fairly quickly, causing the razor itself to stink after cleaning.</li>
            <li>Decent buy, there may be a better shaver out there, who knows?</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t shave super close,</li>
            <li>The next best was a Norelco, but the problem with that razor is that if you have a beard or mustache you will constantly be shaving off part of it - it just takes everything.</li>
            <li>If I just charge its done quickly but cleaning seems to have issues.  </li>
            <li>I had to allow IT to do the work and not me in rubbing the razor over my skin quickly and with lots of pressure.</li>
            <li>The shave is close, quick and never a nick.  </li>
            <li>My top criteria were closeness of shave and price, although I liked the fact that the Panasonic was a wet shaver as well.    </li>
            <li>I received the product quickly after purchasing on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It shaves quick and without a doubt it is the closest electric shave.  </li>
            <li>As close as a razor, and just as quick as an electric.</li>
            <li>and it is quick and close shave.</li>
            <li>In an electric shaver, fore-and-aft pivoting is what contributes to a quick, close shave, and this shaver lacks it.    </li>
            <li>cuts closely, rinses easily (soap and water), nice looking, keeps charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The high speed motor is very smooth and powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li>My neck was smooth and there was no irritation even on the first day I used this machine.</li>
            <li>have a very course beard, and at first this razor did a great job on my cheeks, it barely touches my chin, and does virtually nothing on my neck except cut me.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and it is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is the very first electric shaver I have used that shaves as close as a blade</li>
            <li>This is almost as good as a blade, and a lot cheaper over the long run.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that the long hair trimmer works well here and does not irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>Reall enjoy the wet feature,as it feels more comfortable than the dry shave,but both are evenly great.  </li>
            <li>I just use liquid soap and warm water to clean mine (following the directions for manual cleaning in the instructions).    </li>
            <li>My thought was that by spending just a bit more, I could have a new shaver that was self-cleaning, so off to</li>
            <li>I just shaved with my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver System and wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>This one came up, and the reviews mentioned in many cases that it worked as good if not better than the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li>This is my first real experience with a quality electric shaver as I&#x27;ve been more inclined to use a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The ES8077S not only lives up to its promises regarding the cleaning &amp; drying of the unit, but,gives the best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the cleaner much because it is easy to rinse off when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>I have tried it in the shower, and I do not think that it shaves as good as on a dry face, but I think that is just a result of my technique.  </li>
            <li>This shaver&#x27;s dry shaving is good.</li>
            <li>I get a good 4-5 head shaves out of a single charge.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months, and if there&#x27;s a better product on the market, I sure would like to know about it!</li>
            <li>tool\\&quot; of shaving - a stronger, better shave with more noise, an occasional nick, and you need to be willing to spend time on it.</li>
            <li>these new razors are great with the constant speed</li>
            <li>It may not be more economical to buy a new one, but it was always easier.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Since you can get the razor wet, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean on your own.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good dry shaver then forget it and go buy a couple of $20 Braun PocketGo shavers that work far better than this thing.</li>
            <li>The great thing about the product is that when you shave wet (with shaving lotion) there is NO irritation and the shave is SUPER close (really closer than I EVER got with a razor).  </li>
            <li>He is absolutely thrilled about the product and tells me it works just as great for a dry shave or wet shave and has no problems when submerging the razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the cleaner because it&#x27;s a rather large unit that just doesn&#x27;t fit well on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Cannot say the Pana is not doing the job - it seems to work fine - but the Braun just seems a bit better overall.  </li>
            <li>The hydraclean system is a little bulky and very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be better shavers these days, but I think this is a good deal for the money</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, have to keep going over and over and will still miss a few.</li>
            <li>All a round the razor is great.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks, his skin has gotten use to it and it works great now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the razor for a few weeks now and it gives me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>As I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in over 30 years, I really can&#x27;t give an accurate assessment of how this razor compares to others.</li>
            <li>shaver is worth the money</li>
            <li>which is what I need far more than the side to side pivoting.  </li>
            <li>I guess I have more sensitive skin because they are like hair pullers to me, so i have allways used the foil types and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is too early to say if the cleaning is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 50 years, and this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because when used &#x27;wet&#x27; it delivers as close a shave as I can get with any blade.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Much better results than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to shave in the shower as well as the option to touch up at night if necessary.  </li>
            <li>I can get shaving burn that way, but sometimes it is useful.  </li>
            <li>Having a quality product that looks nice is a double benefit.    </li>
            <li>overall nicely designed product but try before you buy</li>
            <li>I even feel that the old shaver is more powerful.</li>
            <li>It cuts close, &lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and holds a charge for a couple of week&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This shaver is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I have never had much success with electric razors.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean the old fashioned way</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer (I will use this even when I go back to my blade).  </li>
            <li>Kind of big and clunky.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money 100%</li>
            <li>you can handle the noise, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am completely sold on this shaver - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>i have tried many aftershave products and none has completely eliminated the problem.  </li>
            <li>Vortex, like the Activator, has a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>it shaves my face nice and smooth with absolutely no pulling.  </li>
            <li>the trimmer is powerful and has no difficulty with stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is better than my old norelco 82xx serie.  </li>
            <li>This thing is fast and totally cleans as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>Amazon gets my future business for this kind of service.</li>
            <li>he now can shave evryday and looks much more professional.</li>
            <li>good wet, blade shave takes about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>He normally uses a badger brush, glycerin soap, and razor, but likes to have a more portable, quick alternative for traveling or for weekends when he doesn&#x27;t feel like the whole \\&quot;soap and brush\\</li>
            <li>does take up to 3x longer to clean than braun, but for me that has turned out to be more academic rather than practical issue.</li>
            <li>Might be good compared to other electrics.  </li>
            <li>matter what anyone tells you, the electric doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but the convienence factor outweighs that in the right situations.  </li>
            <li>The charger plug goes right into the razor body if you don&#x27;t have the cleaner device with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and when i applied it to my 2 day beard growth, it mowed right through.  </li>
            <li>sometimes, it just doesn&#x27;t cut that pesky hair even though you are holding it right up to it.   </li>
            <li>I was getting close shaves and no irritation or missed areas right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Take care about it, if you learn how to move, the right pression..</li>
            <li>and light, comfortable to hold, quiet, and great results, and half what my Braun cost - I can finally say goodbye to Braun and be happy with something that works better for less money.oting.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is very quiet, gives a close shave and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two other Panasonic shavers; the first one was satisfactory, the second one was excellent -- but I dropped it and</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend buying this item, it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Their absolute top of the line shaver has a convex head which some people say is a wee bit better than this model with the standard head.</li>
            <li>Wet shave is excellent and dry shave</li>
            <li>but husband seems to be very happy with the product both wet and dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this razor whether it&#x27;s a dry shave or wet shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a smaller flip-up trimmer that does an OK job for a quick touch up...</li>
            <li>I mean NEVER gotten a better shave, quick, close, clean, no nicks or cuts or blood and thoroughly enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I will say the cleaning system on this razor is slick and the wet/dry capability is great.  </li>
            <li>This unit is well worth the price, it is the first electric razor that I have owned that lives up to and</li>
            <li>Since using the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean system for the past month, I am greatly amazed at its performance.  </li>
            <li>well built, easy to use, many other plusses.</li>
            <li>It took my face about a week to adjust to the new razor, but it&#x27;s been smooth sailing from there.    </li>
            <li>- The plastic foil protector never seems to click right on the first time.    </li>
            <li>I find that the ES8077S actually shaves better and more comfortably wet than dry; 4) Cleaning the blades and foil is easy -- just apply liquid handsoap to the foil and run the shaver under running warm water, then remove the foil and rinse it out, as well as the blades; 5) It comes with a cleaning, drying and charging station.</li>
            <li>It also holds its charge for ages, is ergonomic and easy to handle and is not too terribly loud.</li>
            <li>Shaves twice as good in half the time.</li>
            <li>Though they claim the inner blade is the sharpest 30 degree blade up to date, the more useful two outer blades are still 90 degree.</li>
            <li>After my fourth Panasonic gave out after 5 years (it didn&#x27;t help that a hotel maid knocked it on the floor and broke it), I decided that since the cheaper Panasonics gave a great shave, the more expensive ones should give an outstanding shave.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic has been working fine so far (about three months).  </li>
            <li>Good points:  can be used in shower  very close wet shave, as close as a blade (watch those nicks!)  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Panasonic and Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It is a little bulkier than the Panasonic razor that I had before, but it is just as good.  </li>
            <li>This is the second electric shaver I own, after using an older shaver for 10 years, also from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>yes, NiCad and NiMh are very good batteries in \\&quot;controlled\\&quot; circumstances.. but not good for real life like LiIon.</li>
            <li>The Vortex cleaning system really keeps the entire head assembly super clean (although I had to clean the part where the head rests once).  </li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to shave with this model, but far more effective than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li>Only use a very little shave cream or just some hot water for best results.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close.    </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor in probably 6-7 years.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that it was quieter.  </li>
            <li>I tried shaving my head - and instantly was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and the price seemed a lot better than some of the higher end Norelcos and Brauns with similar features.</li>
            <li>The first charge lasted about 2 weeks before I had to charge it.</li>
            <li>First off, If i could plug this in and shave i would give it a 5 star.  </li>
            <li>I did have to trim my hair first then shave</li>
            <li>However, since this is a wet-dry razor, I just run it under some hot water whenever it needs it.</li>
            <li>REALLY !  </li>
            <li>if used daily, the shaver would do a better job.</li>
            <li>The first was for my elderly father who was in a convalescent home at the time after a heart surgery.</li>
            <li>But the results are better with the Pana even if I shave for the same length of time with each.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I will never go back to a rotary.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after the first run and cleaned it manually after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace a Remington, and is my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>But still cheaper than similar products in this corrupted country. :-)</li>
            <li>but this is my first panasonic.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that the first shave or two that I took with this razor were so close</li>
            <li>I am able to shave in different directions to get ALL the whiskers.</li>
            <li>First thing I did when I received this unit</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased the ES8077s in March of 2006.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with razors with three pivoting heads, and I&#x27;ll have to get one of those next time.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem as though it would work, so I went into my first shave hesitant.</li>
            <li>And if you follow the directions correctly and allow your hair and skin to get used to the changover from regular razor to electric shaver you will love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The unit feels like a really quality unit!  </li>
            <li>I yearn for someone to really figure out a shaver that can handle all areas of the face!</li>
            <li>funny thing is I went over the Panasonic side with a 10 yr.</li>
            <li>The only downfall if shaving with any method except with a cream/lube, you will not experience that refreshing feeling you get with shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>I first tried a Remington MS5200.</li>
            <li>This model of Panasonic is one of the better ones, and should be on the short list of anyone who is looking for a foil shaver.13,000 RPM speed (</li>
            <li>This model of Panasonic is one of the better ones, and should be on the short list of anyone who is looking for a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>I had mostly been using blades (Sensor Excel or Gillette Disposable) for the prior 5 or six years.  </li>
            <li>first, if i skipped shaving for a day, i had to use a blade because the SoftTouch just couldn&#x27;t do it efficiently.  </li>
            <li>in all, if you are going to spend over $100 on an electric shaver, check out the Panasonic line first.  </li>
            <li>Overall shaving is better</li>
            <li>LiIon are much lighter too!    </li>
            <li>I really think its closer than a razor just using soap in the shower!    </li>
            <li>I got my first Panasonic in 1995 and it still works well.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is the first electric I have used that is satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>Finally, my skin has not looked as healthy.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works pretty well for me</li>
            <li>I would give a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t break on me after exactly 13 months of use.  </li>
            <li>but this gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>For me, being able to shave daily makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Deciding which electric shaver to purchase can be an overwhelming task when comparing the different features of each brand.</li>
            <li>The best part is you dont even need to use the Vortex system, because the cleaning cartridges can get expensive.</li>
            <li>Long battery life, easy to clean by rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low stress and would be great on even a long</li>
            <li>This shaver has been extensively reviewed already and I don&#x27;t have much more to add, except to say that I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li>The closer I&#x27;d shave, the more I&#x27;d pay the price in break-outs the next day.  </li>
            <li>it had a nice trimmer on it and for those who care, the cleaning base was actually kind of nice</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 1 month now, and its a great relief for my face, no irritation and very close shaving, the only con is the neck area, but that happens with every other shaver, the cleaner base is very nice and solid, its great to just leave the shaver there to clean, well if you have problem with irritation you have to try this, but if your hair is too thick maybe the 3 head rotors shavers works best for you..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll take it as a trade off for the absence of irritation and the better shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>shave feels as close as with a fresh razor, particularly if I use it while my skin is warm and wet from the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a very handy feature and is common with all shavers at this price point.    </li>
            <li>The shaver is great, running at a high speed (they say 13,000 reciprocations per second) so that every stroke actually cuts beard.</li>
            <li>But this razor uses the same blades as my old one, and I\\&quot;ve changed blades on my old one before and this sure seems better without a doubt.</li>
            <li>Like all other Panasonic products I own, this razor is of the utmost  quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for nearly a year now, originally because after a three-month layoff from shaving while studying for the bar exam, I found that I was getting cut up every day before work.  </li>
            <li>I do think the foil has better technology to grab flat hairs etc.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a DE (dual edge) razor and a silver tip brush with shave soap or cream lathered in a Moss scuttle for several years now, starting with hot soak, followed by shave oil, soap/cream, with/across/against the grain, then alum block finished with good aftershave.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Norelco shaver, it was easy to keep clean and still looks pretty new after 2 years of solid use.  </li>
            <li>The overall performance of this razor is very good if you plan on shaving everyday.  </li>
            <li>have to say, that having used the Panasonic 8077S Vortex for several weeks now, that this is by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li>Like a perfectly smooth, rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>up was a Norelco 7110X. Also a nice shaver, but even more irritating than the Remington in some spots.</li>
            <li>So far I have rinsed off the shaver under running water and it has stayed clean.</li>
            <li>that great at shaving stray long hairs; long term durability is not known yet.</li>
            <li>nano-speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: Panasonic shavers frequently go on sale at discounters like Target and WalMart, and Panasonic offers rebates from time-to-time</li>
            <li>I do not use the recharging stand since it is too large; instead I clean it by holding it under the hot water faucet and plug it directly to the power cord for recharging.</li>
            <li>This is the first Panasonic razor I have owned; I have been through several other brands and this is the smoothest and closest shave I have ever experienced with an electric.</li>
            <li>... &lt;br /&gt;While the cleaning system is pretty much a gimmick - not totally necessary but nice to have - both the razor and the cleaning system are quite loud.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, I almost sent it right back because it did NOT have the inductive charging system (online sources listed it as a model that did), and the shaver felt light and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very pleased with the razor and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as a blade, charge hangs in tough, easy to clean, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>read a bunch of positive reviews about the Panasonic E8077S</li>
            <li>lot&#x27;s of positive reviews, but I don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and this is just a dry razor shave, what I&#x27;ve always done.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the razor when I first got it</li>
            <li>If I go for more than two days without shaving, using the long hair cutter to \\&quot;knock down\\</li>
            <li>The first time I sent my ES8092 razor in for repair/replacement, Panasonic sent me a much less-expensive reconditioned ES8066 as a replacement.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it everywhere EXCEPT my face.  </li>
            <li>The ES8077S gets a shave just as good if not better than my Schick Quattro Blade razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that a new shaver has new blades and so comparing with the old one will always seem better.  </li>
            <li>This&#x27;s a very interesting product, it isn&#x27;t heavy, but some kind of large, the shave is very close to other tradicional shaves (the blades).</li>
            <li>these are nice, but not very important to me.  </li>
            <li>I tried the shaver in the shower and under full shower stream it operated just fine in the soaking wet environment (though the shave quality was unacceptable).</li>
            <li>The first time was in warranty, and was repaired, and then a year later (with new batteries from Amazon) it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than two shaves, this time it was out of warranty.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system for my new vortex yet, sorry, can&#x27;t report on how well it cleans, but hey, must be better and more convenient than me cleaning it manually (which was a pain for my first panasonic in that my stubble gunk would get caked onto the blades and wouldn&#x27;t easily rinse off).</li>
            <li>I decided to do a little homework, just to see what else is available, and this Panasonic had overall exceptional reviews.</li>
            <li>Also..there are no flimsy parts that feel like they may fly off if you shake it hard, like some of the rotary razors out there!    </li>
            <li>Only downside is I had a fair amount of razor burn when I first started using it for wet shaves -- but now (after about 2 months) I am using it in the shower pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>For me, it works much better dry.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry based on the fact that  I can continue to use my Jack Black Beard Lube if I liked.</li>
            <li>The full process takes 3 hours to clean and dry.     </li>
            <li>only charge when I clean (every 3-4 shaves) and never run low or even off of the top charge tier, so</li>
            <li>It does go away if I give it a dry cycle at this point, but then the cleaning level reduces noticeably and I&#x27;m compelled to add more water.  </li>
            <li>The oscillator would not maintain a constant strong speed even though it is fully charged; therefore, it would tend to \\&quot;shred\\&quot; your skin as your stubs get stuck between the foil and razor of the shaver...</li>
            <li>I think it does a strong overall job</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended, and is 100% better than my old rotary-style Norelco reflex action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone two weeks on a single charge, and I&#x27;m sure I could have gone longer.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic certainly cannot meet this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it wet or dry and it works great either way.  </li>
            <li>but anyway the razor works great wet or dry</li>
            <li>Overall, it is by far a better shaver, and worth the extra time to properly clean it.  </li>
            <li>For most people, the lengthy cleaning time shouldn&#x27;t be much of a concern since if the battery is low, just plug it in after your shave, and it&#x27;ll be clean and ready for your next shave.    </li>
            <li>The after shave feeling, the linear technology, light weight and the battery span are my favorite technological improvement over my previous 6 years old Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>In summary, the unit gives a decent close shave, but the cleaning system is junk!</li>
            <li>Also the loud sound only lasts about 10-15 minutes of the 3 hour cleaning cycle, then it becomes a very soft purr sound.</li>
            <li>I clean my razor about every three days, but the cartridges last longer if you wash out the inside of the razor first.  </li>
            <li>I tried using the HydraClean Hygienic Cleaning System a couple of times, but it took up too much space on the counter around my sink and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything necessary, so I stopped using it after about a month and just rinsed the shaver off under the tap after every use, which seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>For most of my life I have had to use a blade to shave, because my tough, gnarly, Croatian beard was too much for most electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>this is one amazing razor, it actually shaves closer than a standard blade shaver.</li>
            <li>If I let the shaver lightly glide over my skin it would leave so much beard that I had to go over the same spot 10 times from all angles</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just want to clear a spot near an outlet and leave it there, since the unit ends up filled with water.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Shavers have held up very well over their lifetime use.</li>
            <li>much* closer and</li>
            <li>*much* faster.</li>
            <li>but it will be alot cheaper than using the straight razors.</li>
            <li>Much quieter.  </li>
            <li>After using a Norelco for more than 5 years I decided to try a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>How much electricity is that taking?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about as smooth as a regular blade, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate the softer skin on my neck.</li>
            <li>For the price, it does the job very well, so</li>
            <li>Straight out of the box</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Vortex shaver is really the cat&#x27;s meow.</li>
            <li>the shaver and vortex cleaner worked very well.  </li>
            <li>He highly recommends this razor!</li>
            <li>but I bought into the hype and gimmick of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>I am not using the stand as it takes too much space, but once charged with portable charger it runs for about 3 weeks before it needs be recharged.</li>
            <li>Too much of that and</li>
            <li>, I take my time, allow the razor to cut the hairs without the intense pressure from me onto my skin.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the extra shaving heads to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really stretch the life too much b/c alcohol based, will evaporate over time whether you use it or not, once it&#x27;s been opened.</li>
            <li>However, a manual razor still gives a much closer shave</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is the Panasonic 8077 is a real sucko.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth with such a close shave; also no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; at all!</li>
            <li>However, if you have the patience and sensitive skin like me then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>For someone used to a blade, this one really compares.</li>
            <li>Both of these razors which I was relatively happy with, both irritated my neck almost every day and it would be worse on humid days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in those three weeks, and even though you&#x27;re supposed to use it for a month to see results, Amazon&#x27;s return policy leaves me no choice but to guess that another week won&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li>This is much easier than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close</li>
            <li>I really wanted the convenience).  </li>
            <li>much for being \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot;  &lt;br</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have razor burn anymore and its so much quicker.</li>
            <li>but it is very close</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get a really close shave.    </li>
            <li>makes life so much easier than when i was using a mach 3.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>to the face, as is recommended in the owners manual, and not using to much pressure against the face.</li>
            <li>But now he really likes it alot.</li>
            <li>How much time are you going to be in there for it to be an irritation?</li>
            <li>I always knew the Norelco was not as close as a blade, but it was so much faster, I never gave up the electric.</li>
            <li>The angled blades of this shaver really do seem to work.</li>
            <li>It gives extra smooth result.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>But a good choice if you skip a few days between shaves -- rotary shavers as a whole do a much better job over heavy growth than a foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were just as expected, authentic Panasonic, and they did improve the shave somewhat.  </li>
            <li>this method has never given me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>it is also safe to drag it across your skin without worrying about nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I use soap for lubrication and gentle pressure.    </li>
            <li>Using it doesn&#x27;t really take much getting used to (as suggested by some reviews and even the package insert)</li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviews i chose this and am greatful to have read the reviews.</li>
            <li>The real beauty in this machine is the cleaning mechanism.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even really using the cleaning part of it ....</li>
            <li>The plastic on it fells really frail.</li>
            <li>- The triple blade really works.  </li>
            <li>- The foil seems to have more drag than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell, but regardless of which razer I use, I&#x27;ve got to touch up with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has NO RAZOR BURN, and no tugging like some of the rotary shavers do, and is much happier.</li>
            <li>Reader&#x27;s Digest version: great electric shaver, with as near to a good blade shave as I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a 31 yr old white man with moderate beard hair that grows in a mildly complex pattern.  </li>
            <li>and I am much happier with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using double and triple edge blades my entire adult life for 20+ years and would normally get a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with cream and warm water gets the closest shave, but it&#x27;s about as must work as shaving with a blade--and just as messy.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing my old EX8092 shavers with soap and water actually seemed to do a better job.</li>
            <li>It was at least as good as the Norelco/Philips shaver that I had before in terms of shave closeness.  </li>
            <li>Neck whiskers take multiple passes, far more than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Have had several Braun dry electric razors that I liked very much.</li>
            <li>Fast, smooth, and painless (with the exception of rare nicks caused by ingrown hairs and other skin imperfections).</li>
            <li>half what my Braun cost - I can finally say goodbye to Braun and be happy with something that works better for less money.</li>
            <li>I found that my old ES8023 shaves as well as this one with the original three year old foil and blades.</li>
            <li>When using foam in shaving, the skin becomes more sensative and tender, which requires the blade to be sharp as a real razor.</li>
            <li>The cleaning part \\&quot;went dry\\&quot; quickly and it generally wanted to always go through the cleaning cycle when you put it on the stand.</li>
            <li>The ES8077S produces a slightly better shave due to the improved blade design.</li>
            <li>However, after having using this Panasonic unit which I have never attempted to use to &#x27;wet-shave,&#x27; and probably won&#x27;t, I was convinced that I got a better shave from it than ANY other brand shavers.</li>
            <li>As the instructions say, it did take me ~ 30 days to get get my face used to it, but never at any time did it hurt to use (many other shavers I have tried</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had significant difficulty with post-shave irritation and occasional ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Pros: *wet/dry capability (wet is strongly recommended, and is the main reason to consider a Panasonic in the first place).</li>
            <li>dry panasonic shave for me is already closer and faster than dry braun, nice to know if need be for special occasion, important interview or date, can try using the panasonic wet for supposedly aneven closer shave.     </li>
            <li>The cleaning feature uses cartridges and is really unnecessary, since it is so easy to clean the shaver using warm water and soap, but the station will blow-dry and heat your shaver dry, as well as charge it.</li>
            <li>I have had several Panasonic wet / dry shavers before and this one is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>and I find that if you keep the unit clean it provides the same level of close shave day after day.  </li>
            <li>I haved shaved with a Norelco for over 15yrs., and finally swithed to the Panasonic \\&quot;vortex\\&quot;, hydra clean 8077s.  </li>
            <li>I have changed filters regularly and kept the unit clean; the cleaning system just doesn&#x27;t hold up well.    </li>
            <li>I clean once every 3 days, 1 cartridge supposed to last ~ 1.5 months, but i can see stretching it even longer duration.</li>
            <li>Close and clean shave and would suggest buying some extra cartridges</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need the hydraclean system to to keep it clean on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>That may be partly related to keeping the blades clean, though.  </li>
            <li>i ended up having to use a regular razor just to clean up the spots along my neck that it wouldn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li>But the main reason I bought the 8077 was the cleaning station which I knew should keep it pristine and was very similiar to the \\&quot;Braun</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun first and was somewhat disappointed -- more friction and more effort to get a good result than I expected from a top-price razor.</li>
            <li>The ES8077S has NiMH batteries that easily give me 10 days of use on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Panasonic and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really had appreciated the reviews when I was looking to purchase a new razor, and now that I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic for a month, I thought I&#x27;d stop in and return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this total system is anything special.</li>
            <li>Oh yah, and the $100 turned to only $70 with Amazon&#x27;s special discount ......</li>
            <li>things considered, this could have been a wonderful razor if it hadn&#x27;t broken over a very minor jolt.</li>
            <li>Light-weight, easy to handle, and much quieter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Not too loud, but the pitch is higher because the head really has a high RPM.</li>
            <li>to make a long story short, combined with some decent shaving gel and a couple of days practice, the Vortex not only shaves infinitely better than the old Braun, but as close as I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with a blade with NO irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>The reason I went back to Braun and bought the Activator after my first Panasonic was that it was just so much more convenient to clean for my lazy self.</li>
            <li>To clean it, I simply open the head and rinse with water and occasionally run it briefly with liquid hand soap rubbed on the screen and the head stays clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Used to use a norelco and this is a lot better hands down.</li>
            <li>I envied the quick easy electric shave but never had any luck in the past.  </li>
            <li>One thing apparently not stated is you fill a water tank with water and clean it every time you change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>and it cleaned the razor like new!   </li>
            <li>I do not buy new shavers very often so</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic previously which I loved and used until even new blades and foils weren&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Shavers are supposed to shave, of course; but they get better ratings in my opinion the closer and smoother the shave, and the less they irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for about a month and a half, and am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>and also important, i don&#x27;t feel dry and chaffed afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Review for Panasonic ES8077S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my brother owns an older model and loves it, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I also have an older Braun that I use for travel.</li>
            <li>Vortex cleaning system  is nothing more than an added expense, a waste of time and energy, space in the cabinet or under the cabinet, and what does it really do that you can&#x27;t do by passing the razor head under a turned on faucet.</li>
            <li>The main reason for using the vortex electric razor is for convenience of shaving.</li>
            <li>One of the main features that won me over.</li>
            <li>Also when trimming longer hair, the main shaver foil gets stuck with debris - so I have started using the plastic cover for the main foil whenever i use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>this is cleaner, since it doesn&#x27;t need shaving cream, but it takes longer to get shaved than with a blade, because many patches of my beard require multiple passes (you have to get a feel for the various directions of grain on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>while better than the Activator, it actually cut the hair on my neck, however it also left some nicks.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an older Panasonic for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Because of these design flaws, after applying foam in a wet shaving, more sensitive skin goes into the holes and is scanned by blunt blades.</li>
            <li>Panasonic one is not ready to be a good wet shaving product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great deal and a lot better than Braun&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; crap that costs over $200</li>
            <li>So if it&#x27;s possible to get this same razor without the cleaning system, that&#x27;d probably be a better buy.</li>
            <li>ITSELF CLEANS SO EASILY WITH A LITTLE SOAP AND HOT WATER.</li>
            <li>The true test is my 7 year old granddaughter who really can&#x27;t get enough of Pop-Pop.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>The indicator was still at high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this  shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>again, i went for the high end model, the SoftTouch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i bought the ES8077S Vortex with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>This razer was highly rated</li>
            <li>I can only think this will get better in the next two to three weeks as my face gets use to the new razor.</li>
            <li>It even has a much quieter sound than the other one ever had.  </li>
            <li>Works fine wet, but I find that to be a pain.  </li>
            <li>It certainly cuts closer than my old razor.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is in the 9 hour range, maybe a little better.  </li>
            <li>This razors features that make it a little better than others</li>
            <li>I do use the cleaner which I feel does condition the blade and screen a little more than just rinsing it out, but you do have that option as well.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m sure my skin may just need a little time to adjust.  </li>
            <li>But i must say i had to  change them a little more than every year.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has the most sensitive skin of anyone i have ever met and wouls only use a triple bladed brand new razor everytime he shaved( throwing it away for a new blade each time to make sure it was sharp enough).</li>
            <li>Seriously, it has great features, and is solidly built</li>
            <li>only gripe is that I can not get a clean shave near the adam&#x27;s apple area.</li>
            <li>I suspect that there are some small design differences from dedicated dry shavers, so don&#x27;t expect a wet/dry shaver to be comparable to the best dry-only shavers when used dry.  </li>
            <li>If the shaver worked cleanly the first time, the shave would have been comfortable, but the need for repeated passes made the shaver a bit irritating.</li>
            <li>In contrast, this new pansonic vortex seems to be an improvement over even my older panasonic in that it has a triple blade system.</li>
            <li>I wanted to upgrade from my older Panasonic electric shaver, which still worked, but needed a new screen and cutter blade.</li>
            <li>yes, the clean cycle is long but its cheaper than paying $250 for the new pulsonic.</li>
            <li>Like a rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Vortex unit seemed to clean and dry the shaver thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is also much lighter than my old Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And, if you don&#x27;t want to travel with that apparatus, you can use liquid hand soap to clean up and air dry it.  </li>
            <li>He also says that with the sensitive skin of his (he had a beard for 10+ years), it shaves very well in wet-mode with the gel.</li>
            <li>, the whole issue some users have with sensitive skin is mentioned in the user&#x27;s guide.  </li>
            <li>but it is still early to really know.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s so effective that even when i don&#x27;t, it still does</li>
            <li>The shaver works well enough but the trimmer pretty much burnt and melted his beard.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s round in shape so in the end might take up more suitcase room.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It feels good in my hand...not too big or small.   </li>
            <li>You can also rinse the razor with hot water before cleaning and the solution will last much longer.</li>
            <li>I have been a long time blade shaver - most recently with the Mach3.  </li>
            <li>I figured that to be normal whether I cleaned it</li>
            <li>I have only used the shaver for a few weeks - nothing but good experience so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One caveat with the cleaning process: if the water and the cleaning solution cartridge aren&#x27;t fresh, the razor can be quite smelly when you go to use it the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m not going to be spending on cleaning cartridges every few months, so that&#x27;s even more money saved.</li>
            <li>And long battery life comes in handy with this shaver, because it takes a long time to shave - up to 10 minutes versus 3-4 minutes with my old Braun.    </li>
            <li>I think this shaver gives a fair shave, not great.</li>
            <li>I have now had it for about six weeks and highly recommend it if you are looking for a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I have always had to shave with a mach3 or a fusion due to the thickness of my beard, but this Panasonic does a fine job.</li>
            <li>I was considering replacing it with a new Activator, but after reading a few reviews of the Panasonic decided it might be more to my liking, based almost solely on the fact it could be used in the shower or with shaving gel.</li>
            <li>This razor left my face feeling smooth with no burn, and to this point, not a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>But it still lasts more than a week, and part of the reason for the shorter life may be related to the fact that now I shave a bit longer because this model gets my face almost blade-close with a dry shave.</li>
            <li>i use panasonic only dry and am already satisfied, but the unit is supposed to be watertight and panasonic invites you to try using the shaver with shaving foam for an even closer shave, not even an option with the braun.</li>
            <li>I prefer the dry shaving, but the wet option is nice to have.</li>
            <li>You get a nice shave with this product... wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Right outof the box, I used the shaver for a month before it finally ran out of batteries.  </li>
            <li>In all fairness, I admit I have never used a rotary shaver and was contemplating trying just because of the adams apple thing, but the salesman talked me out of the \\&quot;more expensive rotary\\&quot; because he actually owned the Braun 360 before and like his Panasonic better, and it was an older model than the 8077!    </li>
            <li>and then I got the 8095 and finally the foil died \\&quot;even after religious rinsing afteruse\\&quot; soap scum finally got the best of it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I found not as good as my previous rotary electric is that it does not cut the long hairs very well.</li>
            <li>They were replaceable, but by the time you add up the cost of the replacement batteries, a foil assembly, and the cutter, you might as well buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks my beard got used to the new shaver and there has been no redness, bumps or irritation.  </li>
            <li>but I was told that sometimes it just takes a while for skin to adjust to a new razor and that I should keep using it for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>Anyone want to buy some new cleaning filters?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year and it shaves as well now as it did when it was new.    </li>
            <li>I am going to get some new refills and see if that makes a difference, if not then I will contact Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It feels like using a new razor every time I shave.</li>
            <li>and it still looks and works like new.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic Exchange Program sent me the factory reconditioned unit instead of brand new unit &lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic claims that their refurbished item appearance is like that of a new unit, but its apperance is 100% used &lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh well, here I am now shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>But I like the feature of pivoting shaving head and self-cleaning system in the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I live 20 minutes from my office.</li>
            <li>Rather than invest in a new foil and try to debug the problem with the cleaning system, I&#x27;m going to find a new shaver to try.</li>
            <li>Then I took my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver and began to shave.</li>
            <li>and it did indeed make the shaver feel just like new after each shave, but</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>(but it could be because it is brand new).</li>
            <li>and I was faced with needing a new shaver.</li>
            <li>have sinced purchased a new Panasonic wet-dry shaver (model ES-LA63)</li>
            <li>However it does not do the job right the first time, or the second, or the third.</li>
            <li>I do find that I have to go back over and shave some areas twice, which is not unusual with most razors I&#x27;ve tried.      </li>
            <li>A decently close shave and I like the self cleaning action.</li>
            <li>This is the only electric razor that I don&#x27;t have to go behind with a blade, The hydraclean system is great.</li>
            <li>But with my beard getting more course, I have been even more unhappy than ever with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well dry, and does an even better job wet.</li>
            <li>i want a razor that gives a nice shave all over (face and neck), doesn&#x27;t hurt during the process, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red and dried out when im done.  </li>
            <li>The holder/washer device is a little large and unwieldy for my sink and the device has some problems with the curve of my chin, but overall, am satisfied.</li>
            <li>But this one hacks it all down in fine style.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The panasonic foil system and high speed motors are loud.</li>
            <li>Not too loud but high pitched.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner system, in my honest opinion, is a waste of money except if you are lazy and not want to clean the shaver manually which is a piece of cake to use.</li>
            <li>Higher pitched whine than the Braun, but only a fraction of the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets the job done way better than my past Remington which was a comparable price.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first to actually shave my beard without razor burn.</li>
            <li>It did at first sort of non impress me and got too close on the chin several times.</li>
            <li>However, it caused quite a bit of razor burn on my head the first time I used it and there has not been a second time.  </li>
            <li>At first he resisted using this \\&quot;electronic contraption\\&quot;, but Mom finally talked him into trying it for just one week.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is pretty quiet, so I like it.</li>
            <li>There has to be better out there, not sure what though.</li>
            <li>I have also had 2 Braun self-cleaning shavers in the past, including the latest Activator 8595.</li>
            <li>You get better life out of the battery if you drain it to \\&quot;low\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t usually use the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; option.  </li>
            <li>The first left button push removes the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; LED option, and the process begins in about 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve also owned Braun and Norelco, and have found that foil shavers do a better job.  </li>
            <li>That cost me $ 50 more than necessary due to volume..</li>
            <li>The trimmer is mediocre but you get an amazing shave and you never need to trim really because youll love shaving so much youll want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li>I only wished I had read the reviews and gone with the Panasonic first.  </li>
            <li>I have used them all, starting out with a Sunbeam then a Ronson, Norelco, Remington, Braun and many other brand names</li>
            <li>Anyway, the Panasonic 8077S surprised the heck out of me!    </li>
            <li>My first initial thought was</li>
            <li>x Did not cut all my facial hair on first or, sometimes</li>
            <li>I ended up going back to my hand-held razor and may get another Philips/Norelco, as I&#x27;ve personally had better experiences with those.</li>
            <li>Blades are still going strong and close, though do notice a little bit of having to go over some stubborn areas.</li>
            <li>It is also much easier to clean by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil head and rinsing it under the faucet at</li>
            <li>only problem with the Panasonic is the huge number of models they offer, many of which are identical other than for some minor differences such as color.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system works very well but is somewhat loud and takes several hours to clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>Because of my American Indian &amp; German heritage my beard periodically changes and puts a different load on a regular basis on any razor but the Panasonic seems to handle it nicely.</li>
            <li>With a long flat linear surface, thats easy to do until your used to it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try an electric shaver after many years of only using a blade due to razor burn problems with a couple old electrics I had year before.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an old Norelco triple-header for years and decided to try a new one that would shave closer.   </li>
            <li>finish is cheap compared to my previous shaver [Norelco rotary].</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for the past three months, and thus far I have been fairly pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>It did not bog down, and was able to handle wildly different growth directions.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t give a very good shave when dry.  </li>
            <li>My shave is just as smooth as using a twin blade razor but without the mess.</li>
            <li>Will follow thru at a later date, but don&#x27;t let my minor complaint with the cleaning station deter you, this is a great razor/shaving system.</li>
            <li>First, let it be known that I am VERY critical of \\&quot;things\\&quot; and more prone to negative reviews.</li>
            <li>the trimmer is equally weak and i had to work at it to get a nice even line on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>I get the best shave using a thin layor of regular shave cream, but still have the option (when I&#x27;m in a hurry or camping, on the road, etc) of using a preshave lotion to cut down on any mess or if I don&#x27;t have any water available.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my third Panasonic shaver, and each one shaves better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>And since the two previous models did seem to work better after cleaning, I am assuming that cleaning is the key.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with both the wet shaves and the dry ones.</li>
            <li>I tried it wet and dry, with and without shaving cream, but it invariably took so many passes that I could have shaved just as quicky the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>In about two weeks, they sent back a *complete* unit to me, including a new charger/base unit, which I never even expected, all for free.  </li>
            <li>This puppy blasts cleanly through the thickest stubble without even slowing down.</li>
            <li>My beard does not grow as quickly as others, I use the razor every other day.</li>
            <li>You would be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li>I was a blade shaver for the past 25 years and the older I get, the more it seems that blade shaving caused irritation, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>Obviously, you can always clean it yourself, but throwing down the extra $15 every three months is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver had a slider switch, and that was a problem.</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 stars if the cleaning cycle could be complete faster.  </li>
            <li>Very slim body for those with smaller hands.  </li>
            <li>my old razor</li>
            <li>My old Norelco rotary shaves about as close</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t throw out the old Norelco.</li>
            <li>, I prefer my old Norelco 8892XL, it was a bit quiter and Closer shave than Panasonic.</li>
            <li>FAR safer than blades.</li>
            <li>This impacts the quality of the shave directly.  </li>
            <li>My old $30</li>
            <li>The Panasonic will not run during the charge mode, i.e. you must wait for the shaver to recharge before you can complete your shave.  </li>
            <li>My old razor was a lotion-dispensing Norelco, which is eaily outclassed by the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I know that Panasonic makes a similar razor with a convex head; this may be a solution to the neck issue.    </li>
            <li>Wow what a difference from my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The Pros on this razor far outway the Cons.</li>
            <li>My aging father could no longer shave with a traditional blade and was very fustrated.  </li>
            <li>The shaver shaves really well on the cheeks but neds multiple run throughs on the chin areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does shave closer than my old one, but not in one stroke like some users have said.  </li>
            <li>I would hope it&#x27;s closer since my old one had been used for years and should have been duller.</li>
            <li>and it never came as close as my old Remington.  </li>
            <li>loud - noisy  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my three year old Panasonic ES8023.</li>
            <li>He hates to shave but has to shave for work nearly every day.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used an electic since my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>accidental 2 foot drop and the razor became incredibly loud from there on out.  </li>
            <li>So loud it hurt my ears to shave.  </li>
            <li>You can plug the shaver in directly to the outlet with the cord.</li>
            <li>I would note that the cleaning cycle really does take 3 hours...and the unit runs the entire time.  </li>
            <li>old Norelco rotary (seldom used) and</li>
            <li>The trimmer is on the back of the shaver and although it could be a bit wider it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I GOT SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t follow facial contours like the one or two blade Panasonics, which means that it doesn&#x27;t really shave as close.  </li>
            <li>so I should not need to use much of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li>the Norelco frequently irritated my skin, even after the \\&quot;electric shaver break-in period\\&quot; for my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot louder than my old Norelco 955RX.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin that is prone to bumps and ingrown hairs if i shave too close.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>So far it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Takes about 1/2 of the time of my old shaver.</li>
            <li>The Braun did well for while, but after a short time, became VERY noisy.</li>
            <li>I really did not believe it was possible for an electric to shave me this close.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does get nearly as close (but not as close) as a razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas - so far he loves it</li>
            <li>the visible areas (and vital kissing areas  </li>
            <li>About a year ago my old Panasonic bit the dust</li>
            <li>With the Braun, the cleaning station really did help because you could only use the brush on the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning phase is a bit loud and at three hours, pretty long.  </li>
            <li>but it is also twice as expensive (had I know this would be so good for me</li>
            <li>I honestly have not experienced that with this shaver as of yet.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic takes about half the time for a complete shave, wet or dry, as it does not require innumerable passes to get a smooth result; two is fine -- three if you&#x27;re meticulous.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very little irritation.</li>
            <li>Also, the pivot mechanism, which can be locked, combined with that middle slotted blade, helps get every last whisker, even those quarter-inch long \\&quot;rogue&#x27;s\\&quot; that sometimes magically appear on a man&#x27;s upper cheek, or neck.</li>
            <li>In short, the parts (accessories) aren&#x27;t cheap, but they last twice as long.  </li>
            <li>The charge indicator  (low, med, high) has been quite accurate for me, as opposed to several other reviewer&#x27;s comments.  </li>
            <li>Also, the small pop-up trimmer is precise enough to permit trimming around your ears and other areas in between haircuts (yes, I&#x27;m also cheap).</li>
            <li>This type of battery is more expensive, but will give full performance much longer than other battery types.     </li>
            <li>It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair.  </li>
            <li>The holes on the screen are also too big for wet shaving, though they are OK for dry work.</li>
            <li>I even use it to keep my shaved head slick, which allows hte current summer heat to disspate just a bit better.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin gets knicks and cuts from the regular razor.</li>
            <li>and you have a very expensive investment for a minimal shave at best.</li>
            <li>The two main blades appear to move in opposite directions, resulting in virtually no vibration.</li>
            <li>I was getting a decent shave with it until about the sixth month, when the cleaning system broke and repeatedly leaked its cleaning fluid into the receptacle that the shaver sits in.  </li>
            <li>However, after several weeks it was apparent to me that this one gives a much smoother feeling shave.</li>
            <li>the Braun, in particular, really left my face burning when i applied aftershave.   </li>
            <li>had a Norelco rotary that was probably 10 years old and rarely used it because it pulled and did an average job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rather high initial cost</li>
            <li>then i remembered that i had owned a Panasonic shaver back in high school.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, still highly recommended, after 3 years of daily use.</li>
            <li>This is quick without the mess.</li>
            <li>I am returning to my old braun - simply going to buy a new foil &amp; razor kit replacement for $18.    </li>
            <li>I am using it dry although wet shaving with soap was also fantastic.</li>
            <li>The only part of the equation that is not as easy as a razor is the crevace of the neck and the adams apple, that takes a few days or weeks to master.    </li>
            <li>I should also explain I do NOT like rotary style shavers (mainly for comfort) and regular blades ALWAYS cause massive razor burn, even those new 4-blade monsters.</li>
            <li>From the first shave there was absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li>And then the unit starting running normally again.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver some 20+ years ago for roughly $10.  </li>
            <li>I just use normal soap to lather my face and my fingers of my left hand to guide what I do.    </li>
            <li>For the first 5 min, it can be quite loud, but don&#x27;t worry that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t feel i was moving it over my skin too quickly, but even after just one days growth, i felt the little blades tugging on some of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>quieter motor, higher frequency hum than braun, which has a loud and harsh noise that had not improved at all with the new Activator.</li>
            <li>Insofar as the cleaning cycle is concerned--yes, it&#x27;s loud, but only for the first 15 minutes or so of the cycle (after that, the remainder of the 3 hour cleaning cycle is relatively quiet or even silent).  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It took my beard several weeks to adjust to using a cordless shaver and the Panasonic documentation indicates it can take up to 30 days to adjust to this new razor and they were correct.  </li>
            <li>Recently I decided to get a new razor and did a lot or research.</li>
            <li>Having had a panasonic for several years, I wanted to update it to a new model.  </li>
            <li>It cuts really close in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li>Dry shaving with an electric never worked well for me - crappy shave and too much irritation.  </li>
            <li>Bit more expensive, but the Braun cleaning station is much faster than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Bit more expensive, but the Braun cleaning station is much faster than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I had been using an old Braun shaver for quite a few years which worked only OK as long as I changed out the blades once in awhile, so I bought this Panasonic Vortex due to my dad&#x27;s positive experience with his.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and can be used for about a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>in fact, i can apply aftershave, right after using the shaver and only experience a very minimum sting, less eventhan a regular blade.  </li>
            <li>I specially like that It can be used dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning system is a major plus.</li>
            <li>The major distinction of the Panasonic is its waterproof case.  </li>
            <li>I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off.</li>
            <li>cleaning base also comes very handy although I don&#x27;t find myself using cleaning feature very often.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure it will remove the soap scum issue in the future and maintain superior cutting performance</li>
            <li>Sure the neck is tough.  </li>
            <li>Next day, they go right in with all the other whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor requires only a very light pressure against my skin; this is quite different from my past razors and took me a couple of days to adapt to, but the result is no skin irritation at all!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 wks now, so here are my general thoughts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The price of replacement standard double or triple blade cartridges has really seemed to go up in price the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>Battery life is a tad shorter than with my old Panasonic, but then this one has that 13,000 RPM Linear motor, and extra LEDs to power.</li>
            <li>The only flaw is it is fairly loud when you shave and when it self cleans.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>The old panasonic and brauns have two blades on either side of a central comb that i suppose guides and preps the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought 12 of them for $15 with the razor, and I have only used two so far.  </li>
            <li>I never got a complete shave especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I have no regrets in the purchase.</li>
            <li>- Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there.</li>
            <li>Panasonic shavers shave very closely, and you can use it wet.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a 25 yr old white guy with medium beard thickness.  </li>
            <li>I usually consider Panasonic  upgrades \\&quot;gimmicks\\&quot; since many times they appear to be the same razor with the same features with a different model number.    </li>
            <li>But its wet shaving is very problematic.</li>
            <li>The Vortex shaves closer with less irritation, but it does take a little more time to shave when using a shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>Since this happened during hot and sticky whether I figured a wet/dry shaver would work better and be less irritating.</li>
            <li>and i liked how it told you when it was dirty and when it needed new blades</li>
            <li>i just got should last me 6 months, just buck and half per month, well worth the convenience and quality of cleansing.</li>
            <li>Perfect... last years I used other razor and was bad experience.</li>
            <li>A whole 3-pack of panasonic is smaller in size than a single braun cartridge.</li>
            <li>linear motor in this shaver will maintain its 13,000 RPM speed through heavy beard growth right up to the moment the batteries die.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the ES8077S shaver as a replacement since it took Panasonic over 2 months to repair my last ES8092 shaver which promptly starting exhibiting the exact same lost-charge behavior within two months of finally receiving the replacement.</li>
            <li>The shave is fine---not as close as with a blade, but then also no more nicks or cuts!Cleaning&#x27;s been a cinch...just a bit of liquid soap on the shaving head and then a quick rinse off.</li>
            <li>I think the cleaning base is mostly a gimmick - cleans fine in the shower or sink with soap.    </li>
            <li>Always seem to use Norelco&#x27;s but over time I have come to the realization that Norelco&#x27;s are really hard to clean and thus don&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li>i did not buy the one with the cleaning unit, but it wasn&#x27;t hard to clean at all.  </li>
            <li>The middle blade cuts the longer hairs and the regular foil blades subsequently shave them normally.  </li>
            <li>Went back to regular old shaving.</li>
            <li>This does a fairly good job of cutting, however, the head is smaller than the Braun with which I replaced with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave.  </li>
            <li>This one is different, it handles my thin beard hair better and the dry/wet capability helps my skin, too.</li>
            <li>The panasonic delivers a nice shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face even close to as bad as the other electric shavers I have tried, specially if I shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>(yeah I live in an area of limited consumer choices).  </li>
            <li>However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  </li>
            <li>His first 2-3 days left the skin slightly irritated on his face &amp; neck, but towards the end of the week he started liking it.</li>
            <li>As an electrical engineer, I can tell that this razor does not use the usual battery driven motor, but incorporates a high frequency electronic drive system that gives full performance even as the battery starts to run down.    </li>
            <li>I generally shave with a razor in the shower, but there are plenty of days where I don&#x27;t shower until later in the day.  </li>
            <li>i was not able to shace this often with a razor, since the facial hair would not be long enought to cut smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought the Panasonic ES 8077 Vortex after much research and comparing it to other brands like the Braun 360.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning station for the Braun, your only other choice is to use the cleaning brush they include with the shaver, which is a real pain.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning station for the Braun, your only other choice is to use the cleaning brush they include with the shaver, which is a real pain.</li>
            <li>The first couple of shaves did irritate my neck area, but after a few days that was not an issue anymore.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is small, but I don&#x27;t need a powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>The first few times he used the shaver, he had razor burn</li>
            <li>I get a close shave every time for the first few months, however, I do notice after about 6 months of use the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close anymore.  </li>
            <li>in all, this a quality addition to my shaving toolbox, and comes closer than any other electric razor to the closeness of a good traditional shave in far less time, and with no more irritation than that from a careful blade shave.</li>
            <li>have a heavy, stiff Scottish beard, and most electrics leave a lot of stubble, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but at least in the short run it is performing nicely.</li>
            <li>My only real fault with the system is when you clean the razor on the self-cleaning base it is pretty loud.</li>
            <li>I dry shave my leathery old face</li>
            <li>This razor gives me a much closer shave than my previous.  </li>
            <li>No toilet paper to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li>It also does its thing pretty quickly, usually only requiring a few passes to take off my bristle.</li>
            <li>i could hear that it was slowing down and at least be able to finish shaving with it</li>
            <li>If you press TOO hard with an electric razor, you will cut the hairs too far \\&quot;underneath\\&quot; the skin line and when the hair attempts to regrow, if it doesn&#x27;t find the exact same hole it had before, it jams and becomes in ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>He has not used his old shaving mug &amp; single edge razor since his surgery.</li>
            <li>have tried other older style cordless shavers and they did not shave as close as standard blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>Considering the cost of the shaver, it would have been nice if it had lasted at least one more year :(  </li>
            <li>(though, obviously i didn&#x27;t have it long enough to see them in action).   </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is pretty much useless, despite having religiously replaced the cleaning module and tank with fresh water every 40 shaves.</li>
            <li>Took about the same time to shave as my previous shavers, but it feels like I shaved with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard; however, this shaver takes longer to get a smooth shave than my previous three Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>much like that little girl would have</li>
            <li>It likes a little talcum powder when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner-drier-charger works very well.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, it works at least as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>You can choose to charge the battery with each use, using a single button on the left, which cycles through the choices, indicated on the three green LEDs on the right.  </li>

            <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I never used the Braun system, but the Panasonic \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; system is very, very impressive from the technological standpoint.  </li>
            <li> It makes the razor \\&quot;smell better\\&quot; and I think it cuts best after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would use the cleaning system, but after trying it, I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased at Best Buy at a close out price of $71, rather than $100</li>
            <li> I was not looking for the best priced razor, I was looking for the best razor!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent razor and I would buy another one tommorrow if it was necessay.</li>
            <li> Very happy.</li>
            <li> He loves it, which is the best part!  </li>
            <li> Excellent!</li>
            <li> in all, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used, and that list includes a number of Norelcos and Brauns.</li>
            <li> worked perfectly.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!    </li>
            <li> My skin seems to have adjusted perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I would now give the product a perfect 5!)  </li>
            <li> THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE</li>
            <li> Excellent wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> To this day I still don&#x27;t understand their rationale, but I figured it was a perfect time to take another look at electrics.</li>
            <li> Best Buy</li>
            <li> self-cleaning unit does a perfect job of eliminating all the hair and residue from the razor (another reason I purchased this model...</li>
            <li> And the shaver runs perfectly after rinsing it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shave quality.  </li>
            <li> However now he is very happy with it and can shave as often as he needs to without having rashes.</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> But this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this razor, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best of all worlds!</li>
            <li> I always used blades and was always in search for the best one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The design of the unit is in my opinion the best on the market of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> best part is that it is not required for charging.</li>
            <li> The shaver does an excellent job, providing a closer shave than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This shaver was the greatest.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutly perfect!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;very happy shaver!</li>
            <li> and it is still shaving excellent.  </li>
            <li> my neck area, the Vortex isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li> Each time I thought that THIS ONE was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had that was not done with shaving foam and a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  </li>
            <li> &quot;.. anyway, I found one at Best Buy..</li>
            <li> Seems I do it best if I quit thinking in \\&quot;shaving mode\\&quot; and act like I&#x27;m someone else shaving my neck.. \\&quot;Does that make sense?\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I am totally impressed!  </li>
            <li> , just received this panasonic and am getting the best shave of my life with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The Hydraclean System does an excellent job of cleaning and preserving the blades for extended use.</li>
            <li> All in all a excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> BUT to get the best shave do you have to learn how move this raizor, because on the contrary you will some areas with no shave.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li> Excellent price and purchase</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for over a month, and the battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li> all\\&quot; even with the best of BRAUN&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever.</li>
            <li> I reviewed a ton of products and this came up the best for being versitile and the best shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> if you want a great razor get this one!</li>
            <li> On top of that, IT WASN\\&quot;T SHAVED!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This panasonic electric wet/dry razor is very good.  </li>

            <li> The price was very good since there was a $[...]</li>
            <li> very good product ,you are not going to get result like a razer</li>
            <li> All in all the Panasonic ES8077S is a very good deal for the money</li>
            <li> also, for some reason, it isn&#x27;t very good at using it to get the stray whisker.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Incredible.</li>
            <li> MY FACE MOISTURING SHAVE, an incredibly lubricating shaving lotion</li>
            <li> - I replaced it with a Braun PocketGo 370 for $20, which works brilliantly.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as perfectly close as a blade on my beard area, but for the speed and savings, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> just the Panasonic is noticibely superior!</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> self cleaning feature is really a great plus</li>

            <li> This shaver is great.</li>
            <li> In their defense, it does do a great job cleaning.  </li>

            <li> The trimmer itself is great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077 is a great razor.</li>
            <li> also use it before going out at night if I have a bit of a shadow, and it works great for that too.  </li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning function is great too.  </li>
            <li> I bought him the Panasonic Vortex shaver and he&#x27;s just happy as a clam.  </li>
            <li> This product is great....</li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric shaver turned out to be a great gift for my husband.  </li>
            <li> The lithium-ion battery is great.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry option is great -</li>
            <li> and when I get home it looks great.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy to see there didn&#x27;t appear to be any stray whiskers in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been generally happy with the quality and closeness of the shave I get from these</li>
            <li> I was quite happy with my ES8077.  </li>
            <li> Great product for men and women.</li>
            <li> Close shave and works great on legs as well.</li>
            <li> rinse everything off, and it&#x27;s in great shape.</li>
            <li> ES8077 gives a great shave, which is ninety percent of the battle when using any razor.</li>
            <li> Great value from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> If you want to know the trick I used to shave under the chin and neckline and get a great shave just try to shave the way your beard grows.</li>
            <li> in all, there are a lot of great shavers out there.</li>
            <li> in all, there are a lot of great shavers out there.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is a great unit.</li>
            <li> Great piece.</li>
            <li> You can use the Vortex Hydraclean system, which does a great job of cleaning out the shaver.</li>
            <li> Here is what I experienced with this razor:  </li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced (but still suboptimal).</li>
            <li> I think Panasonic has done it again with a very nice reasoniable cost unit.</li>
            <li> Use in the shower or at the sink poses no problems, this is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> The Braun comes with a very nice leather pouch and, with a bit if playing around, it will contiune to serve as the carrier for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Positives: Very nice design -</li>
            <li> A very nice shaver -</li>
            <li> The cleaning feature is very nice, too.</li>
            <li> But Panasonic is very good , Nice linear shaver.</li>
            <li> Superior quality, give great shave.</li>
            <li> cleaning system may be the difference between good and great shaves using Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> How do you get any better than the best shave you have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews and getting a great deal on this one for eighty dollars I decided to give it a thirty day trial &lt;br</li>
            <li> the panasonic es8077s is the best shaver i have ever owned, love the wet&amp;dry .</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I made the purchase, knowing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it if it didn&#x27;t work out, but I am very happy I took the chance.    </li>
            <li> I almost bought into the latest and greatest of Brauns&#x27;, but kept reading and comparing ......</li>
            <li> I am learning tips to make it work better on my neck, so it&#x27;s almost perfect, even on those</li>
            <li> all are so easy and perfect!    </li>
            <li> The cleaner works good.  </li>
            <li> So I returned that razor and searched online for reviews that said something along the lines of \\&quot;as good as Braun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The Panasonic seemed like a good option</li>
            <li> Unit has a good ergonomic feel.</li>
            <li> but I believe it will be good too just based on how good the shaver is to use.</li>
            <li> It gives him a good shave in/out of the shower.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good...    </li>
            <li> You feel like you are dragging the Pana across your skin, even with a good preshave in use.  </li>
            <li> but I feel that the Braun cleaning system is superior.  </li>
            <li> almost as good.  </li>
            <li> but my decision to try out Panasonic was a good one.  </li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> this is a great razor rated 3rd best from cunsumer reports but for the money this is the best you can buy</li>
            <li> A good electric razor for a good price.</li>
            <li> This shaver looked like a good one</li>
            <li> But it gives a good close shave otherwise.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> AND WHEN I TRIED TO FIND A BRAUN REPLACEMENT FOR A FAIR PRICE</li>
            <li> I get a good close shave, so say the ladies, and no nicks.</li>
            <li> but I needed an electric while recovering from shoulder surgery on my good arm.    </li>
            <li> Good shave but takes some time.  </li>
            <li> The reviews looked good</li>
            <li> Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior.  </li>
            <li> This unit gives a superior shave for me, however.    </li>
            <li> I guess the foil razor is just not as good for me.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I did get a couple of nicks with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> is also a good shaver.</li>
            <li> is also a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Saw lots of good reviews for this Panasonic and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this electric razor.</li>
            <li> The Panasonics are superior to the Brauns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but i think can be moore cheaper.</li>
            <li> And this works just as good, and there are instructions how to do this, in the box.</li>
            <li> According to my husband: This razor does a good job.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of &#x27;Panasonic&#x27; for a good razor, so</li>
            <li> The good:  </li>
            <li> It is the best shaver I ever had,and I am over 81 yrs.old,but I think it is a ripoff to buy the cleaning system when they tell you all you have to do is use some liquid soap and water to clean the shaver,and don&#x27;t need the cleaning system to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> Well, this shaver has all of that: close, clean shaves but zero skin irritation, and the self-cleaning system is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic does excellent job to clean neck area</li>
            <li> Needed something to replace a Braun 7075, which I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> bought this shaver on my b&#x27;day after reading all the reviews here and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift and the &#x27;receiver&#x27; is very satisfied with the shaver/cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Good battery life and nice grip on the shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent close shave; no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;; quite operation; Pivotal shaving head; easy cleaning procedure.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are excellent, but couldn&#x27;t do a better or faster job than my Gilette.</li>
            <li> i am fully pleased with this shaver and all components connected to it, the best electric shaver i have ever used, smooth with no irritations.</li>
            <li> a good feature - cleaning is very easy.  </li>
            <li> I could not ask for more!</li>
            <li> (make sure you have finished shaving before you start it cleaning!)  </li>
            <li> (Either are better than what I didn&#x27;t do before!)</li>
            <li> I think it has more technology than the razor!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Basically, I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Sure!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is so much better!</li>
            <li> it was able to catch those left-over hairs below the surface!</li>
            <li> this to say, make sure you use the cartridge system it tells you to!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> at first, i was very happy with the Activator.  </li>
            <li> and it was much more successful around my neck.  </li>
            <li> After years of this I decided to try an electric shaver and chose this model based on reviews and Amazon.com&#x27;s \\&quot;Gold\\&quot; recommendation (top tier shaver!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and have been able to shave every day with no irritation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on the over $200 units!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on the over $200 units!</li>
            <li> Then I read all these \\&quot;Best thing since sliced bread\\&quot; reviews on this particular shaver and was persuaded to buy thanx to Amazon&#x27;s good return policy I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being saddled with a $100 shaver I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Certainly one of the best in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li> It shaves amazingly close.  </li>
            <li> AND IT PROVIDES A GREAT COMFORTABLE SHAVE EITHER WAY.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> It feels great in the hand and the pivoting head will follow the contour of your face precisely.</li>
            <li> I feel I got a great level of shaver for about as cheap as it gets.</li>
            <li> I feel I got a great level of shaver for about as cheap as it gets.</li>
            <li> It is also nice if you had to use in the shower, although I&#x27;m not one to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> if you get caught, it&#x27;s your own fault.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is a nice feature that works well when shaving the jaw line.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that after a year of use</li>
            <li> I really liked the Braun but decided to give the Panasonic a try based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Still loving it.</li>
            <li> braun&#x27;s cleaner had lemony scent which is nice, panasonic has no scent, just like out of the box.</li>
            <li> I am trying to be honest in this review so someone buying this will know my feelings about this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great back-up, does a very close shave, has a trimmer for sideburns and neck, and works great</li>
            <li> I liked this razor a lot.  </li>
            <li> but this is a nice option.    </li>
            <li> This very well might be the best electric razor out there</li>
            <li> He really liked it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice feel in my hand and</li>
            <li> Braun is a good razor, but the Panasonic is better by a two-star margin.</li>
            <li> I am a quality kind of guy.  </li>
            <li> And the cleaning unit is really nice also.  </li>
            <li> I hope to get many good years from this unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try to rinse it off each time on my own and use the brush which came with the razor.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is not as good as most people here seem to think.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice    </li>
            <li> The best electric razor I have used by far!!!</li>
            <li> Does a very good job of cleaning &#x3D;) Quite economical too!</li>
            <li> as a person who really enjoyed almost 6 good years of use from my Braun, I am very happy with the new Panasonic and do not regret for a moment the switch.</li>
            <li> This one is the best - mainly because of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Cool package and all the cleaning and charging stuff worked great</li>
            <li> The shave I get from my new Panasonic is awesome.  </li>
            <li> and she said the she loved how easy that was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good in my hand, and is easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> The hydraclean system works great and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery lasts for four shaves with 3-day stubble; quite good in my opinion; 3) The shaver can be used in the shower, and with warm water and a light layer of shaving cream applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Probably the best electric shaver out there and pretty cheap for the amazing quality it provides....</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver to replace a Norelco one that just did not shave as good as I liked.  </li>
            <li> It is far and away the best I have ever owned, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this product as excellent product but its not for sensitive skin as you can still get razor burns.</li>
            <li> It gave a good shave; it could be used in the shower; and, it worked well with shaving gel for a really smooth shave without any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product so far.</li>
            <li> It is the best electric razor I have used by far.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is -- don&#x27;t expect a real clean shave unless you&#x27;ve got a baby-face beard.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome, it works good when used dry but even better with a nice lather on your face.</li>
            <li> For best results I use it with shaving foam but still get good results dry.</li>
            <li> When I wiped my face clean it looked almost as good as a blade shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> for a good razor, so I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got...</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is a great shaver for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Yes, the system is easy to use and does a good job, but you can do an equally good job with just some running water and Remington Shaver Saver spray (that stuff is great for cleaning and lubing the shaver -- makes your blades and foils last longer and work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth shave (think baby butt).  </li>
            <li> The razor feels very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It is an effective product which basically does what is promissed: an easy, close shave.</li>
            <li> Cleaning with just soap and water is easy and effective, but I paid for the cleaning station and it should work as designed.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, cleans itself and shaves nice with or without lotion.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle takes nearly 3 hours, and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> They were both OK.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> THE CLEANING IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BRAUN &lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MANY BRANDS OF ELECTRIC SHAVERS .</li>
            <li> you may discover that the newest models are still better than your rebuilt one anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> Was expecting much more from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> , I shave my head also, which poses a problem for so many razors designed for face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Faster cut, I found that more areas that I shaved didn&#x27;t need to be gone over as many times as I did with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Seems to get more with every pass.  </li>
            <li> And where it went, was nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;HydraClean Syatem\\&quot;  I find I get a nice smooth shave .</li>
            <li> After receiving  my Panasonic wet/dry ES8077S shaver,I am greatly pleased with the system.</li>
            <li> so this was a going to be interesting.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s battery life is more than ample.  </li>
            <li> I also dont bother with the cleaner because it doesn&#x27;t do much better than just rinsing off in the sink.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors in my life and none have given me a shave like this one.</li>
            <li> , it is lighter and fits better in my hand.</li>
            <li> Interesting cleaning and charging station</li>
            <li> * Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to shave the hair on my chin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it seems that it works for most folks.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I had no transition period....</li>
            <li> This is a much better product.</li>
            <li> it shave better than the Braun Synchro?  </li>
            <li> This is an OK electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It is not so good on the neck area, especially if you have ingrows, but does a great job on my face.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by this razor that I bought two more as christmas presents last year.</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> however the longer he uses it the better performance he is getting out of it.</li>
            <li> I now shave my entire head and this shaver is the best thing I could have bought this year for christmas.</li>
            <li> , had you dolphin-blocked her one too many times.</li>
            <li> and I get more cuts and abrasions from the damn trimmer than from the shaver, even though the usage is probably 100 times more for the shaver than the trimmer.</li>
            <li> , I love it!!\\</li>
            <li> The shave is closer and more &#x27;blade-like&#x27; than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to get the most favorable ones.  </li>
            <li> Remington does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to sure what it does</li>
            <li> Because reviewers gave the Panasonic better reviews.</li>
            <li> Sure, but why?  </li>
            <li> The best way I can compare performance is this: let&#x27;s say that if you shave with a blade, your beard will become noticeable 10 hours later.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this magic stuff is, but it works.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco, by comparison, is better able to get into the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> and I find myself touching up after EVERY shave with a Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li> ( better you should use that).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic ES8003 linear shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> and it may take more time for my skin to gets use to it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it partically for the trimmer and the fact its one of the most recommended shaver.</li>
            <li> the panasonics do a better job of hugging the contours of your face than the brauns as the head pivots in more directions.</li>
            <li> handle is also more contoured for gripping too, braun is just a brick shape.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get refills from Amazon 3-pack for $8.88.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HyrdraClean Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System really gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES8077S shaver six months ago, after I gave up on getting replacement batteries for my ES8033--both are linear-motor powered--that gave me four-years of satisfying use.  </li>
            <li> Initial impressions are that this is the best that I&#x27;ve owned.    </li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied.    </li>
            <li> and I am in search of a better replacement.</li>
            <li> In that time I have used most all brands.</li>
            <li> The one I have used most is the Remington.</li>
            <li> but I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> For that type of money I was expecting something better.  </li>
            <li> But gilette will not get much more money from me..</li>
            <li> panasonic could have given a better travel pouch for the shaver.</li>
            <li> When they are working I love these razors for their close wet/dry shave.</li>
            <li> My latest ES8077S razor started exhibiting this behavior 2 weeks ago and now won&#x27;t even turn on at all despite repeated cleanings/chargings.</li>
            <li> I love the option of cream or no cream.  </li>
            <li> a top end razor should.  </li>
            <li> I would totally Recommend this product, its the best item for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Overall this is an excellent razor</li>
            <li> I had to run it across my neck so many times that it would always get irritated.</li>
            <li> This shaver is all the others have said and more. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> top of everything else, this Panasonic shaver is cheaper than the competitors in this space.   </li>
            <li> ...order the Panasonic and treat yourself to a better shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the Panasonic and would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> More water came out.</li>
            <li> Many moons ago.</li>
            <li> how many passes I&#x27;d try.  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Glad I parked it.</li>
            <li> glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li> The problem with my skin is that I can&#x27;t shave more often than once in four days</li>
            <li> I look for quality over price most all of the time.  </li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews here.    </li>
            <li> There also has to be a better way of throughly cleaning the unit inbetween cartridge changings.  </li>
            <li> Mine grows sideways(in that area only) and with the linear head the shaver works superb with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions and shave with a 90 degree angle you will go over that area many times before your beard disappears.</li>
            <li> Others say the difference is not at all meaningful.</li>
            <li> I went for this model since it was quite a bit cheaper than the convex head models (and the replacement heads are cheaper as well), but still gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> But, like most guys, I like my toys, so I got one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning refills are also a bit more money than the Panasonic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, like most guys, I like my toys, so I got one.  </li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning refills are also a bit more money than the Panasonic ones.  </li>
            <li> whole purchase process was great also.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is better than a blade and no cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li> The circular motions you use with a rotary razor seem to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned mostly rotary shavers over the years and been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> On the sides of my face, the shave closeness WAS outstanding.  </li>
            <li> *Not an OUTSTANDING shave.     </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that I can feel my stubble more at the end of the  day than with a blade.  </li>
            <li> This has been the next best thing.</li>
            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> i would have gladly sacrificed that for a better neck area shave.   </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never had a self-cleaning wet/dry razor before and am really enjoying this one.</li>
            <li> I have owned Panasonic wet/dry razors for several years and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for many years.</li>
            <li> This razor is way better than the Braun.</li>
            <li> The ONLY problem I found is that it does not do a real good job along the neck line area below the chin.</li>
            <li> I threw that in for free!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 1 year to see if it held up</li>
            <li> Hav&#x27;t had to use the side trimmer yet . :)</li>
            <li> This one worked much better.  </li>
            <li> While it did take more time to shave, never once did this shaver get upset.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic linear shaver is a safe choice</li>
            <li> and I do not believe you can purchase a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and reading the reviews on here, I decided to purchase this model to replace a Braun I have had for many years.</li>
            <li> almost ordered one or two more ......</li>
            <li> I never imagined a shaver that would shave as close as a blade with much more comfort.  </li>
            <li> They had it on sale @ Circuit City, but here at Amazon it was a better deal.</li>
            <li> this razor seems kind of light.</li>
            <li> I will return it for a refund and get a better brand.</li>
            <li> - It shaves tricky areas like the neck much better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> - Better grip than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Is it really better than my Norelco?  </li>
            <li> thats awesome enough for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does an okay job on my face.  </li>
            <li> It also the self cleaner works very well and is a great added bonus.     </li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> though admittedly never their top</li>
            <li> I like the overall quality of Panasonic shavers and I think that they are the best electric shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the shaver, feel it right and feel it good when holding, let aside that I can shave while showering.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the price and quick delivery from [...].</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product, based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> The auto clean is a nice feature as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and liked it but will clean my shaver manually and use the cleaner about once per week.</li>
            <li> This is nice on the face, because it allows you to shave more quickly.  </li>
            <li> That worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> With this method it does work pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li> All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that the the ES8092 or ES8077S shavers are great if you can justify buying a new one every six months.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle does a great job and the razor feels brand new each time I shave.</li>
            <li> So easy does it, is better.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice quick job.</li>
            <li> The shaver is excellent and generally better than the Braun although it seems to accumulate water if you use it wet.  </li>
            <li> However, as good as it is it still does not give as close a shave as a good standard razor.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it worked okay in the first 6 months even though I felt that my old trusty Braun foil shaver did the work perfectly for years, in comparison.  </li>
            <li> Why in the world does it take 3 hours to clean a shaver???!    </li>
            <li> My husband thinks this shaver is excellent and is enjoying it more than his previous one because of its cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> but he says it does a great job and is always clean and ready to use.</li>
            <li> hygienic selfcleaning system  looks very cool  </li>
            <li> these turned out to be true, however I am getting better with it and my skin is getting more used to it</li>
            <li> The fact that I can shave into the beard with the regular heads without nicking makes this Panasonic ideal.  </li>
            <li> : For wet shave quality, this is the best of the Panasonic product series in my experience.</li>
            <li> so it surprised me he was sooo happy with it.  </li>
            <li> some might say the panasonic feels cheaper/more flimsy, but i feel that the shave outcome is more important.</li>
            <li> It did work better on my smooth cheek</li>
            <li> The best part is you still get the \\&quot;wet shave\\</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, like all the top Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li> far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> i am getting the closest, most comfortable shave with it</li>
            <li> I did found if i use this shaver first then finish off with my old norelco, I can get the best close shave ever!  </li>
            <li> Since I skip a day shaving often, I was worried it would pull more on those days, but it&#x27;s really fantastic on longer-stubble days with no added discomfort, so viva la</li>
            <li> On the whole a good purchase.</li>
            <li> (and shaving a head is a fair amount of real estate)     </li>
            <li> I was very apprehensive about just how good a shave</li>
            <li> and it keeps everything nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I read good reviews on it and have promising hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got...</li>
            <li> I am sure a brand new Braun could be as good</li>
            <li> The shave is close and smooth, and it is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the shave is any better with the new \\&quot;Vortex\\&quot; shape and the new 30 degree angle blades, but it&#x27;s the best I can get with an electric.  </li>
            <li> Very quick and easy, and -- so far -- it&#x27;s given me a great shave.</li>
            <li> Nice and light, comfortable to hold, quiet, and great results, and</li>
            <li> It is remarkably easy to clean even though it comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning station, which I&#x27;ve used sparingly, as it&#x27;s so easy to clean manually.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that I can shave in the shower and it is so easy to clean  </li>
            <li> He was sold on how easy &amp; close this shaver works.</li>
            <li> The vortex cleaning system makes that an easy task.</li>
            <li> Where I would wind up with stray growths with the Braun, the Pana seems to take care of them easily.</li>
            <li> The ES8077S cuts through my wiskers easily, even with two days of growth, and with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is also easy - just use hand</li>
            <li> The cleaning and recharging is easy</li>
            <li> It can be easily cleaned, too, without all the folderol of the hydraclean system (which I have yet to use).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-REALLY convenient (easy to touch up the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow)</li>
            <li> I decided that rather than replacing it with another pricey Panasonic, I would try out a (relatively) cheap Norelco ($44) and so far have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Battery charges lasts over a week, so it can easily be taken out of town without the charger.</li>
            <li> - Easy cleaning by rinsing under a faucet.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit takes up a fair amount amount of counter space, and unless you are a sound sleeper, don&#x27;t run the cleaning cycle while you are trying to sleep; it is noisy.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend Panasonic linear shaver.</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend the Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but not this model.</li>
            <li> it has a strong motor</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver,it has plenty of power far better than the Braun Shaver that I replaced,the pivoting head works fine on the neck ,it is very easy to clean even without using</li>
            <li> Not having done much on the internet, I was apprehensive, but am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor or electric shaver I have ever used of any kind that does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also gives a very good dry shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that my situation turned out more favorably--I sent the shaver portion back via UPS with my original receipt (with a note that pointed out that the shaver was never waterproof).</li>
            <li> parked a perfectly good Norelco floating head razor that had relatively new heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, smooth, easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The shaver still works fine and the charger works, the cleaning system just won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> - The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.    </li>
            <li> just decided from that point on to keep the shaver away from water, and everything was fine.</li>
            <li> The battery is fine, but the razor is shot.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> However, after we called Panasonic and asked detailed questions about using it and were guided through it by a representative, it became easy to use.</li>
            <li> have not used the cleaning system; I just rinse the shaver parts under water and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> , the cleaning goes fine.</li>
            <li> When my husband needed a new razor we were stumped as to which one, but thanks to the great internet we were able to check reviews and ratings and that&#x27;s how we decided on this brand and model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and cuts fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought MANY products from Amazon over the years and this is the FIRST item I&#x27;ve returned! &lt;</li>
            <li> As many others says cleaning process is kind of loud, but it doesnt bother us since my husband shaves</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver fits comfortably in my hand as I shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> As a plus my Wife gets much closer now with my nice stuble</li>
            <li> I enjoy this shaver, PERIOD.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Electrics while they seem like an attractive option simply don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> The best features of this shaver are: 1) It shaves very close and relatively irritation free.</li>
            <li> , it also works great for personal areas.  </li>
            <li> comfortable shaving foils  </li>
            <li> I am old enough (71) to have gone through many electric razors and this is the best I&#x27;ve yet found.      </li>
            <li> capactiy is great; I have taken a ten day trip and made it without recharging.</li>
            <li> The razor does NOT do well on the all important throat and neck area</li>
            <li> At the sale price and the free shipping, this is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean which is an advantage.</li>
            <li> - The popup clipper is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth quality shave.  </li>
            <li> :  The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.    </li>
            <li> - Came with a cheap travel bag.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> When I got this thing it was great.... very quiet and worked well.</li>
            <li> If I had not have gotten such a great deal on the Panasonic, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is not all that important.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is not all that important.</li>
            <li> I SHAVE MY HEAD WITH THIS MACHINE AND ITS SOOOOOOOO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve been really happy with the Panasonic after using it daily for over four years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i figured it would be worth it to buy the top of the line shaver.  </li>
            <li> if i had to offer one criticism of the Vortex, i guess i&#x27;d say it is not as quiet as the SoftTouch, but with its more powerful motor, i would gladly sacrifice the quietness for a good shave and no pulling.   </li>
            <li> Also, in neck area, Barun was not doing such a great job  &lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers since they were called \\&quot;Smooth Operators.\\</li>
            <li> The razor is a beaut, smooth and close shave everytime.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews are accurate, the ES8077S gives a quick clean shave, and it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charge and clean.</li>
            <li> works just terrific, my friend gave me as a gift - which was a great selection.</li>
            <li> I am a happy person who does not have to go around with red cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> more than money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly comfortable and my face did not need any time to adjust to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide as smoothly as the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Thinks it&#x27;s a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very simple -- running the blade under water, or using soap, seems to work better than the cartridge system, which is good if you want to avoid that expense.  </li>
            <li> But since this can be cleaned just with hand soap and water, i&#x27;ll likely use that method most often and just use the built in system every couple months for a good semi annual clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase a $100 shaver, but I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass.</li>
            <li> usually right before he leaves the house :)</li>
            <li> IT REALLY IS OUTSTANDING RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m amazed the full cleaning process takes a whole 3 hours \\&quot;I&#x27;m sure its quite thorough!\\&quot; for a 5 minute shave!..   </li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t feel very powerful to me, but to my surprise it shaved a teensy bit closer than the Activator</li>
            <li> And while it is true blades are always the closer shave, they also cause the most damage to sensitive skin or to anything other than the most smoothe and perfect head.     </li>
            <li> I was very suprised on how close the shave was when I first used it and being able to use it in the shower is really nice.</li>
            <li> Both razors work great for the first 366 days and then the cleaning device completely dies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower, though I mainly just use it in my car.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever been able to shave with an electric and still be smooth at 6 or 7 pm.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I have had that genuinely shaves better - it is substantially smoother when I shave and</li>
            <li> I wish it had more power, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The company won&#x27;t repair it and you are stuck shelling out another $300 for a whole new system, despite the fact that the razor still works great.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, solid and reliable product.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to pick up and have a quality clean shave within minutes.</li>
            <li> The ability to shave with shaving cream is a great feature, is more comfortable than dry, and far more comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li> Have used Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry Shavers for a long time, over 25 years &amp; have been happy with them.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s 8077 is nothing to get excited about,so save your money unless you are into wet/dry shaving with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my original blades.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> First you have to start with a clean face, this is important!</li>
            <li> Bought the top of the line Braun at the same time and have to say the Panasonic is far superior!  </li>
            <li> It takes 2-3 attempts to get it to clean, then charge.  </li>
            <li> I clean and recharge the razor every weekend.</li>
            <li> I never shaved my face this clean and close with electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but the razor gets clean.</li>
            <li> are the wet/dry feature and the fact that you can clean it under water using liquid soap.</li>
            <li> but you can clean this shaver using liquid soap and tap water.  </li>
            <li> She loves to touch my clean shaven face.</li>
            <li> - The Wet/dry feature (which I&#x27;ve yet to try) provides the opportunity to use shaving lather, as well as the ability to clean the shaver without using the Hydraclean system (I do use the system).    </li>
            <li> You can clean it yourself with soap and water if you wish to save on cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I take off the head to see how clean</li>
            <li> I have yet to try to cleaning unit, but here is a breakdown of the time it should take to clean, according to the manual:  </li>
            <li> Since you can rinse it under water, I can get the shaver just as clean as the stand can, and a lot faster.   </li>
            <li> It never got totally clean.  </li>
            <li> The downside is that you HAVE to use the cleaning station -- you can&#x27;t run a Braun 360 under water to clean it like you</li>
            <li> The downside is that you HAVE to use the cleaning station -- you can&#x27;t run a Braun 360 under water to clean it like you</li>
            <li> Another benefit of keeping them clean</li>
            <li> and if i flip up the trimmer, i can easily clean up what it misses, again with no pain or irritation.  </li>
            <li> the Vortex is far and away the best of the 3 shavers in my opinion and this is without even using one of its key features.  </li>
            <li> If your gonna have a docking station and actually use it, its nice to be able to put the shaver in and charge your batteries without fear of developing memory.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The price offered by Amazon for this shaver is among the lowest I found, and the free super saver shipping made it the lowest price over all.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li> It cuts clean and close.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely POSITIVE review by a MANY year Braun and razor user.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get the Pana to show any battery drain even if I keep it out of the charger for a couple weeks!   </li>
            <li> All my razors have been adquate at best, normally I would have to use a safety razor and \\&quot;dry shave\\</li>
            <li> gives me a very close, very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> its very lightweight and comfortable; great to be able to use it like a manual razor - wet with shaving creme; no razor burn, or irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable, quiet,and shaves very closely.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED BRAUN FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS,THE PANASONIC IS SUPERIOR.</li>
            <li> However, the cleaning stand died quickly and won&#x27;t clean anymore.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t quite there, but good enough</li>
            <li> very well pleased.</li>
            <li> * Looks cool &lt;</li>
            <li> think the model with the convex shaver head would be even better for me</li>
            <li> They say to give your skin two weeks to adjust and I believe that it is true.    </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this so much</li>
            <li> It pulls and requires many passes to get a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried shaving in the shower, but you can&#x27;t shave and wash at the same time, since you must hold the razor as well as the washcloth, and you need a good mirror on the wall of the shower or in your hand.  </li>
            <li> It is true that it takes time for skin to adjust to any electric shaver, but not 30 days as noted in the documentation.  </li>
            <li> Best to start that cycle as you&#x27;re on your way out the door in the morning, or at least while crunching on some corn flakes.</li>
            <li> and I get a fairly close shave, almost as close as the Gillette V mach fusion razor which I was using prior.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked good enough on my face.  </li>
            <li> Shaving performance is good for daily shaves, the shave is reasonably close and comparable to the Norelco, maybe even better.</li>
            <li> To be fair to the shaver, I am semi-retired and I only shave about twice a week.  </li>
            <li> the pivoting head action is nice.</li>
            <li> (Not knowing this, I had almost been ready to pay more at Costco.com just for the returnability but decided to take a chance.)</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not necessary to have to keep your shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not necessary to have to keep your shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li> I prefer to follow the quick clean tips that come with the shaver and use the hydraclean every 60 days.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better and gives me a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> MUCH TO MY AMAZEMENT, THIS RAZOR MORE THAN DOES THE JOB.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works well if it has a full charge.  </li>
            <li> and this is more gentle.</li>
            <li> Die-hard blade shavers will tell you that there&#x27;s no closer shave than a blade, and that&#x27;s certainly true,</li>
            <li> Now, my cheeks are full of scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it shaves your face close and cleans its self</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase</li>
            <li> Overall, if you want a quick fairly close shave with a minimum of pulling and irritation, give it a try.</li>
            <li> my main priority in shaving is to have a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> This type of foil razor takes some adjustment as it is easy to burn your skin when you are first adjusting to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much else new to add; the razor is comfortable in the hand, is relatively quiet, the cleaning sytem is fantastic, battery life is very good, does quick work, and does not irritate my skin at all.    </li>
            <li> I am getting great shaves,no skin bites as with other shavers.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this razor after reading about it on this and other sites.  </li>
            <li> I am very glad I did, the wet shave is superior to my old one.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic pays a little more and puts in superior LiIon batteries.    </li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is very good - far better than my previous Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> They should just sell this without the stand, but of course they want to make more money by having you buy new cleaning cartridges!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very smoth, the battery last almost 3 weeks and the cleaning system is great.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s so effective that even when i don&#x27;t, it still does a good job.    </li>
            <li> But i often want a quick shave without the hassle of shaving cream and wetting my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to the razor, and the water inside it starts to stink fairly quickly, causing the razor itself to stink after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Decent buy, there may be a better shaver out there, who knows?</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t shave super close,</li>
            <li> The next best was a Norelco, but the problem with that razor is that if you have a beard or mustache you will constantly be shaving off part of it - it just takes everything.</li>
            <li> If I just charge its done quickly but cleaning seems to have issues.  </li>
            <li> I had to allow IT to do the work and not me in rubbing the razor over my skin quickly and with lots of pressure.</li>
            <li> The shave is close, quick and never a nick.  </li>
            <li> My top criteria were closeness of shave and price, although I liked the fact that the Panasonic was a wet shaver as well.    </li>
            <li> I received the product quickly after purchasing on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It shaves quick and without a doubt it is the closest electric shave.  </li>
            <li> As close as a razor, and just as quick as an electric.</li>
            <li> and it is quick and close shave.</li>
            <li> In an electric shaver, fore-and-aft pivoting is what contributes to a quick, close shave, and this shaver lacks it.    </li>
            <li> cuts closely, rinses easily (soap and water), nice looking, keeps charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The high speed motor is very smooth and powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li> My neck was smooth and there was no irritation even on the first day I used this machine.</li>
            <li> have a very course beard, and at first this razor did a great job on my cheeks, it barely touches my chin, and does virtually nothing on my neck except cut me.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and it is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is the very first electric shaver I have used that shaves as close as a blade</li>
            <li> This is almost as good as a blade, and a lot cheaper over the long run.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that the long hair trimmer works well here and does not irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> Reall enjoy the wet feature,as it feels more comfortable than the dry shave,but both are evenly great.  </li>
            <li> I just use liquid soap and warm water to clean mine (following the directions for manual cleaning in the instructions).    </li>
            <li> My thought was that by spending just a bit more, I could have a new shaver that was self-cleaning, so off to</li>
            <li> I just shaved with my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver System and wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This one came up, and the reviews mentioned in many cases that it worked as good if not better than the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> This is my first real experience with a quality electric shaver as I&#x27;ve been more inclined to use a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The ES8077S not only lives up to its promises regarding the cleaning &amp; drying of the unit, but,gives the best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the cleaner much because it is easy to rinse off when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I have tried it in the shower, and I do not think that it shaves as good as on a dry face, but I think that is just a result of my technique.  </li>
            <li> This shaver&#x27;s dry shaving is good.</li>
            <li> I get a good 4-5 head shaves out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months, and if there&#x27;s a better product on the market, I sure would like to know about it!</li>
            <li> tool\\&quot; of shaving - a stronger, better shave with more noise, an occasional nick, and you need to be willing to spend time on it.</li>
            <li> these new razors are great with the constant speed</li>
            <li> It may not be more economical to buy a new one, but it was always easier.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Since you can get the razor wet, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean on your own.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good dry shaver then forget it and go buy a couple of $20 Braun PocketGo shavers that work far better than this thing.</li>
            <li> The great thing about the product is that when you shave wet (with shaving lotion) there is NO irritation and the shave is SUPER close (really closer than I EVER got with a razor).  </li>
            <li> He is absolutely thrilled about the product and tells me it works just as great for a dry shave or wet shave and has no problems when submerging the razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the cleaner because it&#x27;s a rather large unit that just doesn&#x27;t fit well on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Cannot say the Pana is not doing the job - it seems to work fine - but the Braun just seems a bit better overall.  </li>
            <li> The hydraclean system is a little bulky and very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be better shavers these days, but I think this is a good deal for the money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, have to keep going over and over and will still miss a few.</li>
            <li> All a round the razor is great.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, his skin has gotten use to it and it works great now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for a few weeks now and it gives me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> As I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in over 30 years, I really can&#x27;t give an accurate assessment of how this razor compares to others.</li>
            <li> shaver is worth the money</li>
            <li> which is what I need far more than the side to side pivoting.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have more sensitive skin because they are like hair pullers to me, so i have allways used the foil types and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too early to say if the cleaning is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 50 years, and this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because when used &#x27;wet&#x27; it delivers as close a shave as I can get with any blade.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Much better results than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to shave in the shower as well as the option to touch up at night if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I can get shaving burn that way, but sometimes it is useful.  </li>
            <li> Having a quality product that looks nice is a double benefit.    </li>
            <li> overall nicely designed product but try before you buy</li>
            <li> I even feel that the old shaver is more powerful.</li>
            <li> It cuts close, &lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and holds a charge for a couple of week&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have never had much success with electric razors.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean the old fashioned way</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer (I will use this even when I go back to my blade).  </li>
            <li> Kind of big and clunky.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money 100%</li>
            <li> you can handle the noise, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am completely sold on this shaver - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> i have tried many aftershave products and none has completely eliminated the problem.  </li>
            <li> Vortex, like the Activator, has a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> it shaves my face nice and smooth with absolutely no pulling.  </li>
            <li> the trimmer is powerful and has no difficulty with stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is better than my old norelco 82xx serie.  </li>
            <li> This thing is fast and totally cleans as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> Amazon gets my future business for this kind of service.</li>
            <li> he now can shave evryday and looks much more professional.</li>
            <li> good wet, blade shave takes about 20 minutes</li>
            <li> He normally uses a badger brush, glycerin soap, and razor, but likes to have a more portable, quick alternative for traveling or for weekends when he doesn&#x27;t feel like the whole \\&quot;soap and brush\\</li>
            <li> does take up to 3x longer to clean than braun, but for me that has turned out to be more academic rather than practical issue.</li>
            <li> Might be good compared to other electrics.  </li>
            <li> matter what anyone tells you, the electric doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but the convienence factor outweighs that in the right situations.  </li>
            <li> The charger plug goes right into the razor body if you don&#x27;t have the cleaner device with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and when i applied it to my 2 day beard growth, it mowed right through.  </li>
            <li> sometimes, it just doesn&#x27;t cut that pesky hair even though you are holding it right up to it.   </li>
            <li> I was getting close shaves and no irritation or missed areas right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Take care about it, if you learn how to move, the right pression..</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is very quiet, gives a close shave and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other Panasonic shavers; the first one was satisfactory, the second one was excellent -- but I dropped it and</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend buying this item, it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Their absolute top of the line shaver has a convex head which some people say is a wee bit better than this model with the standard head.</li>
            <li> Wet shave is excellent and dry shave</li>
            <li> but husband seems to be very happy with the product both wet and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this razor whether it&#x27;s a dry shave or wet shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a smaller flip-up trimmer that does an OK job for a quick touch up...</li>
            <li> I mean NEVER gotten a better shave, quick, close, clean, no nicks or cuts or blood and thoroughly enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I will say the cleaning system on this razor is slick and the wet/dry capability is great.  </li>
            <li> This unit is well worth the price, it is the first electric razor that I have owned that lives up to and</li>
            <li> Since using the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean system for the past month, I am greatly amazed at its performance.  </li>
            <li> well built, easy to use, many other plusses.</li>
            <li> It took my face about a week to adjust to the new razor, but it&#x27;s been smooth sailing from there.    </li>
            <li> - The plastic foil protector never seems to click right on the first time.    </li>
            <li> I find that the ES8077S actually shaves better and more comfortably wet than dry; 4) Cleaning the blades and foil is easy -- just apply liquid handsoap to the foil and run the shaver under running warm water, then remove the foil and rinse it out, as well as the blades; 5) It comes with a cleaning, drying and charging station.</li>
            <li> It also holds its charge for ages, is ergonomic and easy to handle and is not too terribly loud.</li>
            <li> Shaves twice as good in half the time.</li>
            <li> Though they claim the inner blade is the sharpest 30 degree blade up to date, the more useful two outer blades are still 90 degree.</li>
            <li> After my fourth Panasonic gave out after 5 years (it didn&#x27;t help that a hotel maid knocked it on the floor and broke it), I decided that since the cheaper Panasonics gave a great shave, the more expensive ones should give an outstanding shave.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic has been working fine so far (about three months).  </li>
            <li> Good points:  can be used in shower  very close wet shave, as close as a blade (watch those nicks!)  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Panasonic and Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It is a little bulkier than the Panasonic razor that I had before, but it is just as good.  </li>
            <li> This is the second electric shaver I own, after using an older shaver for 10 years, also from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> yes, NiCad and NiMh are very good batteries in \\&quot;controlled\\&quot; circumstances.. but not good for real life like LiIon.</li>
            <li> The Vortex cleaning system really keeps the entire head assembly super clean (although I had to clean the part where the head rests once).  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to shave with this model, but far more effective than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> Only use a very little shave cream or just some hot water for best results.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close.    </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor in probably 6-7 years.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that it was quieter.  </li>
            <li> I tried shaving my head - and instantly was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and the price seemed a lot better than some of the higher end Norelcos and Brauns with similar features.</li>
            <li> The first charge lasted about 2 weeks before I had to charge it.</li>
            <li> First off, If i could plug this in and shave i would give it a 5 star.  </li>
            <li> I did have to trim my hair first then shave</li>
            <li> However, since this is a wet-dry razor, I just run it under some hot water whenever it needs it.</li>
            <li> REALLY !  </li>
            <li> if used daily, the shaver would do a better job.</li>
            <li> The first was for my elderly father who was in a convalescent home at the time after a heart surgery.</li>
            <li> But the results are better with the Pana even if I shave for the same length of time with each.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I will never go back to a rotary.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after the first run and cleaned it manually after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Remington, and is my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> But still cheaper than similar products in this corrupted country. :-)</li>
            <li> but this is my first panasonic.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that the first shave or two that I took with this razor were so close</li>
            <li> I am able to shave in different directions to get ALL the whiskers.</li>
            <li> First thing I did when I received this unit</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased the ES8077s in March of 2006.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with razors with three pivoting heads, and I&#x27;ll have to get one of those next time.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem as though it would work, so I went into my first shave hesitant.</li>
            <li> And if you follow the directions correctly and allow your hair and skin to get used to the changover from regular razor to electric shaver you will love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The unit feels like a really quality unit!  </li>
            <li> I yearn for someone to really figure out a shaver that can handle all areas of the face!</li>
            <li> funny thing is I went over the Panasonic side with a 10 yr.</li>
            <li> The only downfall if shaving with any method except with a cream/lube, you will not experience that refreshing feeling you get with shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> I first tried a Remington MS5200.</li>
            <li> This model of Panasonic is one of the better ones, and should be on the short list of anyone who is looking for a foil shaver.13,000 RPM speed (</li>
            <li> This model of Panasonic is one of the better ones, and should be on the short list of anyone who is looking for a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I had mostly been using blades (Sensor Excel or Gillette Disposable) for the prior 5 or six years.  </li>
            <li> first, if i skipped shaving for a day, i had to use a blade because the SoftTouch just couldn&#x27;t do it efficiently.  </li>
            <li> in all, if you are going to spend over $100 on an electric shaver, check out the Panasonic line first.  </li>
            <li> Overall shaving is better</li>
            <li> LiIon are much lighter too!    </li>
            <li> I really think its closer than a razor just using soap in the shower!    </li>
            <li> I got my first Panasonic in 1995 and it still works well.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is the first electric I have used that is satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Finally, my skin has not looked as healthy.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works pretty well for me</li>
            <li> I would give a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t break on me after exactly 13 months of use.  </li>
            <li> but this gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> For me, being able to shave daily makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> Deciding which electric shaver to purchase can be an overwhelming task when comparing the different features of each brand.</li>
            <li> The best part is you dont even need to use the Vortex system, because the cleaning cartridges can get expensive.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, easy to clean by rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low stress and would be great on even a long</li>
            <li> This shaver has been extensively reviewed already and I don&#x27;t have much more to add, except to say that I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li> The closer I&#x27;d shave, the more I&#x27;d pay the price in break-outs the next day.  </li>
            <li> it had a nice trimmer on it and for those who care, the cleaning base was actually kind of nice</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 month now, and its a great relief for my face, no irritation and very close shaving, the only con is the neck area, but that happens with every other shaver, the cleaner base is very nice and solid, its great to just leave the shaver there to clean, well if you have problem with irritation you have to try this, but if your hair is too thick maybe the 3 head rotors shavers works best for you..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll take it as a trade off for the absence of irritation and the better shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> shave feels as close as with a fresh razor, particularly if I use it while my skin is warm and wet from the shower.  </li>
            <li> This is a very handy feature and is common with all shavers at this price point.    </li>
            <li> The shaver is great, running at a high speed (they say 13,000 reciprocations per second) so that every stroke actually cuts beard.</li>
            <li> But this razor uses the same blades as my old one, and I\\&quot;ve changed blades on my old one before and this sure seems better without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Like all other Panasonic products I own, this razor is of the utmost  quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for nearly a year now, originally because after a three-month layoff from shaving while studying for the bar exam, I found that I was getting cut up every day before work.  </li>
            <li> I do think the foil has better technology to grab flat hairs etc.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a DE (dual edge) razor and a silver tip brush with shave soap or cream lathered in a Moss scuttle for several years now, starting with hot soak, followed by shave oil, soap/cream, with/across/against the grain, then alum block finished with good aftershave.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Norelco shaver, it was easy to keep clean and still looks pretty new after 2 years of solid use.  </li>
            <li> The overall performance of this razor is very good if you plan on shaving everyday.  </li>
            <li> have to say, that having used the Panasonic 8077S Vortex for several weeks now, that this is by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li> Like a perfectly smooth, rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> up was a Norelco 7110X. Also a nice shaver, but even more irritating than the Remington in some spots.</li>
            <li> So far I have rinsed off the shaver under running water and it has stayed clean.</li>
            <li> that great at shaving stray long hairs; long term durability is not known yet.</li>
            <li> nano-speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: Panasonic shavers frequently go on sale at discounters like Target and WalMart, and Panasonic offers rebates from time-to-time</li>
            <li> I do not use the recharging stand since it is too large; instead I clean it by holding it under the hot water faucet and plug it directly to the power cord for recharging.</li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic razor I have owned; I have been through several other brands and this is the smoothest and closest shave I have ever experienced with an electric.</li>
            <li> ... &lt;br /&gt;While the cleaning system is pretty much a gimmick - not totally necessary but nice to have - both the razor and the cleaning system are quite loud.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I almost sent it right back because it did NOT have the inductive charging system (online sources listed it as a model that did), and the shaver felt light and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very pleased with the razor and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade, charge hangs in tough, easy to clean, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> read a bunch of positive reviews about the Panasonic E8077S</li>
            <li> lot&#x27;s of positive reviews, but I don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and this is just a dry razor shave, what I&#x27;ve always done.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the razor when I first got it</li>
            <li> If I go for more than two days without shaving, using the long hair cutter to \\&quot;knock down\\</li>
            <li> The first time I sent my ES8092 razor in for repair/replacement, Panasonic sent me a much less-expensive reconditioned ES8066 as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use it everywhere EXCEPT my face.  </li>
            <li> The ES8077S gets a shave just as good if not better than my Schick Quattro Blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that a new shaver has new blades and so comparing with the old one will always seem better.  </li>
            <li> This&#x27;s a very interesting product, it isn&#x27;t heavy, but some kind of large, the shave is very close to other tradicional shaves (the blades).</li>
            <li> these are nice, but not very important to me.  </li>
            <li> I tried the shaver in the shower and under full shower stream it operated just fine in the soaking wet environment (though the shave quality was unacceptable).</li>
            <li> The first time was in warranty, and was repaired, and then a year later (with new batteries from Amazon) it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than two shaves, this time it was out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system for my new vortex yet, sorry, can&#x27;t report on how well it cleans, but hey, must be better and more convenient than me cleaning it manually (which was a pain for my first panasonic in that my stubble gunk would get caked onto the blades and wouldn&#x27;t easily rinse off).</li>
            <li> I decided to do a little homework, just to see what else is available, and this Panasonic had overall exceptional reviews.</li>
            <li> Also..there are no flimsy parts that feel like they may fly off if you shake it hard, like some of the rotary razors out there!    </li>
            <li> Only downside is I had a fair amount of razor burn when I first started using it for wet shaves -- but now (after about 2 months) I am using it in the shower pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li> For me, it works much better dry.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry based on the fact that  I can continue to use my Jack Black Beard Lube if I liked.</li>
            <li> The full process takes 3 hours to clean and dry.     </li>
            <li> only charge when I clean (every 3-4 shaves) and never run low or even off of the top charge tier, so</li>
            <li> It does go away if I give it a dry cycle at this point, but then the cleaning level reduces noticeably and I&#x27;m compelled to add more water.  </li>
            <li> The oscillator would not maintain a constant strong speed even though it is fully charged; therefore, it would tend to \\&quot;shred\\&quot; your skin as your stubs get stuck between the foil and razor of the shaver...</li>
            <li> I think it does a strong overall job</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended, and is 100% better than my old rotary-style Norelco reflex action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone two weeks on a single charge, and I&#x27;m sure I could have gone longer.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic certainly cannot meet this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it wet or dry and it works great either way.  </li>
            <li> but anyway the razor works great wet or dry</li>
            <li> Overall, it is by far a better shaver, and worth the extra time to properly clean it.  </li>
            <li> For most people, the lengthy cleaning time shouldn&#x27;t be much of a concern since if the battery is low, just plug it in after your shave, and it&#x27;ll be clean and ready for your next shave.    </li>
            <li> The after shave feeling, the linear technology, light weight and the battery span are my favorite technological improvement over my previous 6 years old Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In summary, the unit gives a decent close shave, but the cleaning system is junk!</li>
            <li> Also the loud sound only lasts about 10-15 minutes of the 3 hour cleaning cycle, then it becomes a very soft purr sound.</li>
            <li> I clean my razor about every three days, but the cartridges last longer if you wash out the inside of the razor first.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the HydraClean Hygienic Cleaning System a couple of times, but it took up too much space on the counter around my sink and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything necessary, so I stopped using it after about a month and just rinsed the shaver off under the tap after every use, which seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> For most of my life I have had to use a blade to shave, because my tough, gnarly, Croatian beard was too much for most electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> this is one amazing razor, it actually shaves closer than a standard blade shaver.</li>
            <li> If I let the shaver lightly glide over my skin it would leave so much beard that I had to go over the same spot 10 times from all angles</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just want to clear a spot near an outlet and leave it there, since the unit ends up filled with water.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Shavers have held up very well over their lifetime use.</li>
            <li> much* closer and</li>
            <li> *much* faster.</li>
            <li> but it will be alot cheaper than using the straight razors.</li>
            <li> Much quieter.  </li>
            <li> After using a Norelco for more than 5 years I decided to try a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> How much electricity is that taking?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about as smooth as a regular blade, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate the softer skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does the job very well, so</li>
            <li> Straight out of the box</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Vortex shaver is really the cat&#x27;s meow.</li>
            <li> the shaver and vortex cleaner worked very well.  </li>
            <li> He highly recommends this razor!</li>
            <li> but I bought into the hype and gimmick of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> I am not using the stand as it takes too much space, but once charged with portable charger it runs for about 3 weeks before it needs be recharged.</li>
            <li> Too much of that and</li>
            <li> , I take my time, allow the razor to cut the hairs without the intense pressure from me onto my skin.</li>
            <li> Cuts very close.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the extra shaving heads to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really stretch the life too much b/c alcohol based, will evaporate over time whether you use it or not, once it&#x27;s been opened.</li>
            <li> However, a manual razor still gives a much closer shave</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is the Panasonic 8077 is a real sucko.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth with such a close shave; also no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; at all!</li>
            <li> However, if you have the patience and sensitive skin like me then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> For someone used to a blade, this one really compares.</li>
            <li> Both of these razors which I was relatively happy with, both irritated my neck almost every day and it would be worse on humid days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in those three weeks, and even though you&#x27;re supposed to use it for a month to see results, Amazon&#x27;s return policy leaves me no choice but to guess that another week won&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li> This is much easier than shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close</li>
            <li> I really wanted the convenience).  </li>
            <li> much for being \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot;  &lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have razor burn anymore and its so much quicker.</li>
            <li> but it is very close</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get a really close shave.    </li>
            <li> makes life so much easier than when i was using a mach 3.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> to the face, as is recommended in the owners manual, and not using to much pressure against the face.</li>
            <li> But now he really likes it alot.</li>
            <li> How much time are you going to be in there for it to be an irritation?</li>
            <li> I always knew the Norelco was not as close as a blade, but it was so much faster, I never gave up the electric.</li>
            <li> The angled blades of this shaver really do seem to work.</li>
            <li> It gives extra smooth result.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> But a good choice if you skip a few days between shaves -- rotary shavers as a whole do a much better job over heavy growth than a foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were just as expected, authentic Panasonic, and they did improve the shave somewhat.  </li>
            <li> this method has never given me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> it is also safe to drag it across your skin without worrying about nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I use soap for lubrication and gentle pressure.    </li>
            <li> Using it doesn&#x27;t really take much getting used to (as suggested by some reviews and even the package insert)</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviews i chose this and am greatful to have read the reviews.</li>
            <li> The real beauty in this machine is the cleaning mechanism.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even really using the cleaning part of it ....</li>
            <li> The plastic on it fells really frail.</li>
            <li> - The triple blade really works.  </li>
            <li> - The foil seems to have more drag than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell, but regardless of which razer I use, I&#x27;ve got to touch up with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has NO RAZOR BURN, and no tugging like some of the rotary shavers do, and is much happier.</li>
            <li> Reader&#x27;s Digest version: great electric shaver, with as near to a good blade shave as I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a 31 yr old white man with moderate beard hair that grows in a mildly complex pattern.  </li>
            <li> and I am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using double and triple edge blades my entire adult life for 20+ years and would normally get a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with cream and warm water gets the closest shave, but it&#x27;s about as must work as shaving with a blade--and just as messy.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing my old EX8092 shavers with soap and water actually seemed to do a better job.</li>
            <li> It was at least as good as the Norelco/Philips shaver that I had before in terms of shave closeness.  </li>
            <li> Neck whiskers take multiple passes, far more than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Have had several Braun dry electric razors that I liked very much.</li>
            <li> Fast, smooth, and painless (with the exception of rare nicks caused by ingrown hairs and other skin imperfections).</li>
            <li> half what my Braun cost - I can finally say goodbye to Braun and be happy with something that works better for less money.</li>
            <li> I found that my old ES8023 shaves as well as this one with the original three year old foil and blades.</li>
            <li> When using foam in shaving, the skin becomes more sensative and tender, which requires the blade to be sharp as a real razor.</li>
            <li> The cleaning part \\&quot;went dry\\&quot; quickly and it generally wanted to always go through the cleaning cycle when you put it on the stand.</li>
            <li> The ES8077S produces a slightly better shave due to the improved blade design.</li>
            <li> However, after having using this Panasonic unit which I have never attempted to use to &#x27;wet-shave,&#x27; and probably won&#x27;t, I was convinced that I got a better shave from it than ANY other brand shavers.</li>
            <li> As the instructions say, it did take me ~ 30 days to get get my face used to it, but never at any time did it hurt to use (many other shavers I have tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had significant difficulty with post-shave irritation and occasional ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Pros: *wet/dry capability (wet is strongly recommended, and is the main reason to consider a Panasonic in the first place).</li>
            <li> dry panasonic shave for me is already closer and faster than dry braun, nice to know if need be for special occasion, important interview or date, can try using the panasonic wet for supposedly aneven closer shave.     </li>
            <li> The cleaning feature uses cartridges and is really unnecessary, since it is so easy to clean the shaver using warm water and soap, but the station will blow-dry and heat your shaver dry, as well as charge it.</li>
            <li> I have had several Panasonic wet / dry shavers before and this one is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> and I find that if you keep the unit clean it provides the same level of close shave day after day.  </li>
            <li> I haved shaved with a Norelco for over 15yrs., and finally swithed to the Panasonic \\&quot;vortex\\&quot;, hydra clean 8077s.  </li>
            <li> I have changed filters regularly and kept the unit clean; the cleaning system just doesn&#x27;t hold up well.    </li>
            <li> I clean once every 3 days, 1 cartridge supposed to last ~ 1.5 months, but i can see stretching it even longer duration.</li>
            <li> Close and clean shave and would suggest buying some extra cartridges</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the hydraclean system to to keep it clean on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> That may be partly related to keeping the blades clean, though.  </li>
            <li> i ended up having to use a regular razor just to clean up the spots along my neck that it wouldn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> But the main reason I bought the 8077 was the cleaning station which I knew should keep it pristine and was very similiar to the \\&quot;Braun</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun first and was somewhat disappointed -- more friction and more effort to get a good result than I expected from a top-price razor.</li>
            <li> The ES8077S has NiMH batteries that easily give me 10 days of use on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Panasonic and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really had appreciated the reviews when I was looking to purchase a new razor, and now that I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic for a month, I thought I&#x27;d stop in and return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this total system is anything special.</li>
            <li> Oh yah, and the $100 turned to only $70 with Amazon&#x27;s special discount ......</li>
            <li> things considered, this could have been a wonderful razor if it hadn&#x27;t broken over a very minor jolt.</li>
            <li> Light-weight, easy to handle, and much quieter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not too loud, but the pitch is higher because the head really has a high RPM.</li>
            <li> to make a long story short, combined with some decent shaving gel and a couple of days practice, the Vortex not only shaves infinitely better than the old Braun, but as close as I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with a blade with NO irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The reason I went back to Braun and bought the Activator after my first Panasonic was that it was just so much more convenient to clean for my lazy self.</li>
            <li> To clean it, I simply open the head and rinse with water and occasionally run it briefly with liquid hand soap rubbed on the screen and the head stays clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Used to use a norelco and this is a lot better hands down.</li>
            <li> I envied the quick easy electric shave but never had any luck in the past.  </li>
            <li> One thing apparently not stated is you fill a water tank with water and clean it every time you change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> and it cleaned the razor like new!   </li>
            <li> I do not buy new shavers very often so</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic previously which I loved and used until even new blades and foils weren&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Shavers are supposed to shave, of course; but they get better ratings in my opinion the closer and smoother the shave, and the less they irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for about a month and a half, and am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> and also important, i don&#x27;t feel dry and chaffed afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Review for Panasonic ES8077S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my brother owns an older model and loves it, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I also have an older Braun that I use for travel.</li>
            <li> Vortex cleaning system  is nothing more than an added expense, a waste of time and energy, space in the cabinet or under the cabinet, and what does it really do that you can&#x27;t do by passing the razor head under a turned on faucet.</li>
            <li> The main reason for using the vortex electric razor is for convenience of shaving.</li>
            <li> One of the main features that won me over.</li>
            <li> Also when trimming longer hair, the main shaver foil gets stuck with debris - so I have started using the plastic cover for the main foil whenever i use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> this is cleaner, since it doesn&#x27;t need shaving cream, but it takes longer to get shaved than with a blade, because many patches of my beard require multiple passes (you have to get a feel for the various directions of grain on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while better than the Activator, it actually cut the hair on my neck, however it also left some nicks.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an older Panasonic for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Because of these design flaws, after applying foam in a wet shaving, more sensitive skin goes into the holes and is scanned by blunt blades.</li>
            <li> Panasonic one is not ready to be a good wet shaving product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great deal and a lot better than Braun&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; crap that costs over $200</li>
            <li> So if it&#x27;s possible to get this same razor without the cleaning system, that&#x27;d probably be a better buy.</li>
            <li> ITSELF CLEANS SO EASILY WITH A LITTLE SOAP AND HOT WATER.</li>
            <li> The true test is my 7 year old granddaughter who really can&#x27;t get enough of Pop-Pop.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> The indicator was still at high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this  shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> again, i went for the high end model, the SoftTouch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i bought the ES8077S Vortex with high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This razer was highly rated</li>
            <li> I can only think this will get better in the next two to three weeks as my face gets use to the new razor.</li>
            <li> It even has a much quieter sound than the other one ever had.  </li>
            <li> Works fine wet, but I find that to be a pain.  </li>
            <li> It certainly cuts closer than my old razor.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is in the 9 hour range, maybe a little better.  </li>
            <li> This razors features that make it a little better than others</li>
            <li> I do use the cleaner which I feel does condition the blade and screen a little more than just rinsing it out, but you do have that option as well.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sure my skin may just need a little time to adjust.  </li>
            <li> But i must say i had to  change them a little more than every year.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has the most sensitive skin of anyone i have ever met and wouls only use a triple bladed brand new razor everytime he shaved( throwing it away for a new blade each time to make sure it was sharp enough).</li>
            <li> Seriously, it has great features, and is solidly built</li>
            <li> only gripe is that I can not get a clean shave near the adam&#x27;s apple area.</li>
            <li> I suspect that there are some small design differences from dedicated dry shavers, so don&#x27;t expect a wet/dry shaver to be comparable to the best dry-only shavers when used dry.  </li>
            <li> If the shaver worked cleanly the first time, the shave would have been comfortable, but the need for repeated passes made the shaver a bit irritating.</li>
            <li> In contrast, this new pansonic vortex seems to be an improvement over even my older panasonic in that it has a triple blade system.</li>
            <li> I wanted to upgrade from my older Panasonic electric shaver, which still worked, but needed a new screen and cutter blade.</li>
            <li> yes, the clean cycle is long but its cheaper than paying $250 for the new pulsonic.</li>
            <li> Like a rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Vortex unit seemed to clean and dry the shaver thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is also much lighter than my old Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> And, if you don&#x27;t want to travel with that apparatus, you can use liquid hand soap to clean up and air dry it.  </li>
            <li> He also says that with the sensitive skin of his (he had a beard for 10+ years), it shaves very well in wet-mode with the gel.</li>
            <li> , the whole issue some users have with sensitive skin is mentioned in the user&#x27;s guide.  </li>
            <li> but it is still early to really know.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s so effective that even when i don&#x27;t, it still does</li>
            <li> The shaver works well enough but the trimmer pretty much burnt and melted his beard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s round in shape so in the end might take up more suitcase room.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It feels good in my hand...not too big or small.   </li>
            <li> You can also rinse the razor with hot water before cleaning and the solution will last much longer.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time blade shaver - most recently with the Mach3.  </li>
            <li> I figured that to be normal whether I cleaned it</li>
            <li> I have only used the shaver for a few weeks - nothing but good experience so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One caveat with the cleaning process: if the water and the cleaning solution cartridge aren&#x27;t fresh, the razor can be quite smelly when you go to use it the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m not going to be spending on cleaning cartridges every few months, so that&#x27;s even more money saved.</li>
            <li> And long battery life comes in handy with this shaver, because it takes a long time to shave - up to 10 minutes versus 3-4 minutes with my old Braun.    </li>
            <li> I think this shaver gives a fair shave, not great.</li>
            <li> I have now had it for about six weeks and highly recommend it if you are looking for a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I have always had to shave with a mach3 or a fusion due to the thickness of my beard, but this Panasonic does a fine job.</li>
            <li> I was considering replacing it with a new Activator, but after reading a few reviews of the Panasonic decided it might be more to my liking, based almost solely on the fact it could be used in the shower or with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> This razor left my face feeling smooth with no burn, and to this point, not a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> But it still lasts more than a week, and part of the reason for the shorter life may be related to the fact that now I shave a bit longer because this model gets my face almost blade-close with a dry shave.</li>
            <li> i use panasonic only dry and am already satisfied, but the unit is supposed to be watertight and panasonic invites you to try using the shaver with shaving foam for an even closer shave, not even an option with the braun.</li>
            <li> I prefer the dry shaving, but the wet option is nice to have.</li>
            <li> You get a nice shave with this product... wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Right outof the box, I used the shaver for a month before it finally ran out of batteries.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness, I admit I have never used a rotary shaver and was contemplating trying just because of the adams apple thing, but the salesman talked me out of the \\&quot;more expensive rotary\\&quot; because he actually owned the Braun 360 before and like his Panasonic better, and it was an older model than the 8077!    </li>
            <li> and then I got the 8095 and finally the foil died \\&quot;even after religious rinsing afteruse\\&quot; soap scum finally got the best of it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found not as good as my previous rotary electric is that it does not cut the long hairs very well.</li>
            <li> They were replaceable, but by the time you add up the cost of the replacement batteries, a foil assembly, and the cutter, you might as well buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks my beard got used to the new shaver and there has been no redness, bumps or irritation.  </li>
            <li> but I was told that sometimes it just takes a while for skin to adjust to a new razor and that I should keep using it for a couple months.  </li>
            <li> Anyone want to buy some new cleaning filters?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year and it shaves as well now as it did when it was new.    </li>
            <li> I am going to get some new refills and see if that makes a difference, if not then I will contact Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It feels like using a new razor every time I shave.</li>
            <li> and it still looks and works like new.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic Exchange Program sent me the factory reconditioned unit instead of brand new unit &lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic claims that their refurbished item appearance is like that of a new unit, but its apperance is 100% used &lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh well, here I am now shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> But I like the feature of pivoting shaving head and self-cleaning system in the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I live 20 minutes from my office.</li>
            <li> Rather than invest in a new foil and try to debug the problem with the cleaning system, I&#x27;m going to find a new shaver to try.</li>
            <li> Then I took my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver and began to shave.</li>
            <li> and it did indeed make the shaver feel just like new after each shave, but</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> (but it could be because it is brand new).</li>
            <li> and I was faced with needing a new shaver.</li>
            <li> have sinced purchased a new Panasonic wet-dry shaver (model ES-LA63)</li>
            <li> However it does not do the job right the first time, or the second, or the third.</li>
            <li> I do find that I have to go back over and shave some areas twice, which is not unusual with most razors I&#x27;ve tried.      </li>
            <li> A decently close shave and I like the self cleaning action.</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor that I don&#x27;t have to go behind with a blade, The hydraclean system is great.</li>
            <li> But with my beard getting more course, I have been even more unhappy than ever with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well dry, and does an even better job wet.</li>
            <li> i want a razor that gives a nice shave all over (face and neck), doesn&#x27;t hurt during the process, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red and dried out when im done.  </li>
            <li> The holder/washer device is a little large and unwieldy for my sink and the device has some problems with the curve of my chin, but overall, am satisfied.</li>
            <li> But this one hacks it all down in fine style.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The panasonic foil system and high speed motors are loud.</li>
            <li> Not too loud but high pitched.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner system, in my honest opinion, is a waste of money except if you are lazy and not want to clean the shaver manually which is a piece of cake to use.</li>
            <li> Higher pitched whine than the Braun, but only a fraction of the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets the job done way better than my past Remington which was a comparable price.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first to actually shave my beard without razor burn.</li>
            <li> It did at first sort of non impress me and got too close on the chin several times.</li>
            <li> However, it caused quite a bit of razor burn on my head the first time I used it and there has not been a second time.  </li>
            <li> At first he resisted using this \\&quot;electronic contraption\\&quot;, but Mom finally talked him into trying it for just one week.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is pretty quiet, so I like it.</li>
            <li> There has to be better out there, not sure what though.</li>
            <li> I have also had 2 Braun self-cleaning shavers in the past, including the latest Activator 8595.</li>
            <li> You get better life out of the battery if you drain it to \\&quot;low\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t usually use the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; option.  </li>
            <li> The first left button push removes the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; LED option, and the process begins in about 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve also owned Braun and Norelco, and have found that foil shavers do a better job.  </li>
            <li> That cost me $ 50 more than necessary due to volume..</li>
            <li> The trimmer is mediocre but you get an amazing shave and you never need to trim really because youll love shaving so much youll want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I only wished I had read the reviews and gone with the Panasonic first.  </li>
            <li> I have used them all, starting out with a Sunbeam then a Ronson, Norelco, Remington, Braun and many other brand names</li>
            <li> Anyway, the Panasonic 8077S surprised the heck out of me!    </li>
            <li> My first initial thought was</li>
            <li> x Did not cut all my facial hair on first or, sometimes</li>
            <li> I ended up going back to my hand-held razor and may get another Philips/Norelco, as I&#x27;ve personally had better experiences with those.</li>
            <li> Blades are still going strong and close, though do notice a little bit of having to go over some stubborn areas.</li>
            <li> It is also much easier to clean by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil head and rinsing it under the faucet at</li>
            <li> only problem with the Panasonic is the huge number of models they offer, many of which are identical other than for some minor differences such as color.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works very well but is somewhat loud and takes several hours to clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> Because of my American Indian &amp; German heritage my beard periodically changes and puts a different load on a regular basis on any razor but the Panasonic seems to handle it nicely.</li>
            <li> With a long flat linear surface, thats easy to do until your used to it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try an electric shaver after many years of only using a blade due to razor burn problems with a couple old electrics I had year before.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an old Norelco triple-header for years and decided to try a new one that would shave closer.   </li>
            <li> finish is cheap compared to my previous shaver [Norelco rotary].</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for the past three months, and thus far I have been fairly pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> It did not bog down, and was able to handle wildly different growth directions.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t give a very good shave when dry.  </li>
            <li> My shave is just as smooth as using a twin blade razor but without the mess.</li>
            <li> Will follow thru at a later date, but don&#x27;t let my minor complaint with the cleaning station deter you, this is a great razor/shaving system.</li>
            <li> First, let it be known that I am VERY critical of \\&quot;things\\&quot; and more prone to negative reviews.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is equally weak and i had to work at it to get a nice even line on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I get the best shave using a thin layor of regular shave cream, but still have the option (when I&#x27;m in a hurry or camping, on the road, etc) of using a preshave lotion to cut down on any mess or if I don&#x27;t have any water available.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my third Panasonic shaver, and each one shaves better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> And since the two previous models did seem to work better after cleaning, I am assuming that cleaning is the key.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with both the wet shaves and the dry ones.</li>
            <li> I tried it wet and dry, with and without shaving cream, but it invariably took so many passes that I could have shaved just as quicky the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> In about two weeks, they sent back a *complete* unit to me, including a new charger/base unit, which I never even expected, all for free.  </li>
            <li> This puppy blasts cleanly through the thickest stubble without even slowing down.</li>
            <li> My beard does not grow as quickly as others, I use the razor every other day.</li>
            <li> You would be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> I was a blade shaver for the past 25 years and the older I get, the more it seems that blade shaving caused irritation, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Obviously, you can always clean it yourself, but throwing down the extra $15 every three months is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver had a slider switch, and that was a problem.</li>
            <li> I would give it 4 stars if the cleaning cycle could be complete faster.  </li>
            <li> Very slim body for those with smaller hands.  </li>
            <li> my old razor</li>
            <li> My old Norelco rotary shaves about as close</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t throw out the old Norelco.</li>
            <li> , I prefer my old Norelco 8892XL, it was a bit quiter and Closer shave than Panasonic.</li>
            <li> FAR safer than blades.</li>
            <li> This impacts the quality of the shave directly.  </li>
            <li> My old $30</li>
            <li> The Panasonic will not run during the charge mode, i.e. you must wait for the shaver to recharge before you can complete your shave.  </li>
            <li> My old razor was a lotion-dispensing Norelco, which is eaily outclassed by the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I know that Panasonic makes a similar razor with a convex head; this may be a solution to the neck issue.    </li>
            <li> Wow what a difference from my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The Pros on this razor far outway the Cons.</li>
            <li> My aging father could no longer shave with a traditional blade and was very fustrated.  </li>
            <li> The shaver shaves really well on the cheeks but neds multiple run throughs on the chin areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does shave closer than my old one, but not in one stroke like some users have said.  </li>
            <li> I would hope it&#x27;s closer since my old one had been used for years and should have been duller.</li>
            <li> and it never came as close as my old Remington.  </li>
            <li> loud - noisy  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my three year old Panasonic ES8023.</li>
            <li> He hates to shave but has to shave for work nearly every day.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used an electic since my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> accidental 2 foot drop and the razor became incredibly loud from there on out.  </li>
            <li> So loud it hurt my ears to shave.  </li>
            <li> You can plug the shaver in directly to the outlet with the cord.</li>
            <li> I would note that the cleaning cycle really does take 3 hours...and the unit runs the entire time.  </li>
            <li> old Norelco rotary (seldom used) and</li>
            <li> The trimmer is on the back of the shaver and although it could be a bit wider it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I GOT SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t follow facial contours like the one or two blade Panasonics, which means that it doesn&#x27;t really shave as close.  </li>
            <li> so I should not need to use much of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> the Norelco frequently irritated my skin, even after the \\&quot;electric shaver break-in period\\&quot; for my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot louder than my old Norelco 955RX.  </li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin that is prone to bumps and ingrown hairs if i shave too close.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> So far it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 1/2 of the time of my old shaver.</li>
            <li> The Braun did well for while, but after a short time, became VERY noisy.</li>
            <li> I really did not believe it was possible for an electric to shave me this close.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does get nearly as close (but not as close) as a razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas - so far he loves it</li>
            <li> the visible areas (and vital kissing areas  </li>
            <li> About a year ago my old Panasonic bit the dust</li>
            <li> With the Braun, the cleaning station really did help because you could only use the brush on the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning phase is a bit loud and at three hours, pretty long.  </li>
            <li> but it is also twice as expensive (had I know this would be so good for me</li>
            <li> I honestly have not experienced that with this shaver as of yet.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic takes about half the time for a complete shave, wet or dry, as it does not require innumerable passes to get a smooth result; two is fine -- three if you&#x27;re meticulous.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very little irritation.</li>
            <li> Also, the pivot mechanism, which can be locked, combined with that middle slotted blade, helps get every last whisker, even those quarter-inch long \\&quot;rogue&#x27;s\\&quot; that sometimes magically appear on a man&#x27;s upper cheek, or neck.</li>
            <li> In short, the parts (accessories) aren&#x27;t cheap, but they last twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The charge indicator  (low, med, high) has been quite accurate for me, as opposed to several other reviewer&#x27;s comments.  </li>
            <li> Also, the small pop-up trimmer is precise enough to permit trimming around your ears and other areas in between haircuts (yes, I&#x27;m also cheap).</li>
            <li> This type of battery is more expensive, but will give full performance much longer than other battery types.     </li>
            <li> It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair.  </li>
            <li> The holes on the screen are also too big for wet shaving, though they are OK for dry work.</li>
            <li> I even use it to keep my shaved head slick, which allows hte current summer heat to disspate just a bit better.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin gets knicks and cuts from the regular razor.</li>
            <li> and you have a very expensive investment for a minimal shave at best.</li>
            <li> The two main blades appear to move in opposite directions, resulting in virtually no vibration.</li>
            <li> I was getting a decent shave with it until about the sixth month, when the cleaning system broke and repeatedly leaked its cleaning fluid into the receptacle that the shaver sits in.  </li>
            <li> However, after several weeks it was apparent to me that this one gives a much smoother feeling shave.</li>
            <li> the Braun, in particular, really left my face burning when i applied aftershave.   </li>
            <li> had a Norelco rotary that was probably 10 years old and rarely used it because it pulled and did an average job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather high initial cost</li>
            <li> then i remembered that i had owned a Panasonic shaver back in high school.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, still highly recommended, after 3 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> This is quick without the mess.</li>
            <li> I am returning to my old braun - simply going to buy a new foil &amp; razor kit replacement for $18.    </li>
            <li> I am using it dry although wet shaving with soap was also fantastic.</li>
            <li> The only part of the equation that is not as easy as a razor is the crevace of the neck and the adams apple, that takes a few days or weeks to master.    </li>
            <li> I should also explain I do NOT like rotary style shavers (mainly for comfort) and regular blades ALWAYS cause massive razor burn, even those new 4-blade monsters.</li>
            <li> From the first shave there was absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> And then the unit starting running normally again.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver some 20+ years ago for roughly $10.  </li>
            <li> I just use normal soap to lather my face and my fingers of my left hand to guide what I do.    </li>
            <li> For the first 5 min, it can be quite loud, but don&#x27;t worry that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t feel i was moving it over my skin too quickly, but even after just one days growth, i felt the little blades tugging on some of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> quieter motor, higher frequency hum than braun, which has a loud and harsh noise that had not improved at all with the new Activator.</li>
            <li> Insofar as the cleaning cycle is concerned--yes, it&#x27;s loud, but only for the first 15 minutes or so of the cycle (after that, the remainder of the 3 hour cleaning cycle is relatively quiet or even silent).  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It took my beard several weeks to adjust to using a cordless shaver and the Panasonic documentation indicates it can take up to 30 days to adjust to this new razor and they were correct.  </li>
            <li> Recently I decided to get a new razor and did a lot or research.</li>
            <li> Having had a panasonic for several years, I wanted to update it to a new model.  </li>
            <li> It cuts really close in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving with an electric never worked well for me - crappy shave and too much irritation.  </li>
            <li> Bit more expensive, but the Braun cleaning station is much faster than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Bit more expensive, but the Braun cleaning station is much faster than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I had been using an old Braun shaver for quite a few years which worked only OK as long as I changed out the blades once in awhile, so I bought this Panasonic Vortex due to my dad&#x27;s positive experience with his.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and can be used for about a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> in fact, i can apply aftershave, right after using the shaver and only experience a very minimum sting, less eventhan a regular blade.  </li>
            <li> I specially like that It can be used dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning system is a major plus.</li>
            <li> The major distinction of the Panasonic is its waterproof case.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off.</li>
            <li> cleaning base also comes very handy although I don&#x27;t find myself using cleaning feature very often.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure it will remove the soap scum issue in the future and maintain superior cutting performance</li>
            <li> Sure the neck is tough.  </li>
            <li> Next day, they go right in with all the other whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor requires only a very light pressure against my skin; this is quite different from my past razors and took me a couple of days to adapt to, but the result is no skin irritation at all!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 wks now, so here are my general thoughts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The price of replacement standard double or triple blade cartridges has really seemed to go up in price the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> Battery life is a tad shorter than with my old Panasonic, but then this one has that 13,000 RPM Linear motor, and extra LEDs to power.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is it is fairly loud when you shave and when it self cleans.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> The old panasonic and brauns have two blades on either side of a central comb that i suppose guides and preps the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 12 of them for $15 with the razor, and I have only used two so far.  </li>
            <li> I never got a complete shave especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I have no regrets in the purchase.</li>
            <li> - Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers shave very closely, and you can use it wet.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 25 yr old white guy with medium beard thickness.  </li>
            <li> I usually consider Panasonic  upgrades \\&quot;gimmicks\\&quot; since many times they appear to be the same razor with the same features with a different model number.    </li>
            <li> But its wet shaving is very problematic.</li>
            <li> The Vortex shaves closer with less irritation, but it does take a little more time to shave when using a shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> Since this happened during hot and sticky whether I figured a wet/dry shaver would work better and be less irritating.</li>
            <li> and i liked how it told you when it was dirty and when it needed new blades</li>
            <li> i just got should last me 6 months, just buck and half per month, well worth the convenience and quality of cleansing.</li>
            <li> Perfect... last years I used other razor and was bad experience.</li>
            <li> A whole 3-pack of panasonic is smaller in size than a single braun cartridge.</li>
            <li> linear motor in this shaver will maintain its 13,000 RPM speed through heavy beard growth right up to the moment the batteries die.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the ES8077S shaver as a replacement since it took Panasonic over 2 months to repair my last ES8092 shaver which promptly starting exhibiting the exact same lost-charge behavior within two months of finally receiving the replacement.</li>
            <li> The shave is fine---not as close as with a blade, but then also no more nicks or cuts!Cleaning&#x27;s been a cinch...just a bit of liquid soap on the shaving head and then a quick rinse off.</li>
            <li> I think the cleaning base is mostly a gimmick - cleans fine in the shower or sink with soap.    </li>
            <li> Always seem to use Norelco&#x27;s but over time I have come to the realization that Norelco&#x27;s are really hard to clean and thus don&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> i did not buy the one with the cleaning unit, but it wasn&#x27;t hard to clean at all.  </li>
            <li> The middle blade cuts the longer hairs and the regular foil blades subsequently shave them normally.  </li>
            <li> Went back to regular old shaving.</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job of cutting, however, the head is smaller than the Braun with which I replaced with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave.  </li>
            <li> This one is different, it handles my thin beard hair better and the dry/wet capability helps my skin, too.</li>
            <li> The panasonic delivers a nice shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face even close to as bad as the other electric shavers I have tried, specially if I shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> (yeah I live in an area of limited consumer choices).  </li>
            <li> However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  </li>
            <li> His first 2-3 days left the skin slightly irritated on his face &amp; neck, but towards the end of the week he started liking it.</li>
            <li> As an electrical engineer, I can tell that this razor does not use the usual battery driven motor, but incorporates a high frequency electronic drive system that gives full performance even as the battery starts to run down.    </li>
            <li> I generally shave with a razor in the shower, but there are plenty of days where I don&#x27;t shower until later in the day.  </li>
            <li> i was not able to shace this often with a razor, since the facial hair would not be long enought to cut smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought the Panasonic ES 8077 Vortex after much research and comparing it to other brands like the Braun 360.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning station for the Braun, your only other choice is to use the cleaning brush they include with the shaver, which is a real pain.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning station for the Braun, your only other choice is to use the cleaning brush they include with the shaver, which is a real pain.</li>
            <li> The first couple of shaves did irritate my neck area, but after a few days that was not an issue anymore.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small, but I don&#x27;t need a powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> The first few times he used the shaver, he had razor burn</li>
            <li> I get a close shave every time for the first few months, however, I do notice after about 6 months of use the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close anymore.  </li>
            <li> in all, this a quality addition to my shaving toolbox, and comes closer than any other electric razor to the closeness of a good traditional shave in far less time, and with no more irritation than that from a careful blade shave.</li>
            <li> have a heavy, stiff Scottish beard, and most electrics leave a lot of stubble, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but at least in the short run it is performing nicely.</li>
            <li> My only real fault with the system is when you clean the razor on the self-cleaning base it is pretty loud.</li>
            <li> I dry shave my leathery old face</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a much closer shave than my previous.  </li>
            <li> No toilet paper to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li> It also does its thing pretty quickly, usually only requiring a few passes to take off my bristle.</li>
            <li> i could hear that it was slowing down and at least be able to finish shaving with it</li>
            <li> If you press TOO hard with an electric razor, you will cut the hairs too far \\&quot;underneath\\&quot; the skin line and when the hair attempts to regrow, if it doesn&#x27;t find the exact same hole it had before, it jams and becomes in ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> He has not used his old shaving mug &amp; single edge razor since his surgery.</li>
            <li> have tried other older style cordless shavers and they did not shave as close as standard blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> Considering the cost of the shaver, it would have been nice if it had lasted at least one more year :(  </li>
            <li> (though, obviously i didn&#x27;t have it long enough to see them in action).   </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is pretty much useless, despite having religiously replaced the cleaning module and tank with fresh water every 40 shaves.</li>
            <li> Took about the same time to shave as my previous shavers, but it feels like I shaved with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard; however, this shaver takes longer to get a smooth shave than my previous three Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> much like that little girl would have</li>
            <li> It likes a little talcum powder when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner-drier-charger works very well.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it works at least as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> You can choose to charge the battery with each use, using a single button on the left, which cycles through the choices, indicated on the three green LEDs on the right.  </li>
            <li> Finally, if I go a few days without shaving, it always leaves a few strays which require me to keep a few disposable razors handy.  </li>
            <li> Have previously shaved with a Mach III Blade, but my face is too sensitive to shave daily - generally shave every third day, and even still ended up with irritation.</li>
            <li> The only (very small) downside is that it takes about three hours to go through the clean and dry cycle.</li>
            <li> However, if one&#x27;s schedule allows 5 minutes addition to the shower for a quick wet shave (using a quality cream such as e-Shave), the results to the hand and post-shave facial skin narrowly lag behind full blade-and-badger wet shave, with a major difference only being apparent in the amount of time before stubble becomes apparent to the touch and the eye: a close traditional shave typically results in palpable stubble by 24 hours, followed by visual stubble at 36-48 hours, whereas a shave with this razor lasts but 8-12 hours by touch, followed at 20-24 hours by the appearance of a beard</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for almost two years (daily use), at which point it developed a water leak, no doubt due to the added complexity of the pivoting head, and the motor shorted out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think about getting something different (due to #6 and #7), but so far I haven&#x27;t seen anything that will make me spend the money to replace the Panasonic.    </li>
            <li> After using several other brands, the Panasonic Vortex Hdyraclean System has delivered, by far, the closest and cleanest shave I have received from any electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating to spend twenty minutes shaving and still not be able to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Starts to pull out the hair if the battery drops below half unless you have a brand new inner blade.</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, if the shaver battery dies during a shave, you must plug it and find other things to do for 15-20 minutes in order to complete your shave.  </li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m concerned the cleaning station may go out far before the razor, just due to runtime.</li>
            <li> The cost of the cleanning cartridges seem a little high.</li>
            <li> (and for me thats only evident late in the evening) and that I will have to use a Mach3 on some parts of my neck.</li>
            <li> Both my panasonics shaved closer and operated more quietly and was less irritating on my skin than either Braun models.</li>
            <li> With my Mach 3, I soak my beard in hot water for at least five minutes before shaving, and I did no different with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> When are those guys gonna quit trying to save a few bucks and give the customer a decent battery?</li>
            <li> For more than 10 years I was once a week shaver because shaving on a short stubble would leave me all bloody (and I am just too lazy because it takes so long over the sink :) in the neck area.</li>
            <li> All the little hair particles are gone, and the blades actually shine like new.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I went to a local brick and morter and got a new arcitec razor, got home, and tried to shave my head with it.  </li>
            <li> - Cleaning features include cleaning only, charging only, cleaning and dry, and cleaning, drying, and charging.    </li>
            <li> You will need to do a slight touch-up with a razor afterwards in hard-to-reach areas like portions of the neck and a little of the lip area right under your nose, but this is the case with all electric shavers; 2)</li>
            <li> My wife complained for the first week or so, and it scares our cat quite a bit.</li>
            <li> However, this razor falls short when you plan on shaving every couple of days, and need to use the long hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> but it does not last as long as a blade shave.  </li>
            <li> How long can it last doing this every day?    </li>
            <li> I expected free shipping to be rather slow, but to my surprise it arrived in two days!  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s worse is that the cleaning liquid now pools where I stick the shaver after I put it through the full clean/dry mode.  </li>
            <li> In my case, there seems to be no trapped water escaping from the housing when I turn it upside down.</li>
            <li> when my old Norelco started wearing down I did a lot of research.</li>
            <li> I was worried because he has very sensitive skin and after shaving with electric or regular razer he usually gets red rashes which hurt.</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun 3612 with old dull blades.  </li>
            <li> Evidently, the little plasticcatches that held the head onto the part of the razor with the motor wore down.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  Not a major con,</li>
            <li> so seems like this could really last for those long trips!    </li>
            <li> I asked my Dad what he thought of his new shaver after using it a few weeks and he had this to say: \\&quot;Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> It was close, but the razor clearly shaved closer with less visible stubble.   </li>
            <li> But i will be looking at one of the Brauns as i want something that shaves better dry, and something less irritating.</li>
            <li> The old shaver had NiCad batteries, and had dropped to half a shave per charge.  </li>
            <li> In this instance, because it&#x27;s not practical to take the cleaner/charger unit on the road, the instructions tell you to essentially rinse the screen and cutter components under a tap with soap, and then manually dry them.</li>
            <li> But I have used several dry and wet-dry shavers from Panasonic and Norelco over the years.  </li>
            <li> It does a complete cleaning in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a wet/dry shaver; the Braun is dry only.</li>
            <li> I tried all different methods with my Panasonic re; beard lube, dry, Williams Lectric Shave, shaving cream and Afta.</li>
            <li> I bought initially Norelco dry shaver .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement unit for my old Braun 5550, which after a few years of use has finally died.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After quite a bit of homework I settled on the Panasonic because of it&#x27;s ability to be used wet and essentially in the same fashion I had used the blade.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Panasonic I have only used for two weeks now, and with the wet shave feature, I get it done in about 5 minutes, and as close as a double or triple edged razor.  </li>
            <li> Okay, Pana, the little felt travel bag is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t intend to use the cleaning station every single day, but I know it will make an obvious difference.  </li>
            <li> I may break down and buy new foil/blades at some point, but not until it stops shaving as well as it does (close, minimal if any irritation).  </li>
            <li> I tried different techniques with the same unsatisfactory results, with both dry and wet (using shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> I use mine only once a week, simply rinsing the razor under the faucet on the other days.</li>
            <li> It has a little fan and makes funny little noises for quite a while.</li>
            <li> For medical reasons, I had to stop using a blade, and the old Braun shaver I owned just gave me raw</li>
            <li> One downside of the convex head is that if you press too hard, you can get some irritation according to some reviews I read.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing annoying about the clean cycle, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> even though I had planned to take advantage of the wet shaving option, I seem to get a better and less irritating shave by using it dry</li>
            <li> I can measure little difference between the heads and blades of my last three shavers, all of which are the same thickness and differ only in shape.</li>
            <li> noise is no different than my old shaver, just the usual buzzing.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore,it takes twice as long to shave with it then using a razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked like a charm, but after a year of usage I noticed it started to behave strangely.</li>
            <li> Even with minor flaws, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It can be removed from the holder and used any time, as long as there is a charge left-in an emergency, the cord can be used.     </li>
            <li> If you let it go for a couple of days, it wont do that well anymore, but as long as you use it every day</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the drag noted above, but it takes me longer to shave with the Pana than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say as close as a manual shaver but not far off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even take that long for your skin to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I find myself shawing the same part over and over again, even on the wet option.  </li>
            <li> I use wet except when in a rush or when only a touch up shave is needed.</li>
            <li> Long battery time.</li>
            <li> re-shave what I had spent the last 15-20 minutes shaving in the shower!</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a reliable product with no frills and some minor inconveniences.</li>
            <li> No wow factor.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As I enter my 40s, my beard is turning grey and getting tougher.</li>
            <li> I expected a similar experience when switching to the Panasonic, but I&#x27;ve had basically no irritation issues since day one.  </li>
            <li> but the shave was not fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have long since forgotten.</li>
            <li> Naturally, NO electric shaver will do as well as and yield as close a shave as shaving foam and a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I used it as an excuse to upgrade.  </li>
            <li> battery life between charges has been quite long.  </li>
            <li> I believe there&#x27;s a switch to have just charge, but it has been so long ......</li>
            <li> - I can shave as long or as close</li>
            <li>  Held a charge for a long time  </li>
            <li> If you let the hairs get long you&#x27;ll find yourself using the edge trimmer to get the stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning base does a good job cleaning</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider getting the next model down, without the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> I used it with shaving creme for the first few months but have since used it dry, cleaning it and charging it in the station every few days.   </li>
            <li> I do expect it to perhaps loose a little of its efficiency over time, but wow, unbelieveable.</li>
            <li> Trust me on this, and buy a less expensive and more reliable razor don&#x27;t get sucked in by all the gimmicks.</li>
            <li> The Braun shave-head has less drag on the face than the Pana, by far.  </li>
            <li> Next, because this shaver can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> i am using these wet and dry panasonic razors since 10 years because it is the only system that fits my skin.</li>
            <li> i have a hard time getting some of the hairs, but it does a much better job than the Activator and even after going over it a few times, the Vortex doesn&#x27;t nick or leave my skin raw.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high pitched whine is a bit annoying first thing in the morning; elaborate cleaning system probably unnecessary (just rince with tap water).  </li>
            <li> Specifically, it takes twice as long to shave with the 8077 as it did with my last shaver (a remington) and often times no matter how hard or soft I press the razor</li>
            <li> As usual, the area between the neck and jaw line is a tricky place to shave, and I have to pass over the same area several times to receive a moderately close shave.  </li>
            <li> And, sometimes, due to the changing speed of the shaver, I felt that instead of the hairs being \\&quot;cut\\&quot; properly, the effect feels like the shaver is trying to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the stubs out.     </li>
            <li> so I only have to shave evey other day.  </li>
            <li> my first impression of the SoftTouch was of its rather weak motor.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say the same about the other two shavers.  </li>
            <li> This maybe due to the different shaving motion of the two systems.</li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;LL through your other one away, including your razor in a second!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing other than Norelco razers, but decided to try a different approach.  </li>
            <li> - The battery lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also the fan that is used to dry the razor runs for hours and is audible in adjacent rooms.</li>
            <li> My face was getting roughed up a bit, and it still does after months of use if i go dry.</li>
            <li> furthermore, the panasonic is a wet/dry system while braun is strictly dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replace my Remington dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Dry - Approx 2 hrs 50 mins    </li>
            <li> I have tried this thing dry...</li>
            <li> The Panasonic turns out to be much less irritating, just as fast and darned near as close.  </li>
            <li> Can dry shave any time without the burn or redness.</li>
            <li> HAVING NEVER OWNED AN ELECTRIC RAZOR, I WAS SKEPTICAL BUT NEEDED SOMETHING TO SHAVE MY HEAD CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend staying with dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> Again, stay with dry shaving - it&#x27;s easier on the skin.    </li>
            <li> i went over the area quite a few times, which left my neck red and with a couple of nicks.  </li>
            <li> he wasted a lot of money this way and still could only shave every couple of days because even that irritated his skin and had red bumps along with stubble.     </li>
            <li> he even dry shaves with it usually, which takes less time, but it does work very well with shave cream.     </li>
            <li> one has but 2-3 minutes, this razor will allow a visually acceptable dry shave whose palpable closeness is less underwhelming than other dry shaves</li>
            <li> the panasonic cleaning unit itself has a little larger footprint than the braun; though may be easier to pack as it can lie flat and is thinner.</li>
            <li> Years ago I settled on shaving in the shower with just plain soap and a regular, simple twin blade pivoting cartridge razor (Atra).  </li>
            <li> Now if Panasonic would just put a Linear motor in one of their single or double-blade models...</li>
            <li> Although I liked the feel and the fact that I could put aftershave on after, I was disappointed in closeness of the shave.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a week and have not had the first episode of razor burn or a poor shave.</li>
            <li> Like the wet feature and it charges well (long batterly lifetime).  </li>
            <li> It took between 10 and 15 minutes to get a close shave - way too long for a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> and now I will loose 18-19$ in shipping.</li>
            <li> The foil seems to last forever, as I&#x27;ve yet to notice it wearing down.    </li>
            <li> This is probably the only down side.</li>
            <li> For some reason, when the battery gets low, it switches to \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode instead of slowing down or dying.  </li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought the replacement blade set through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Coming from several Brauns, this is a step down.    </li>
            <li> br /&gt;anyway, lately Braun has been flooding the airwaves with ads for the new Braun Activator, so</li>
            <li> However, you have to train your face to the new shaver for at least 1 week</li>
            <li> FYI, the less expensive ES8066 shaver, which I also already had, doesn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as either the ES8092 or ES8066 shavers, but at least I haven&#x27;t experienced the charging problems with it over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I like to shave with a safety razor every week or two, but I like shaving dry after a shower--although Braun suggests that you shave BEFORE you wash!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to shave dry with your shirt on--or even your tie!  </li>
            <li> I espeicially like the pivoting head and the ability to shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I went a week and a half, and only charged it because it was a convenient time to recharge it.</li>
            <li> dry shaving closeness just doesn&#x27;t approach wet shaves, period.</li>
            <li> Actually, the Panasonic was 30 to 50 percent less than the others in it class</li>
            <li> I actually need to distance myself a bit from this product, as I have taken to mentioning it at parties, and that&#x27;s a bit, um, odd.</li>
            <li> both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> In the past, I needed to use two diferent razors: one with enough power to cut the wiskers, and a second razor to finish off for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Shaving dry or wet with the 8077S</li>
            <li> BEING THAT YOU CAN USE IT WET OR DRY.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> Works well wet or dry (but not damp).    </li>
            <li> have used it wet and dry.</li>
            <li> That was another big turn off to my previous electrics.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge about ten days for me and is quieter than my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> THIS WET DRY SHAVER KILLS THAT RAZOR.</li>
            <li> Dry is quicker and neater, wet is smoother and closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d stopped using my previous dry-only rotary electric and switched back to a blade because my skin was getting irritated.  </li>
            <li> Because I was disinterested in having a big black box sitting on the sink all the time (the fancy cleaning system), I bought a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> My previous remington (also the oscillating blade style) did about the same.  </li>
            <li> (This is not true if you use the &#x27;wet shave&#x27; capability of the Pana, but I prefer the dry shave overall.)</li>
            <li> At the same the shaver alternated between normal and high speed vibration which made impossible to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, often took longer than using a hand-held (regular) razor blade  x Messy storage device that&#x27;s not easy to clean  x Expensive cleaning cartridges    </li>
            <li> Being smaller it takes a little longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a little thing, but the hair it leaves is irritated by a collar, especially a buttoned one with a tie.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it takes several passes around the the atoms apple and hard to reach place.</li>
            <li> before that the sensor excel), but due to the sensitivity of my skin, i have been limited to shaving in the downward direction.  </li>
            <li> braun cleaner is bulky, more expensive, will run you at least $10 for a 2-pack</li>
            <li> But the Amazon price was so good that I decided to give it a try, and the power cord plugs into the base with the same jack as on the razor, so you can take just the cord and shaver on a trip and dispense with the huge base, if you like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco and a Braun, and the shave wasn&#x27;t even remotely as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how it does some day in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was curious to try the wet mode</li>
            <li> the rotory razors like the norelco are too rough for my skin(pull/lift and cut).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the point now where i have to wet my face and use Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> need shave foam to wet shave with</li>
            <li> underwater, so your grandma wouldn&#x27;t find out and hit you with her wooden shoe in front of everybody like she probably had just done a few minutes before that</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t careful though, this thing will cut you...</li>
            <li> that, even with a heavy beard, I only have to shave every four or five days!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate having spent $18.76 just to try the product.  </li>
            <li> Spent some time on Amazon&#x27;s site and others reviewing electric razors.  </li>
            <li> A lot of technology but not much on results.</li>
            <li> I tried it wet in the shower as a replacement for my trusty razor and didn&#x27;t like the results at all, so I now use both..and am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you, the product does what it says, but not very well.</li>
            <li> used wet</li>
            <li> It is noisy, but it&#x27;s in the bathroom and the door can be closed.</li>
            <li> A red LED below the green LEDs glows when the cartridge is defunct.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;No regrets.</li>
            <li> I shave wet, with Gillette foam.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with electrics all my life, had a few norelcos and never noticed a big difference between them.    </li>
            <li> cause you can use it wet.   </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the ability to use wet</li>
            <li> next time I activated the shaver, it ran for a few seconds and then quit.</li>
            <li> 2 months later it is dead as a doornail...</li>
            <li> I spent $65.00.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this electric a try because of the ability to shave wet.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Mach3, or perhaps try a newer Norelco with wet shave ability.</li>
            <li> Not really a problem for me as I am not around while the razor is going through the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this shaver is the three-blade design which makes the head too wide.  </li>
            <li> (shaver runs at a constant speed until the battery runs dead, unlike non-Linear models which get gradually slower with each use.</li>
            <li> i also noticed that after a few days, it left my face chaffed.  </li>
            <li> the Vortex is a wet/dry shaver, whereas the Activator and SoftTouch can not be used wet.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a wet shaver and it is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Though the manufacturer claims it&#x27;s wet/dry, the blade and screen is not well designed for wet work.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a blade with lather during my military time, but have shaved with an electric shaver ever since.  </li>
            <li> It started doing this within the last few months.  </li>
            <li> there is nothing more annoying than running out of juice in the middle of a shave.  </li>
            <li> most of them have what i consider \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; features, such as the cleaning base unit, travel plugs, and cases.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it comes with a cleaning base, which works nicely.  </li>
            <li> The reason for changing in the first place was that the Braun battery was starting to fail, holding a charge for less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who can no longer use a regular razor due to being on a blood thinner, he loves it, it&#x27;s a little noisy when in the cleaning mode</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in shaving with this razor then going back over my whole face with an expensive Mach 3.</li>
            <li> There are a few catches-  shaving well with this shaver takes longer, in my experience, than with other electrics, especially if you go wet.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic rarely causes that problem, unless I&#x27;m careless about running it too long and hard over the same patch of beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer gets wet when you wash the main razor which is irritating.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally given up on Panasonic&#x27;s defective high end shaver designs and their lousy service.</li>
            <li> The side-to-side pivoting of the head is not very useful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a regular razor because I tend to make my face feel too raw.    </li>
            <li> And I do like, because I typically shave dry while I&#x27;m deciding what to wear in the morning, so</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have was the neck hair was not completely shaved but its not the shavers fault.</li>
            <li> This may be a common complaint as this is my first experience with an electric shaver</li>
            <li> He had used a single blade razor all his life, but he lost so much weight in the hospital that his neck skin was very thin &amp; loose.</li>
            <li> This way I can let it drain down and only charge it when it needs it instead of everyday.  </li>
            <li> They offer 2 year warranty and are extremely reliable.</li>
            <li> other downside of this shaver is that it is no longer induction charging.</li>
            <li> I will be watching to see if the electrical contacts corrode over time or leak due to exposure to water.</li>
            <li> If you want a cool shaver to use in the shower or for touch-ups, then this is for you - just remember the cost yearly for swapping the cutting heads &amp; cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I used the Panasonic on 1/2 of my face &amp; neck, and a twin blade razor on the other 1/2.</li>
            <li> The cartridges can be expensive if you need to shave every day, but the razor can be well cleaned in hot water, so the Vortex need not be used after every shave.  </li>
            <li> For reasons I can&#x27;t figure out, the trimmer has some sharp points</li>
            <li> first it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic I&#x27;ve owned in the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I was taken by the fabolous reviews by the other customers and purcahsed the product.</li>
            <li> As a comparison, the Remington clipper is configured as a slide and when hair or other residue get caught in the glides, it continually slides forward when shaving.  </li>
            <li> - It looks sharp.  </li>
            <li> My last two razors (for the past 10 years or so) have been rotary style models from Norelco and Remington.</li>
            <li> I shave about once every other day,</li>
            <li> another forum, I read about one other owner who had a horror story of returning the ES8077 to Panasonic, and waiting six weeks for a response.</li>
            <li> the other hand, the Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution does make the shaver smell like Froot Loops if you&#x27;re into aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> Today, I tried shaving one side with the Mach3 and the other with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Close shave (though not as close as other Panasonic models)  </li>
            <li> i did have trouble around my neck, as the Braun just wouldn&#x27;t cut the rather long hairs there.  </li>
            <li> at $129 on amazon, it was cheaper than the other two i had already bought and returned.  </li>
            <li> i think it blows away all the other guys, which is suprising.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer than other Panasonic that I have owned.</li>
            <li> I do not have the heaviest of beards and could almost go ever other day for a shave.  </li>
            <li> Probably due to the foils being worn.  </li>
            <li> The handle and pivot design are extremely inappropriate to an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just the different design or what,</li>
            <li> I purcased it after reading other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the benchmark against which I compare any other shaving methods.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cuts right thru the stiff (I say stiff, should say stiffer, my beard is really not that tough) hairs under my lip.</li>
            <li> The razor is not for those with tough skin and it takes several passes to go over your entire face.</li>
            <li> The great motor and thin foil make this a fast, close shave, but the design makes cutting ALL the neck hairs very difficult for me.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse facial hair</li>
            <li> I have a very thick facial hair with hairs on my neck growing almost parallel to the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know life was possible without red patches behind my jaw from scraping, or that a shaver head could adapt so well to changes in terrain, so to speak.</li>
            <li> The Remington would occasionally irritate the skin on my cheek raising bumps which would only get worse.  </li>
            <li> The cost was over half off what a comparable Braun was, but I still didn&#x27;t buy into this using an electric to wet shave.</li>
            <li> When I got this one for an early Christmas present I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it will vary with the person&#x27;s beard, but I inherited a pretty tough, varied, beard from my dad - PLAINLY, it works on all the different tough, long, whatever you got!</li>
            <li> I was using wet shavers for a long time because dry shavers did not really do a good job</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have an insanely tough beard and ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic shavers lasted 4-5 years, so I expected nothing less than 4 years out of this one.</li>
            <li> Other brands I&#x27;ve tried cut that time in half.    </li>
            <li> It still leaves stray hairs that I have to touch up with a razor periodically, but leaves less that other models I have tried.</li>
            <li> Only sad that Amazon used the biggest box with aired bags and the little machine in the corner of the box.</li>
            <li> I use it slightly wet usually at the sink but not that wet where it is dripping or anything.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> The ES8077S features three cutting blades, a sideburn trimmer and a powerful 13,000 RPM motor.</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer is very inadequate and often pulls hair rather than cutting.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it in my opinion for the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Shaving is average.</li>
            <li> I gave up on Panasonic...is not worth</li>
            <li> This shaver was not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> It simply is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> sorry for writing this much, but i wish i had a review like this when i was shopping for shavers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> , I had completely unsatisfactory experience with this product because of the unacceptably poor quality of shave.</li>
            <li> and I have thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> the shaver and water pours out and I get a wet messy shave when I didn&#x27;t want one.  </li>
            <li> the shaver peeled off a very thin layer from my side cheek skin and caused a large area of irritation.</li>
            <li> - Hydraclean solutions are easier to use and appear to cost significantly less than solutions for Braun and Remington (purchased a 3-pack for under $7 and should last at least three months).    </li>
            <li> As the battery charge went down, the speed of the shaver slowed as well.  </li>
            <li> I turned the unit upside down, and water trickled from it.</li>
            <li> I would break it down like this:    </li>
            <li> The competitors manual stated \\&quot;not\\&quot; to keep topping off the battery, but to let it run down and then recharge.. something you don&#x27;t have to worry about  with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> instead, they would swim up to the little Mexican girl with the pink conciera dress for some weird reason, who totally didn&#x27;t deserve to have ALL of the dolphins&#x27; attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually shave dry in about 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The result would be that I was forced to shave with a soapy wet shaver head slick with the cleaning solution, which is definitely not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Lousy job, even after going over just one side of my head above the ear for over 2 minutes, there was nothing but stubble left over.  </li>
            <li> less face-</li>
            <li> so I tend to use the Mach3 for touchups less and less (almost zero now).</li>
            <li> Then less than 9 months after the purchase I noticed mine was giving me some irratation and not shaving quite so close anymore.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> - The cleaning is much less noisy than the both the Braun and Remington.    </li>
            <li> The transition from my previous to this shaver has been seemless.  </li>
            <li> With all of the features, I can give it nothing less than five stars.</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic ES8077S hoping it would cut close and with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> While I previously used Braun nd Norelco, I had never used a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t order this razor from the site i-kitchen they will send you some junky razor from the 90s and then MAYBE refund half of your money.</li>
            <li> It cost so much less and seems quality built.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I was done shaving in less than 4 minutes and didn&#x27;t have any irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver costs less.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridges cost less.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is lighter and therefore less fatiguing to grip.</li>
            <li> Had it for less than a month no problems.</li>
            <li> Every previous electric shaver that I have ever tried (Norelco, Braun) would not give me a close shave on the neck area, under my chin and jaws.  </li>
            <li> This is a big fail if your battery runs out in the middle of shaving.  </li>
            <li> only do the cleaning once every 3 or 4 shaves, so it will last quite a while and the 3 packs from Amazon aren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sometimes one does not have the luxury of taking over half an hour for bathing and dressing.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in a previous review, I have been a Panasonic electric shaver user for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those men who have difficult beards and are looking for an electric that just might do the job.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about this product is the long hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> otherwise my face will become a mess.</li>
            <li> then I don&#x27;t have to make a mess around the sink.</li>
            <li> It runs so slowly that shaving took twice as long, and its screen irritated my face.</li>
            <li> in if you have a tight outlet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, replacing worn out parts is as costly as just buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using an older Braun for the past five years or so, and the poor motor one day decided no more.</li>
            <li> the shaver is easy without the cleaning unit base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging is easy and I can charge without using the base unit by just using the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago for my BF for Christmas.</li>
            <li> To continue, when excessive pressure is applied to the skin, the pressure can cause pulling of the skin, and lead to razor cuts (this has happened to me with other shavers).  </li>
            <li> A little note both shavers have to be tried for a number of days in succession in order to make any comment.</li>
            <li> a little bit of the foil broke.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research because I was never \\&quot;an</li>
            <li> before i get into my review of this shaver, i am compelled to give a little background of my skin type and the problems ive had with shaving.  </li>
            <li> and behold, i was perturbed by the results my little test.  </li>
            <li> so let me rave about it a little bit.   </li>
            <li> With Norelco it is very hard to shave the neck hair and under the chin, with Norelco it takes several passes to shave the neck hair.</li>
            <li> So this shaver gave out, totally dead, a little over three years after purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can shave over tough areas several times without razor burn.</li>
            <li> only gripes are the large and NOISY cleaning/charging base.</li>
            <li> He hasnt said a bad word about it in months since he got it (hes the kind who never will admit to being wrong).</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of shelling out massive $$ for the Mach3</li>
            <li> I am one who needs to shave everyday in order to looked well groomed.  </li>
            <li> I have always dried shaved, and my neck always became irritated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And then finally as you gave up and secretly flipped the bird to the dolphins</li>
            <li> The alternative is the Firm of Nicks &amp; Cuts.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Mold all over the Cleaning Cartridge after a few days of use &lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 forever, I bought this product to shave a few minutes of my shaving time.</li>
            <li> I suggest it to any  man that has been bothered with ingrown whiskers or left behind  stubble.  </li>
            <li> a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> waste time with the others</li>
            <li> decided to keep this one because, although still subpar compared to a razor, I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Give the razor a few weeks before you stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have used it anywhere from three days to 1/2 day of growth with no problem with missing or irritation.</li>
            <li> but it took a few times to get used to it since he used a razor before.</li>
            <li> As the title implies, I tried the Norelco for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I had to get used to the cleaning taking a few hours.</li>
            <li> a few months ago, i got fed up with having a 5:00 shadow at noon and decided to try an electric shaver.   </li>
            <li> after a few shaves with it, however, i noticed some problems.  </li>
            <li> it too seemed to have some trouble around my neck.  </li>
            <li> They are also a bit messy to use when you travel.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If it dies after a few years I won&#x27;t feel quite as bummed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy stubble, but even waiting</li>
            <li> a few shaves like I do</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Panasonic products in the past, and they have never let me down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: The automatic cleaning cycle is loud and last for about 2 to 3 hours; the travel bag (marble bag) is a piece of crap (won&#x27;t hold shaver and cord also no protection for the razor); the cleaner charger has to sit someone in your bathroom, my other razors were stored in the drawer (this unit takes up some counter space).</li>
            <li> I have had some slight problems with shavers in the past, but haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is my first razor with a cleaning base, so I&#x27;m curious to how well it works.  </li>
            <li> That having been said, I was very disappointed with this particular shaver for two reasons: the shaver did not last as long as other ones I have owned (the rechargable batteries wore out way too prematurely for a shaver at this price level), and the HydraClean base unit was too large and bulky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly guys, this thing is really pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> when reading my review of the 3 shavers i tried, keep in mind that a shaver that has these three qualities makes me happier than one with a cool base and a travel kit.   </li>
            <li> This razor by itself is a bargain, but together with the cleaning system it keeps your cutting heads and foil in like new condition for every shave.    </li>
            <li> But as long as I change how I hold the unit when I&#x27;m shaving the back of my head, I can at least try to keep all cutting surfaces on my skin at once.  </li>
            <li> But as long as I change how I hold the unit when I&#x27;m shaving the back of my head, I can at least try to keep all cutting surfaces on my skin at once.  </li>
            <li> I have a fancy Braun that I am now giving away, I hope I can learn to get a little closer with the Panasonic (I do have a hard beard),.</li>
            <li> Sadly, about a month or so after receiving the new blades, the head of my razor fell off (shades of Dumb and Dumber).  </li>
            <li> The charger base has an annoying, huge, blinking red light, so you may have to place the base somewhere other than your nightstand.</li>
            <li> Maybe....But not much better.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a Fusion for touch-up however as I find it no better than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> i usually run the cleaner after a shave not before i need to use.</li>
            <li> it was past time to replace the blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owed 3 Panasonic ES8092 razors in the past two years and now the ES8077S razor for the past six months.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, the trimmer is next to useless, but a cheap-o beard trimmer does the job</li>
            <li> I wake up at 7:00, get into the shower as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every way of shaving over the past 25+ years including a variety of foil and rotary electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without irritation in the throat area and has no trouble cutting anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I applied a small amount of shaving cream, and this must be the foamy type not the gel, and covered the area I wanted to shave.</li>
            <li> No more buying blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have tried to make the razor fail by not following the directions and it still performed as it should.  </li>
            <li> You almost think something is wrong with it, its so quiet!  </li>
            <li> I have difficult facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse when shaving wet -</li>
            <li> Areas under the chin, around the adam&#x27;s apple, and at the back of the jaw are extremely difficult to shave with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Just reduce the cost of the shaver by a few bucks and get rid of the stand!    </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and they give me the closest shave with the least discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and usually have to trim up with a standard razor blade....not any longer!</li>
            <li> In the package are directions for easily cleaning it -- just put some liquid detergent on the cutting head, run it until the detergent foams up, remove cutting head and rinse it along with the razor.</li>
            <li> I do not have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> You can either insert it (snaps easily) into the cleaning stand (electrical contacts at the base of the shaver) or unplug the wall transformer from the cleaning stand and plug it directly into the base of the shaver.</li>
            <li> (after owning the shaver a little less than a year), the motor starting changing speeds randomly, slowing down, and pulling hair rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have real heavy growth, but this razor has a very tough time removing whiskers, even after repeatedly going over the same area.</li>
            <li> these dont just slow down and give you a heads up, they stop!!</li>
            <li> I was tired of having irritated skin after razor shaving each day, and though I had less than favorable results with electric razors in the past</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 1 month before the base unit cleaning system quit working.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the cleaning base is not really necessary.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode is pretty worthless too.  </li>
            <li> It still delivers a very close shave and the base has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it shaves quite as close as a blade in the tough areas, but it&#x27;s not significant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it tends to dull the razor as some reviewers have claimed.      </li>
            <li> An electric shaver is NOT a razor, and shouldn&#x27;t have the handle of one - this handle makes it hard to maneuver around the face.  </li>
            <li> very poor dry shaver (the reason I wanted this</li>
            <li> And when I was done working every angle multiple times, the shave was still a disappointment:</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> Also, their instructions were confusing.  </li>
            <li> , it is cheaper than blades (at least non-generic blades) and easier on the skin.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find a complaint.</li>
            <li> The 13,000/minute cutting speed is essential to the shave</li>
            <li> People have complained about shaver cuts.  </li>
            <li> You should at least give it a look.</li>
            <li> but the directions are a bit confusing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - If anyone has the ES8043SC and wants to buy my base, &lt;br /&gt;e-mail me.</li>
            <li> Slowly and deliberately holding the shaver at 90 deg.</li>
            <li> Idiotic handle and pivot design, takes a very long time to shave, difficult to shave several areas, can tear up the skin, no lock button.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad: unlike past models that actually had functional trimmers, the pop-up trimmer on this model, to put it bluntly, sucks.</li>
            <li> They also include an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water; this would be convenient when on the road, so you don&#x27;t have to lug around the cleaning base!    </li>
            <li> i actually started shaving slower out of fear of that very uncomfortable tug.  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to find one locally and everything I found online said \\&quot;not in stores, online only\\</li>
            <li> it can nick your skin a little and draw a drop of blood once in a while, not too painful but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Unless one has trouble with the simple cleaning procedures, the base &lt;br</li>
            <li> wet/dry, shaves my neck with very little irritation, and is not totally dependent on the self-cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> With the Norelco, it was quite a bit faster (which is bad, obviously), maybe 6.5-7 hours.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for a few months I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Not to say the Braun is not a good shaver</li>
            <li> the guy at bloomingdales said it was no good for shaving your head.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> no good.  </li>
            <li> - The power cord powering the cleaning base can be disconnected and connected directly to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> i have also read some complaints of a shaver and/or the base being loud, but while some are louder than others, none are going to wake up the neighbors.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed at the seemingly bogus claims of the Braun Activator&#x27;s new patterned slots at improving shave closeness and cutting down on shave time over the previous models of Braun.</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t press too hard!)  </li>
            <li> And like one of the other reviewers, I hated how Braun had limited cleaning options.  </li>
            <li> However, I paid 94 dollars for this just over a month ago (which is too late for a price adjustment) and now it&#x27;s 60 something dollars!</li>
            <li> With Norelco cleaning is tough.  </li>
            <li> But then, I&#x27;ve always had a tough face and this shaver is still excelling.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger I tried an electric razor and was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time!!!</li>
            <li> The charging / cleaning base is a little gimmicky and noisy, but I do like the dry-only feature - dries the shaver after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> , one of those stupid dolphins finally swam up to you</li>
            <li> leaves some hairs behind that I end up having to pull anyway.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I was tired of the day-after skin irritation that occurred after I shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li> I had to send the base and the shaver back at my expense for repair/replacement under warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Shaver and found the quality of the shave to be exceptionally poor, even after repeated attempts.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit irritating.  </li>
            <li> - The cleaning base has a medium footprint, but no larger than that of the Braun and Remington cleaning bases.    </li>
            <li> this with a grain of salt if your beard isn&#x27;t this thick (I have a permanent five o&#x27;clock shadow like Homer Simpson unfortunately), but keep my experience in mind if you do.</li>
            <li> And there was a thin film of lubricant extruding from inside the motor housing.  </li>
            <li> Can shave in the shower, but you have to apply thin amounts of cream.</li>
            <li> Now the head swivel mechanism is broken.  </li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable for me to use a razor everyday.</li>
            <li> Every other time I have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday now, which is not so bad.</li>
            <li> I was really tired of paying for the expensive &#x27;quad&#x27; razor blades as they keep jacking up the prices, so</li>
            <li> , looks like the &lt;br /&gt;same shaver without the other base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaver for over a month and just a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The seal had failed and water got into the circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic customer service would repair the unit for a \\&quot;fee\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m buying a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I think for this price range, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Have always used an expensive blade for shaving.</li>
            <li> Absurd.</li>
            <li> relatively expensive replacement heads    </li>
            <li> If it lasts four years (unfortunately, Panasonic hasn&#x27;t supported battery replacement before, and I don&#x27;t expect that they will change now)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong mind</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> cleaning process does a mediocre job.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this razor makes the rotary models from Norelco and Remington seem really lame in comparison.</li>
            <li> So, I was late for my meeting and showed up with painful burns and cuts all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Well it is expensive and I am not impressed by the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> and I unfortunately get razor burn or ingrown hairs when I use a blade.</li>
            <li> I still like Braun, and none of the razors ever failed on me</li>
            <li> Plasma TV and the instructions are written in the same MISERABLE way as the shaver.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a really mediocre job on the neck area.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless and</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you decide to make the purchase</li>
            <li> If you ever feel you need to apply alot of pressure, your angle is wrong.</li>
            <li> felt like there were 1000 angry gnomes in the shaver using tweezers on my beard).  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> As I said i my review of the HydraClean cartridges, the HydraClean system is an expensive gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cleaning cartridges for the base unit are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Remember that one time, you went to Sea World, and you waited at the dolphin tank hoping at least one of those stupid fish would swim up to you, because you were some how special?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean bloody.</li>
            <li> I replace the filter about 3 times a year, and I replaced the foil and cutting blades once.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks this thing is cutting me as close as a mach 3 going against the grain.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a problem as its position and angle make it somewhat awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Close shaves, but I&#x27;d end up cutting myself on bumps.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought it!  </li>
            <li> After 4 months, the fan in the base started doing a weird noise.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts are very expensive IMO.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li> The (trivial) bad:  </li>
            <li> &quot; my hair is painful and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars except I am disappointed in the pivot system</li>
            <li> Bad Points:  bulky base station  noisy cleaning process that takes 3 hours</li>
            <li> one is a real stinker:  </li>
            <li> it a try if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But, I was extremely disappointed in its performance.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the base often anyway.</li>
            <li> I hate that.  </li>
            <li> hate it.  </li>
            <li> I bought another one for my worthless lawyer friend who said electric shavers are all crap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the noise too annoying, though some of you may.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t tried the plug in base cleaning method.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I just rinse the shaver under the faucet, snap it in the base and select the drying cycle.   </li>
            <li> *Cleaning/charging base.</li>
            <li> The wash system is worthless, it is a wet/dry shaver, i would just rinse it under running water.  </li>
            <li> Annoying, yes, but</li>
            <li> Save your money and get a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning base station.  </li>
            <li> kinda like a bad driver!    </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the performance.</li>
            <li> exerience with this panasonic product was horrible and I will never ever purchase another Panasonic products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Very annoying!    </li>
            <li> Someone needs to replace the team working on documentation, because it is really awful.  </li>
            <li> It is really terrible.    </li>
            <li> The result is terrible--</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I owned this device for two years and had zero issues with it. I eventually upgraded to a nicer unit, but this one did its job day in and day out with no complaints from its user</li>
            <li> Have used Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry Shavers for a long time, over 25 years &amp; have been happy with them. I like shaving with an electric razor &amp; shaving cream, I do not get a razor burn that way. The Panasonic Shavers have held up very well over their lifetime use. The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver fits comfortably in my hand as I shave. Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I used the ES8077 for a couple of years, then bought an ES8228 last December.  They were both OK.  Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  I recently switched to a Braun Series 7 and the shave is *much* closer and *much* faster.</li>
            <li> best razor i have ever owened</li>
            <li> This panasonic electric wet/dry razor is very good.  It shaves pretty close.    I do find that I have to go back over and shave some areas twice, which is not unusual with most razors I&#x27;ve tried.      If you use shaving cream, it tends to give a closer shave.  It is also nice if you had to use in the shower, although I&#x27;m not one to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> After 5 year of using a Norelco, I decided to change for this Panasonic. I am very happy it. This shaver is very smoth, the battery last almost 3 weeks and the cleaning system is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using double and triple edge blades my entire adult life for 20+ years and would normally get a pretty good shave.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price of replacement standard double or triple blade cartridges has really seemed to go up in price the last couple of years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried other older style cordless shavers and they did not shave as close as standard blade shavers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read a bunch of positive reviews about the Panasonic E8077S so I thought I too would give it a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wow this is one amazing razor, it actually shaves closer than a standard blade shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took my beard several weeks to adjust to using a cordless shaver and the Panasonic documentation indicates it can take up to 30 days to adjust to this new razor and they were correct.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have gone several weeks without placing the unit back in the charger and it still had plenty of battery life left in it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning feature is really a great plus and I find that if you keep the unit clean it provides the same level of close shave day after day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is worth the money and I am glad I do not have to keep purchasing those expensive standard blades.</li>
            <li> I have had this electric razor for about 2 weeks now and I love it. This is my first electric razor in probably 6-7 years. I have always had to shave with a mach3 or a fusion due to the thickness of my beard, but this Panasonic does a fine job. Obviously, the shave is not as close as a mach 3 but it will be alot cheaper than using the straight razors. The first couple of shaves did irritate my neck area, but after a few days that was not an issue anymore. My only real fault with the system is when you clean the razor on the self-cleaning base it is pretty loud. Also the fan that is used to dry the razor runs for hours and is audible in adjacent rooms. The cleaning base does a good job cleaning but I find myself not wanting to use it because of the noise.</li>
            <li> My closest shave has always been with my oldest Norelco, that adjust if I go an extra day withot a shav3e. I have a fancy Braun that I am now giving away, I hope I can learn to get a little closer with the Panasonic (I do have a hard beard),. &lt;br /&gt;   I really like the Panasonic and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED BRAUN FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS,THE PANASONIC IS SUPERIOR. &lt;br /&gt;GREAT SHAVE   THE CLEANING IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BRAUN &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TRY IT------YOU WILL LIKE IT !!!!!</li>
            <li> My experience echoes the review of \\&quot;Shopper\\&quot; on 8/8/06.  It&#x27;s been years since I last gave electric razors a try, but judging from the glowing reviews I thought maybe the technology had improved.  I will say the cleaning system on this razor is slick and the wet/dry capability is great.  But for me the value of an electric razor is as a time saver.  I tried it wet and dry, with and without shaving cream, but it invariably took so many passes that I could have shaved just as quicky the old fashioned way.  And when I was done working every angle multiple times, the shave was still a disappointment: I was left with sharkskin cheeks and stray hairs below the chin. It might get a passing grade if you didn&#x27;t feel the skin, but there is no comparison in shave quality to a traditional razor.  Might be good compared to other electrics.  Fit and finish are excellent, but couldn&#x27;t do a better or faster job than my Gilette.</li>
            <li> I am fan of linear motor devices and this shaver does what it says. However, I am a bit concerned that one must rinse the shaver before shaver cleaning and drying cycle.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MANY BRANDS OF ELECTRIC SHAVERS . THIS ONE STANDS OUT AS VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Panasonic inductive charging shaver, whose batteries had finally died. They were replaceable, but by the time you add up the cost of the replacement batteries, a foil assembly, and the cutter, you might as well buy a new shaver. And anyway, technology marches on, so you may discover that the newest models are still better than your rebuilt one anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the case with this \\&quot;linear motor\\&quot; Vortex shaver. When I opened the box, I almost sent it right back because it did NOT have the inductive charging system (online sources listed it as a model that did), and the shaver felt light and flimsy. But the Amazon price was so good that I decided to give it a try, and the power cord plugs into the base with the same jack as on the razor, so you can take just the cord and shaver on a trip and dispense with the huge base, if you like. And I do like, because I typically shave dry while I&#x27;m deciding what to wear in the morning, so I don&#x27;t use the base often anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a heavy, stiff Scottish beard, and most electrics leave a lot of stubble, especially on my neck. But this one hacks it all down in fine style. My \\&quot;new\\&quot; 5-O&#x27;clock shadow is about the same as my \\&quot;old\\&quot; 2-O&#x27;clock shadow. Also, the small pop-up trimmer is precise enough to permit trimming around your ears and other areas in between haircuts (yes, I&#x27;m also cheap). Battery life is a tad shorter than with my old Panasonic, but then this one has that 13,000 RPM Linear motor, and extra LEDs to power. But it still lasts more than a week, and part of the reason for the shorter life may be related to the fact that now I shave a bit longer because this model gets my face almost blade-close with a dry shave. So I tend to see if I can get every last whisker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have yet to be cut or nicked with this razor, even though I have to shave inside the corners of my mouth every 2 or 3 days (picture, if you will, the caveman in the Geico commercials). Also, the pivot mechanism, which can be locked, combined with that middle slotted blade, helps get every last whisker, even those quarter-inch long \\&quot;rogue&#x27;s\\&quot; that sometimes magically appear on a man&#x27;s upper cheek, or neck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The linear motor in this shaver will maintain its 13,000 RPM speed through heavy beard growth right up to the moment the batteries die. But this unit has a series of LEDs to tell you when the charge is low, so if you get caught, it&#x27;s your own fault. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One last plus: The on-off switch is recessed, so the probability that this shaver will get switched on in your luggage is very low, of not zero. My old shaver had a slider switch, and that was a problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS: The charger base has an annoying, huge, blinking red light, so you may have to place the base somewhere other than your nightstand.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for three-four weeks and use it almost every day. It is an effective product which basically does what is promissed: an easy, close shave. I espeicially like the pivoting head and the ability to shave wet or dry. I do not use the recharging stand since it is too large; instead I clean it by holding it under the hot water faucet and plug it directly to the power cord for recharging.</li>
            <li> Review for Panasonic ES8077S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my brother owns an older model and loves it, I decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The problem that it solved for me was redness and irritation.  After about two weeks my beard got used to the new shaver and there has been no redness, bumps or irritation.  It shaves amazingly close.  I&#x27;ve used it wet or dry and it works great either way.  It&#x27;s close, smooth, easy and convenient.  Wish I had tried this years ago.</li>
            <li> The shaver is excellent and generally better than the Braun although it seems to accumulate water if you use it wet.  However, the cleaning stand died quickly and won&#x27;t clean anymore.  It was erratic from the start.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I rate the shaver a 4 and the and the stand a big 0 for myoverall of 2</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of shelling out massive $$ for the Mach3 I had been using.  This is almost as good as a blade, and a lot cheaper over the long run.  I&#x27;ve had a Norelco and a Braun, and the shave wasn&#x27;t even remotely as close as a blade.  This isn&#x27;t quite there, but good enough so I get through the day without looking like I have 2nd day shadow.  Cleaning is very simple -- running the blade under water, or using soap, seems to work better than the cartridge system, which is good if you want to avoid that expense.  Only downside is I had a fair amount of razor burn when I first started using it for wet shaves -- but now (after about 2 months) I am using it in the shower pretty much every day.  On the whole a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I bought it for my husband. He loves the closeness for bald heads. The cleaner works good.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Five stars all around.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the razor when I first got it but I was told that sometimes it just takes a while for skin to adjust to a new razor and that I should keep using it for a couple months.  Well it didn&#x27;t get any better and now it&#x27;s too late to return it.  Specifically, it takes twice as long to shave with the 8077 as it did with my last shaver (a remington) and often times no matter how hard or soft I press the razor leaves some hairs behind that I end up having to pull anyway.  It&#x27;s very frustrating to spend twenty minutes shaving and still not be able to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Was expecting much more from Panasonic.  Doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, have to keep going over and over and will still miss a few.</li>
            <li> i am fully pleased with this shaver and all components connected to it, the best electric shaver i have ever used, smooth with no irritations. also please with the efficiency with which it was delivered, i was going out of town soon after it was ordered, and i knew it would not be at home, so i had it shipped to the hotel and it arrived with time to spare. very well pleased.</li>
            <li> Needed something to replace a Braun 7075, which I was very pleased with.  I don&#x27;t just shave my face, I shave my head also, which poses a problem for so many razors designed for face and neck.  A few days ago I went to a local brick and morter and got a new arcitec razor, got home, and tried to shave my head with it.  Lousy job, even after going over just one side of my head above the ear for over 2 minutes, there was nothing but stubble left over.  Used the Braun, and all gone within seconds.  So I returned that razor and searched online for reviews that said something along the lines of \\&quot;as good as Braun\\&quot;.  This one came up, and the reviews mentioned in many cases that it worked as good if not better than the Braun shavers.  And like one of the other reviewers, I hated how Braun had limited cleaning options.  This is my first razor with a cleaning base, so I&#x27;m curious to how well it works.  But since this can be cleaned just with hand soap and water, i&#x27;ll likely use that method most often and just use the built in system every couple months for a good semi annual clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it for 15 or 20 minutes so I could give it a try.  First thing I noticed was that it was quieter.  Much quieter.  Higher pitched whine than the Braun, but only a fraction of the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried shaving my head - and instantly was satisfied with the results.  As other reviewers said, it works at least as good if not better.  Faster cut, I found that more areas that I shaved didn&#x27;t need to be gone over as many times as I did with the Braun.  Seems to get more with every pass.  And where it went, was nice and smooth.  No stubble at all.  Very smooth, and this is just a dry razor shave, what I&#x27;ve always done.  I&#x27;m curious to see how it does some day in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars except I am disappointed in the pivot system - it only pivots side to side with the tilt hinge, it does not pivot front / back at all, which is what I need far more than the side to side pivoting.  But as long as I change how I hold the unit when I&#x27;m shaving the back of my head, I can at least try to keep all cutting surfaces on my skin at once.  At least it&#x27;s so effective that even when i don&#x27;t, it still does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice and light, comfortable to hold, quiet, and great results, and half what my Braun cost - I can finally say goodbye to Braun and be happy with something that works better for less money.oting.

            <li> I was very suprised on how close the shave was when I first used it and being able to use it in the shower is really nice. But after about 10 or 15 shaves you can tell it&#x27;s time to replace something as it starts to grab you hair on occasion. Furthermore,it takes twice as long to shave with it then using a razor. So I just use it when Im in a rush to work and need to shave in the car. Lastly, it takes several passes around the the atoms apple and hard to reach place. Besides that it&#x27;s a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver,it has plenty of power far better than the Braun Shaver that I replaced,the pivoting head works fine on the neck ,it is very easy to clean even without using the \\&quot;HydraClean Syatem\\&quot;  I find I get a nice smooth shave . I think Panasonic has done it again with a very nice reasoniable cost unit. As a plus my Wife gets much closer now with my nice stuble less face- See another bonus ! !</li>
            <li> It is the best shaver I ever had,and I am over 81 yrs.old,but I think it is a ripoff to buy the cleaning system when they tell you all you have to do is use some liquid soap and water to clean the shaver,and don&#x27;t need the cleaning system to charge the shaver.I wish I could have sent the cleaning system back,it is not needed.Thank You Ted Govola</li>
            <li> After using a Norelco for more than 5 years I decided to try a wet shaver. The Panasonic seemed like a good option so I bought one. The shaver worked like a charm, but after a year of usage I noticed it started to behave strangely. It would turn itself on and wouldn&#x27;t turn off by using the on/off button. At the same the shaver alternated between normal and high speed vibration which made impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;As the unit was out of warranty I decided to find out what the problem was, so I disassemble it and found water inside. The seal had failed and water got into the circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic customer service would repair the unit for a \\&quot;fee\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m buying a Norelco. They offer 2 year warranty and are extremely reliable.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. Its everything you could ask from an electric shaver. The only flaw is it is fairly loud when you shave and when it self cleans.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this shaver, PERIOD.  Gets the job done way better than my past Remington which was a comparable price.  It cuts really close in the dry mode.  I was curious to try the wet mode so I used shaving cream.  Although I liked the feel and the fact that I could put aftershave on after, I was disappointed in closeness of the shave.    For me, it works much better dry.  And isn&#x27;t that the reason people buy these?  For convenience?    I would give it 4 stars if the cleaning cycle could be complete faster.  Why in the world does it take 3 hours to clean a shaver???!    In their defense, it does do a great job cleaning.  But 3 hours?  How much electricity is that taking?  Also, their instructions were confusing.  I think for this price range, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Even with minor flaws, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean System   After receiving  my Panasonic wet/dry ES8077S shaver,I am greatly pleased with the system.I am getting great shaves,no skin bites as with other shavers.Reall enjoy the wet feature,as it feels more comfortable than the dry shave,but both are evenly great.  The cleaning system works like a charm.  I could not ask for more!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used a lot of electic razors. Always seem to use Norelco&#x27;s but over time I have come to the realization that Norelco&#x27;s are really hard to clean and thus don&#x27;t shave as close. I can&#x27;t use a regular razor because I tend to make my face feel too raw.    Recently I decided to get a new razor and did a lot or research. I also have an older Braun that I use for travel. I would have never thought of Panasonic as being in the electric shaver business. But everyone seem to rave about the brand.  I decided to give it a try and the price seemed a lot better than some of the higher end Norelcos and Brauns with similar features. I have never owned a self-cleaning model so this was a going to be interesting.    Overall, this is a great shaver. Not too loud, but the pitch is higher because the head really has a high RPM. Took about the same time to shave as my previous shavers, but it feels like I shaved with a straight razor. Very smooth and soft. Unit is lighter than my Norelco&#x27;s and the head movement is very good. Unit has a good ergonomic feel. Very slim body for those with smaller hands.  I like the cleaning/charging stand because you can put it there without necessarilly charging it. This way I can let it drain down and only charge it when it needs it instead of everyday.  The first charge lasted about 2 weeks before I had to charge it. I also decided to run the self cleaning once to see how it did. That worked pretty good. I just won&#x27;t cleaning as often as the manual states.    I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Hunh ... lot&#x27;s of positive reviews, but I don&#x27;t get it.  The \\&quot;Vortex\\&quot; (should have been dubbed \\&quot;The Daisy\\&quot;) just does not cut it.  I have an old Braun 3612 with old dull blades.  It cuts right thru the stiff (I say stiff, should say stiffer, my beard is really not that tough) hairs under my lip. The Panasonic \\&quot;Daisy\\&quot; shaver just sits there and cries.  No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly guys, this thing is really pretty bad.  Think twice before you spend your money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering this shaver as a substitute for blade shaving, then you&#x27;ve hit the jackpot.      I have been shaving my head for about a year now and have tried various models of electric and blade razors.  And while it is true blades are always the closer shave, they also cause the most damage to sensitive skin or to anything other than the most smoothe and perfect head.     Electrics while they seem like an attractive option simply don&#x27;t get the job done. They just lack the power to get through the toughest hair, like the head.    Well then there is the Panasonic ES8077S Linear Shaver.  This puppy blasts cleanly through the thickest stubble without even slowing down. I swear this thing would cut my lawn if I tried it.     Seriously, it has great features, and is solidly built and it&#x27;s battery life is more than ample.  I get a good 4-5 head shaves out of a single charge. (and shaving a head is a fair amount of real estate)     This razor by itself is a bargain, but together with the cleaning system it keeps your cutting heads and foil in like new condition for every shave.    If you want a shave that is AS CLOSE AS A BLADE but want to avoid the annoyance of cuts, nicks and razor bumps; than give this gem a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Just started using this razor seven days ago. I am one who needs to shave everyday in order to looked well groomed.  Have always used an expensive blade for shaving. Believe it or not, this razor can do the trick!! I highly recommend it. No burn or irritation-Just buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> First off, If i could plug this in and shave i would give it a 5 star.  there is nothing more annoying than running out of juice in the middle of a shave.  these new razors are great with the constant speed but you cant&#x27;t judge when it will stop on you. these dont just slow down and give you a heads up, they stop!! then you have to plug it in and charge it for a while and then unplug it and continue!!!!! I hate that.  my old razor i could hear that it was slowing down and at least be able to finish shaving with it plugged in. why they decided to not have it work plugged in is beyond me.  I use it slightly wet usually at the sink but not that wet where it is dripping or anything. I also dont bother with the cleaner because it doesn&#x27;t do much better than just rinsing off in the sink.  the rotory razors like the norelco are too rough for my skin(pull/lift and cut). allthough i see why the lift and cuts probably get a closer shave I guess I have more sensitive skin because they are like hair pullers to me, so i have allways used the foil types and i like the panasonics for that but my next one will have to work when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic previously which I loved and used until even new blades and foils weren&#x27;t enough. I bought the untra cheap model with the yellow trim but it felt like a toy and worse, shaved like one.   But this model cuts like a dream. I dry shave my leathery old face and it works a treat. I even use it to keep my shaved head slick, which allows hte current summer heat to disspate just a bit better. I highly recommend this shaver. I haven&#x27;t used the cleaner yet but I believe it will be good too just based on how good the shaver is to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors in my life and none have given me a shave like this one. I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week waiting on this razor to come in and when it did it preformed above my expectations. I did have to trim my hair first then shave I just shave and it gave me a shave that feels razor close. I shave both my face and head and it worked great. My wife even used it to do her legs and under arms and she said the she loved how easy that was. I definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaver as a gift last Christmas. Before that i was using a rotary shaver from Norelco. I was used to using the Rotary shavers but i wanted to try a foil for a while. I think this shaver gives a fair shave, not great. I&#x27;m at the point now where i have to wet my face and use Shaving Cream. With this method it does work pretty good. But i often want a quick shave without the hassle of shaving cream and wetting my face. My face was getting roughed up a bit, and it still does after months of use if i go dry. My old Norelco rotary shaves about as close and yes, i have compared several times and that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t throw out the old Norelco. But i will be looking at one of the Brauns as i want something that shaves better dry, and something less irritating.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is great. It&#x27;s just about as smooth as a regular blade, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate the softer skin on my neck. It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower, though I mainly just use it in my car. The foil seems to last forever, as I&#x27;ve yet to notice it wearing down.    My only complaint is the cleaning system. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to the razor, and the water inside it starts to stink fairly quickly, causing the razor itself to stink after cleaning. Maybe I got a bad cleaning cartridge. However, since this is a wet-dry razor, I just run it under some hot water whenever it needs it.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077S is a mid-range shaver in the Panasonic line-up of electric shavers. For the price, it does the job very well, so unless you have money to burn, there is no need to buy higher-end models costing several hundred dollars. I bought this shaver because I was tired of the day-after skin irritation that occurred after I shaved with a razor. The ES8077S features three cutting blades, a sideburn trimmer and a powerful 13,000 RPM motor. The blade head can move side-to-side, but I prefer to lock it in position.    The best features of this shaver are: 1) It shaves very close and relatively irritation free. You will need to do a slight touch-up with a razor afterwards in hard-to-reach areas like portions of the neck and a little of the lip area right under your nose, but this is the case with all electric shavers; 2) The rechargeable battery lasts for four shaves with 3-day stubble; quite good in my opinion; 3) The shaver can be used in the shower, and with warm water and a light layer of shaving cream applied to the skin. Braun shavers can&#x27;t be used in the shower. I find that the ES8077S actually shaves better and more comfortably wet than dry; 4) Cleaning the blades and foil is easy -- just apply liquid handsoap to the foil and run the shaver under running warm water, then remove the foil and rinse it out, as well as the blades; 5) It comes with a cleaning, drying and charging station. The cleaning feature uses cartridges and is really unnecessary, since it is so easy to clean the shaver using warm water and soap, but the station will blow-dry and heat your shaver dry, as well as charge it. The blades will last 2 years; the foil 1 year, according to the manual. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my Panasonic ES8095 shaver.  Like some others, my ES8095 would not take a charge. The first time was in warranty, and was repaired, and then a year later (with new batteries from Amazon) it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than two shaves, this time it was out of warranty.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my third Panasonic shaver, and each one shaves better than the previous one. I like the feel of the ES 8077, it is lighter and fits better in my hand. The Li-ion battery life is excellent. I went a week and a half, and only charged it because it was a convenient time to recharge it. The indicator was still at high. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is too early to say if the cleaning is worthwhile. The cleaning cycle takes nearly 3 hours, and does a very good job. The cost of the cleanning cartridges seem a little high. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other downside of this shaver is that it is no longer induction charging. You can either insert it (snaps easily) into the cleaning stand (electrical contacts at the base of the shaver) or unplug the wall transformer from the cleaning stand and plug it directly into the base of the shaver. I will be watching to see if the electrical contacts corrode over time or leak due to exposure to water.</li>
            <li> I haved shaved with a Norelco for over 15yrs., and finally swithed to the Panasonic \\&quot;vortex\\&quot;, hydra clean 8077s.  I have always dried shaved, and my neck always became irritated.  The Vortex shaves closer with less irritation, but it does take a little more time to shave when using a shaving gel.  Overall, it is by far a better shaver, and worth the extra time to properly clean it.  Decent buy, there may be a better shaver out there, who knows?</li>
            <li> This is the second electric shaver I own, after using an older shaver for 10 years, also from Panasonic. Shavers are supposed to shave, of course; but they get better ratings in my opinion the closer and smoother the shave, and the less they irritate your skin. Also, ease of use and maintenance are a plus. Well, this shaver has all of that: close, clean shaves but zero skin irritation, and the self-cleaning system is just wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, solid and reliable product.</li>
            <li> Pro &lt;br /&gt;* Looks cool &lt;br /&gt;* Interesting cleaning and charging station &lt;br /&gt;* Seems solidly constructed &lt;br /&gt;* Can use it in the shower &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con &lt;br /&gt;* Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to shave the hair on my chin.  I have used this for 2 months (about 1-2 shaves a week).  My beard hair is of regular thickness.  I just don&#x27;t understand why the shaver can&#x27;t shave the upper neck and chin portion.  It leaves patches of hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it seems that it works for most folks.  I might just be the outlier  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your shaver hunt.</li>
            <li> Finally, a shaver that performs as advertised. I have used all of the Norelco and Braun shavers out there and this is the first to actually shave my beard without razor burn. Truthfully, I had no transition period....none was necessary. I have been using this shaver for a week and have not had the first episode of razor burn or a poor shave. Incredible. My days of shaving cream are over! I have a very tough beard and usually have to trim up with a standard razor blade....not any longer! I am truly amazed at the quality of the shave I have gotten from this razor. Use in the shower or at the sink poses no problems, this is a very nice shaver. A definite buy...enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product. I had a braun before.This is a much better product.</li>
            <li> Getting adapted to it now for three weeks and am very happy with the close shave and the cleaning. It did at first sort of non impress me and got too close on the chin several times. But once my face adapted to it, I will never go back to the Norelco. This shaver is awesome...</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 month now, and its a great relief for my face, no irritation and very close shaving, the only con is the neck area, but that happens with every other shaver, the cleaner base is very nice and solid, its great to just leave the shaver there to clean, well if you have problem with irritation you have to try this, but if your hair is too thick maybe the 3 head rotors shavers works best for you.. just my 345 cents,</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the shaver, feel it right and feel it good when holding, let aside that I can shave while showering. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who can no longer use a regular razor due to being on a blood thinner, he loves it, it&#x27;s a little noisy when in the cleaning mode but he says it does a great job and is always clean and ready to use. I also purchased one for my son for christmas.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for the past three months, and thus far I have been fairly pleased with the performance.  The closeness of the shave is very good - far better than my previous Panasonic razor.  As usual, the area between the neck and jaw line is a tricky place to shave, and I have to pass over the same area several times to receive a moderately close shave.  The pivoting head is a nice feature that works well when shaving the jaw line. My biggest complaint about this product is the long hair trimmer.  The long hair trimmer is very inadequate and often pulls hair rather than cutting.  If I go for more than two days without shaving, using the long hair cutter to \\&quot;knock down\\&quot; my hair is painful and time consuming.  The overall performance of this razor is very good if you plan on shaving everyday.  However, this razor falls short when you plan on shaving every couple of days, and need to use the long hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This razor is very quiet in comparison with my braun synchro.  I initially bought it because I had hoped to use it in the shower and to shave my head.  However, it caused quite a bit of razor burn on my head the first time I used it and there has not been a second time.  It is excellent for your face (and maybe YOUR head).  I like the cleaning system and the ease of use.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does it shave better than the Braun Synchro?  Maybe....But not much better.  If I had to do it over again, I probably would not spend the money on this razor.  However, if I were to choose between it and the Braun, I would choose the Panasonic because of the wet/dry option and because it operates so quietly.  It is an excellent razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 50 years, and this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because when used &#x27;wet&#x27; it delivers as close a shave as I can get with any blade.  When used with KISS MY FACE MOISTURING SHAVE, an incredibly lubricating shaving lotion, it also works great for personal areas.  It is remarkably easy to clean even though it comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning station, which I&#x27;ve used sparingly, as it&#x27;s so easy to clean manually.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months, and if there&#x27;s a better product on the market, I sure would like to know about it!</li>
            <li> For more than 10 years I was once a week shaver because shaving on a short stubble would leave me all bloody (and I am just too lazy because it takes so long over the sink :) in the neck area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver on my b&#x27;day after reading all the reviews here and have been very satisfied. I went in with the expectation that the shave wont be as close as a Mach3 (and for me thats only evident late in the evening) and that I will have to use a Mach3 on some parts of my neck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both these turned out to be true, however I am getting better with it and my skin is getting more used to it so I tend to use the Mach3 for touchups less and less (almost zero now). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I can shave in the shower and it is so easy to clean  (well atleast the blades, not the gunk that gets into the pivot mechanism). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the model with the convex shaver head would be even better for me but it is also twice as expensive (had I know this would be so good for me, I would have bought that one instead).</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor because I have a problem with razor bumps (ingrown hairs) on my neck. I can honestly say that after a year of use I&#x27;m still very happy with it. The only thing I would change is the length of time for the cleaning cycle (which is also noisy). That&#x27;s not a big deal, though, since I set it to run before I leave for work.</li>
            <li> Superior quality, give great shave. Good for sensitive skin. Cleaning system is a major plus.</li>
            <li> Excellent Electric Razor.  See te reviews under ES8043SC.  No point in repeating them</li>
            <li> This is an OK electric shaver. It is not so good on the neck area, especially if you have ingrows, but does a great job on my face.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by this razor that I bought two more as christmas presents last year. Then less than 9 months after the purchase I noticed mine was giving me some irratation and not shaving quite so close anymore. I have always used water and shaving cream with it and cleaned and dryed it every day &amp; changed the cleaning cartridge every 4 to 6 weeks. When I enquired about this the reply from panasonic was that they don&#x27;t handle enquiries having to do with supplies or accessories and then \\&quot;kindly\\&quot; referred me to a site to find and order said parts or accessories.   REALLY !  Given the cost of the cleaning cartridges (3 for 14.99) &amp; the screen $25 every 12 months &amp; the blades (~$25 every two years or $12.50/year) the annual maintenance cost of this baby &#x3D; (3*14.99)+25+12.50 &#x3D; ~$82.50/ a year - the current amazon price on this is $99.00</li>
            <li> I ordered the shaver sunday night, paid for 2 day delivery, and received the shaver tuesday before 1pm, CST. i had not shaven for about four days. the only complaint i have was the neck hair was not completely shaved but its not the shavers fault. im sure if used daily, the shaver would do a better job. yes, the clean cycle is long but its cheaper than paying $250 for the new pulsonic. Tim</li>
            <li> I bought this item 4 years ago.  I replace the filter about 3 times a year, and I replaced the foil and cutting blades once.  The tagline for this company was, once you start using this razor, you&#x27;ll never go back to razor blades.  They were correct.    Caveat:  My beard does not grow as quickly as others, I use the razor every other day.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome, it works good when used dry but even better with a nice lather on your face. The ES8077S gets a shave just as good if not better than my Schick Quattro Blade razor. I highly reccomend buying this item, it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago for my BF for Christmas. Straight out of the box it didn&#x27;t shave super close, however the longer he uses it the better performance he is getting out of it. They say to give your skin two weeks to adjust and I believe that it is true.    However, I paid 94 dollars for this just over a month ago (which is too late for a price adjustment) and now it&#x27;s 60 something dollars! Absurd.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It gives him a good shave in/out of the shower. He loves the trimmer that he uses on his sideburns.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s loud. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good points:  can be used in shower  very close wet shave, as close as a blade (watch those nicks!)  hygienic selfcleaning system  looks very cool  comfortable shaving foils  30 day moneyback guarantee from Panasonic    Bad Points:  bulky base station  noisy cleaning process that takes 3 hours (make sure you have finished shaving before you start it cleaning!)  very poor dry shaver (the reason I wanted this, hence I returned it)  need shave foam to wet shave with this  need to buy cleaning cartridges and change every month  relatively expensive replacement heads    Summary:  I paid $125 for this, used this for 3 weeks and ended up returning it under their 30 day moneyback guarantee - I replaced it with a Braun PocketGo 370 for $20, which works brilliantly.    If you want a cool shaver to use in the shower or for touch-ups, then this is for you - just remember the cost yearly for swapping the cutting heads &amp; cleaning cartridges.  If you want a good dry shaver then forget it and go buy a couple of $20 Braun PocketGo shavers that work far better than this thing.</li>
            <li> This is my second ES8077. The first one lasted about 1 month before the base unit cleaning system quit working. I had to send the base and the shaver back at my expense for repair/replacement under warranty. After waiting over a month and shaving with my worn out Remington, I received a refurbished replacement unit, which was a slightly different model. That was just over a year ago. Now the second unit&#x27;s cleaning system has quit working. The shaver still works fine and the charger works, the cleaning system just won&#x27;t turn on. (This happened just after I bought 3 more expensive cleaning filters). I have changed filters regularly and kept the unit clean; the cleaning system just doesn&#x27;t hold up well.    In summary, the unit gives a decent close shave, but the cleaning system is junk! I wish I would have bought a Braun! Anyone want to buy some new cleaning filters? When the shaver head wears out I will definitely buy another brand!</li>
            <li> I now shave my entire head and this shaver is the best thing I could have bought this year for christmas. It works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my Panasonic Vortex shaver back in 2005, BUT, I&#x27;ve purchased two of these shavers. The first was for my elderly father who was in a convalescent home at the time after a heart surgery. He had used a single blade razor all his life, but he lost so much weight in the hospital that his neck skin was very thin &amp; loose. At first he resisted using this \\&quot;electronic contraption\\&quot;, but Mom finally talked him into trying it for just one week. His first 2-3 days left the skin slightly irritated on his face &amp; neck, but towards the end of the week he started liking it. After two weeks there was no turning back. He was sold on how easy &amp; close this shaver works. He actually called me (which NEVER happens) just to say thank you for this shaver. He has not used his old shaving mug &amp; single edge razor since his surgery. I had been using an old Braun shaver for quite a few years which worked only OK as long as I changed out the blades once in awhile, so I bought this Panasonic Vortex due to my dad&#x27;s positive experience with his. Holy cow! What a difference from the Braun. My shave is just as smooth as using a twin blade razor but without the mess. Just for the halibut I used the Panasonic on 1/2 of my face &amp; neck, and a twin blade razor on the other 1/2. My bride could not tell the difference. This Panasonic Vortex shaver is really the cat&#x27;s meow. It is worth every penny. BTW, I&#x27;ve never used the included cleaning system, so I cain&#x27;t remark about that feature. I just blow out the cuttings after every use, rinse it out once a week and hit it with a couple drops of 3-in-1 oil. Both my father &amp; I are still using our shavers every day 4 years after their purchase.</li>
            <li> I just switchet to panasonic last week to try this item, I prefer my old Norelco 8892XL, it was a bit quiter and Closer shave than Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Remember that one time, you went to Sea World, and you waited at the dolphin tank hoping at least one of those stupid fish would swim up to you, because you were some how special?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead, they would swim up to the little Mexican girl with the pink conciera dress for some weird reason, who totally didn&#x27;t deserve to have ALL of the dolphins&#x27; attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then finally as you gave up and secretly flipped the bird to the dolphins underwater, so your grandma wouldn&#x27;t find out and hit you with her wooden shoe in front of everybody like she probably had just done a few minutes before that, one of those stupid dolphins finally swam up to you and you got to touch it, just for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that? Do you remember how it felt? Like a rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT&#x27;S how your face will feel when you use this shaver. Like a perfectly smooth, rubbery wet balloon, filled with meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t careful though, this thing will cut you... much like that little girl would have, had you dolphin-blocked her one too many times.</li>
            <li> I am old enough (71) to have gone through many electric razors and this is the best I&#x27;ve yet found.      The razor works so well that, even with a heavy beard, I only have to shave every four or five days!  (In between I just look modern-chic.)      The next best was a Norelco, but the problem with that razor is that if you have a beard or mustache you will constantly be shaving off part of it - it just takes everything. The fact that I can shave into the beard with the regular heads without nicking makes this Panasonic ideal.  The pop-out trimmer works excellently, also.    It is convenient that the blades need replacement only every two years, and the outer foil, equipped with included long-hair clipper, lasts a year.  Other brands I&#x27;ve tried cut that time in half.    In short, the parts (accessories) aren&#x27;t cheap, but they last twice as long.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year and it shaves as well now as it did when it was new.    The Vortex cleaning system really keeps the entire head assembly super clean (although I had to clean the part where the head rests once).  The cartridges can be expensive if you need to shave every day, but the razor can be well cleaned in hot water, so the Vortex need not be used after every shave.  The way I use it, I get fifteen cleanings before I have to change the cleaning cartridge.    It can be removed from the holder and used any time, as long as there is a charge left-in an emergency, the cord can be used.     P.S. You do have to learn how to use an electric shaver!  The alternative is the Firm of Nicks &amp; Cuts.</li>
            <li> I have owned the 8077ES for about six weeks now, and this is my fourth Panasonic wet/dry shaver in about 13 years (i.e. about 4 years each). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good: For wet shave quality, this is the best of the Panasonic product series in my experience. First time I have ever been able to shave with an electric and still be smooth at 6 or 7 pm. Fast, smooth, and painless (with the exception of rare nicks caused by ingrown hairs and other skin imperfections). FAR safer than blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system may be the difference between good and great shaves using Panasonic shavers. I can measure little difference between the heads and blades of my last three shavers, all of which are the same thickness and differ only in shape. And since the two previous models did seem to work better after cleaning, I am assuming that cleaning is the key. The vortex cleaning system makes that an easy task. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some may consider this shaver pricey. I don&#x27;t agree. If it lasts four years (unfortunately, Panasonic hasn&#x27;t supported battery replacement before, and I don&#x27;t expect that they will change now), it is cheaper than blades (at least non-generic blades) and easier on the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charge capactiy is great; I have taken a ten day trip and made it without recharging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The indifferent: dry shaving closeness just doesn&#x27;t approach wet shaves, period. I suspect that there are some small design differences from dedicated dry shavers, so don&#x27;t expect a wet/dry shaver to be comparable to the best dry-only shavers when used dry.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad: unlike past models that actually had functional trimmers, the pop-up trimmer on this model, to put it bluntly, sucks. For reasons I can&#x27;t figure out, the trimmer has some sharp points and I get more cuts and abrasions from the damn trimmer than from the shaver, even though the usage is probably 100 times more for the shaver than the trimmer. The whole unit takes up a fair amount amount of counter space, and unless you are a sound sleeper, don&#x27;t run the cleaning cycle while you are trying to sleep; it is noisy.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Shaver and found the quality of the shave to be exceptionally poor, even after repeated attempts.  To get anywhere even approximating a close shave (compared to a razor) I had to go over the same areas on my face and neck numerous times, and even then had to finish along my neck with a razor.  I tried different techniques with the same unsatisfactory results, with both dry and wet (using shaving cream).  If the shaver worked cleanly the first time, the shave would have been comfortable, but the need for repeated passes made the shaver a bit irritating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the shaver and vortex cleaner worked very well.  The Vortex unit seemed to clean and dry the shaver thoroughly.  I tried the shaver in the shower and under full shower stream it operated just fine in the soaking wet environment (though the shave quality was unacceptable). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the shaver to Amazon under Panasonic&#x27;s thirty-day satisfaction guarantee, and it cost me $18.76 in return shipping costs using Amazon&#x27;s return USPS label.  I don&#x27;t appreciate having spent $18.76 just to try the product.  I&#x27;ve bought MANY products from Amazon over the years and this is the FIRST item I&#x27;ve returned! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I had completely unsatisfactory experience with this product because of the unacceptably poor quality of shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very good. The cleaning system works well as well.  Used to use a norelco and this is a lot better hands down. &lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry is also a plus.</li>
            <li> When my husband needed a new razor we were stumped as to which one, but thanks to the great internet we were able to check reviews and ratings and that&#x27;s how we decided on this brand and model.  He has had it now for about 3 weeks, and again yesterday ( and for about the 100th time ) he says, \\&quot;This is the best shaver I have ever had, I love it!!\\&quot; the shave is as good as any strait blade razor!!!  He highly recommends this razor!</li>
            <li> This product works well for maintaining when you have no hair, it&#x27;ll keep it rather short without a problem...  If you let it go for a couple of days, it wont do that well anymore, but as long as you use it every day it&#x27;s good...    Cleaning is pretty quiet, so I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES8077 shaver about 2 years ago.  Religiously replaced the cleaning cartidges (WES035P) but it began to stop working properly (after about 6 months).  The oscillator would not maintain a constant strong speed even though it is fully charged; therefore, it would tend to \\&quot;shred\\&quot; your skin as your stubs get stuck between the foil and razor of the shaver...And, sometimes, due to the changing speed of the shaver, I felt that instead of the hairs being \\&quot;cut\\&quot; properly, the effect feels like the shaver is trying to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the stubs out.     Granted, it worked okay in the first 6 months even though I felt that my old trusty Braun foil shaver did the work perfectly for years, in comparison.  I thought that this product would continue to work for years \\&quot;like new\\&quot; condition if I had cleaned it with the cartidges...but I bought into the hype and gimmick of the whole thing.  I felt ripped off, especially with this price.    I am returning to my old braun - simply going to buy a new foil &amp; razor kit replacement for $18.    I do not recommend the Panasonic ES8077 shaver.</li>
            <li> This review is in comparison with the prior generation Braun Synchro Shaver with Braun&#x27;s cleaning system.  I really liked the Braun but decided to give the Panasonic a try based on the reviews.  After using it for some months now, here are my pros and cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The &#x27;linear motor&#x27; of the Panasonic keeps the blade speed the same all the time, regardless of the battery charge.  This was something that I did not like about the Braun.  As the battery charge went down, the speed of the shaver slowed as well.  This impacts the quality of the shave directly.  A big plus for the Panasonic. &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The shave is closer and more &#x27;blade-like&#x27; than the Braun.  But note the cons below on the time it takes. &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The Pana does a much better job on those difficult places like the Adams apple area.  Where I would wind up with stray growths with the Braun, the Pana seems to take care of them easily. &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The reason for changing in the first place was that the Braun battery was starting to fail, holding a charge for less than a week.  So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get the Pana to show any battery drain even if I keep it out of the charger for a couple weeks!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The Braun shave-head has less drag on the face than the Pana, by far.  You feel like you are dragging the Pana across your skin, even with a good preshave in use.  (This is not true if you use the &#x27;wet shave&#x27; capability of the Pana, but I prefer the dry shave overall.) &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Maybe it is the drag noted above, but it takes me longer to shave with the Pana than the Braun.  But the results are better with the Pana even if I shave for the same length of time with each. &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Okay, Pana, the little felt travel bag is ridiculous!  Give me a break!  The Braun comes with a very nice leather pouch and, with a bit if playing around, it will contiune to serve as the carrier for the Panasonic. &lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Not a major con, but I feel that the Braun cleaning system is superior.  Cannot say the Pana is not doing the job - it seems to work fine - but the Braun just seems a bit better overall.  (Either are better than what I didn&#x27;t do before!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, as a person who really enjoyed almost 6 good years of use from my Braun, I am very happy with the new Panasonic and do not regret for a moment the switch.</li>
            <li> Spent some time on Amazon&#x27;s site and others reviewing electric razors.  This seemed to get the most favorable ones.  I have now had it for about six weeks and highly recommend it if you are looking for a new razor.  Wet shave is excellent and dry shave almost as good.  Much better results than my old Braun.  I would give it five stars but the jury is still out on the charging/cleaning station.  It takes 2-3 attempts to get it to clean, then charge.  If I just charge its done quickly but cleaning seems to have issues.  I am going to get some new refills and see if that makes a difference, if not then I will contact Panasonic.  Cleaning with just soap and water is easy and effective, but I paid for the cleaning station and it should work as designed.  Will follow thru at a later date, but don&#x27;t let my minor complaint with the cleaning station deter you, this is a great razor/shaving system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KB</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077 is a great razor. The cleaning system stopped draining the fluid after 6 months. I clean and recharge the razor every weekend. I am thinking of replacing the system with another brand.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for a few months I am not impressed.  I don&#x27;t have real heavy growth, but this razor has a very tough time removing whiskers, even after repeatedly going over the same area. My old $30 Remington does a much better job. Also having to purchase the cleaning unit/solution on a recommended monthly basis, added on to it&#x27;s rather high initial cost I cannot recommend it. A lot of technology but not much on results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day for 2 months and I can&#x27;t find a complaint. I never shaved my face this clean and close with electric shaver. I am using it dry although wet shaving with soap was also fantastic. I am not using the stand as it takes too much space, but once charged with portable charger it runs for about 3 weeks before it needs be recharged. The linear power electronics they use keeps the shaving capability unchanged to the last seconds when battery needs to be recharged. The shaver is also much lighter than my old Braun&#x27;s. The after shave feeling, the linear technology, light weight and the battery span are my favorite technological improvement over my previous 6 years old Braun&#x27;s. I am sure a brand new Braun could be as good but my decision to try out Panasonic was a good one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have used razor blades all my life. When I was younger I tried an electric razor and was very unhappy. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin gets knicks and cuts from the regular razor. Too much of that and some of the advertisements I&#x27;ve seen on the TV about this razor and others made me think that it was time to try an electric razor again. &lt;br /&gt;At first it was uncomfortable. The motion and actions to shave were different than with regular razor. Some of the hairs were not getting cut so I would have to go over that area again and again. I was about to give up when it hit me that for this electric razor to work I had to allow IT to do the work and not me in rubbing the razor over my skin quickly and with lots of pressure. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I take my time, allow the razor to cut the hairs without the intense pressure from me onto my skin. I have to shave everyday now, which is not so bad. It looks good. &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system of this razor seems to do its job. I&#x27;m not to sure what it does but the razor gets clean. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Taken a bit of getting use to but husband seems to be very happy with the product both wet and dry</li>
            <li> hate it.  waste of time and money. seen cleaner shaves on a gorilla</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard; however, this shaver takes longer to get a smooth shave than my previous three Norelco shavers.  Why did I change brands? Because reviewers gave the Panasonic better reviews. &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic does not have the battery life of the Norelco.  The Panasonic will not run during the charge mode, i.e. you must wait for the shaver to recharge before you can complete your shave.  The Norelco was cordless or corded, so if the battery died during a shave, all you had to do was plug it in and continue your shave.  With the Panasonic, if the shaver battery dies during a shave, you must plug it and find other things to do for 15-20 minutes in order to complete your shave.  What a waste of time!!! &lt;br /&gt;The Vortex cleaning system  is nothing more than an added expense, a waste of time and energy, space in the cabinet or under the cabinet, and what does it really do that you can&#x27;t do by passing the razor head under a turned on faucet. &lt;br /&gt;So, think about your time, and how you need to spend it. &lt;br /&gt;It is just my onion. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077s Vortex met my needs perfectly.  I generally shave with a razor in the shower, but there are plenty of days where I don&#x27;t shower until later in the day.  On these mornings, I hit the beard with the ES8077s to keep from looking too scruffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it before going out at night if I have a bit of a shadow, and it works great for that too.  I tried it wet in the shower as a replacement for my trusty razor and didn&#x27;t like the results at all, so I now use both..and am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what anyone tells you, the electric doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but the convienence factor outweighs that in the right situations.  I use the Panasonic about 50% of the time, the razor the rest.  Could I replace the razor?  Sure, but why?  I like using both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for about a month and a half, and am quite pleased.  It took my face about a week to adjust to the new razor, but it&#x27;s been smooth sailing from there.    My old razor was a lotion-dispensing Norelco, which is eaily outclassed by the Panasonic.  The best way I can compare performance is this: let&#x27;s say that if you shave with a blade, your beard will become noticeable 10 hours later.  With the Norelco, it was quite a bit faster (which is bad, obviously), maybe 6.5-7 hours.  The Panasonic is in the 9 hour range, maybe a little better.  Based on reviews I have read here, I tried Lectric Shave lotion.  I don&#x27;t know what this magic stuff is, but it works.  In combination with Lectric Shave, this razor gives performance equal to a blade.  It&#x27;s a very smooth shave (think baby butt).  I&#x27;m not kidding; I&#x27;ll probably never use a blade again.    I don&#x27;t have much else new to add; the razor is comfortable in the hand, is relatively quiet, the cleaning sytem is fantastic, battery life is very good, does quick work, and does not irritate my skin at all.    The only downside to this razor is that the head is quite big.  This is nice on the face, because it allows you to shave more quickly.  However, it has some difficulty manuvering on the neck, and some hairs may be missed.  The Norelco, by comparison, is better able to get into the nooks and crannies.  However, I almost always had stray hairs after shaving with the Norelco, and I do not have that problem with the Panasonic.  I know that Panasonic makes a similar razor with a convex head; this may be a solution to the neck issue.    All in all, I am very pleased with this razor.  It is far and away the best I have ever owned, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s 8077 is nothing to get excited about,so save your money unless you are into wet/dry shaving with an electric razor. The Way some of these guys rave about it you would think they were working for Panasonic.Don&#x27;t get me wrong mind you, the product does what it says, but not very well. The razor is not for those with tough skin and it takes several passes to go over your entire face. The razor does NOT do well on the all important throat and neck area and I find myself touching up after EVERY shave with a Mach 3 Turbo ( better you should use that). Don&#x27;t use a Fusion for touch-up however as I find it no better than the Panasonic. This razors features that make it a little better than others are the wet/dry feature and the fact that you can clean it under water using liquid soap. Alternatively you can use the cleaning block. I leave the decision up to you, but I should also state that you MUST change the outer/and inner foils every year and that will run you about fifty-sixty dollars tack this onto the cleaning cartridges sold at sixteen dollars and you have a very expensive investment for a minimal shave at best. It did not change my life and it won&#x27;t change yours. Trust me on this, and buy a less expensive and more reliable razor don&#x27;t get sucked in by all the gimmicks.</li>
            <li> This is the same shaver sold at sharper image without the digital battery display.  Amazon had a $30 coupon so I paid $70.  It comes with an automatic cleaning stand but you can clean this shaver using liquid soap and tap water.  I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic ES8003 linear shaver for many years.  The ES8077S produces a slightly better shave due to the improved blade design.</li>
            <li> You would be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver out there. No razor burns on the neck. Cuts very close. I wouldn&#x27;t say as close as a manual shaver but not far off. I am not impressed with the cleaning system. If it weren&#x27;t for the cleaning system I would give it a 5 star rating. Certainly one of the best in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaver for over a month and just a little disappointed.  It seems like it gives me a close shave but it does not last as long as a blade shave.  This may be a common complaint as this is my first experience with an electric shaver and it may take more time for my skin to gets use to it.  I hope this is the case.</li>
            <li> this is a great razor rated 3rd best from cunsumer reports but for the money this is the best you can buy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he didnt like it. I bought it partically for the trimmer and the fact its one of the most recommended shaver. The shaver works well enough but the trimmer pretty much burnt and melted his beard. Which stunk up the house. We ended up returning it. Not worth it in my opinion for the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Shaving is average. After 4 months, the fan in the base started doing a weird noise. Sent it back for service (still under warranty). It took almost 2 months to get it back. The same problem persists. I gave up on Panasonic...is not worth</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my son-in-law who was looking for a wet/dry electric shaver.  He tryed it Christmas Day in the shower and said it was awesome.  He has very sensitive skin so it surprised me he was sooo happy with it.  I also purchased the extra shaving heads to qualify for the free shipping.  At the sale price and the free shipping, this is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat.  Thanks, Panasonic and Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The razor cuts well but I don&#x27;t think this total system is anything special. The replacement parts are very expensive IMO. I&#x27;ve had my razor about a year and will just toss it and buy something else when it dies. The battery starts losing it&#x27;s run time after about 6 months. The cleaning system isn&#x27;t needed if you rinse your razor after each use. There has to be better out there, not sure what though.</li>
            <li> This is my second panasonic linear, just used for a couple days. I have also had 2 Braun self-cleaning shavers in the past, including the latest Activator 8595. Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system for my new vortex yet, sorry, can&#x27;t report on how well it cleans, but hey, must be better and more convenient than me cleaning it manually (which was a pain for my first panasonic in that my stubble gunk would get caked onto the blades and wouldn&#x27;t easily rinse off). I think the Vortex is the answer to my prayers. Both my panasonics shaved closer and operated more quietly and was less irritating on my skin than either Braun models. The reason I went back to Braun and bought the Activator after my first Panasonic was that it was just so much more convenient to clean for my lazy self. Now there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any need for a tradeoff, can have your cake and eat it too--quality shave and practical convenience.    I was very disappointed at the seemingly bogus claims of the Braun Activator&#x27;s new patterned slots at improving shave closeness and cutting down on shave time over the previous models of Braun. In contrast, this new pansonic vortex seems to be an improvement over even my older panasonic in that it has a triple blade system. The old panasonic and brauns have two blades on either side of a central comb that i suppose guides and preps the hair. on the vortex, that center comb also has a blade to cut long/stray hairs, and so far doesn&#x27;t seem to be just a gimmick, i feel a difference. furthermore, the panasonic is a wet/dry system while braun is strictly dry. i use panasonic only dry and am already satisfied, but the unit is supposed to be watertight and panasonic invites you to try using the shaver with shaving foam for an even closer shave, not even an option with the braun. dry panasonic shave for me is already closer and faster than dry braun, nice to know if need be for special occasion, important interview or date, can try using the panasonic wet for supposedly aneven closer shave.     the panasonics do a better job of hugging the contours of your face than the brauns as the head pivots in more directions. quieter motor, higher frequency hum than braun, which has a loud and harsh noise that had not improved at all with the new Activator. they are also lighter units than brauns, which i happen to like. handle is also more contoured for gripping too, braun is just a brick shape.  some might say the panasonic feels cheaper/more flimsy, but i feel that the shave outcome is more important. braun has fancier packaging, the unit, the plug, the carrying case, manual, even the box (as i recall was a doozy to open). the panasonic is no nonsense but gets the job done.     the panasonic cleaning unit itself has a little larger footprint than the braun; though may be easier to pack as it can lie flat and is thinner. braun&#x27;s is unwieldy bc it&#x27;s round in shape so in the end might take up more suitcase room. Also, the panasonic cleaning cartridge is smaller and not alcohol-based. you do have to add tap water to the panasonic. the braun uses alcohol which evaporates over time once you pop the lid open, regardless of whether or not you use it.     Update: Have used now for 1 month. Still loving it. Can now comment on the cleaning feature. Does a very good job of cleaning &#x3D;) Quite economical too! I was able to get refills from Amazon 3-pack for $8.88. I clean once every 3 days, 1 cartridge supposed to last ~ 1.5 months, but i can see stretching it even longer duration. That 3-pack i just got should last me 6 months, just buck and half per month, well worth the convenience and quality of cleansing. braun cleaner is bulky, more expensive, will run you at least $10 for a 2-pack and you can&#x27;t really stretch the life too much b/c alcohol based, will evaporate over time whether you use it or not, once it&#x27;s been opened. A whole 3-pack of panasonic is smaller in size than a single braun cartridge. braun&#x27;s cleaner had lemony scent which is nice, panasonic has no scent, just like out of the box. does take up to 3x longer to clean than braun, but for me that has turned out to be more academic rather than practical issue. i usually run the cleaner after a shave not before i need to use. just push the button and leave; so i don&#x27;t care if it takes 1 or 3 hours since i won&#x27;t be coming back to use the shaver until the next day anyway. hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference from my Norelco.  The shave I get from my new Panasonic is awesome.  It would take my Norelco a lot longer to get something close to what I get with the Panasonic.  This razor does at times get so close that it cuts my skin.  This is a bit irritating.  I think it has cut my chin in the same spot ever since I got the razor.  I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning/charge unit yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  All a round the razor is great.  I love it, and I will never go back to a rotary.</li>
            <li> my main priority in shaving is to have a very smooth and close shave.  this shaver has exceeded my expectations in how close of a shave i get.  i can now shave every 2 days w/o any irritation to get a close shave and not walk around with stubble.  i was not able to shace this often with a razor, since the facial hair would not be long enought to cut smoothly.  i am very happy.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HyrdraClean Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System really gives a great shave. It feels like using a new razor every time I shave. Because of my American Indian &amp; German heritage my beard periodically changes and puts a different load on a regular basis on any razor but the Panasonic seems to handle it nicely. The true test is my 7 year old granddaughter who really can&#x27;t get enough of Pop-Pop. She loves to touch my clean shaven face. If she sees me before I shave in the morning she says one day my beard is very soft and the next day very rough. She can&#x27;t figure out why it isn&#x27;t the same all the time. But after I shave with the Panasonic she is very happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, and he loves it. He followed the suggestion to use shaving cream, and he says it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s had in memory. He won&#x27;t consider using anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job of cutting, however, the head is smaller than the Braun with which I replaced with this shaver.  Being smaller it takes a little longer to shave.  It is easy to clean which is an advantage.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic I&#x27;ve owned in the past 10 years.  The others have either had batteries wear out or it was past time to replace the blade.  It may not be more economical to buy a new one, but it was always easier.  This shaver is the best by far.  I enjoy being able to shave in the shower as well as the option to touch up at night if necessary.  The shave is close, quick and never a nick.  It is closer to shaving with a blade than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors off and on for several decades.  I&#x27;ve owned several Braun, Remington, Norelco, Sunbeam and Wahl shavers and the Panasonic ES8977 used wet gives me a shave that is actually as close as I can get with a blade.  It turns out to be the one that I have been looking for for years.</li>
            <li> I was taken by the fabolous reviews by the other customers and purcahsed the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver take some time getting used too. However it does not do the job right the first time, or the second, or the third. It takes 3-5 repetitons on the same area to get a shave and that does not stand up to my Mach3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only way I could get it to work at all was to shave against the grain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shipped it back and now I will loose 18-19$ in shipping.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this so much I bought another one for my worthless lawyer friend who said electric shavers are all crap. He hasnt said a bad word about it in months since he got it (hes the kind who never will admit to being wrong). I have had mine for almost a year and I love it. Did not think I would like the vortex cleaner though, but now Im hooked. Just rinse off your shaver heads and pop it in and in cleans and lubricates it for three hours. Before this I was Mach 3 only. Now my Mach 3 just flips me off when I open the medicine cabinet for the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I asked my Dad what he thought of his new shaver after using it a few weeks and he had this to say: \\&quot;Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning feature. It cuts well, could be faster. Like the flexible head and quiet operation\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.</li>
            <li> I do not have a very heavy beard so I only have to shave evey other day.  I have semi-sensitive skin so this is an issue with some shavers.  I have had some slight problems with shavers in the past, but haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with this shaver.  It shaves closer than any electric that I&#x27;ve tried before.  The automatic cleaning function is great too.  I have owned the shaver since December and it still looks and works like new.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> The main reason for using the vortex electric razor is for convenience of shaving. Also to reduce razor cuts. I like the cleaning/charging station. However, a manual razor still gives a much closer shave</li>
            <li> I used the product for about a month and these were my findings &lt;br /&gt;1) Mold all over the Cleaning Cartridge after a few days of use &lt;br /&gt;2) Panasonic Exchange Program sent me the factory reconditioned unit instead of brand new unit &lt;br /&gt;3) Panasonic claims that their refurbished item appearance is like that of a new unit, but its apperance is 100% used &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My exerience with this panasonic product was horrible and I will never ever purchase another Panasonic products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> How do you get any better than the best shave you have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other Panasonic shavers; the first one was satisfactory, the second one was excellent -- but I dropped it and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a real stinker:  It pulls and requires many passes to get a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning process does a mediocre job.  I stopped using it after the first run and cleaned it manually after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about six months this clunker started up by itself at 3AM and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  I sent it in for warranty service which took 3 weeks.  Now, after the warranty has expired it&#x27;s doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tossed it and bought a $60 Braun, which is a bit noisy but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is the Panasonic 8077 is a real sucko.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used.  The shave feels just as close as a razor everywhere, except for on my neck around the throat area.  For what ever reason it doesn&#x27;t shave as close in that area.  But on my face, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this shaver and a razor.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li> The great motor and thin foil make this a fast, close shave, but the design makes cutting ALL the neck hairs very difficult for me.  Seems like a little thing, but the hair it leaves is irritated by a collar, especially a buttoned one with a tie.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES8077S shaver six months ago, after I gave up on getting replacement batteries for my ES8033--both are linear-motor powered--that gave me four-years of satisfying use.  The old shaver had NiCad batteries, and had dropped to half a shave per charge.  The ES8077S has NiMH batteries that easily give me 10 days of use on a single charge.  The charge indicator  (low, med, high) has been quite accurate for me, as opposed to several other reviewer&#x27;s comments.  I don&#x27;t think the shave is any better with the new \\&quot;Vortex\\&quot; shape and the new 30 degree angle blades, but it&#x27;s the best I can get with an electric.  The 13,000/minute cutting speed is essential to the shave, I think, since I tried the cheaper model that runs at 10,000/minute (my wife gave it to me as a present, not appreciating the difference), and I returned it per the warranty.  I even got my money back--after 8 weeks.     The major distinction of the Panasonic is its waterproof case.  Shaving with cream and warm water gets the closest shave, but it&#x27;s about as must work as shaving with a blade--and just as messy.  I can get shaving burn that way, but sometimes it is useful.  I can usually shave dry in about 90 seconds.  I tried shaving in the shower, but you can&#x27;t shave and wash at the same time, since you must hold the razor as well as the washcloth, and you need a good mirror on the wall of the shower or in your hand.  I still like the idea of a waterproof razor.  Braun&#x27;s razors are not guaranteed waterproof, but their cleaning system requires immersion.    I never used the Braun system, but the Panasonic \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; system is very, very impressive from the technological standpoint.  It uses water-based soap--unlike the Braun--whose solution contains alcohol.  Since I am allergic to alcohol, I prefer this system.  It runs like a dishwasher, filling twice from the tank, pumping the aqueous solution in and out without any spillage.  It is noisy, but it&#x27;s in the bathroom and the door can be closed.The drying phase can continue for up to three hours, but this does not use the razor&#x27;s motor, as suggested by some reviewers.  You can choose to charge the battery with each use, using a single button on the left, which cycles through the choices, indicated on the three green LEDs on the right.  You get better life out of the battery if you drain it to \\&quot;low\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t usually use the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; option.  The first left button push removes the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; LED option, and the process begins in about 15 seconds.  I clean my razor about every three days, but the cartridges last longer if you wash out the inside of the razor first.  A red LED below the green LEDs glows when the cartridge is defunct.  I bought 12 of them for $15 with the razor, and I have only used two so far.  It makes the razor \\&quot;smell better\\&quot; and I think it cuts best after cleaning.  I don&#x27;t know if it tends to dull the razor as some reviewers have claimed.      I like to shave with a safety razor every week or two, but I like shaving dry after a shower--although Braun suggests that you shave BEFORE you wash!  Electric shave lotion and after-shave lotion contain alcohol, so I don&#x27;t use them.  It&#x27;s easier to shave dry with your shirt on--or even your tie!  I didn&#x27;t think I would use the cleaning system, but after trying it, I am impressed.  I think it has more technology than the razor!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Remington, and is my first wet/dry shaver.  In the past I&#x27;ve also owned Braun and Norelco, and have found that foil shavers do a better job.  Initial impressions are that this is the best that I&#x27;ve owned.    Pros:  - The Wet/dry feature (which I&#x27;ve yet to try) provides the opportunity to use shaving lather, as well as the ability to clean the shaver without using the Hydraclean system (I do use the system).    - Hydraclean solutions are easier to use and appear to cost significantly less than solutions for Braun and Remington (purchased a 3-pack for under $7 and should last at least three months).    - The popup clipper is easy to clean.  As a comparison, the Remington clipper is configured as a slide and when hair or other residue get caught in the glides, it continually slides forward when shaving.  Very annoying!    - The power cord powering the cleaning base can be disconnected and connected directly to the shaver.  This is a very handy feature and is common with all shavers at this price point.    - The cleaning is much less noisy than the both the Braun and Remington.    - Cleaning features include cleaning only, charging only, cleaning and dry, and cleaning, drying, and charging.    - It looks sharp.  Having a quality product that looks nice is a double benefit.    Cons:  - The cleaning base has a medium footprint, but no larger than that of the Braun and Remington cleaning bases.    People have complained about shaver cuts.  I honestly have not experienced that with this shaver as of yet.  It is true that it takes time for skin to adjust to any electric shaver, but not 30 days as noted in the documentation.  My experience has been 1-2 weeks to adjust.  To continue, when excessive pressure is applied to the skin, the pressure can cause pulling of the skin, and lead to razor cuts (this has happened to me with other shavers).  The transition from my previous to this shaver has been seemless.  I am quite satisfied.    I purchased at Best Buy at a close out price of $71, rather than $100+.  With all of the features, I can give it nothing less than five stars.</li>
            <li> A good electric razor for a good price. A decently close shave and I like the self cleaning action.</li>
            <li> This shaver looked like a good one but it does not shave close enough.Every time I shave I have to shave with the trimmer to get a closer shave because the shaver does not shave longer hair.I was very disappointed with this product and I am in search of a better replacement.</li>
            <li> I have owned both the Braun and now the Panasonic razors with the automated cleaning device. Both razors work great for the first 366 days and then the cleaning device completely dies. The company won&#x27;t repair it and you are stuck shelling out another $300 for a whole new system, despite the fact that the razor still works great. These companies need to construct both the razor AND the cleaning device with the same quality. Otherwise, there were no complaints: close shave, no nicks, works well.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for about 45 years. In that time I have used most all brands. The one I have used most is the Remington. My last Remington was a microscreen ms2000. All my razors have been adquate at best, normally I would have to use a safety razor and \\&quot;dry shave\\&quot; my neck every two or three days because the electric razors would not shave close enough in that area. After about two hours of reviewing electric razors I decided on the Panasonic ES8077S. Keep in mind I was not looking for the best priced razor, I was looking for the best razor! Actually, the Panasonic was 30 to 50 percent less than the others in it class and in addition I received a $20.00 rebate. After using the razor the first time I realized this was the razor I had been looking for over the past 40 plus years. I have now only used the ES8077S for three (3) days but I have fallen in love with it. My face feels so smooth with such a close shave; also no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; at all! I can only think this will get better in the next two to three weeks as my face gets use to the new razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: Excellent close shave; no \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;; quite operation; Pivotal shaving head; easy cleaning procedure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS: The automatic cleaning cycle is loud and last for about 2 to 3 hours; the travel bag (marble bag) is a piece of crap (won&#x27;t hold shaver and cord also no protection for the razor); the cleaner charger has to sit someone in your bathroom, my other razors were stored in the drawer (this unit takes up some counter space). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: I am trying to be honest in this review so someone buying this will know my feelings about this product. The Pros on this razor far outway the Cons. It is an excellent razor and I would buy another one tommorrow if it was necessay.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this shaver after my old Norelco dead of old age. I was very hesitant to purchase a $100 shaver, but I&#x27;m sure glad I did. From the first shave there was absolutely no irritation. It&#x27;s smooth and cuts fine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this product as excellent product but its not for sensitive skin as you can still get razor burns. overall nicely designed product but try before you buy</li>
            <li> If you like shaving in the shower this is the electric razor for you. It does the job as advertised. The only thing I found not as good as my previous rotary electric is that it does not cut the long hairs very well. But it gives a good close shave otherwise.</li>
            <li> Used blades all my life and finally made the switch.  Easy to use, very little irritation. It doesn&#x27;t even take that long for your skin to get used to it. Love it!</li>
            <li> For that type of money I was expecting something better.  I find myself shawing the same part over and over again, even on the wet option.  However, if you have the patience and sensitive skin like me then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x60;t buy this here in Norway.. So I ordered it from the US. Never used shaving machine before. But gilette will not get much more money from me.. Good product. Quality all the way. Very happy. Only sad that Amazon used the biggest box with aired bags and the little machine in the corner of the box. That cost me $ 50 more than necessary due to volume.. But still cheaper than similar products in this corrupted country. :-)</li>
            <li> My aging father could no longer shave with a traditional blade and was very fustrated.  I bought him the Panasonic Vortex shaver and he&#x27;s just happy as a clam.  For someone used to a blade, this one really compares.</li>
            <li> This product is great....wet/dry, shaves my neck with very little irritation, and is not totally dependent on the self-cleaning base.  You can clean it yourself with soap and water if you wish to save on cleaning cartridges.  It is highly recommended, and is 100% better than my old rotary-style Norelco reflex action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years, since I sprouted stubble, natch, and I have never, ever, experience a closer or smoother shave. I didn&#x27;t know life was possible without red patches behind my jaw from scraping, or that a shaver head could adapt so well to changes in terrain, so to speak. &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is one for the family, as even my wife likes it. (No, weirdo, she doesn&#x27;t need it.) The cleaning system works, without reservation. By providing it the occasional inexpensive cleaning cartridge, I never have to mop whiskers out of the sink again. I actually need to distance myself a bit from this product, as I have taken to mentioning it at parties, and that&#x27;s a bit, um, odd. But it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The shaver shaves really well on the cheeks but neds multiple run throughs on the chin areas. Good battery life and nice grip on the shaver. panasonic could have given a better travel pouch for the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owed 3 Panasonic ES8092 razors in the past two years and now the ES8077S razor for the past six months. When they are working I love these razors for their close wet/dry shave. However, all three have failed to hold a charge for more than 5 minutes within six months of use. My latest ES8077S razor started exhibiting this behavior 2 weeks ago and now won&#x27;t even turn on at all despite repeated cleanings/chargings. The cleaning system is pretty much useless, despite having religiously replaced the cleaning module and tank with fresh water every 40 shaves. Rinsing my old EX8092 shavers with soap and water actually seemed to do a better job. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally given up on Panasonic&#x27;s defective high end shaver designs and their lousy service. I actually bought the ES8077S shaver as a replacement since it took Panasonic over 2 months to repair my last ES8092 shaver which promptly starting exhibiting the exact same lost-charge behavior within two months of finally receiving the replacement. The first time I sent my ES8092 razor in for repair/replacement, Panasonic sent me a much less-expensive reconditioned ES8066 as a replacement. It took a number of calls to get them to replace it with the same shaver I sent them. FYI, the less expensive ES8066 shaver, which I also already had, doesn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as either the ES8092 or ES8066 shavers, but at least I haven&#x27;t experienced the charging problems with it over the past 5 years. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the the ES8092 or ES8077S shavers are great if you can justify buying a new one every six months.</li>
            <li> I decided to try an electric shaver after many years of only using a blade due to razor burn problems with a couple old electrics I had year before.  After looking at all the reviews I could (yes, I&#x27;m one of those) I decided upon the Panasonic.  I have always been a fan of Panasonic products in the past, and they have never let me down.  This shaver was no exception.  After taking a while for my face to get used to it, it was shaving me as closely as my blade shavor.  I even got a couple nicks from it that bled!  (Don&#x27;t press too hard!)  I also have one of those necks where the whiskers grow in about 10 different directions.  This shaver handles it with only a couple changes in direction of the ergonmic handle and pivoting head.  The only razer burns I have gotten is when I have shaved too low on my neck, where there aren&#x27;t any whiskers anyway.  I love the option of cream or no cream.  I get the best shave using a thin layor of regular shave cream, but still have the option (when I&#x27;m in a hurry or camping, on the road, etc) of using a preshave lotion to cut down on any mess or if I don&#x27;t have any water available.  The battery has never been an issue.  I took it to a place where I didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to recharge it, shaved every day for 10 days, and still had about 1/2 a charge left when I came home.  I do use the cleaner which I feel does condition the blade and screen a little more than just rinsing it out, but you do have that option as well.  Buy this shavor!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 forever, I bought this product to shave a few minutes of my shaving time. And it does accomplish that. I shave in 3 minutes now instead of the 5 to 6 minutes it used to take me. It even shaves closer than the Mach3.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has one failing however - it CANNOT shave the neck hair. I got several nicks on my neck before giving up. I use the Mach3 on the neck.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great product, but not god-sent.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric shaver turned out to be a great gift for my husband.  He normally uses a badger brush, glycerin soap, and razor, but likes to have a more portable, quick alternative for traveling or for weekends when he doesn&#x27;t feel like the whole \\&quot;soap and brush\\&quot; routine.  This shaver is a great back-up, does a very close shave, has a trimmer for sideburns and neck, and works great both wet and dry. He loves it, which is the best part!  The shaver arrived in a speedy manner, too, just in time for Valentine&#x27;s Day!  No glitches.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic razor I have owned; I have been through several other brands and this is the smoothest and closest shave I have ever experienced with an electric. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. The ES8077S cuts through my wiskers easily, even with two days of growth, and with no skin irritation at all. I shave wet, with Gillette foam. In the past, I needed to use two diferent razors: one with enough power to cut the wiskers, and a second razor to finish off for a closer shave.  The panasonic does it all.    The features I like about this razor:    1. The high speed motor is very smooth and powerful. The two main blades appear to move in opposite directions, resulting in virtually no vibration. As an electrical engineer, I can tell that this razor does not use the usual battery driven motor, but incorporates a high frequency electronic drive system that gives full performance even as the battery starts to run down.    2. The razor requires only a very light pressure against my skin; this is quite different from my past razors and took me a couple of days to adapt to, but the result is no skin irritation at all!    3. The lithium-ion battery is great. After a week of shaving, the battery indicator still shows a \\&quot;high\\&quot; state of charge. This type of battery is more expensive, but will give full performance much longer than other battery types.     4. The charging/cleaning system is very simple to use. I use mine only once a week, simply rinsing the razor under the faucet on the other days. When I travel, I leave the cleaning system at home and just take the power cord for charging.    I was very pleased with the price and quick delivery from [...].</li>
            <li> The best electric razor I have used by far!!! Bought the top of the line Braun at the same time and have to say the Panasonic is far superior!  Not to say the Braun is not a good shaver just the Panasonic is noticibely superior! A little note both shavers have to be tried for a number of days in succession in order to make any comment. They both irritated my skin for a couple of days but after that the Panasonic definitely out preformed the Braun.  Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> Bought the Panasonic after owning several Braun shavers.  Last Braun was a model with the self-cleaning system; it had multiple breakdowns, including overflowing flammable cleaning solution all over our bathroom counter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has been working fine so far (about three months).  Its self-cleaning system is water-based, not alcohol as in the Braun.  The wet/dry option is great - I use wet except when in a rush or when only a touch up shave is needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rating is 4 stars instead of 5 because:  not that great at shaving stray long hairs; long term durability is not known yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using an older Braun for the past five years or so, and the poor motor one day decided no more. I was considering replacing it with a new Activator, but after reading a few reviews of the Panasonic decided it might be more to my liking, based almost solely on the fact it could be used in the shower or with shaving gel. I should also explain I do NOT like rotary style shavers (mainly for comfort) and regular blades ALWAYS cause massive razor burn, even those new 4-blade monsters. &lt;br /&gt;So to make a long story short, combined with some decent shaving gel and a couple of days practice, the Vortex not only shaves infinitely better than the old Braun, but as close as I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with a blade with NO irritation whatsoever. It also does its thing pretty quickly, usually only requiring a few passes to take off my bristle. Excellent! It also holds its charge for ages, is ergonomic and easy to handle and is not too terribly loud. &lt;br /&gt;My only gripes are the large and NOISY cleaning/charging base. It sounds as though it might be lifting off at any moment. Best to start that cycle as you&#x27;re on your way out the door in the morning, or at least while crunching on some corn flakes. As others have stated, the trimmer is next to useless, but a cheap-o beard trimmer does the job no problem. Finally, if I go a few days without shaving, it always leaves a few strays which require me to keep a few disposable razors handy.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used, and that list includes a number of Norelcos and Brauns.</li>
            <li> I had been using an old Norelco triple-header for years and decided to try a new one that would shave closer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does shave closer than my old one, but not in one stroke like some users have said.  I would hope it&#x27;s closer since my old one had been used for years and should have been duller. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It feels good in my hand...not too big or small.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The noise is no different than my old shaver, just the usual buzzing.  No problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is pretty slick.  After I shave I plug it in when I go to work and when I get home it looks great.  I take off the head to see how clean and I was happy to see there didn&#x27;t appear to be any stray whiskers in there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but at least in the short run it is performing nicely.</li>
            <li> razor works like a top end razor should.  cuts closely, rinses easily (soap and water), nice looking, keeps charge for a long time.  you can&#x27;t go wrong with this panasonic.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replace my Remington dry shaver.  The Remington would occasionally irritate the skin on my cheek raising bumps which would only get worse.  Since this happened during hot and sticky whether I figured a wet/dry shaver would work better and be less irritating. I bought Panasonic ES8077S hoping it would cut close and with less irritation.  Boy was I wrong!  If I let the shaver lightly glide over my skin it would leave so much beard that I had to go over the same spot 10 times from all angles and of course by the time I was done my face was blotchy and often bleeding.  It did work better on my smooth cheek but my neck looked like I had sun poisoning.  I tried the shaver for about three weeks because the directions said it would take up to 30 days to get used to it but after several comments on vacation from people about what happened to my face I gave up.  All that work trying to use this shaver and it never came as close as my old Remington.  I never got a complete shave especially on my neck.  This shaver was not worth the effort.  I might try another wet/dry but I&#x27;ll wait for my face to heal.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade, charge hangs in tough, easy to clean, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with electrics all my life, had a few norelcos and never noticed a big difference between them.    This is the first shaver I have had that genuinely shaves better - it is substantially smoother when I shave and a day later I am just beginning to get shadowy.    There are a few catches-  shaving well with this shaver takes longer, in my experience, than with other electrics, especially if you go wet.  it can nick your skin a little and draw a drop of blood once in a while, not too painful but not what I expected.  loud - noisy  I think the cleaning base is mostly a gimmick - cleans fine in the shower or sink with soap.    In summary, it is the \\&quot;power tool\\&quot; of shaving - a stronger, better shave with more noise, an occasional nick, and you need to be willing to spend time on it. I don&#x27;t think I will go back to another brand after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for over 30 years. I&#x27;ve used remington, norelco, braun but this is my first panasonic. My last two razors (for the past 10 years or so) have been rotary style models from Norelco and Remington. I&#x27;ve been generally happy with the quality and closeness of the shave I get from these models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, that having used the Panasonic 8077S Vortex for several weeks now, that this is by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down. It&#x27;s not even close! The panasonic foil system and high speed motors are loud. This is probably the only down side. My wife complained for the first week or so, and it scares our cat quite a bit. (she likes to hang in the bathroom during my morning routine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I have to say that the noise doesn&#x27;t bother me while using the razor at all. The closeness of the shave and the total lack or any irritation on my neck makes the noise a &#x27;non-issue&#x27;. I couldn&#x27;t believe that the first shave or two that I took with this razor were so close and I had no adjustment period required at all! My neck was smooth and there was no irritation even on the first day I used this machine. I have to say that this razor makes the rotary models from Norelco and Remington seem really lame in comparison. Both of these razors which I was relatively happy with, both irritated my neck almost every day and it would be worse on humid days. Shaving dry or wet with the 8077S gives me a very close, very smooth shave. I am able to shave in different directions to get ALL the whiskers. Basically, I love this thing! Go out and get one now!</li>
            <li> I would totally Recommend this product, its the best item for it&#x27;s price. Almost lives up to the Braun. The trimmer is mediocre but you get an amazing shave and you never need to trim really because youll love shaving so much youll want to shave everyday! (Unless you have a perminent beard, goatie, etc..)</li>
            <li> Like all other Panasonic products I own, this razor is of the utmost  quality.  It gives a smooth quality shave.  I suggest it to any  man that has been bothered with ingrown whiskers or left behind  stubble.  Dennis T. Bel Air, MD</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on electric razors and compared on paper the Norelco, Panasonic, and Braun.  My top criteria were closeness of shave and price, although I liked the fact that the Panasonic was a wet shaver as well.    I received the product quickly after purchasing on Amazon.  The price was very good since there was a $[...] Panasonic rebate offered at the time.   The razor works as described.  I use it with shaving cream and I get a fairly close shave, almost as close as the Gillette V mach fusion razor which I was using prior.  The only exception is the neck area, which I have to go over with the Gillete.      Overall this is an excellent razor and I have no regrets in the purchase.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000ALB1VQ Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean System]]    I was quite happy with my ES8077.  It gave a good shave; it could be used in the shower; and, it worked well with shaving gel for a really smooth shave without any skin irritation.  It was at least as good as the Norelco/Philips shaver that I had before in terms of shave closeness.  Unlike the Norelco shaver, it was easy to keep clean and still looks pretty new after 2 years of solid use.  I tried using the HydraClean Hygienic Cleaning System a couple of times, but it took up too much space on the counter around my sink and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything necessary, so I stopped using it after about a month and just rinsed the shaver off under the tap after every use, which seemed to work fine.  After two years of reliable service, my shaver stopped working suddenly last week.  Considering the cost of the shaver, it would have been nice if it had lasted at least one more year :(  Oh well, here I am now shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> Great product for men and women. I bought this product for my husband. He loves it. Long battery time. Easy to use. Close shave and works great on legs as well.</li>
            <li> I have uploaded several photos of the unit, including everything it came with.    I bought this as a replacement unit for my old Braun 5550, which after a few years of use has finally died.    I have yet to try to cleaning unit, but here is a breakdown of the time it should take to clean, according to the manual:  1) Charge - Approx 1 Hour  2) Clean/Dry/Charge - Approx 3 Hours  3) Clean/Dry - Approx 3 Hours  4) Dry/Charge - Approx 2 hrs 50 mins  5) Dry - Approx 2 hrs 50 mins    For most people, the lengthy cleaning time shouldn&#x27;t be much of a concern since if the battery is low, just plug it in after your shave, and it&#x27;ll be clean and ready for your next shave.    The manual recommends replacing the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; detergent cartridge every 30-40 days. They also include an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water; this would be convenient when on the road, so you don&#x27;t have to lug around the cleaning base!    Replacement Parts &amp; Accessories (Retail prices &amp; model # as indicated in insert):  1) Protective Cap (WES8044X7158): $0.62  2) Outer Foil (WES9085PC): $35.00  3) Inner Blades (WES9064PC): $21.95  4) Charging Adapter (WES8044K7658): $16.11  5) Self-Cleaning Recharger (WES8078H4218): $41.89  6) Detergent Cartridge 3-pack (WES035P): $9.99    Pros:  - The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.    - Wet/Dry: One of the main features that won me over. I decided to get this unit instead of the Braun Activator because of this feature. I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off. First thing I did when I received this unit was to try shaving after a shower -- worked perfectly.    - Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there. With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass. I&#x27;m impressed!    - Head Pivots:  The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.    - Battery life:  Right outof the box, I used the shaver for a month before it finally ran out of batteries.  I shave about once every other day, so seems like this could really last for those long trips!    Cons:  - After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated. However, I&#x27;m sure my skin may just need a little time to adjust.  (Edit:  My skin seems to have adjusted perfectly.  I would now give the product a perfect 5!)  - Came with a cheap travel bag.  - The cleaning/charging unit is fairly big.    ---    Some reviewers have mentioned the noise of the unit.  With any electric shaver, the noise is unavoidable.  I didn&#x27;t find the noise too annoying, though some of you may.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my three year old Panasonic ES8023. I found that my old ES8023 shaves as well as this one with the original three year old foil and blades. I even feel that the old shaver is more powerful. But I like the feature of pivoting shaving head and self-cleaning system in the new shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried Norelco before. I was very disappointed with the performance. Panasonic shavers shave very closely, and you can use it wet. The only problem I can think of is that it is a \\&quot;directional\\&quot; shaver. You have to glide the shaver against the growth of the hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend Panasonic linear shaver. If money is an issue, get a cheapest linear shaver you can find.</li>
            <li> I have an insanely tough beard and ridiculously sensitive skin.  Within 2 weeks this thing is cutting me as close as a mach 3 going against the grain.  Can&#x27;t feel a whisker on my face.  Sure the neck is tough.  They&#x27;ll probably never make an electric that can tackle the neck, but this thing actually does an acceptable job.  The best part is you still get the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; feeling cause you can use it wet.   &lt;br /&gt;     I would definitely consider getting the next model down, without the cleaning station.  Since you can rinse it under water, I can get the shaver just as clean as the stand can, and a lot faster.   &lt;br /&gt;    I&#x27;m telling you.  Don&#x27;t read anymore reviews.  This is the shaver you want.  Unreal.</li>
            <li> I purchased the panasonic Hydraclean ES 8078s a month ago. In that time, I have used it about 3x/week, for a total of about 12 times. I used it in the shower, I was left with hairs all over my neck every time. I tried different methods...nothing. I had to run it across my neck so many times that it would always get irritated. When enough was enough...I have a meeting at 8:30. I live 20 minutes from my office. I wake up at 7:00, get into the shower as usual. Start to shave...continue rubbing this thing systematically over my face...continue shaving...continue....run my hand across where i had just shaved...hair. I am in the shower for 15 minutes hoping that this thing had worked. I get out of the shower and my neck is totally beat up...I mean bloody. On top of that, IT WASN\\&quot;T SHAVED!!! I had to get out the foam and mach 3 and re-shave what I had spent the last 15-20 minutes shaving in the shower! So, I was late for my meeting and showed up with painful burns and cuts all over my face and neck. I have tried this thing dry...wet...everything; always wanting to give something that I spent over $100 on the benefit of the doubt...bottom line Do not waste your money or sacrifice your skin....grow a beard or try something else. &lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have used the Norelco triple blade for years with no problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m now sending it back. I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in those three weeks, and even though you&#x27;re supposed to use it for a month to see results, Amazon&#x27;s return policy leaves me no choice but to guess that another week won&#x27;t help that much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a very course beard, and at first this razor did a great job on my cheeks, it barely touches my chin, and does virtually nothing on my neck except cut me. With my Mach 3, I soak my beard in hot water for at least five minutes before shaving, and I did no different with this Panasonic. I&#x27;m not interested in shaving with this razor then going back over my whole face with an expensive Mach 3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take this with a grain of salt if your beard isn&#x27;t this thick (I have a permanent five o&#x27;clock shadow like Homer Simpson unfortunately), but keep my experience in mind if you do.</li>
            <li> I WAS USING A BRAUN SYNCHROFLEX BEFORE THIS SHAVER AND WHEN I TRIED TO FIND A BRAUN REPLACEMENT FOR A FAIR PRICE BUT COULDN&#x27;T I DECIDED TO TRY THE PANASONIC 8077. THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE EVER OWNED BEING THAT YOU CAN USE IT WET OR DRY. I HAVE TRIED THIS SHAVER BOTH WAYS AND IT PROVIDES A GREAT COMFORTABLE SHAVE EITHER WAY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER .</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor that I don&#x27;t have to go behind with a blade, The hydraclean system is great. Also gives a very good dry shave. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent wet/dry shaver.  I wish it had more power, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I shave my beard and head in the shower. This is much easier than shaving with a razor. The charge lasts a LONG time. Took my skin about two weeks to get used to it (you have to give it some time). The razor stays in my shower until the battery gets low, then I let it recharge overnight (although it recharges in an hour or so). Excellent product so far.</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, like all the top Panasonic shavers.  It cuts close, &lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and holds a charge for a couple of week&#x27;s worth &lt;br /&gt;of shaves.  The trimmer is small, but I don&#x27;t need a powerful trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;It feels good in my hand, and is easy to shave with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is easy without the cleaning unit base.  Just put a &lt;br /&gt;few dabs of hand soap on the head, spread it around, and turn it on. &lt;br /&gt;Then rinse everything off, and it&#x27;s in great shape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cleaning base is not really necessary. &lt;br /&gt;Unless one has trouble with the simple cleaning procedures, the base &lt;br /&gt;is a waste of money.  Save $20 and get the ES8043SC, looks like the &lt;br /&gt;same shaver without the other base.  Here&#x27;s the link to Amazon&#x27;s page: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009DT342/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hpc_1/002-9260792-2319221?%5Fencoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;v&#x3D;glance&amp;n&#x3D;3760901 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;P.S. - If anyone has the ES8043SC and wants to buy my base, &lt;br /&gt;e-mail me.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Remingtons, the Brauns...etc and none compare to the Panasonic.  I only wished I had read the reviews and gone with the Panasonic first.  It shaves quick and without a doubt it is the closest electric shave.  No skin irritation.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8077 cleaning system is the only one that does not use alcohol...so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate like the Braun and Remington cleaning systems.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8077 can also be cleaned manually using soap and water.  It is a wet/dry shaver so it works as well in the shower as out.  You can also use shaving cream with this shaver.  Absolutely amazing product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was initially a skeptic after reading the reviews...but I was wrong.  This shaver is all the others have said and more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On top of everything else, this Panasonic shaver is cheaper than the competitors in this space.   This shaver is worth every penny and then some. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste time with the others...order the Panasonic and treat yourself to a better shave.</li>
            <li> It simply is not worth the money.  I am sorry I bought it!  Les Saffil</li>
            <li> I have never had much success with electric razors. They irritate my skin, don&#x27;t produce a close shave, and leave stray hairs. After reading the good reviews and getting a great deal on this one for eighty dollars I decided to give it a thirty day trial &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The results: &lt;br /&gt;- It still leaves stray hairs that I have to touch up with a razor periodically, but leaves less that other models I have tried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Using it in the shower/wet reduces that abrasion to the skin and makes it tolerable to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep this one because, although still subpar compared to a razor, I can use it everyday. It is very uncomfortable for me to use a razor everyday. If it weren&#x27;t for the ability to use wet I would be sending this one back just like the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every way of shaving over the past 25+ years including a variety of foil and rotary electric razors.  Dry shaving with an electric never worked well for me - crappy shave and too much irritation.  Years ago I settled on shaving in the shower with just plain soap and a regular, simple twin blade pivoting cartridge razor (Atra).  I would have kept with that except that the local grocery store started playing inventory games and refused to stock the Atra cartridges I preferred (yeah I live in an area of limited consumer choices).  To this day I still don&#x27;t understand their rationale, but I figured it was a perfect time to take another look at electrics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After quite a bit of homework I settled on the Panasonic because of it&#x27;s ability to be used wet and essentially in the same fashion I had used the blade.  The Panasonic turns out to be much less irritating, just as fast and darned near as close.  I&#x27;m sold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can pass on the cleaning system since the razor is essentially pristine after use and a rinse in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after doing quite a bit of research.  While I previously used Braun nd Norelco, I had never used a Panasonic.  Needless to say, I am very happy with the purchase.  Shaves very close and I do not feel as if I have to use a razor to get a \\&quot;true\\&quot; shave.  Overall, I am very happy with the Panasonic and would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric shaver always a razor.  I envied the quick easy electric shave but never had any luck in the past.  Then I read all these \\&quot;Best thing since sliced bread\\&quot; reviews on this particular shaver and was persuaded to buy thanx to Amazon&#x27;s good return policy I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being saddled with a $100 shaver I didn&#x27;t like. &lt;br /&gt;It worked good enough on my face.  If it could have worked that well on my neck I probably would have kept it.  It couldn&#x27;t shave my neck at all.  Wet or dry I was stuck shaving for longer than I would have with a razor  to try to get it all and it never got it all.  Cool package and all the cleaning and charging stuff worked great it just wouldn&#x27;t shave my neck.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the ES8077s in March of 2006. I wanted to upgrade from my older Panasonic electric shaver, which still worked, but needed a new screen and cutter blade. My thought was that by spending just a bit more, I could have a new shaver that was self-cleaning, so off to Best Buy I went.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ES8077 gives a great shave, which is ninety percent of the battle when using any razor. I didn&#x27;t find the razor noise to be obnoxious. Insofar as the cleaning cycle is concerned--yes, it&#x27;s loud, but only for the first 15 minutes or so of the cycle (after that, the remainder of the 3 hour cleaning cycle is relatively quiet or even silent).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning unit does a perfect job of eliminating all the hair and residue from the razor (another reason I purchased this model...I really wanted the convenience).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, for the warning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I used the automatic cleaning unit exclusively from the time I bought the shaver in March, when I went on vacation in September it was time to switch to a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; cleaning mode. In this instance, because it&#x27;s not practical to take the cleaner/charger unit on the road, the instructions tell you to essentially rinse the screen and cutter components under a tap with soap, and then manually dry them. Which I did. Just like the directions told me. After all, the instructions point out that the unit is \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next time I activated the shaver, it ran for a few seconds and then quit. I stared at it in front of the mirror in bewilderment (which did not help). I turned the unit upside down, and water trickled from it. I flicked it several times. More water came out. And then the unit starting running normally again.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So much for being \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just decided from that point on to keep the shaver away from water, and everything was fine. But come March (after owning the shaver a little less than a year), the motor starting changing speeds randomly, slowing down, and pulling hair rather than cutting it. And there was a thin film of lubricant extruding from inside the motor housing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In another forum, I read about one other owner who had a horror story of returning the ES8077 to Panasonic, and waiting six weeks for a response. I&#x27;m happy to report that my situation turned out more favorably--I sent the shaver portion back via UPS with my original receipt (with a note that pointed out that the shaver was never waterproof). In about two weeks, they sent back a *complete* unit to me, including a new charger/base unit, which I never even expected, all for free.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the advice I&#x27;d pass along, which I followed myself: when you buy the shaver, test it by going through a manual cleaning procedure under the faucet. Find out if it seems to trap water in the housing, or otherwise ceases to run properly after having been exposed to water. In my case, there seems to be no trapped water escaping from the housing when I turn it upside down. And the shaver runs perfectly after rinsing it. Because this shaver *is* waterproof.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So buy it. But test it. That&#x27;s my advice.</li>
            <li> I finally bought the Panasonic ES 8077 Vortex after much research and comparing it to other brands like the Braun 360. here is my experience with it after 4 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is cheap compared to my previous shaver [Norelco rotary]. Shaving performance is good for daily shaves, the shave is reasonably close and comparable to the Norelco, maybe even better. However not as close as a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer gets wet when you wash the main razor which is irritating. Also when trimming longer hair, the main shaver foil gets stuck with debris - so I have started using the plastic cover for the main foil whenever i use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is easy and I can charge without using the base unit by just using the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is also easy - just use hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall charge lasts 10-12 days with daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a reliable product with no frills and some minor inconveniences. Nothing fancy to write home about. No wow factor.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband for fathers day and he loves it. He has only used it in the shower once but he uses it daily out of the shower. He hates to shave but has to shave for work nearly every day. He doesn&#x27;t have razor burn anymore and its so much quicker. But one warning, the &#x27;30 Day Test&#x27; is a must. Give the razor a few weeks before you stop using it. The first few times he used the shaver, he had razor burn and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable. After a few weeks, his skin has gotten use to it and it works great now.</li>
            <li> Well it is expensive and I am not impressed by the cleaning system.  But I have used several dry and wet-dry shavers from Panasonic and Norelco over the years.  This is the first razor or electric shaver I have ever used of any kind that does not irritate my skin.  I am very happy with the shave quality.  It gives a close shave without irritation in the throat area and has no trouble cutting anywhere.  It also does not miss like some razors.  I have used it anywhere from three days to 1/2 day of growth with no problem with missing or irritation.</li>
            <li> very good product ,you are not going to get result like a razer but it is very close .so far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this razor whether it&#x27;s a dry shave or wet shave.  It certainly cuts closer than my old razor.  The cleaning station is a bit of a gimmick though.  Since you can get the razor wet, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean on your own.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on one with a cleaning station.  The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode is pretty worthless too.  For some reason, when the battery gets low, it switches to \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode instead of slowing down or dying.  That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me but anyway the razor works great wet or dry and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razer for my husband for christmas. I was worried because he has very sensitive skin and after shaving with electric or regular razer he usually gets red rashes which hurt. He started to use the razer and it took him couple weeks to get used to it. However now he is very happy with it and can shave as often as he needs to without having rashes. As many others says cleaning process is kind of loud, but it doesnt bother us since my husband shaves usually right before he leaves the house :)</li>
            <li> Works great! Haven&#x27;t used an electic since my old Norelco. Many moons ago. I just never really got a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave from the old electics, but Panasonic seems to have solved the problems. This is quick without the mess. You can shave anywhere any time. I get a good close shave, so say the ladies, and no nicks. No toilet paper to stop the bleeding. The hydraclean system works great and it charges quickly. Great value from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect... last years I used other razor and was bad experience. But this razor is excellent. Sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace a Norelco circular three cutter wheel electric razor I had for over 10 years.  It is the best electric razor I have used by far.  However, as good as it is it still does not give as close a shave as a good standard razor.  It is easy to clean the old fashioned way and I haven&#x27;t tried the plug in base cleaning method.  To be fair to the shaver, I am semi-retired and I only shave about twice a week.  Overall, if you want a quick fairly close shave with a minimum of pulling and irritation, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this razor after reading about it on this and other sites.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t give a very good shave when dry.  Works fine wet, but I find that to be a pain.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with razors with three pivoting heads, and I&#x27;ll have to get one of those next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blade man but I needed an electric while recovering from shoulder surgery on my good arm.    I will also use the razor when traveling since this is simpler for me.    I liked this razor a lot.  Pretty good shave for an electric.  I&#x27;d never swith to an electric permanantly but this is a nice option.    What I like:    Good shave but takes some time.  Holds charge for a long time.  Nice trimmer (I will use this even when I go back to my blade).  Easy to clean.  Works well wet or dry (but not damp).    What I don&#x27;t like:    Not too loud but high pitched.  Kind of big and clunky.  Takes a while to get a really close shave.    All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li> the guy at bloomingdales said it was no good for shaving your head.  it has been terrific.  makes life so much easier than when i was using a mach 3.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work.  I hate shaving.  Razor burn, cuts, and all that.  I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning.  The reviews looked good so I gave it a shot for a couple weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks.  As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave.  It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair.  For whatever reason if you had a stray hair left on the neck it couldn&#x27;t seem to get it no matter how many passes I&#x27;d try.  Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior.  This very well might be the best electric razor out there but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I was getting a decent shave with it until about the sixth month, when the cleaning system broke and repeatedly leaked its cleaning fluid into the receptacle that the shaver sits in.  The result would be that I was forced to shave with a soapy wet shaver head slick with the cleaning solution, which is definitely not what I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a little bit of the foil broke.  Rather than invest in a new foil and try to debug the problem with the cleaning system, I&#x27;m going to find a new shaver to try.</li>
            <li> Anyone have any idea of the item number on Amazon?  Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the &#x27;receiver&#x27; is very satisfied with the shaver/cleaner.  Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I got this thing it was great.... very quiet and worked well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1 accidental 2 foot drop and the razor became incredibly loud from there on out.  So loud it hurt my ears to shave.  2 months later it is dead as a doornail... won&#x27;t even turn on.  The battery is fine, but the razor is shot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaner base does a great job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All things considered, this could have been a wonderful razor if it hadn&#x27;t broken over a very minor jolt.</li>
            <li> Whiskers that don&#x27;t make it into the slots for slicing can be cut later with the pop-up trimmer. Next day, they go right in with all the other whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it wet and dry. It likes a little talcum powder when using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner-drier-charger works very well. And, if you don&#x27;t want to travel with that apparatus, you can use liquid hand soap to clean up and air dry it.  The charger plug goes right into the razor body if you don&#x27;t have the cleaner device with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I parked a perfectly good Norelco floating head razor that had relatively new heads but still didn&#x27;t cut well.  Glad I parked it.</li>
            <li> I just shaved with my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver System and wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed it. I did a little research because I was never \\&quot;an electric shaver guy\\&quot; and I found out quite a bit. First you have to start with a clean face, this is important! Next, because this shaver can be used wet or dry I applied a small amount of shaving cream, and this must be the foamy type not the gel, and covered the area I wanted to shave. Then I took my new Panasonic ES8077S Vortex HydraClean Electric Shaver and began to shave. Slowly and deliberately holding the shaver at 90 deg. to the face, as is recommended in the owners manual, and not using to much pressure against the face. Well let me tell you .........  I have never, and I mean NEVER gotten a better shave, quick, close, clean, no nicks or cuts or blood and thoroughly enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I was very apprehensive about just how good a shave I would get from an electric razor. I was very impressed with this razor, and would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve used it after a three day growth, and was amazed with the performance.</li>
            <li> My sister asked me to buy this for her husband for their anniversary. So it would be a surprise for him. He really liked it but it took a few times to get used to it since he used a razor before. But now he really likes it alot. He even can use it in the shower. I one day will probably buy my husband one soon. Great razor. Just don&#x27;t order this razor from the site i-kitchen they will send you some junky razor from the 90s and then MAYBE refund half of your money. I did this and wished i went with Amazon sooner.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077S is also sold in some stores as the Panasonic ES8075.    Never bought a wet/dry electric. Have had several Braun dry electric razors that I liked very much. Unfortunately, replacing worn out parts is as costly as just buying a new one. I decided to do a little homework, just to see what else is available, and this Panasonic had overall exceptional reviews. The cost was over half off what a comparable Braun was, but I still didn&#x27;t buy into this using an electric to wet shave. Just didn&#x27;t seem as though it would work, so I went into my first shave hesitant. The Panasonic glides across the skin, and with the cream on my face I didn&#x27;t think it was working. I continued to shave, and as the cream was removed I could definitely tell I was getting a close shave. When I wiped my face clean it looked almost as good as a blade shave. I have very thick, coarse facial hair and I unfortunately get razor burn or ingrown hairs when I use a blade. This razor left my face feeling smooth with no burn, and to this point, not a single ingrown hair. Some say the self cleaning system is noisy. So what! It&#x27;s in the bathroom. How much time are you going to be in there for it to be an irritation? Plus, you can just turn it on as you head out for work. It does a complete cleaning in less than 30 minutes. The cleaning cycle does a great job and the razor feels brand new each time I shave. You can also rinse the razor with hot water before cleaning and the solution will last much longer. I still like Braun, and none of the razors ever failed on me, they just wore out from use(blades dulled, foil wore out, etc..). So, if this razor can stand the test of time it will be one I continue to buy. It cost so much less and seems quality built. You should at least give it a look. I spent $65.00. Wish I had bought 2, to have the extra in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco 3 head electric razors for 20 years. This Panasonic is so much better! As I enter my 40s, my beard is turning grey and getting tougher. I always knew the Norelco was not as close as a blade, but it was so much faster, I never gave up the electric. But with my beard getting more course, I have been even more unhappy than ever with the Norelco. So I decided to give the panasonic a try. I have never been happier. As close as a razor, and just as quick as an electric. Best of all worlds!</li>
            <li> I have tried several times to switch from shaving with a standard razor to an electric.  Every other time I have been disappointed.  Not this time, however.  The panasonic delivers a nice shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face even close to as bad as the other electric shavers I have tried, specially if I shave in the shower.  I don&#x27;t think it shaves quite as close as a blade in the tough areas, but it&#x27;s not significant.  The auto clean is a nice feature as well.  That was another big turn off to my previous electrics. &lt;br /&gt;It has a nice feel in my hand and the pivoting head action is nice. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.  No more buying blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an electric shaver user. I always used blades and was always in search for the best one. The problem with my skin is that I can&#x27;t shave more often than once in four days otherwise my face will become a mess. I have a very thick facial hair with hairs on my neck growing almost parallel to the skin. After reading reviews for this shaving system I decided to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;This razor exceeded my expectations. It shaves clean and very gentle. To my surprise I was done shaving in less than 4 minutes and didn&#x27;t have any irritation on my neck. The angled blades of this shaver really do seem to work. Truly I didn&#x27;t expect such performance from an electric shaver. Now, it won&#x27;t cut as close as a blade but I&#x27;ll take it as a trade off for the absence of irritation and the better shaving experience.  &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base also comes very handy although I don&#x27;t find myself using cleaning feature very often. I just rinse the shaver under the faucet, snap it in the base and select the drying cycle.   &lt;br /&gt;The design of the unit is in my opinion the best on the market of electric shavers. It feels great in the hand and the pivoting head will follow the contour of your face precisely. &lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver - you won&#x27;t be disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Like the wet feature and it charges well (long batterly lifetime).  The holder/washer device is a little large and unwieldy for my sink and the device has some problems with the curve of my chin, but overall, am satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8077S Vortex vs. the Braun 8595 Activator: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is a good razor, but the Panasonic is better by a two-star margin. I bought the Braun first and was somewhat disappointed -- more friction and more effort to get a good result than I expected from a top-price razor. I then bought the Panasonic and returned the Braun without hesitation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a wet/dry shaver; the Braun is dry only. The Panasonic takes about half the time for a complete shave, wet or dry, as it does not require innumerable passes to get a smooth result; two is fine -- three if you&#x27;re meticulous. The Panasonic shaver costs less. The Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridges cost less. The Panasonic is lighter and therefore less fatiguing to grip. As soon as I tried the Panasonic, I knew the Braun was going back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution does make the shaver smell like Froot Loops if you&#x27;re into aroma therapy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both manufacturers offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, by the way, which I don&#x27;t think is mentioned in Amazon&#x27;s descriptions. (Not knowing this, I had almost been ready to pay more at Costco.com just for the returnability but decided to take a chance.)</li>
            <li> My husband loves the flexibility that it has. It gives extra smooth result. He also says that with the sensitive skin of his (he had a beard for 10+ years), it shaves very well in wet-mode with the gel. &lt;br /&gt;He have not tried the cleaning block yet. &lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is not required for charging. You can plug the shaver in directly to the outlet with the cord. So if you travel, you don&#x27;t need to take this big cleaning block with you.</li>
            <li> I have had this Panasonic Shaver for about 2 months now.  I pretty much use it everywhere EXCEPT my face.  And if you follow the directions correctly and allow your hair and skin to get used to the changover from regular razor to electric shaver you will love this shaver.  The unit feels like a really quality unit!  I am a quality kind of guy.  I look for quality over price most all of the time.  Especially since I am going to be shaving some private areas.   &lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last forever!!  And the cleaning unit is really nice also.  I hope to get many good years from this unit.  Bottom line.....Worth the money 100%</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews here.    One thing apparently not stated is you fill a water tank with water and clean it every time you change the cartridge.  The Braun does not require this...you just change the cartridge.    This unit gives a superior shave for me, however.    I would note that the cleaning cycle really does take 3 hours...and the unit runs the entire time.  How long can it last doing this every day?    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    Addendum    1.    Someone mentioned the instructions.  I have a Pana. Plasma TV and the instructions are written in the same MISERABLE way as the shaver.  Someone needs to replace the team working on documentation, because it is really awful.  They give you a bunch of complex-numbered figures (13b 13c 2a, 6), then write the text in a stream-of-conciousness block refering back to those figures multi-pages before..  It is really terrible.    2.    This shaver does a really mediocre job on the neck area.  The good news is that the long hair trimmer works well here and does not irritate the skin.  I yearn for someone to really figure out a shaver that can handle all areas of the face!</li>
            <li> You would think by some of the reviews that they are salesman for Panasonic. I must say that you are not going to get as close of a shave as you would with a quality disposable razor. And I stress \\&quot;A Quality Razor.\\&quot; There are some plus columns for the Panasonic that include: &lt;br /&gt;1. Can dry shave any time without the burn or redness. &lt;br /&gt;2. Quick and easy to pick up and have a quality clean shave within minutes. &lt;br /&gt;3. Can shave in the shower, but you have to apply thin amounts of cream. &lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I know now. If I had not have gotten such a great deal on the Panasonic, I would not have purchased it. I am not saying it is not a good product. I am just saying that, \\&quot;With a quality disposable razor, you can get a closer shave.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been a long time blade shaver - most recently with the Mach3.  I thought I would give this electric a try because of the ability to shave wet.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 wks now, so here are my general thoughts.  Positives: Very nice design - its very lightweight and comfortable; great to be able to use it like a manual razor - wet with shaving creme; no razor burn, or irritation.  Negatives:  The it&#x27;s high pitched whine is a bit annoying first thing in the morning; elaborate cleaning system probably unnecessary (just rince with tap water).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now for the bottom line: does it shave as close as a blade?  The answer for me is no.  Today, I tried shaving one side with the Mach3 and the other with the Panasonic.  It was close, but the razor clearly shaved closer with less visible stubble.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is I went over the Panasonic side with a 10 yr. old Norelco rotary (seldom used) and it was able to catch those left-over hairs below the surface! Afterward, there was almost no difference with the razor side.  I guess the foil razor is just not as good for me.  I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Mach3, or perhaps try a newer Norelco with wet shave ability.</li>
            <li> As the title implies, I tried the Norelco for a few weeks.  I am now returning it, after having tried the Panasonic just two times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco (7775x) was quite wimpy.  It took between 10 and 15 minutes to get a close shave - way too long for a wet shaver.  The Nivea lotion packs were a joke.  Completely useless and the pump didn&#x27;t work reliably.  Furthermore, the trimmer was not built-in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic... &lt;br /&gt;While the cleaning system is pretty much a gimmick - not totally necessary but nice to have - both the razor and the cleaning system are quite loud. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you can handle the noise, it&#x27;s worth it.  The shaver does an excellent job, providing a closer shave than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  The shave was almost identical in closeness to that delievered by the Mach 3 Power (arguably the finest razor).  Surprisingly, I did get a couple of nicks with the Panasonic.  Maybe it was because I used hand soap instead of lather. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am completely sold on this shaver - it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> This is my first real experience with a quality electric shaver as I&#x27;ve been more inclined to use a manual razor.  I think it does a strong overall job but the directions are a bit confusing.  There also has to be a better way of throughly cleaning the unit inbetween cartridge changings.  Close and clean shave and would suggest buying some extra cartridges, they last a month a piece.</li>
            <li> Obviously, you can always clean it yourself, but throwing down the extra $15 every three months is well worth it.  I thought I&#x27;d try to rinse it off each time on my own and use the brush which came with the razor.  I did that for about three months.  It never got totally clean.  I figured that to be normal whether I cleaned it or I used the cleaning system.  I thought I&#x27;d give the cleaning system another try and it cleaned the razor like new!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All this to say, make sure you use the cartridge system it tells you to!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, the whole issue some users have with sensitive skin is mentioned in the user&#x27;s guide.  If you&#x27;re transitioning from disposable blades, expect some irritation.  However, it does leave after several uses.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product overall.</li>
            <li> OK, I was really skeptical to buy an electric shaver. I have been shaving with a razor for 28 years and never tried anything else. I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry based on the fact that  I can continue to use my Jack Black Beard Lube if I liked. This shaver was the greatest. I tried all different methods with my Panasonic re; beard lube, dry, Williams Lectric Shave, shaving cream and Afta. All methods will give you an \\&quot;as close\\&quot; shave compared to ANY razor. The only downfall if shaving with any method except with a cream/lube, you will not experience that refreshing feeling you get with shaving with a razor. If you want to know the trick I used to shave under the chin and neckline and get a great shave just try to shave the way your beard grows. Mine grows sideways(in that area only) and with the linear head the shaver works superb with no skin irritation at all. If you follow the instructions and shave with a 90 degree angle you will go over that area many times before your beard disappears. &lt;br /&gt;  The cleaner system, in my honest opinion, is a waste of money except if you are lazy and not want to clean the shaver manually which is a piece of cake to use.I tried it and liked it but will clean my shaver manually and use the cleaner about once per week. &lt;br /&gt;   I highly recommend this  shaver. You will not be sorry if you decide to make the purchase</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Shaves very close but does not irritate my skin. I was a blade shaver for the past 25 years and the older I get, the more it seems that blade shaving caused irritation, especially on my neck. Tried all sorts of different blades and creams, but none worked all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried an electric. I first tried a Remington MS5200. A very nice shaver - well built, easy to use, many other plusses. However, it still gave me some irritation in the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up was a Norelco 7110X. Also a nice shaver, but even more irritating than the Remington in some spots. But a good choice if you skip a few days between shaves -- rotary shavers as a whole do a much better job over heavy growth than a foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried the Panasonic. Absolutly perfect! It shaves very well dry, and does an even better job wet. Only use a very little shave cream or just some hot water for best results. Clean-up is simple even without the Hydraclean system. Yes, the system is easy to use and does a good job, but you can do an equally good job with just some running water and Remington Shaver Saver spray (that stuff is great for cleaning and lubing the shaver -- makes your blades and foils last longer and work better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with the Panasonic is the huge number of models they offer, many of which are identical other than for some minor differences such as color. Their absolute top of the line shaver has a convex head which some people say is a wee bit better than this model with the standard head. Others say the difference is not at all meaningful. I went for this model since it was quite a bit cheaper than the convex head models (and the replacement heads are cheaper as well), but still gives a great shave. One downside of the convex head is that if you press too hard, you can get some irritation according to some reviews I read. Lower models may or may not have the linear motor (it&#x27;s a big plus - get it) or the 13,000 RPM speed (another big plus you want in a shaver). The cleaning station is not all that important. It works well, but it&#x27;s not necessary to have to keep your shaver in good condition. But, like most guys, I like my toys, so I got one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also looked at the Braun models and the Braun 360 is also a good shaver. Bit more expensive, but the Braun cleaning station is much faster than the Panasonic. The downside is that you HAVE to use the cleaning station -- you can&#x27;t run a Braun 360 under water to clean it like you can the Panasonic. If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning station for the Braun, your only other choice is to use the cleaning brush they include with the shaver, which is a real pain. The Braun cleaning refills are also a bit more money than the Panasonic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, there are a lot of great shavers out there. This model of Panasonic is one of the better ones, and should be on the short list of anyone who is looking for a foil shaver.13,000 RPM speed (another big plus you want in a shaver).

            <li> I bought this item for my husband and he loves it. Its faster and easier then any regular one.</li>
            <li> Having had a panasonic for several years, I wanted to update it to a new model.  I am very glad I did, the wet shave is superior to my old one.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier. &lt;br /&gt;The whole purchase process was great also. Not having done much on the internet, I was apprehensive, but am very satisfied.  The shaver arrived at my home as promised and started using it the next morning. &lt;br /&gt;very happy shaver!</li>
            <li> The ES8077S not only lives up to its promises regarding the cleaning &amp; drying of the unit, but,gives the best shave I have had in a long time.  The closeness of the shave is better than a blade and no cuts or nicks.  I have tried to make the razor fail by not following the directions and it still performed as it should.  This unit is well worth the price, it is the first electric razor that I have owned that lives up to and even surpassess the claims made by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with the Panasonic shaver. It is very comfortable, quiet,and shaves very closely. I also like the cleaning/drying/charging station.</li>
            <li> After using a Norelco rotary razor for years, I decided to give this style of razor a try.  It works just fine.  Not as close as a blade but plenty close.  This type of foil razor takes some adjustment as it is easy to burn your skin when you are first adjusting to it.  Takes several weeks to adjust to it.  It take longer to shave with the back and forth motions and the need to change directions on your face to get a close shave.  The circular motions you use with a rotary razor seem to be more efficient.  The cleaning system works very well but is somewhat loud and takes several hours to clean and dry.  Not really a problem for me as I am not around while the razor is going through the cleaning cycle.  All in all the Panasonic ES8077S is a very good deal for the money and I would make the purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shaver. The shave is close and smooth, and it is very easy to keep clean. You don&#x27;t need the hydraclean system to to keep it clean on a daily basis. I prefer to follow the quick clean tips that come with the shaver and use the hydraclean every 60 days. I prefer the dry shaving, but the wet option is nice to have. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun shaver with this Panasonic based on a recomendation.  This shaver is much better and gives me a much closer shave.  It holds a charge about ten days for me and is quieter than my previous shaver.  The trimmer is on the back of the shaver and although it could be a bit wider it works very well.  This Panasonic shaver is a great unit.</li>
            <li> the panasonic es8077s is the best shaver i have ever owned, love the wet&amp;dry .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned mostly rotary shavers over the years and been pleased with them. However, after several weeks it was apparent to me that this one gives a much smoother feeling shave. I used it with shaving creme for the first few months but have since used it dry, cleaning it and charging it in the station every few days.   They say to change the blades every year but I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 1-1/2 years and it is still shaving excellent.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I SHAVE MY HEAD WITH THIS MACHINE AND ITS SOOOOOOOO SMOOTH. I USE TO USE A MACH 3 RAZOR AND THIS WET DRY SHAVER KILLS THAT RAZOR. MY SKIN IS SMOOTHER I GOT SENSITIVE SKIN AND I NEVER BREAK OUT ANYMORE. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER SHAVER. THANK U PANASONIC</li>
            <li> I have only used the shaver for a few weeks - nothing but good experience so far. I have been pleased with both the wet shaves and the dry ones. Dry is quicker and neater, wet is smoother and closer. The cleaning and recharging is easy but I had to get used to the cleaning taking a few hours.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver some 20+ years ago for roughly $10.  After my fourth Panasonic gave out after 5 years (it didn&#x27;t help that a hotel maid knocked it on the floor and broke it), I decided that since the cheaper Panasonics gave a great shave, the more expensive ones should give an outstanding shave.  Not quite.    The problem with this shaver is the three-blade design which makes the head too wide.  It doesn&#x27;t follow facial contours like the one or two blade Panasonics, which means that it doesn&#x27;t really shave as close.  On the sides of my face, the shave closeness WAS outstanding.  The pivoting head would seem to be a plus, but that feature is unneeded complexity (see below).  I would break it down like this:    Pros: *wet/dry capability (wet is strongly recommended, and is the main reason to consider a Panasonic in the first place). Close shave (though not as close as other Panasonic models)  *Linear motor (shaver runs at a constant speed until the battery runs dead, unlike non-Linear models which get gradually slower with each use. *Battery power indicator. *Cleaning/charging base. *Lithium-ion batteries. *Close shave.    Cons: *Shave is not as close as lesser-expensive Panasonics. *Cleaning cartridges for the base unit are hard to find in stores. *Pivoting head (not a necessary feature in my opinion). *Not an OUTSTANDING shave.     I had this shaver for almost two years (daily use), at which point it developed a water leak, no doubt due to the added complexity of the pivoting head, and the motor shorted out. My previous Panasonic shavers lasted 4-5 years, so I expected nothing less than 4 years out of this one. Ultimately, rather than shipping it to Panasonic for repair/replacement (at my cost), I purchased a cheaper Panasonic two-blade shaver.  I STRONGLY recommend the Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but not this model. Now if Panasonic would just put a Linear motor in one of their single or double-blade models...</li>
            <li> I do not buy new shavers very often so when my old Norelco started wearing down I did a lot of research. Saw lots of good reviews for this Panasonic and decided to give it a try. I have had it about a month now and I absolutely love it! It gives a very close shave without irritating my sensitive skin. For best results I use it with shaving foam but still get good results dry. I have not used the cleaner much because it is easy to rinse off when I&#x27;m done so I should not need to use much of the cleaning fluid. Bottom line, this is a great shaver for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for nearly a year now, originally because after a three-month layoff from shaving while studying for the bar exam, I found that I was getting cut up every day before work.  I&#x27;d stopped using my previous dry-only rotary electric and switched back to a blade because my skin was getting irritated.  The Panasonic rarely causes that problem, unless I&#x27;m careless about running it too long and hard over the same patch of beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave feels as close as with a fresh razor, particularly if I use it while my skin is warm and wet from the shower.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that I can feel my stubble more at the end of the  day than with a blade.  In terms of ease of use, it&#x27;s a push--this is cleaner, since it doesn&#x27;t need shaving cream, but it takes longer to get shaved than with a blade, because many patches of my beard require multiple passes (you have to get a feel for the various directions of grain on your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat with the cleaning process: if the water and the cleaning solution cartridge aren&#x27;t fresh, the razor can be quite smelly when you go to use it the next morning.  Aside from occasional smell issues, however, it gets the razor clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were it not for the cuts, I&#x27;d prefer using a blade.  This has been the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve received from an electric.  It takes a little longer to shave with this model, but far more effective than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> HAVING NEVER OWNED AN ELECTRIC RAZOR, I WAS SKEPTICAL BUT NEEDED SOMETHING TO SHAVE MY HEAD CLEAN.  MUCH TO MY AMAZEMENT, THIS RAZOR MORE THAN DOES THE JOB.  IT REALLY IS OUTSTANDING RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.  I SEE NO NEED FOR THE CLEANING RESEVOIR AS THE RAZOR ITSELF CLEANS SO EASILY WITH A LITTLE SOAP AND HOT WATER. THE PRODUCT IS OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale back around Christmas 2005.  I had mostly been using blades (Sensor Excel or Gillette Disposable) for the prior 5 or six years.  I have to say I&#x27;ve been really happy with the Panasonic after using it daily for over four years.  A number of things stand out, though.    1) even though I had planned to take advantage of the wet shaving option, I seem to get a better and less irritating shave by using it dry so I&#x27;ve been using it only that way for the last four years.    2) Second, skip the fancy cleaning system.  I just use liquid soap and warm water to clean mine (following the directions for manual cleaning in the instructions).    3) the Norelco frequently irritated my skin, even after the \\&quot;electric shaver break-in period\\&quot; for my face.  I expected a similar experience when switching to the Panasonic, but I&#x27;ve had basically no irritation issues since day one.  That may be partly related to keeping the blades clean, though.  4) I&#x27;m still using my original blades.  Another benefit of keeping them clean, I think.  I was using a disposable per week (avg $1/shaver).  By this time, the Panasonic has paid for itself multiple times.  I may break down and buy new foil/blades at some point, but not until it stops shaving as well as it does (close, minimal if any irritation).  6) It&#x27;s a lot louder than my old Norelco 955RX.  7) Neck whiskers take multiple passes, far more than the Norelco.  8) It charges fast and can be used for about a week on a single charge.  Sometimes I think about getting something different (due to #6 and #7), but so far I haven&#x27;t seen anything that will make me spend the money to replace the Panasonic.    UPDATE 07/15/2010:  Finally broke down and bought the replacement blade set through Amazon.  These were just as expected, authentic Panasonic, and they did improve the shave somewhat.  Sadly, about a month or so after receiving the new blades, the head of my razor fell off (shades of Dumb and Dumber).  Evidently, the little plasticcatches that held the head onto the part of the razor with the motor wore down.  Note that I&#x27;m not referring to the foil part of the blade falling out, but the part the foil clicks into.</li>
            <li> i am using these wet and dry panasonic razors since 10 years because it is the only system that fits my skin. But i must say i had to  change them a little more than every year. i thought that buying the most expensive one i would have a longer usage... no</li>
            <li> before i get into my review of this shaver, i am compelled to give a little background of my skin type and the problems ive had with shaving.  i&#x27;m a 25 yr old white guy with medium beard thickness.  i have sensitive skin that is prone to bumps and ingrown hairs if i shave too close.  i have tried many aftershave products and none has completely eliminated the problem.  for years, ive been using the gillette mach III razor(and before that the sensor excel), but due to the sensitivity of my skin, i have been limited to shaving in the downward direction.  this method has never given me a very close shave.  a few months ago, i got fed up with having a 5:00 shadow at noon and decided to try an electric shaver.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i figured it would be worth it to buy the top of the line shaver.  most of them have what i consider \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; features, such as the cleaning base unit, travel plugs, and cases.  these are nice, but not very important to me.  i want a razor that gives a nice shave all over (face and neck), doesn&#x27;t hurt during the process, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red and dried out when im done.  i have also read some complaints of a shaver and/or the base being loud, but while some are louder than others, none are going to wake up the neighbors.  when reading my review of the 3 shavers i tried, keep in mind that a shaver that has these three qualities makes me happier than one with a cool base and a travel kit.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;anyway, lately Braun has been flooding the airwaves with ads for the new Braun Activator, so i figured i should give it a shot.  at first, i was very happy with the Activator.  it has a strong motor and when i applied it to my 2 day beard growth, it mowed right through.  i did have trouble around my neck, as the Braun just wouldn&#x27;t cut the rather long hairs there.  i went over the area quite a few times, which left my neck red and with a couple of nicks.  i ended up having to use a regular razor just to clean up the spots along my neck that it wouldn&#x27;t cut.  i also noticed that after a few days, it left my face chaffed.  it had a nice trimmer on it and for those who care, the cleaning base was actually kind of nice and it did indeed make the shaver feel just like new after each shave, but i would have gladly sacrificed that for a better neck area shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;so i tried Braun&#x27;s chief competitor, Norelco.  again, i went for the high end model, the SoftTouch.  my first impression of the SoftTouch was of its rather weak motor.  it just didn&#x27;t feel very powerful to me, but to my surprise it shaved a teensy bit closer than the Activator and it was much more successful around my neck.  after a few shaves with it, however, i noticed some problems.  first, if i skipped shaving for a day, i had to use a blade because the SoftTouch just couldn&#x27;t do it efficiently.  i&#x27;d spend 10 minutes shaving with it and i&#x27;d still have hairs that it just hadn&#x27;t cut.  no good.  secondly, it pulled.  i don&#x27;t feel i was moving it over my skin too quickly, but even after just one days growth, i felt the little blades tugging on some of the hairs.  i actually started shaving slower out of fear of that very uncomfortable tug.  it too seemed to have some trouble around my neck.  while better than the Activator, it actually cut the hair on my neck, however it also left some nicks.  the trimmer is equally weak and i had to work at it to get a nice even line on my sideburns.  also, for some reason, it isn&#x27;t very good at using it to get the stray whisker.  sometimes, it just doesn&#x27;t cut that pesky hair even though you are holding it right up to it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;so after using it for a month (they ask you to try it 21 days), i sent it back.  i did not buy the one with the cleaning unit, but it wasn&#x27;t hard to clean at all.  and i liked how it told you when it was dirty and when it needed new blades (though, obviously i didn&#x27;t have it long enough to see them in action).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;lo and behold, i was perturbed by the results my little test.  then i remembered that i had owned a Panasonic shaver back in high school.  it was very simple by today&#x27;s standards, but i never had a problem with it.  so i figured i should check out what Panasonic had to offer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i bought the ES8077S Vortex with high hopes.  at $129 on amazon, it was cheaper than the other two i had already bought and returned.  i have only owned it for a week now, but i already know that this is the shaver for me.  so let me rave about it a little bit.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the Vortex, like the Activator, has a powerful motor.  it cut through my beard without any problem and left me with a softer, smoother shave than either of the others.  it shaves my face nice and smooth with absolutely no pulling.  and also important, i don&#x27;t feel dry and chaffed afterwards.  in fact, i can apply aftershave, right after using the shaver and only experience a very minimum sting, less eventhan a regular blade.  i can&#x27;t say the same about the other two shavers.  the Braun, in particular, really left my face burning when i applied aftershave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;around my neck area, the Vortex isn&#x27;t perfect.  i have a hard time getting some of the hairs, but it does a much better job than the Activator and even after going over it a few times, the Vortex doesn&#x27;t nick or leave my skin raw.  and if i flip up the trimmer, i can easily clean up what it misses, again with no pain or irritation.  the trimmer is powerful and has no difficulty with stray hairs.  it is also safe to drag it across your skin without worrying about nicks or cuts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;so the Vortex is far and away the best of the 3 shavers in my opinion and this is without even using one of its key features.  the Vortex is a wet/dry shaver, whereas the Activator and SoftTouch can not be used wet.  i am getting the closest, most comfortable shave with it and i haven&#x27;t even used it with water yet.  this means that i can get an even closer shave if i use it with gel/shaving cream.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a cleaning base, which works nicely.  if i had to offer one criticism of the Vortex, i guess i&#x27;d say it is not as quiet as the SoftTouch, but with its more powerful motor, i would gladly sacrifice the quietness for a good shave and no pulling.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;all in all, if you are going to spend over $100 on an electric shaver, check out the Panasonic line first.  i think it blows away all the other guys, which is suprising.  i hope you found this helpful.  sorry for writing this much, but i wish i had a review like this when i was shopping for shavers.</li>
            <li> I was using wet shavers for a long time because dry shavers did not really do a good job and my skin didn&#x27;t like it either. This one is different, it handles my thin beard hair better and the dry/wet capability helps my skin, too. The cleaning is awsome! I love it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have never had a self-cleaning wet/dry razor before and am really enjoying this one. I have owned Panasonic wet/dry razors for several years and this one is the best yet. It shaves closer than other Panasonic that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I had tried Braun which was $150 but the shave was not fast enough. Also, in neck area, Barun was not doing such a great job  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic does excellent job to clean neck area and it is quick and close shave. I have had it for 3 months now and I have no problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Side burn trimmer does not work so well on Panasonic though but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Slipped from my hand in shower.  Now the head swivel mechanism is broken.  Even before, had to use razor for neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for many years. They always took forever to do a marginal job. This razor is way better than the Braun. Shaves twice as good in half the time.</li>
            <li> I have used them all, starting out with a Sunbeam then a Ronson, Norelco, Remington, Braun and many other brand names I have long since forgotten. Each time I thought that THIS ONE was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had that was not done with shaving foam and a safety razor. However, after having using this Panasonic unit which I have never attempted to use to &#x27;wet-shave,&#x27; and probably won&#x27;t, I was convinced that I got a better shave from it than ANY other brand shavers. The ONLY problem I found is that it does not do a real good job along the neck line area below the chin. Naturally, NO electric shaver will do as well as and yield as close a shave as shaving foam and a safety razor. I guess it all depends upon each individual&#x27;s preferences and what you can expect from electric shaving units.</li>
            <li> The shaver is better than my old norelco 82xx serie.  However, you have to train your face to the new shaver for at least 1 week (I got several cuts).  The wash system is worthless, it is a wet/dry shaver, i would just rinse it under running water.  Overall shaving is better but i didn&#x27;t find it save me any time.  I did found if i use this shaver first then finish off with my old norelco, I can get the best close shave ever!  This maybe due to the different shaving motion of the two systems.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers since they were called \\&quot;Smooth Operators.\\&quot;  This one is the best - mainly because of the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this electric razor. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months, and it&#x27;s smoother than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It can be easily cleaned, too, without all the folderol of the hydraclean system (which I have yet to use). In the package are directions for easily cleaning it -- just put some liquid detergent on the cutting head, run it until the detergent foams up, remove cutting head and rinse it along with the razor. Very quick and easy, and -- so far -- it&#x27;s given me a great shave.</li>
            <li> Although doing the neck takes a while to master, the face, cheeks, chin, under the nose all are so easy and perfect!    I prefer to take my shaves in the shower.. then I don&#x27;t have to make a mess around the sink. I just use normal soap to lather my face and my fingers of my left hand to guide what I do.    I don&#x27;t have a fancy beard to cut around, or I couldn&#x27;t get away with that.    I too had the 8092 \\&quot;which I finally gave up to my son\\&quot; and then I got the 8095 and finally the foil died \\&quot;even after religious rinsing afteruse\\&quot; soap scum finally got the best of it. Since it was time anyway for a blade change  \\&quot;cost about 22.00 and the foil was another 35.00\\&quot;, so I used it as an excuse to upgrade.  It was very difficult to find one locally and everything I found online said \\&quot;not in stores, online only\\&quot;.. anyway, I found one at Best Buy..Kudos to them!    I usually consider Panasonic  upgrades \\&quot;gimmicks\\&quot; since many times they appear to be the same razor with the same features with a different model number.    But the main reason I bought the 8077 was the cleaning station which I knew should keep it pristine and was very similiar to the \\&quot;Braun 8160 XLCC\\&quot;  I had just bought but immediately took back once I read the manual and figured out it wasn&#x27;t a wet/dry... actually I had to call thier tech line from the manual.... seems they don&#x27;t put that info on the box or even in thier manual. I don&#x27;t intend to use the cleaning station every single day, but I know it will make an obvious difference.  Another gripe is they didn&#x27;t have LiIon batteries... another thing they didn&#x27;t advertise.   Panasonic pays a little more and puts in superior LiIon batteries.    If your gonna have a docking station and actually use it, its nice to be able to put the shaver in and charge your batteries without fear of developing memory.  The competitors manual stated \\&quot;not\\&quot; to keep topping off the battery, but to let it run down and then recharge.. something you don&#x27;t have to worry about  with the Panasonic. When are those guys gonna quit trying to save a few bucks and give the customer a decent battery? yes, NiCad and NiMh are very good batteries in \\&quot;controlled\\&quot; circumstances.. but not good for real life like LiIon. LiIon are much lighter too!    Also..there are no flimsy parts that feel like they may fly off if you shake it hard, like some of the rotary razors out there!    However, I&#x27;m amazed the full cleaning process takes a whole 3 hours \\&quot;I&#x27;m sure its quite thorough!\\&quot; for a 5 minute shave!..   I\\&quot;m concerned the cleaning station may go out far before the razor, just due to runtime. It has a little fan and makes funny little noises for quite a while. The full process takes 3 hours to clean and dry.     But I&#x27;m sure it will remove the soap scum issue in the future and maintain superior cutting performance so I bought it.      Anyway, the Panasonic 8077S surprised the heck out of me!    I&#x27;m aware that a new shaver has new blades and so comparing with the old one will always seem better.  But this razor uses the same blades as my old one, and I\\&quot;ve changed blades on my old one before and this sure seems better without a doubt. It even has a much quieter sound than the other one ever had.  You almost think something is wrong with it, its so quiet!  I do think the foil has better technology to grab flat hairs etc.    This thing is fast and totally cleans as good as a razor.  I use soap for lubrication and gentle pressure.    Let the razor do its job.. don&#x27;t try to force it! If you ever feel you need to apply alot of pressure, your angle is wrong. With a long flat linear surface, thats easy to do until your used to it.  If you keep applying pressure, you keep repeating your mistakes and never learn.. kinda like a bad driver!    If you press TOO hard with an electric razor, you will cut the hairs too far \\&quot;underneath\\&quot; the skin line and when the hair attempts to regrow, if it doesn&#x27;t find the exact same hole it had before, it jams and becomes in ingrown hair. So easy does it, is better.  Since I never see that explaination anywhere.. I threw that in for free!    Anyway, you can totally forget about cuts and knicks with this baby!.. you can even run it over your lips!... this is smoother and cleaner than the model I owned before.    I really think its closer than a razor just using soap in the shower!    The only part of the equation that is not as easy as a razor is the crevace of the neck and the adams apple, that takes a few days or weeks to master.    Seems I do it best if I quit thinking in \\&quot;shaving mode\\&quot; and act like I&#x27;m someone else shaving my neck.. \\&quot;Does that make sense?\\&quot;    The brains proprioceptive abilities are not perfect, its better to think objectively and get out of the box .. almost as if your shaving someone else.  You will find that the angles you use will be different as you follow the coutours of your face and use your \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; in the tricky spots on the neck rather than your minds eye.    Anyway.. it works for me.    In all fairness, I admit I have never used a rotary shaver and was contemplating trying just because of the adams apple thing, but the salesman talked me out of the \\&quot;more expensive rotary\\&quot; because he actually owned the Braun 360 before and like his Panasonic better, and it was an older model than the 8077!    What gives?..... I did!</li>
            <li> Wow.  I bought this electric razor on a whim....I was tired of having irritated skin after razor shaving each day, and though I had less than favorable results with electric razors in the past I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I am totally impressed!  The great thing about the product is that when you shave wet (with shaving lotion) there is NO irritation and the shave is SUPER close (really closer than I EVER got with a razor).  Using it doesn&#x27;t really take much getting used to (as suggested by some reviews and even the package insert)...I was getting close shaves and no irritation or missed areas right out of the box.  And no cleaning with this razor--the charging station does it for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take a chance and try this razor out:   &lt;br /&gt;-Closest shaves possable EVERY DAY. &lt;br /&gt;-No skin irritation &lt;br /&gt;-Wet shaves/shaving cream/lotion just like razors &lt;br /&gt;-Less total cost (when compared to a years suply of Mach 3 or comp. razors &lt;br /&gt;-REALLY convenient (easy to touch up the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) &lt;br /&gt;-Self cleaning stand</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco for over 15 years until I purchased the Panasonic ES8077S.  The Panasonic gives a much closer shave.  So far it has exceeded my expectations.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 1 year to see if it held up and it did.  It still delivers a very close shave and the base has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I have had several Panasonic wet / dry shavers before and this one is the best one so far. I use it as a wet shaver and it is a pleasure to use. The cleaner works well also.</li>
            <li> Does a nice quick job. Had it for less than a month no problems. Takes about 1/2 of the time of my old shaver. Hav&#x27;t had to use the side trimmer yet . :)</li>
            <li> The razor is a beaut, smooth and close shave everytime. I personally think the cleaning system is overkill. So far I have rinsed off the shaver under running water and it has stayed clean. I&#x27;ve yet to even use the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and it is just fantastic. Easy to use, cleans itself and shaves nice with or without lotion.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shaver to replace a Norelco one that just did not shave as good as I liked.  This one worked much better.  I do have to make several passes to get a close shave, but I like the results. I specially like that It can be used dry or wet.  The hydraclean system is a little bulky and very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be better shavers these days, but I think this is a good deal for the money (I got it for about $70)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 electric shavers, 2 Brauns and 2 Panasonics.  The Panasonics are superior to the Brauns.  I got my first Panasonic in 1995 and it still works well.  This is my second Panasonic shaver. Most of the reviews are accurate, the ES8077S gives a quick clean shave, and it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of electric razors (Norelco, Remington, Braun) and have never found one that shaves closer than this one. It is as close to a blade shave as you can get with an electric razor. I used blade razors for quite a while, but found that my skin got irritated quite often. They are also a bit messy to use when you travel. The Braun did well for while, but after a short time, became VERY noisy. The Panasonic is very quiet, gives a close shave and is very easy to use. The only (very small) downside is that it takes about three hours to go through the clean and dry cycle. Other than that, I am very pleased with the razor and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 245 reviews?  Well then, I will make mine short.  This is the very first electric shaver I have used that shaves as close as a blade (Gillete Mach x). I really did not believe it was possible for an electric to shave me this close.  For medical reasons, I had to stop using a blade, and the old Braun shaver I owned just gave me raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic I have only used for two weeks now, and with the wet shave feature, I get it done in about 5 minutes, and as close as a double or triple edged razor.  Obviously, everyone&#x27;s experience will vary. I have difficult facial hair.  Curly hair.  Every previous electric shaver that I have ever tried (Norelco, Braun) would not give me a close shave on the neck area, under my chin and jaws.  This Panasonic is the first electric I have used that is satisfactory.  And without making my skin raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet made use of the cleaning station. This review only applies to the shaver itself. Highly recommended for those men who have difficult beards and are looking for an electric that just might do the job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t shave while plugged in.  This is a big fail if your battery runs out in the middle of shaving.  The cleaning station is a waste of money.  Shaver works well if it has a full charge.  Starts to pull out the hair if the battery drops below half unless you have a brand new inner blade.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have had to use a blade to shave, because my tough, gnarly, Croatian beard was too much for most electric shavers.  When I got this one for an early Christmas present I was skeptical.  I was very surprised at the results.  It did not bog down, and was able to handle wildly different growth directions.  As the instructions say, it did take me ~ 30 days to get get my face used to it, but never at any time did it hurt to use (many other shavers I have tried felt like there were 1000 angry gnomes in the shaver using tweezers on my beard).  I even gave it the ultimate test, and let my beard grow for 4 days before I shaved it.  While it did take more time to shave, never once did this shaver get upset.  I have tried it in the shower, and I do not think that it shaves as good as on a dry face, but I think that is just a result of my technique.  The cleaning cartridges do not last me 30 days, however.  With daily shaving and cleaning, I get ~ 21 days before they need to be changed.  One note about the cleaning cycle.  For the first 5 min, it can be quite loud, but don&#x27;t worry that doesn&#x27;t last long.  Finally, my skin has not looked as healthy.  I think it was getting torn up by the blade and this is more gentle.</li>
            <li> You get a nice shave with this product... wet or dry. Easy to use, charge and clean. You cannot go wrong with this product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> works just terrific, my friend gave me as a gift - which was a great selection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for a few weeks now and it gives me a great shave.  I do not have the heaviest of beards and could almost go ever other day for a shave.  I had been using an older Panasonic for quite some time.  This razor gives me a much closer shave than my previous.  Some ingrown hairs in the begining but that is starting to disappear.  The cleaning system is a nice touch.  I have used it once a week and it keeps everything nice and fresh.  The razor feels very comfortable in my hand.  Good product!</li>
            <li> The shaver works pretty well for me and I have thick facial hair.  I get a close shave every time for the first few months, however, I do notice after about 6 months of use the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close anymore.  Probably due to the foils being worn.  The manufacturer suggests replacing the outer foil after 1 year and and the inner after 2 years.  I would give a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t break on me after exactly 13 months of use.  The warranty period is 1 year!  I would expect a $130 (price I paid on Jan 15, 2006 at Amazon) shaver to last longer than 13 months.  I will try to see if Panasonic will still honor the warranty considering it is just 1 month over the warranty period.</li>
            <li> Have previously shaved with a Mach III Blade, but my face is too sensitive to shave daily - generally shave every third day, and even still ended up with irritation. After years of this I decided to try an electric shaver and chose this model based on reviews and Amazon.com&#x27;s \\&quot;Gold\\&quot; recommendation (top tier shaver!) I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and have been able to shave every day with no irritation! Die-hard blade shavers will tell you that there&#x27;s no closer shave than a blade, and that&#x27;s certainly true, but this gets pretty close. For me, being able to shave daily makes all the difference. The cleaning feature is very nice, too. Light-weight, easy to handle, and much quieter than I expected. I was nervous when I made the purchase, knowing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it if it didn&#x27;t work out, but I am very happy I took the chance.    UPDATE as of July 2010 - So this shaver gave out, totally dead, a little over three years after purchase. As consumers it seems that we are being conditioned to not expect anything to last anymore. Growing up I think my dad had the same electric razor for over a decade. Probably didn&#x27;t pay $100+ for it either! I decided that rather than replacing it with another pricey Panasonic, I would try out a (relatively) cheap Norelco ($44) and so far have been happy with it. If it dies after a few years I won&#x27;t feel quite as bummed. Plus I&#x27;m not going to be spending on cleaning cartridges every few months, so that&#x27;s even more money saved.</li>
            <li> It did not matter if I used a blade or a remington shaver I always become irritated by shaving which no post cream would help.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, just received this panasonic and am getting the best shave of my life with no irritation. I am a happy person who does not have to go around with red cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> Probably the best electric shaver out there and pretty cheap for the amazing quality it provides....more than money&#x27;s worth. Thanks to all the reviews i chose this and am greatful to have read the reviews. Great piece.</li>
            <li> This shaver&#x27;s dry shaving is good. But its wet shaving is very problematic. Though the manufacturer claims it&#x27;s wet/dry, the blade and screen is not well designed for wet work. When using foam in shaving, the skin becomes more sensative and tender, which requires the blade to be sharp as a real razor. Panasonic certainly cannot meet this. Though they claim the inner blade is the sharpest 30 degree blade up to date, the more useful two outer blades are still 90 degree. The holes on the screen are also too big for wet shaving, though they are OK for dry work. Because of these design flaws, after applying foam in a wet shaving, more sensitive skin goes into the holes and is scanned by blunt blades. The result is terrible-- the shaver peeled off a very thin layer from my side cheek skin and caused a large area of irritation. Now, my cheeks are full of scars. &lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic one is not ready to be a good wet shaving product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;     It&#x27;s a good product, but i think can be moore cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is my second shaving system. I bought initially Norelco dry shaver . With Norelco it is very hard to shave the neck hair and under the chin, with Norelco it takes several passes to shave the neck hair. But Panasonic is very good , Nice linear shaver. I got the closest shave ever. I am very happy with the product. Cleaning is a breeze. With Norelco cleaning is tough.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My husband thinks this shaver is excellent and is enjoying it more than his previous one because of its cleaning system.  The only problem we had was that the instructions sent with the shaver were inadequate/difficult for initial usage.  However, after we called Panasonic and asked detailed questions about using it and were guided through it by a representative, it became easy to use.</li>
            <li> After using several other brands, the Panasonic Vortex Hdyraclean System has delivered, by far, the closest and cleanest shave I have received from any electric shaver. The wet/dry feature allows the ability to shave in the shower for a smoother finish. The Hydraclean System does an excellent job of cleaning and preserving the blades for extended use. I like the fact that I can shave over tough areas several times without razor burn. Deciding which electric shaver to purchase can be an overwhelming task when comparing the different features of each brand. Especially if you have never used an electic shaver before. The Panasonic linear shaver is a safe choice and I do not believe you can purchase a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Switched over from a Braun shaver. This shaver, in terms of actually shaving, probably give me a closer shave than the Braun (but it could be because it is brand new). Battery charges lasts over a week, so it can easily be taken out of town without the charger. The real beauty in this machine is the cleaning mechanism. You can use the Vortex Hydraclean system, which does a great job of cleaning out the shaver. All the little hair particles are gone, and the blades actually shine like new. The best part is you dont even need to use the Vortex system, because the cleaning cartridges can get expensive. You can use just regular soap and water. I use hand soap, pump once into the blades, Turn on the shaver, and the soap starts to lather. Then while the shaver is still on, run water over it. And this works just as good, and there are instructions how to do this, in the box. All in all a excellent shaver. Also comes with carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and reading the reviews on here, I decided to purchase this model to replace a Braun I have had for many years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life between charges has been quite long.  The shaver does get nearly as close (but not as close) as a razor.  It is incredibly comfortable and my face did not need any time to adjust to the shaver.  The ability to shave with shaving cream is a great feature, is more comfortable than dry, and far more comfortable than a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I can not get a clean shave near the adam&#x27;s apple area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not used the cleaning system; I just rinse the shaver parts under water and it&#x27;s fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price offered by Amazon for this shaver is among the lowest I found, and the free super saver shipping made it the lowest price over all.  I expected free shipping to be rather slow, but to my surprise it arrived in two days!  Amazon gets my future business for this kind of service.</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s a very interesting product, it isn&#x27;t heavy, but some kind of large, the shave is very close to other tradicional shaves (the blades). BUT to get the best shave do you have to learn how move this raizor, because on the contrary you will some areas with no shave. Take care about it, if you learn how to move, the right pression.. it&#x27;s very good shaver.</li>
            <li> According to my husband: This razor does a good job. However, if you only shave once a week (yes, some guys only shave once a week) it doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas - so far he loves it but it is still early to really know. I read good reviews on it and have promising hopes for it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.  It cuts clean and close.  It is a little bulkier than the Panasonic razor that I had before, but it is just as good.  Excellent price and purchase I feel</li>
            <li> Pros:  Long battery life, easy to clean by rinsing with water.  Cons:  Idiotic handle and pivot design, takes a very long time to shave, difficult to shave several areas, can tear up the skin, no lock button.    This shaver is not as good as most people here seem to think.  Coming from several Brauns, this is a step down.    The handle and pivot design are extremely inappropriate to an electric shaver.  An electric shaver is NOT a razor, and shouldn&#x27;t have the handle of one - this handle makes it hard to maneuver around the face.  The side-to-side pivoting of the head is not very useful.  In an electric shaver, fore-and-aft pivoting is what contributes to a quick, close shave, and this shaver lacks it.    To get a close shave with this thing, you need to go back and forth 5-10 times over the same area from different directions.  It&#x27;s even worse when shaving wet - I would recommend staying with dry shaving.  Areas under the chin, around the adam&#x27;s apple, and at the back of the jaw are extremely difficult to shave with this shaver.  If you lather up, you will likely bleed in these areas if trying to get a close shave.  Again, stay with dry shaving - it&#x27;s easier on the skin.    The charging / cleaning base is a little gimmicky and noisy, but I do like the dry-only feature - dries the shaver after rinsing.  And that is a good feature - cleaning is very easy.  Pop off the foil, rinse under water, and that&#x27;s it!  I only use the cleaning cartridge once a week.    I have used this shaver for over a month, and the battery life is excellent.  You can go longer than a week before recharging.  And long battery life comes in handy with this shaver, because it takes a long time to shave - up to 10 minutes versus 3-4 minutes with my old Braun.    I plan on continuing to use this shaver for a couple of years, but I&#x27;m going back to Braun when it&#x27;s time to replace it.</li>
            <li> First, let it be known that I am VERY critical of \\&quot;things\\&quot; and more prone to negative reviews. This is an extremely POSITIVE review by a MANY year Braun and razor user. This is the key, Braun AND razor .... I&#x27;ve always had to still use a razor to \\&quot;get it all\\&quot; even with the best of BRAUN&#x27;s. This DOES shave as close, closer, than a razor. Perhaps it will vary with the person&#x27;s beard, but I inherited a pretty tough, varied, beard from my dad - PLAINLY, it works on all the different tough, long, whatever you got! I do expect it to perhaps loose a little of its efficiency over time, but wow, unbelieveable. I&#x27;m not even really using the cleaning part of it .... just wash and shake! At $100 bucks it&#x27;s a great deal and a lot better than Braun&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; crap that costs over $200 plus (and uses a Panasonic motor by the way). I almost bought into the latest and greatest of Brauns&#x27;, but kept reading and comparing ...... NO comparison. Oh yah, and the $100 turned to only $70 with Amazon&#x27;s special discount ...... almost ordered one or two more ...... just &#x27;cuz!  TRY IT ...... YOU&#x27;LL through your other one away, including your razor in a second!    UPDATE after 3 years .....  Couldn&#x27;t believe it has been 3 years since purchasing this. Blades are still going strong and close, though do notice a little bit of having to go over some stubborn areas. But then, I&#x27;ve always had a tough face and this shaver is still excelling.  I NEVER use the \\&quot;stupid\\&quot; stand though. The cleaning part \\&quot;went dry\\&quot; quickly and it generally wanted to always go through the cleaning cycle when you put it on the stand. I believe there&#x27;s a switch to have just charge, but it has been so long ...... just takes up a bunch of room. They should just sell this without the stand, but of course they want to make more money by having you buy new cleaning cartridges! Just reduce the cost of the shaver by a few bucks and get rid of the stand!    Anyway, still highly recommended, after 3 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 50 years and the majority of time have used  an electric shaver.  I shaved with a blade with lather during my military time, but have shaved with an electric shaver ever since.  Since using the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean system for the past month, I am greatly amazed at its performance.  I never imagined a shaver that would shave as close as a blade with much more comfort.  With all the features of the system, its smoothness and speed, I will never shave with anything else again.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job and is easy to clean. The trimmer is a problem as its position and angle make it somewhat awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I really had appreciated the reviews when I was looking to purchase a new razor, and now that I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic for a month, I thought I&#x27;d stop in and return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco rotary that was probably 10 years old and rarely used it because it pulled and did an average job. I was really tired of paying for the expensive &#x27;quad&#x27; razor blades as they keep jacking up the prices, so I thought I&#x27;d buy a nicer-quality electric with hopes of doing away with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I&#x27;m sticking with using this electric and don&#x27;t miss the razor at all. It&#x27;s a faster shave and you can use it wet/dry if you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s not as perfectly close as a blade on my beard area, but for the speed and savings, I&#x27;m happy. I am learning tips to make it work better on my neck, so it&#x27;s almost perfect, even on those tricky spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;I only do the cleaning once every 3 or 4 shaves, so it will last quite a while and the 3 packs from Amazon aren&#x27;t too expensive. I don&#x27;t have heavy stubble, but even waiting a few shaves like I do, the cleaning goes fine. There&#x27;s nothing annoying about the clean cycle, it&#x27;s pretty quiet. You&#x27;ll just want to clear a spot near an outlet and leave it there, since the unit ends up filled with water. The plug is a relatively chunky one, so plan that in if you have a tight outlet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Quality:&lt;br /&gt;On the visible areas (and vital kissing areas  ;-)  it&#x27;s just as close as my blade.  Since I skip a day shaving often, I was worried it would pull more on those days, but it&#x27;s really fantastic on longer-stubble days with no added discomfort, so viva la scruffy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge:&lt;br /&gt;I only charge when I clean (every 3-4 shaves) and never run low or even off of the top charge tier, so it&#x27;s low stress and would be great on even a long trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smaller flip-up trimmer that does an OK job for a quick touch up... nothing has amazed me with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that info helps someone else. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of &#x27;Panasonic&#x27; for a good razor, so I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got... I feel I got a great level of shaver for about as cheap as it gets. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on the over $200 units!&#x27; for a good razor, so I really appreciate the good reviews this unit got...

            <li> About a year ago my old Panasonic bit the dust and I was faced with needing a new shaver. Because I was disinterested in having a big black box sitting on the sink all the time (the fancy cleaning system), I bought a Braun shaver. What a mistake! It runs so slowly that shaving took twice as long, and its screen irritated my face. I finally bought this Panasonic and when I opened the package I discovered I could just skip using the cleaner and charge it by simply plugging it into the transformer. The shaver is great, running at a high speed (they say 13,000 reciprocations per second) so that every stroke actually cuts beard. To clean it, I simply open the head and rinse with water and occasionally run it briefly with liquid hand soap rubbed on the screen and the head stays clean and fresh. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver has been extensively reviewed already and I don&#x27;t have much more to add, except to say that I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I endorse it without reservation.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to purchase it. They had it on sale @ Circuit City, but here at Amazon it was a better deal. My first initial thought was this razor seems kind of light. The plastic on it fells really frail. Well after using it for 2 days, I accidentally dropped it. On impact the head broke. I will return it for a refund and get a better brand. I still have my Braun 7680 that I bought 4 yrs ago. This razor was suppose to be the replacement. I will cut to the chase and just buy a newer Braun model.</li>
            <li> I started out shaving using blades.  Close shaves, but I&#x27;d end up cutting myself on bumps.  The closer I&#x27;d shave, the more I&#x27;d pay the price in break-outs the next day.  Then I switched to a Braun Syncro 7526 electric, and that helped a lot.  When the battery started to die in that one, I decided to try this razor instead.  So all my comments here are in comparison to the Braun 7526    The good:  - The battery lasts a very long time.  I&#x27;ve gone two weeks on a single charge, and I&#x27;m sure I could have gone longer.  - The triple blade really works.  It&#x27;s not just three of the same thing.  The middle blade cuts the longer hairs and the regular foil blades subsequently shave them normally.  - It shaves tricky areas like the neck much better than the Braun.  - I can shave as long or as close as I like and I have yet to experience skin irritation that same day or the next.  - Better grip than the Braun.  - Easy cleaning by rinsing under a faucet.  - It provides a close shave.    The (trivial) bad:  - The foil seems to have more drag than the Braun.  Not sure if it&#x27;s just the different design or what, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide as smoothly as the Braun.  - The plastic foil protector never seems to click right on the first time.    Conclusion:   Get this razor!   The hydraclean part is probably a bit of an overkill, though.  I&#x27;ve not actually found the need to use it yet.  With the Braun, the cleaning station really did help because you could only use the brush on the razor itself.  But with this razor, you can rinse the heads under water.  So if it&#x27;s possible to get this same razor without the cleaning system, that&#x27;d probably be a better buy.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father.  He is absolutely thrilled about the product and tells me it works just as great for a dry shave or wet shave and has no problems when submerging the razor in the shower.  Thinks it&#x27;s a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing other than Norelco razers, but decided to try a different approach.  This razer was highly rated so I decided to take the plunge.  Is it really better than my Norelco?  I really can&#x27;t tell, but regardless of which razer I use, I&#x27;ve got to touch up with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is -- don&#x27;t expect a real clean shave unless you&#x27;ve got a baby-face beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it shaves your face close and cleans its self thats awesome enough for me</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product, based on the reviews. But, I was extremely disappointed in its performance.     Here is what I experienced with this razor:  x Did not cut evenly  x Did not cut all my facial hair on first or, sometimes, second pass  x As a result, often took longer than using a hand-held (regular) razor blade  x Messy storage device that&#x27;s not easy to clean  x Expensive cleaning cartridges    Pros:   Held a charge for a long time   Did like trimmer device   Looks nice    I ended up going back to my hand-held razor and may get another Philips/Norelco, as I&#x27;ve personally had better experiences with those.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Still using it after 6 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year; it replaced a trusty Remington that lasted about 10 years.  The cleaning phase is a bit loud and at three hours, pretty long.  Annoying, yes, but what&#x27;s worse is that the cleaning liquid now pools where I stick the shaver after I put it through the full clean/dry mode.  It started doing this within the last few months.  I pull out the shaver and water pours out and I get a wet messy shave when I didn&#x27;t want one.  It does go away if I give it a dry cycle at this point, but then the cleaning level reduces noticeably and I&#x27;m compelled to add more water.  At this point I prefer to wash it myself by putting hand-soap on the blades and running it, as it instructs in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an okay job on my face.  My previous remington (also the oscillating blade style) did about the same.  If you let the hairs get long you&#x27;ll find yourself using the edge trimmer to get the stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise?  Save your money and get a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning base station.  It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever. My boyfriend has the most sensitive skin of anyone i have ever met and wouls only use a triple bladed brand new razor everytime he shaved( throwing it away for a new blade each time to make sure it was sharp enough). he wasted a lot of money this way and still could only shave every couple of days because even that irritated his skin and had red bumps along with stubble.     I reviewed a ton of products and this came up the best for being versitile and the best shaver on the market. he now can shave evryday and looks much more professional. He has NO RAZOR BURN, and no tugging like some of the rotary shavers do, and is much happier. he even dry shaves with it usually, which takes less time, but it does work very well with shave cream.     The self cleaner is alittle noisy, but is only a problem for us because he works graveyard so it cleans itself at 11pm. if it was used in the morning i cant imagine it being a problem. Also the loud sound only lasts about 10-15 minutes of the 3 hour cleaning cycle, then it becomes a very soft purr sound. It also the self cleaner works very well and is a great added bonus.     if you want a great razor get this one!</li>
            <li> As I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in over 30 years, I really can&#x27;t give an accurate assessment of how this razor compares to others. That being said, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it. I purcased it after reading other&#x27;s reviews. The shave is fine---not as close as with a blade, but then also no more nicks or cuts!Cleaning&#x27;s been a cinch...just a bit of liquid soap on the shaving head and then a quick rinse off. This unit comes with a \\&quot;cleaning dock\\&quot;. Because of a rebate from Amazon, it ended up cheaper than the model without the cleaner. I&#x27;ve never used the cleaner because it&#x27;s a rather large unit that just doesn&#x27;t fit well on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase but I only used it for a couple of months. Went back to regular old shaving.</li>
            <li> Reader&#x27;s Digest version: great electric shaver, with as near to a good blade shave as I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a 31 yr old white man with moderate beard hair that grows in a mildly complex pattern.  I&#x27;ve had significant difficulty with post-shave irritation and occasional ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve been using a DE (dual edge) razor and a silver tip brush with shave soap or cream lathered in a Moss scuttle for several years now, starting with hot soak, followed by shave oil, soap/cream, with/across/against the grain, then alum block finished with good aftershave. This is the benchmark against which I compare any other shaving methods.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor through Amazon when it was Panasonic&#x27;s premier shaver, and thus have several years and blade changes with this one. I&#x27;ve also had Norelcos and Brauns (though admittedly never their top models).&lt;br /&gt;A good wet, blade shave takes about 20 minutes start to finish. Sometimes one does not have the luxury of taking over half an hour for bathing and dressing. It is in this circumstance that I current utilize this razor.&lt;br /&gt;If one has but 2-3 minutes, this razor will allow a visually acceptable dry shave whose palpable closeness is less underwhelming than other dry shaves I&#x27;ve experienced (but still suboptimal). However, if one&#x27;s schedule allows 5 minutes addition to the shower for a quick wet shave (using a quality cream such as e-Shave), the results to the hand and post-shave facial skin narrowly lag behind full blade-and-badger wet shave, with a major difference only being apparent in the amount of time before stubble becomes apparent to the touch and the eye: a close traditional shave typically results in palpable stubble by 24 hours, followed by visual stubble at 36-48 hours, whereas a shave with this razor lasts but 8-12 hours by touch, followed at 20-24 hours by the appearance of a beard shadow.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this a quality addition to my shaving toolbox, and comes closer than any other electric razor to the closeness of a good traditional shave in far less time, and with no more irritation than that from a careful blade shave.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in a previous review, I have been a Panasonic electric shaver user for over 20 years. I like the overall quality of Panasonic shavers and I think that they are the best electric shavers on the market. I have a heavy beard and they give me the closest shave with the least discomfort. That having been said, I was very disappointed with this particular shaver for two reasons: the shaver did not last as long as other ones I have owned (the rechargable batteries wore out way too prematurely for a shaver at this price level), and the HydraClean base unit was too large and bulky. As I said i my review of the HydraClean cartridges, the HydraClean system is an expensive gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sinced purchased a new Panasonic wet-dry shaver (model ES-LA63) and I am much happier with it. It is also much easier to clean by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil head and rinsing it under the faucet at nano-speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: Panasonic shavers frequently go on sale at discounters like Target and WalMart, and Panasonic offers rebates from time-to-time so it pays to read the circulars and shop around, especially around Fathers Day.</li>
