            <li>It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and has a nice very light scent.  </li>
            <li>I tend to like all Aveeno products, but it&#x27;s wonderful to use a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>found it on amazon and it was easy to order.</li>
            <li>(I receive nothing additional for providing positive reviews, I just really love this product!)</li>
            <li>I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a free sample of aveeno sunscreen protect and hydrate.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed by my skin upon application, but makes my face more oily after a while</li>
            <li>This lotion makes a great, affordable daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good!</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy and dries quickly on my face.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the natural ingredients and scent of this product!</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product for my body specially my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>overall it is It is good</li>
            <li>My preschooler complains that most sunscreens, even gentle ones, sting his face.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that also sunburns very easily.</li>
            <li>On hot days with strong sun use sunblock too.</li>
            <li>I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review Although I received this as a sample these are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, makes my skin soft and smells pleasant for something you want to wear routinely,  not just in contexts where it is normal to smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a seemingly logical replacement for Aveeno Face, which is no longer available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a body cream, a bit thicker than a normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I need protection because i live in hawaii where it is sunny most days.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and smooth like you would expect a normal moisturizer to, with the benefit of sun</li>
            <li>It is in an easy to carry tube and there is an easy to open cap, the lotion squeezes smoothly out of the tube (on room temperature).</li>
            <li>The Protect + Hydration sunscreen from Aveeno has a much nicer, light scent.</li>
            <li>and it absorbed well in my skin.</li>
            <li>Have used many other kinds, but if it isn&#x27;t easy to spread, I won&#x27;t keep up with it.  </li>
            <li>It has some oily feeling after applying and it could smudge the lotion on places you touch for the first 30-40 minutes until it disappear into the skin</li>
            <li>but I went ahead and got this Aveeno product first.  </li>
            <li>I used it during a vacation with unexpectedly hot and very sunny days -- kept me from any sunburn and it stayed put without being pasty.</li>
            <li>I found this sunscreen to be totally ineffective -- where other 30 SPF sunscreens worked great, this one resulted in a sunburn and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion makes a fantastic, affordable daily moisturizer and SPF.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated when I use it.</li>
            <li>I use it because I have to, but I really do not like the smell that most sunscreen lotions have.</li>
            <li>but I actually really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Seems ok on arms and other areas.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and moisturized for a good long while after use</li>
            <li>I have put on 15-20 minutes before going out with the kids to play and noticed I do get a good amount of tanning and on my forehead a little touch of red.. not quite a sunburn.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me break out and gives decent amount of protection.</li>
            <li>I recently used this product at the beach and it has just the right amount of coverage</li>
            <li>I have spent 2 weeks on the caribbean summer and this is the very first summer that my skin does not peel of when very tanned.</li>
            <li>Aveeno usually smells better</li>
            <li>The slight scent is pleasant and it fades quickly so is not going to alarm your sensitive cubicle mates.</li>
            <li>It actually worked exactly how I hoped –</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin and since it didn&#x27;t make me breakout</li>
            <li>Not oily or greasy, leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The product is natural and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a stronger sunscreen if you&#x27;re going to be out in direct sunlight for awhile.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s prefect for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne. .  </li>
            <li>These two issues make it difficult for me to find a good sunscreen that does give me a rash, lets my skin breathe, and still protects me from sunburns.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This lotion went thickly like most sunscreens do</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s broad spectrum and has an Spf of 30</li>

            <li>Was not able to test the SPF part out in the sun much (It has been very cloudy and rainy in Oklahoma)</li>
            <li>I use only when I drive and the sun is direct on my hands.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion as a daily SPF on my arms and chest, as the daily lotion products with SPF 15 really aren&#x27;t enough protection for my skin anymore.</li>
            <li>I use it as a daily moisturizer which offers UV protection when I am out and about.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight, didn&#x27;t feel hot, and didn&#x27;t burn at all.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nothing about the packaging suggests this product has a VERY floral scent which unfortunately makes me smell like female deodorant.</li>
            <li> I only use Aveeno sunscreen products year round.</li>
            <li> I will not buy again mainly due to the smell.</li>
            <li> You get a number of hours of sun protection with none of the leftover grit of other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of that shine/oily residue that sunblocks can have but much less than other types I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You do have to use quite a bit of it as it a little thinner than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It also has the typical sunblock scent which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This product gives hydration for less than an hour (for my case).</li>
            <li> It has a slightly stronger smell than their non spf lotions</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday on my arms &amp; on my legs every time I wear shorts or Capris.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of sunscreens over the past few years, and this is the one I&#x27;ll be sticking with.</li>
            <li> I did notice some breakouts on my face a few days after I used the sunscreen, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s caused by the product or just my hormones (I tend to have some when I&#x27;m about to have my period).</li>
            <li> (I apply dime or cent sizes usually to my hands).</li>
            <li> if applied small portions of it and increase when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to Aveeno&#x27;s face-spefic SPF lotion</li>
            <li> very small tube for the price.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave behind a greasy, oily look to your skin that you can get from a lot of sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> I like the faint smell of the lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Some of them were very expensive.</li>
            <li> Too bad they couldn&#x27;t make it unscented.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>

            <li> I bought 3 of these for travel in Mexico at an all inclusive resort. I needed them to be 3 oz since a carry on was all I was taking. I think it smells great and it absorbed well in my skin. My boyfriend and I used two of these on our 4 day weekend getaway in the sun. I would recommend this for traveling.</li>
            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its Protect + hydrate LOTION to review.” I love this sunblock! It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and has a nice very light scent. It moisturizes as well I like that it&#x27;s broad spectrum and has an Spf of 30 it&#x27;s great for the whole family I will definitely buy this product !!</li>
            <li> very small tube for the price. It smells horrible. I will not buy again mainly due to the smell. Aveeno usually smells better</li>
            <li> Too greasy feeling and takes forever to absorb.</li>
            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a free sample of aveeno sunscreen protect and hydrate. I love this stuff, its not greasy and I can wear it under my makeup, I have sensitive skin and since it didn&#x27;t make me breakout it will be my go to this summer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it doesn&#x27;t leave a layer of white on my skin, and of course, it protects me from the sun. I have fair skin, and I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn when wearing it yet. I&#x27;ve tried a number of sunscreens over the past few years, and this is the one I&#x27;ll be sticking with.</li>
            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.  This lotion makes a fantastic, affordable daily moisturizer and SPF. Not oily or greasy, leaves skin feeling soft. Was not able to test the SPF part out in the sun much (It has been very cloudy and rainy in Oklahoma) but I plan to this summer. I like the faint smell of the lotion as well. Overall pretty good!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does protect my face from the sun. It is easily absorbed by my skin upon application, but makes my face more oily after a while (I have combination skin). It also has the typical sunblock scent which I don&#x27;t like. I did notice some breakouts on my face a few days after I used the sunscreen, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s caused by the product or just my hormones (I tend to have some when I&#x27;m about to have my period). I will use it again after a week and observe...</li>
            <li> “I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” I recently used this product at the beach and it has just the right amount of coverage</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen AND fabulous on your skin. I tend to like all Aveeno products, but it&#x27;s wonderful to use a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin. Also, does not cause any break-outs or irritations. During summer outings, I will use under my makeup instead of regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes a great, affordable daily moisturizer. The slight scent is pleasant and it fades quickly so is not going to alarm your sensitive cubicle mates. I used it during a vacation with unexpectedly hot and very sunny days -- kept me from any sunburn and it stayed put without being pasty. I bought several tubes in case they quit making it. Excellent stuff. Even my husband, who hates any kind of lotion on his face was persuaded to try and use it.</li>

It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and has a nice very light scent.  It moisturizes as well, so it&#x27;s not just a sunblock.  I like that it&#x27;s broad spectrum and has an Spf of 30.  I will definitely buy this product for my sun protection needs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I use sunblock like this for daily protection. Nothing about the packaging suggests this product has a VERY floral scent which unfortunately makes me smell like female deodorant. If you&#x27;re a guy and you need sunblock that doesn&#x27;t smell perfumed, then go with a different brand. Too bad they couldn&#x27;t make it unscented.</li>
            <li> I have spent 2 weeks on the caribbean summer and this is the very first summer that my skin does not peel of when very tanned. I had the most perfect tan ever!</li>
            <li> I found this sunscreen to be totally ineffective -- where other 30 SPF sunscreens worked great, this one resulted in a sunburn and oily skin.  I usually love Aveeno products but I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on.  Have used many other kinds, but if it isn&#x27;t easy to spread, I won&#x27;t keep up with it.  This is very easy to put on my toddlers.</li>
            <li> had some issues with the face and the dermatologist recommended this cream. found it on amazon and it was easy to order.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Greasy and irritated my skin and contacts. I bought this as a seemingly logical replacement for Aveeno Face, which is no longer available. But does not fill the bill!</li>
            <li> I only use Aveeno sunscreen products year round.</li>
            <li> I never used this product on my face. I just purchased this product for my body specially my hands and feet. This product feels good when you apply to skin as it spreads smoothly on skin. It has some oily feeling after applying and it could smudge the lotion on places you touch for the first 30-40 minutes until it disappear into the skin (I apply dime or cent sizes usually to my hands). This product gives hydration for less than an hour (for my case). I use only when I drive and the sun is direct on my hands. I don&#x27;t expect it to stay effective after 1 hour (60 minutes) of applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In overall it is It is good if applied small portions of it and increase when needed. It is in an easy to carry tube and there is an easy to open cap, the lotion squeezes smoothly out of the tube (on room temperature).</li>
            <li> My preschooler complains that most sunscreens, even gentle ones, sting his face.  I do know that it isn&#x27;t specifically for faces.  But, I love Aveeno products and had hopes for this one.  But, he states this stings his face, and cries and asks for it to be taken off.  The fragrance is also stronger than I&#x27;d like.  We&#x27;ll keep looking!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My skin feels very hydrated when I use it. I wished the tube was larger. It does not leave white streaks on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion as a daily SPF on my arms and chest, as the daily lotion products with SPF 15 really aren&#x27;t enough protection for my skin anymore. It absorbs well, makes my skin soft and smells pleasant for something you want to wear routinely,  not just in contexts where it is normal to smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I burn very easily so I am constantly applying sunscreen. I use it because I have to, but I really do not like the smell that most sunscreen lotions have. The Protect + Hydration sunscreen from Aveeno has a much nicer, light scent. It also does not leave behind a greasy, oily look to your skin that you can get from a lot of sunscreen products. It goes on light and smooth like you would expect a normal moisturizer to, with the benefit of sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. (I receive nothing additional for providing positive reviews, I just really love this product!)</li>
            <li> Nice and safe. Perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen for my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to Aveeno&#x27;s face-spefic SPF lotion but this &#x27;protect + hydrate&#x27; stuff has seemed to replace it on my local stores shelves. I bought it and put it very lightly on my face in the morning and had to deal with my eyes burning the rest of the day. I love Aveeno products but I hope this product is not replacing the face SPF lotion.  I will buy the face specific product off of Amazon but wish I could just pick it up locally instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a body cream, a bit thicker than a normal lotion. It left my skin soft and moisturized for a good long while after use &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel the need to keep applying it. One thing I wasn&#x27;t to keen on i it does have that SPF sunscreen scent to it. Not a fan. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.

            <li> This sunscreen both works and smells great! The product is natural and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. You get a number of hours of sun protection with none of the leftover grit of other sunscreens. You do have to use quite a bit of it as it a little thinner than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that also sunburns very easily. These two issues make it difficult for me to find a good sunscreen that does give me a rash, lets my skin breathe, and still protects me from sunburns.  This product does all three of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion went thickly like most sunscreens do but it soaked into my skin so I didn&#x27;t feel it any more. This also meant that my pores weren&#x27;t clogged and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was overheating even after two hours out in the bright sun. Two hours? I didn&#x27;t have to reapply this sunscreen, it continued to work for those two hours. Sometimes after I&#x27;ve been out in the sun, a burn appears hours later but nope, not with this product. My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight, didn&#x27;t feel hot, and didn&#x27;t burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have found my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.</li>
            <li> I’m a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a sample of its PROTECT + HYDRATE LOTION SUNSCREEN WITH BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. I really liked the natural ingredients and scent of this product! It was perfect!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this daily on my arms, face and neck. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out and gives decent amount of protection. I would suggest using a stronger sunscreen if you&#x27;re going to be out in direct sunlight for awhile. I have put on 15-20 minutes before going out with the kids to play and noticed I do get a good amount of tanning and on my forehead a little touch of red.. not quite a sunburn. On hot days with strong sun use sunblock too. It has a slightly stronger smell than their non spf lotions but I actually really like the smell. It has a bit of that shine/oily residue that sunblocks can have but much less than other types I&#x27;ve tried. I think it&#x27;s prefect for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne. .

            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. Love it. I use it as a daily moisturizer which offers UV protection when I am out and about. I need protection because i live in hawaii where it is sunny most days. It is light weight with a pleasant smell. I DON&#x27;T use it for the beach or water activities because I use a zinc based sunscreen instead... Zinc stays put and offers superior protection!</li>
            <li> For years I have looked for a daily moisturizer with SPF 30 that I could put on my face but everything I&#x27;ve tried makes my eyes burn.  I gave up until I read an article in a magazine that featured about five products. Some of them were very expensive. I was prepared to try the more expensive ones but I went ahead and got this Aveeno product first.  It actually worked exactly how I hoped – moisturizes my skin and gives me the SPF protection and I don&#x27;t get stinging eyes anymore! It is light and not greasy and dries quickly on my face.  I also use it on my arms when I&#x27;m wearing T-shirts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno 30 protect and hydrate for over a year. I wear it everyday on my arms &amp; on my legs every time I wear shorts or Capris. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This tingles when put on the face and does not feel good, sort of mentholated or some thing.  I guess it&#x27;s not formulated for the face.  Seems ok on arms and other areas.</li>
