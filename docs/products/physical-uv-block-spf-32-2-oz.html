            <li>Good price, but will expire in 4 months.  </li>
            <li>Might not be good under makeup or if you don&#x27;t like the white-faced look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is really very potent and not loss</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My daughters don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling, but better protection from UV rays and cancer and tell them to &amp;#34;suck</li>
            <li>The zinc in this product is great for my skin and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and Obagi is a Fantastic brand for most things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for my aging sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I added this to the regimine about a month ago and it is just fine.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought this product because it was super cheap since it was expiring in 2 months</li>
            <li>It works better with the higher SPF</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;alco&amp;#34; lol and slther it on constantly when I workout plyometics outside and faithfully use in on my daughters and my hair many times.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the vendor could change the picture so future customers would know what they were getting.</li>
            <li>He says it never feels greasy, goes on easily, protects his face very well and has kept his facial skin looking much better.</li>
            <li>my very Much want to look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>My husband has pretty severe rosacea and his dermatologist suggested for him to use this Obagi sunblock years ago.</li>
            <li>We always come back for more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be aware that this product is sunscreen lotion and isn&#x27;t as pictured.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is a pretty good, thick, sunscreen.</li>
            <li>that is pure carelessness and irresponsibility.</li>
            <li>Obagi is fantastic in Sun protection, though people who don&#x27;t like the white cast or perhaps that slippery oily feeling</li>
            <li>Being from Hawaii and am now Trying to REALLY protect my skin</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that they made it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it but would LOVE it if they would use something other than parabens in it.</li>
            <li>This Sunscreen is not for everyone, but it is for those who are very Sun Concious as we get older.</li>
            <li>This was the main ingredient which gave Obagi the skin tone evening effect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you wear a tinted moisturizer or BB cream you can easy cover the white cast it leaves or just dam your face after having left on 15 minutes if it hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obagi Nuderm Physical UV Block for about three years,&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and last all day.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it higher if I felt like I was getting my money&#x27;s worth :-/</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very moist especially those with oily skin</li>
            <li>I like the old 6.</li>
            <li>But as with all sun blocks, don&#x27;t get near eyes, it will sting if any gets into your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have always purchsed the whole Obaji series for years (even when i am only out of one step).  </li>
            <li>While the UV block is great, it is also very expensive.</li>
            <li>This product was advertised as Obagi Nuderm Physical UV Block and pictured as such with Broad Spectrum UVA/UVA Physical Block with 18.5% zinc oxide; HOWEVER, what I got was Obagi Physical UV Broad Spectrum SPF 32 Sunscreen lotion.</li>

            <li> In addition, there is nothing on the back of the bottle other than Obagi.</li>
            <li> Helps keep dry skin moist, but use Matte powder to keep shine at bay.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin living in Colorado</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle is so thick it is impossible to expel the UV block, and the bottle is also impervious to light, thus one cannot see how much of the UV block is remaining.</li>
            <li> It does not have the active ingredients, warning, directions, etc.</li>
            <li> I apply it thickly and it gives you white face</li>
            <li> The No. 6 Sunblock was previously packaged in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was much to difficult to squeeze product from the container and it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long either.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but I use it under my regular moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> So, it is a major annoyance that it is very difficult to squeeze every last drop of the product from its bottle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s benefits for atleast 2-3 months, which this will be gone by then since I don&#x27;t want to waste the benefits.  </li>
            <li> under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t ball up or come off, I only put a thin layer of it on.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen like a Sunscreen alcoholic minuse</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d been using this everyday, I could have prevented a lot of damage to my skin!</li>
            <li> A lesson, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on very thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with Obagi, because it seems like their newer products don&#x27;t have hydroquinone in them anymore.</li>
            <li> I notice this does well as a base before putting on my BB cream, and setting it with powder.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that this item was not the No. 6 Sunfader</li>

            <li> I love this product!! I swear by it!!  I never leave home without it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought this product because it was super cheap since it was expiring in 2 months and Obagi is a Fantastic brand for most things. I use sunscreen like a Sunscreen alcoholic minuse the &amp;#34;alco&amp;#34; lol and slther it on constantly when I workout plyometics outside and faithfully use in on my daughters and my hair many times.

            <li> It&#x27;s goes on very thick. I like the old 6. It works better with the higher SPF so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that this item was not the No. 6 Sunfader&lt;br /&gt;The change is packaging is deceiving.  The No. 6 Sunblock was previously packaged in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;I needed the No. 6 Sunfader.</li>
            <li> Great product, stays on well.  But as with all sun blocks, don&#x27;t get near eyes, it will sting if any gets into your eyes.  A lesson, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Everyone should be using this sun protection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with Obagi, because it seems like their newer products don&#x27;t have hydroquinone in them anymore. This was the main ingredient which gave Obagi the skin tone evening effect. That being said, this is a pretty good, thick, sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The zinc in this product is great for my skin and it works really well.  Find i need to put hydrating lotion on before so makeup does not pill.  Probably just my skin.</li>
            <li> It was much to difficult to squeeze product from the container and it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long either.</li>
            <li> I ordered THREE of these sunblocks May 2013.  I just today, June 3, 2013, received all three-and ALL THREE EXPIRED JANUARY 2013!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe this company sent 6 months expired product to a consumer.  That isn&#x27;t even an oversight-that is pure carelessness and irresponsibility.</li>
            <li> Good price, but will expire in 4 months.  Beware! Unless one plans to use it soon.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product. I just bought this for my wife. I guess she loves the product since she&#x27;s using this for almost 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I had written another review but would like to clarify and be specific about why so that people know the facts. This product was advertised as Obagi Nuderm Physical UV Block and pictured as such with Broad Spectrum UVA/UVA Physical Block with 18.5% zinc oxide; HOWEVER, what I got was Obagi Physical UV Broad Spectrum SPF 32 Sunscreen lotion. The bottle pictured is NOT even the same as what I received. In addition, there is nothing on the back of the bottle other than Obagi. It does not have the active ingredients, warning, directions, etc. Clearly a different product. So beware of this vendor not representing what they sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add to this review (6/19/14). The vendor saw my review and then sent me another \\&quot;block\\&quot; to fix the misrepresentation. Upon receipt, I emailed them and said I got the same product lotion rather than block. Upon realizing what the manufacture had done (changed the labeling), the vendor gave me a refund. I really appreciate that they made it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that this product is sunscreen lotion and isn&#x27;t as pictured. It would be nice if the vendor could change the picture so future customers would know what they were getting.</li>
            <li> The best protection from the sun!</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen for swimming laps in a chlorinated pool.  From what I can tell it stays on for an hour swim session.  I apply it thickly and it gives you white face but that is the fashion with the swim crowd.  Might not be good under makeup or if you don&#x27;t like the white-faced look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not bother my skin which tends to be oily.  I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi Nuderm Physical UV Block for about three years,&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and last all day.  It&#x27;s a great product for my aging sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist while undergoing some laser treatments. It is very thick, but I use it under my regular moisturizer on my face. If I&#x27;d been using this everyday, I could have prevented a lot of damage to my skin!</li>
            <li> I thought it was the sun fader..</li>
            <li> It is the best sunblock for my sun damaged chest. No sun gets through!</li>
            <li> I have always purchsed the whole Obaji series for years (even when i am only out of one step).  I added this to the regimine about a month ago and it is just fine.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it but would LOVE it if they would use something other than parabens in it. It goes&lt;br /&gt;well  under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t ball up or come off, I only put a thin layer of it on.</li>
