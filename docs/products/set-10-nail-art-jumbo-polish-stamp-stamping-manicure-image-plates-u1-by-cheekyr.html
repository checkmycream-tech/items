            <li>the stamps I have tried (which admittedly isn&#x27;t all of them - yet!) have stamped really well, and I love the fact that they are grouped together by theme!</li>
            <li>The quality of the etching is superb, and there is a tremendous assortment of unique full nail designs, as well as some smaller images.  </li>
            <li>I was mega excited to get this jumbo plates</li>

            <li>nail stamper, I was excited to get these plates, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Images are a nice size for stamping your entire nail and they are very detailed.</li>
            <li>and after I received them i cannot stop stamping my nails, love the designs are amazing, some of the plates came with scratches but only in the plastic paper that protects them.</li>
            <li>I took an initial once over of all of the plates and they are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have a set of 2013 Cheeky circle plates that came looking beautiful in a previous order.</li>
            <li>Overall at first glance they are Amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re open to suggestions from your loyal fans :)</li>
            <li>The designs on the new 2013 plates are much better.</li>
            <li>I tried every plate, about 5-10 designs per plate, and they stamped crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li>They product crisp images and and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The images transfer really well!</li>
            <li>And I love the larger size of the full-nail images-Hurray!!!  </li>
            <li>The images pick up the first time, everytime, never have I had any issues what so ever with these images working.</li>
            <li>They are more affordable than buying them individually.  </li>

            <li>I love all of the little designs.</li>
            <li>well with a varetiy of polishes both stamping and normal polish</li>
            <li>Recommend them to anyone new or old to stamping,try them</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it if you&#x27;ll actually use them.</li>

            <li> I will say if you have longer nail beds or nails that these are not long enough.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;d like Cheeky to consider is making the images a bit longer or remove the half moon as it shortens the image considerably.</li>
            <li> (crazy sounding I know, but it can happen so easily!)</li>
            <li> As an avid (but amateur!)</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they took a long long long time to arrive 3 weeks, and during the waiting time you can not track your package (cheeky sends an email explaining this), but if i don´t consider the looong wait, these plates are awsome.</li>
            <li> Not sure why these don&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s expected in a pack this size.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet as I have other designs on my nails at the moment.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I received these within two days and just got them at the door a few mins ago.</li>
            <li> Have found very few stamps that I can not use.  </li>
            <li> AT LEAST once a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended for them to start off with at least one the Cheeky plates as starters......</li>
            <li> I opened the box and they were packed very nicely, no scratches, nothing bent.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because some of the plates/images are irrelevant for me</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I would not get the package in time for Christmas</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> Buy the set because you won&#x27;t be disappointed in any of the plates.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have wider nail beds,or just looking for a fuller design, then THESE are the plates for you! Great prices and fast shipping, Cheeky is the only place to buy the best plates!</li>
            <li> Cheeky&#x27;s new 2013 Jumbo Plates are most excellent! Well etched designs for every nail art occasion. A must have for your nail art stamping library!</li>
            <li> Awesome designs! A little pricey but worth it if you&#x27;ll actually use them. The images transfer really well! 4 stars because some of the plates/images are irrelevant for me but I guess that&#x27;s expected in a pack this size.</li>
            <li> There are so many beautiful images on these plates!!! And I love the larger size of the full-nail images-Hurray!!!  I probably won&#x27;t use the &#x27;Mexico&#x27; images much-they just aren&#x27;t my style.  All the images I have tried so far stamp beautifully. This set is a must-have for every stamper!</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are great! Their is plenty of variety and the most important part they stamp wonderful. Images are a nice size for stamping your entire nail and they are very detailed. This set would make a great edition to any stampaholics collection.</li>

            <li> I love my cheeky nail plates they are awesome. Recommend them to anyone new or old to stamping,try them I know you&#x27;ll fall in love with them like I did.</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality. They stamp very well. the images are clear and the fine detail is great. You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> Just discovered the beauty of nail stamping and these plates have some lovely &amp; cute designs. A must for any nail art enthusiast.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner to stamping you MUST get this set. It literally has a piece of everything you could want. I have been an avid stamper for many years and I reach for these plates AT LEAST once a week (I stamp 4 times a week). The images pick up the first time, everytime, never have I had any issues what so ever with these images working. I&#x27;m simply impressed and rant and rave about this set to all of my friends. The images are large for long and wide fingernails as well</li>
            <li> I got my order 11 days after the shipment email was sent, that was quicker than the posted arrival date.  I love these plates!  They are more affordable than buying them individually.  Buy the set because you won&#x27;t be disappointed in any of the plates.  I tried every plate, about 5-10 designs per plate, and they stamped crisp and clean.  I have done several manicures with the plates and love that I haven&#x27;t used the same one twice.  I used a Color Club polish to practice with and it worked great, as did a Konad polish.</li>
            <li> Thank you, it received as ordered. So far so good! Can&#x27;t go wrong it&#x27;s a simple product.  Good price as well! Just wish the images did not have the curve!</li>
            <li> I love these nail plates. I would definitely buy the next templates that come out. I am so glad that I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I really like the new 2013 Jumbo plates. I think the designs are getting better for sure. I have several jumbo plates as well as the 2012 Cheeky 26 plates. The designs on the new 2013 plates are much better. I did however only receive 9 plates in my order instead of 10 amazon took care of that so no worries. Hope they keep making these!</li>
            <li> Lots of varied designs from cutesy to more ornate well etched&lt;br /&gt;works well with a varetiy of polishes both stamping and normal polish</li>
            <li> These are etched very well.  They product crisp images and and well worth the money.  I will say if you have longer nail beds or nails that these are not long enough.  So these are useful to me when my nails are nubs or very little edge on my nails</li>

I opened the box and they were packed very nicely, no scratches, nothing bent. I took an initial once over of all of the plates and they are gorgeous. I love all of the little designs. I have yet to actually stamp with them but when I do I will probably come back and update this. Overall at first glance they are Amazing!</li>
            <li> this is a great combo of nail plates. Have found very few stamps that I can not use.  Quality is very good and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Tried each design and found all stamps perfectly, the etchings are deep enough to retain enough polish for stamping transfer.  I receive compliments from friends and colleagues alike on &amp;#34;how to do it&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve recommended for them to start off with at least one the Cheeky plates as starters......^o^</li>
            <li> I received these as a birthday gift, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The quality of the etching is superb, and there is a tremendous assortment of unique full nail designs, as well as some smaller images.  I hope Cheeky releases another set of these type of plates!</li>
            <li> Delivered in time in perfect condition. I&#x27;d like to stress on the fact that these plates have the best price ever!! Along with amazing quality... What more could I ask for? Only thing I&#x27;d like Cheeky to consider is making the images a bit longer or remove the half moon as it shortens the image considerably. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re open to suggestions from your loyal fans :) Thanks...</li>
            <li> They almost look used and polished out like they do to DVD. i&#x27;m wondering if they were returns that got buffed and repackaged. Some of the scratches are fairly deep and will probably show in the design but most will not, I hope. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet as I have other designs on my nails at the moment. Two plates have raised dents on the edges but not in the designs so I can work around them. I have a set of 2013 Cheeky circle plates that came looking beautiful in a previous order. Not sure why these don&#x27;t look new. Took 9 days to arrive.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail plate kit for my daughter-in-law for Christmas and she loves it.  I was afraid that I would not get the package in time for Christmas but it arrived before the estimated arrival date of January 2nd.  My daughter-in-law came over after Christmas and showed me the design she had used on her nails and it was really beautiful.  She is very pleased with the quality of the plates and with the results.</li>
            <li> So glad I got these plates! So much selection for designs &amp; they stamp great! Can&#x27;t wait to try them all</li>
            <li> As an avid (but amateur!) nail stamper, I was excited to get these plates, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the stamps I have tried (which admittedly isn&#x27;t all of them - yet!) have stamped really well, and I love the fact that they are grouped together by theme! It makes it easier to find the type of stamp you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic backing means you don&#x27;t cut yourself (crazy sounding I know, but it can happen so easily!), the images are well-etched and stamp cleanly, and they are great value for money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Received.  They were a gift and she is very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
