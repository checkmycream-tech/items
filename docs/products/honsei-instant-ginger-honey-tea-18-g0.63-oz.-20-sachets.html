            <li>This ginger tea is fantastic</li>

            <li>and I will exaggerate a bit to allow your imagination to run free, but a \\&quot;vat\\&quot; of mucous came out of my lungs.</li>
            <li>Would have loved to have more, but will order later.</li>
            <li>I have had this tea from a local store which was excellent, very flavorful pellets.  </li>
            <li>The ginger taste is pretty strong (but not TOO strong for my taste)</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this for those days that I do not want to take the time to boil fresh ginger , but do know that no matter what brand you trust, nothing is better than fresh ginger tea.</li>
            <li>I love it very muc; I am now always drinking the ginger tea ; I am recommending to all my faily to dhave this item</li>
            <li>Exactly what my mom wanted!</li>
            <li>But, it will do and as close to fresh as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally found this at a farmer&#x27;s market near a friend&#x27;s house, but could not find it near my own.  </li>
            <li>Just the right combination of Ginger and honey.</li>
            <li>It eased my upset stomach and satisfied my sweet tooth at the same time.  </li>
            <li>so you just need to scoop it and add hot water.</li>
            <li>It has a tart taste at first</li>
            <li>Next time I will order one or two more to offset the shipping charge.</li>
            <li>Just Stir crystal into cup of hot water.</li>
            <li>I will get some more later.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is not bold, but it is a nice drink.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This is a very tasty tea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking anywhere one might use refined sugar (which I try to avoid as much as I can).</li>
            <li>Unlike most other Ginger / Honey mixes, this one has no sugar in it - JUST Ginger and Honey.  </li>
            <li>No sugar, no Corn Syrup (High Fructose or otherwise)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I drink ginger tea (either fresh from the root or Honsei) daily, with 75mg of Vitamin C a day.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and 1 packed will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Product easy to store and requires little room</li>
            <li>The packaging could have been smaller and more compact because the box is kinda large for just 20 tea bags, however, I do understand that the teabags are bigger than your average tea bag here.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is a language problem, if there is any tea in this or not--it does not say what kind of tea--but really that doesn&#x27;t matter to me (though I am curious to know)</li>
            <li>This is not too strong or too pale.</li>
            <li>If you love Honey Ginger tea, this package is hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li>excellent way to soothe a sore throat, clear your sinuses, and generally chase away a cold or flu!</li>
            <li>The ginger element is very pronounced and has a definite warming effect on the body.  </li>
            <li>I found this item at my local market for $3.00 which is the usual price at most stores.</li>
            <li>I am a PhD student who is in the house most of the time, but when I left the safety of my home to meet the new management crew of my apartment complex, I shook the hand of the receptionist (who apparently does NOT wash her hands throughout the day, let alone after she leaves the bathroom).</li>
            <li>Always good especially during cold season.</li>
            <li>Can make it strong or weak depending the amount of water you use.</li>

            <li> This is a very tasty tea. It makes my day! Would have loved to have more, but will order later.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this, I&#x27;ve been putting it in my coffee! and adding to my homemade lemonade as well! I&#x27;m a newbie to this, but I can imagine may other ways to use...I&#x27;m thinking anywhere one might use refined sugar (which I try to avoid as much as I can). YUM The box lists the ingredients as ginger and honey, but the packets list ginger, tea and honey. I am not sure if it is a language problem, if there is any tea in this or not--it does not say what kind of tea--but really that doesn&#x27;t matter to me (though I am curious to know) It is delicious and has become a staple in my cupboard. The ginger taste is pretty strong (but not TOO strong for my taste) so you must love ginger!</li>
            <li> Great helps with acid reflux cant live without this tea the best thing I have found to help with stomach issues</li>
            <li> If you love Honey Ginger tea, this package is hard to beat for the price.

Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Referred by a friend.  Tried it am very happy with the product.  Will certainly purchase it again. Gave it to friends to try.</li>
            <li> Great if you have tummy ache or feel bloated.</li>
            <li> Thus ginger tea is great for people with stomach issues, i have used it to settle my stomach for a year now after having gas pain from colon cancer surgery</li>
            <li> Great ginger powder with natural taste. This is not too strong or too pale. Perfect for my stomach upset.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Honsei Instant Ginger Honey Tea is a winner for both ease of preparation and flavor.  The ginger element is very pronounced and has a definite warming effect on the body.  It eased my upset stomach and satisfied my sweet tooth at the same time.  With preparation as easy as adding warm water and stirring, there is no downside to this product.  It&#x27;s a must-try if you want a flavorful, healthful, and convenient warm drink.</li>
            <li> I am a tea lover a friend introduced me to this tea and found it calming with an extra zing!!! ordering more today!!</li>
            <li> I love drinking Ginger Tea when I have a stomach ache. This is a powdered form of tea so you just need to scoop it and add hot water. It has a tart taste at first but I added honey and it made it better. I wouldnt drink this as a regular tea but Love it for getting your digestion going and when you are sick. Easy to use and 1 packed will last a long time. The package is in a foreign language so it is an imported product of Singapore. I will be buying more of this during the cold season.</li>
            <li> This is delicious if you like a strong yet sweet ginger tea, however  the shipping costs as much as the tea!  Next time I will order one or two more to offset the shipping charge.</li>
            <li> good ginger &amp; honey flavor.Easy to use. Just Stir crystal into cup of hot water.</li>
            <li> This is not the product that should come in this box.  I have had this tea from a local store which was excellent, very flavorful pellets.  This was a powdered product which was tasteless I can only assume it is another Chinese knock off.  Don&#x27;t bother spending money for it.</li>
            <li> This ginger tea is fantastic</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Ginger tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meets or exceeds my expectations,  deliioious and aromatic Easy to prepare and delightfully non fattening. Product easy to store and requires little room</li>
            <li> I traveled to Vegas and I think I got sucker punched by the heat.  My friend had some of this tea with her and she made a cup for me.  Wow!!  I was good in no time.  I like ginger and if you like the taste of ginger this is a great cup of instant tea.</li>
            <li> Do not rate it better because it is too strong for my taste. Prefer the crystallized form from  the same company, I will recommend it, but will mention the strength .</li>
            <li> Exactly what my mom wanted! She had been looking for this for years. She had it in Korea 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I originally found this at a farmer&#x27;s market near a friend&#x27;s house, but could not find it near my own.  Unlike most other Ginger / Honey mixes, this one has no sugar in it - JUST Ginger and Honey.  No sugar, no Corn Syrup (High Fructose or otherwise)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent way to soothe a sore throat, clear your sinuses, and generally chase away a cold or flu!</li>
            <li> The tea was delicious,  strong and so very flavorful. Just the right combination of Ginger and honey. I will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this for those days that I do not want to take the time to boil fresh ginger , but do know that no matter what brand you trust, nothing is better than fresh ginger tea. But, it will do and as close to fresh as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited on Feb 10th 2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to bother anyone with the truth as to why I have to drink ginger tea. You see, I am unable to receive the flu shot, therefore, I want to be a witness to this brand (at least) of ginger tea.  I am a PhD student who is in the house most of the time, but when I left the safety of my home to meet the new management crew of my apartment complex, I shook the hand of the receptionist (who apparently does NOT wash her hands throughout the day, let alone after she leaves the bathroom). Anyway, I would say about 12 hours later, I was succumbed by an incessant dry cough that appeared to have come out of no where. I immediately drank the Honsei ginger tea again for the second time that day (see notations below), added extra, extra honey to bring up any phlegm, and took one Mucinex DM. I kid you not - 20 minutes later.....and I will exaggerate a bit to allow your imagination to run free, but a \\&quot;vat\\&quot; of mucous came out of my lungs. Coughing immediately stopped. The only thing left was a headache that lasted for 3 days non-stop that came upon me the day after I drank the tea and honey. That flu headache that appears to never go away and that even tylenol cannot take away - in fact, all it does is remove the edge of it, which allows you to continue your life (sort of). So, what am I stating? Being that ginger tea is an anti-viral agent, I am here to tell you that though the medical community does not want you to know that fact and will deny that there is any proof to the claim - it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I drink ginger tea (either fresh from the root or Honsei) daily, with 75mg of Vitamin C a day. Therefore, take into account that I also had vitamin C working for me against the flu that the CDC states 25% of those who received the flu shot will not experience it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toodles!f those who received the flu shot will not experience it working.    Toodles!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law introduced me to this tea.  I loved it so much, I immediately went to Amazon and bought more.  I love this Tea, you do not have to add sugar at all, it is perfect.  However, the price was way a little on the high side, you can find it cheaper.</li>
            <li> Delicious tea with wonderful flavor and soothing capabilities. I ordered two boxes and they came in 2 days later.</li>
            <li> I love it and would tell friends about it.  I will get some more later.  I have nothing else to say.</li>
