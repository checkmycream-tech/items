            <li>Good luck with your adventures.</li>
            <li>Saw this mentioned on a men&#x27;s website among the \\&quot;The 10 Must-Try Colognes Of 2012,\\&quot; and with the added blessing of mostly good reviews here, I gave it a shot to replace the venerable \\&quot;standard\\&quot; of men&#x27;s office fragrances, Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li>Good smelling men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell good to a woman, or if you want your man to smell good, do not pass this up.  </li>
            <li>My brother loved it as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li>Good price for this perfume and the best of all is that it was original perfume</li>
            <li>The person receiving this gift was super happy!  </li>
            <li>It smells great on paper but so much better on men.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with both the price and quality of product.</li>
            <li>I have Attimo and thought i&#x27;d give this a try, and very glad i did.</li>
            <li>Once again Amazon comes through with a great price and authentic product.</li>
            <li>I had tried it at a department store and found the musky scent with a touch of cardamon very interesting.  </li>
            <li>It is so nicee and sexy!</li>
            <li>Beautiful,sexy scent perfect for the nighttime or a hot date.</li>
            <li>Love it on my husband!</li>
            <li>I love smelling good for My wife and this fragrance comes through every time I plan on purchasing more great fragrances from amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Citrus based with Vanilla overtones and an amazing texture in the background.</li>
            <li>Amazingly packaged though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon.com does not allow returns for this product because it is considered a \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li>nice still use it to this day</li>
            <li>I was not blown away with the opening to be honest</li>
            <li>It is a good cologne, I recommend It, I love It</li>
            <li>We got a sample of this in the newspaper and we both liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>Nice cologne</li>
            <li>Starts with a mellow flowery scent then transitions into a nice seductive scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I like the compliments I have gotten,a nice conversation starter.</li>
            <li>I took a chance getting this cologne as a gift because I liked it a lot...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good, refreshing, clean smell</li>
            <li>This is a perfect replacement for my trusty Acqua, this is the new up and comer.</li>
            <li>should be used is very strong at night.</li>
            <li>I love this scrumptious scent on my handsome husband!</li>
            <li>smells very good, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Without question the most cost effective purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 35 year old hubby.</li>
            <li>When I received it from Amazon though, the scent was much more musky than I liked.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth testing out in a department store, and ordering through Amazon, to get a great saving on the price.</li>
            <li>so I can tell is original, came just in time, good service provided</li>
            <li>The merchandise received with out Damage or Scratches, the fragrancy is good, I recomend this product, the delivery was fast and time, the price is a good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but is also not that good.  </li>
            <li>The scent starts out good but dissipates quickly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Probably better to buy it from a department store that way</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this scent, it is irresistible.  </li>
            <li>I want to make a note that I bought this for my boyfriend at the time from the Macy&#x27;s. :)</li>
            <li>My wife likes it on me so it must be OK</li>
            <li>Mu husband love it</li>
            <li>But again, the scent is extremely exotic.</li>
            <li>ok to start off, shipping was excellent ordered it and two days later there it was.</li>
            <li>I have had many people ask me what type of clothing I&#x27;m wearing, tell them it&#x27;s ferragamo.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have to say is just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>I surely will recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;KK</li>
            <li>Ladys love it.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and get glowing raves from the women.</li>
            <li>an adds a touch of sophistication to this cologne which i love.  </li>
            <li>LOve the uniqueness of it.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again and again because I get so many compliments when I wear this Cologne</li>
            <li>Girls love this</li>
            <li>and I am glad</li>
            <li>...love it ..... : )</li>
            <li>I love it too.</li>
            <li>So I will preface this by stating that I love cologne.</li>
            <li>Got many compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will have to order another for my boyfriend who also fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Recipient was very pleased and confirmed it was genuine cologne.</li>
            <li>It is especially attractive to women with a fresh soft air of calming to their olfactory gland.</li>
            <li>Smells refreshing, sophisticated, and unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, to my pleasant surprise, Amazon quickly made this right by crediting me for this sale.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous cologne at an outstanding price.</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful, elegant, seductive smell.  </li>
            <li>Those who gave good feedback do not have a clue as to what the real Ferragamo smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sexy, confident, sophisticated, smart.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell that lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>The blend of Tonka Bean, Coriander, Black Pepper and resin is a perfect mix for me.</li>
            <li>I think this F Black is almost perfect.</li>
            <li>A very classy cologne which shares a good amount of similarity to Chanel Allure pour homme.  </li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>It is huge.  </li>
            <li>Just buy it and enjoy the ride.</li>
            <li>I have of the Ferragamo F fragrences except Salvatore Ferragamo F Free Which i&#x27;m planning to buy soon.</li>
            <li>Great scent but does not last</li>
            <li>smells very lavender and sexy and i would recommend this item to everyone its a safe product</li>
            <li>first off, it more feminine then you would think and is quite strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Chanel Allure after putting this on, to see if it would be worth the money to add Allure to my collection, but after doing so, I realized that this is a worthy replacement of that cologne for a much more affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>The first word that popped into my head when I smelled this fragrance was SEXY.  </li>
            <li>I believe it depends from seller to seller or how original the product is.</li>
            <li>Original as spected according to the description posted.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>Not too spicy, not too clean.</li>
            <li>It is great, It actually has a fresh spring sweet manly scent.  </li>
            <li>I have met the perfect challenger, Ferragamo Black is everything that Acqua was when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>As a man I find this scent singularly special.</li>
            <li>A special occasion fragrance.</li>
            <li>At first I thought, \\&quot;Hmm, nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be much there, really.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very sexy in it&#x27;s scent, and it has fantastic lasting power and projection.  </li>
            <li>A real winner for men wanting something uniquely more communicative than their daytime &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents.</li>
            <li>Mild musk smell w sandalwood and clean notes.</li>
            <li>It has a spicy and sweet smell to it.  </li>
            <li>This is most likely not even safe to use, as who knows what chemicals they used to attempt to fabricate it.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>If you like Aqua Di Gio, you&#x27;ll more than likely love this scent.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It is a clean, warm, simple, yet powerful smell.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>several people at work liked it and asked the brand</li>
            <li>only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of \\&quot;wow\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but overall, a nice perfume.</li>
            <li>Not to knock Chanel, their colognes are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>got a very positive feedback from my son.</li>
            <li>Original packaging, smells and looks real.</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much, defiantly I&#x27;ll continue using it in future.</li>
            <li>I would have bought it right then and</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of the high-end type of colognes (Creed Aventus, Thierry Mugler Pure Malt, YSL Libre, Hanae Mori eau de parfum for men (Japanese), and ETC.  </li>
            <li>i like it since the first day, it is not strong it is very nice, perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying the small bottle which is easier for me to fly with, especially because the price was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better, as there were a few people who commented that it was not the authentic Ferragamo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Happy to know I can get it a half price on this site versus a high end depARTMENT STORE.</li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping,&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Mall wanted more than twice the price for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased the first one for me</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to always smell the cologne first at a store, whether it is on a sample card or your skin.</li>
            <li>Just a side note, this definitely appears to be authentic product.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t \\&quot;over-smell\\&quot; - for lack of a better term, and will last longer that way.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this would have a higher rating from me.</li>
            <li>I have used several Ferragamo colognes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t forget the shoes because that will be the first thing someone will look at.</li>
            <li>The bottle and atomizer first class Louis Bullard</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time</li>
            <li>It starts with Channel Allure Homme vibe, and middle and the dry down (the best part) is very nice resemblance of YSL La Nuit de l&#x60;Homme without cardamon (more masculine) and a bit fresher which makes the scent all year round!.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Ferragamo make some high quality scents that make a worth while statement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my nearly exclusive go-to for special nights now.</li>
            <li>Attracks females attention in a positive way.  </li>
            <li>Have used this in the past and loved the smell.</li>
            <li>This is not, in any way, nor has been, a real Ferragamo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is the cologne he always wears and he was very exited to get it.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but it fades way too fast on me.</li>
            <li>Authentic and as expected.</li>
            <li>This item went over very well..</li>
            <li>nice everyday and work smell.</li>
            <li>and i do love that it doesn&#x27;t lose masculinity like other citrus scents of today.</li>
            <li>It is a business casual or a great shirt and most certainly long pants or jeans.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my cologne and I will pay high dollar for something I really like.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it fits me and the smell is smooth but not loud like other colognes.</li>
            <li>It is a bit complex and hypnotically pleasant, yet masculine in effect.</li>
            <li>I like the regular Ferragamo (red box) much better.</li>
            <li>Is a product for a 40 and older, I think.</li>
            <li>Well if it&#x27;s so hazardous, how were you able to ship it to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying from Macy&#x27;s and paying double then using this cheap sorry excuse of an imitation.  </li>
            <li>I applaud Amazon loud and clear for doing the right thing here.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Final phase is my favorite and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New in box.</li>
            <li>The background texture is very masculine</li>
            <li>Loses scent faster than other products and barely able to smell it, but really good for low key cologne.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my nephew, this gift is all the way in Central America Panama to be exact</li>
            <li>He usually wears Armani Mania and Armani Code, and this new one is equally nice in a different way.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and the scent last the whole day.</li>
            <li>This has a more subtle, unusual, slightly powdery fresh scent.</li>
            <li>smell is not overwhelming and not too strong - so you can wear to office.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even going to say that it could be an old product, or one that was left out in high temperature.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and it is taken seriously wherever I go.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gift for your boyfriend or husband or maybe a male friend I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ferragamo stipulates this scent for evening occasions rather than casual daily wear, with good reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sweet and fresh scent but like it also.</li>
            <li>it has pleasent smell right for middle aged men</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than most typical men&#x27;s colognes, many of which are overpowering and strong in a sickening way.</li>
            <li>This is for soft music and low lights, but I wear it for evening outings too.</li>
            <li>I really like these perfumes, just what I expected, thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>item arrived correctly, well packaged, the scent is genuine just as previous ones i´ve owned, long lasting</li>
            <li>it is not very famous here, but worth it to buy with reasonably very low price</li>
            <li>secondly, its very fruity and not much of a wood tone.</li>
            <li>However, when I received it and wore it a few times, I noticed it lasted a few hours at the most.</li>
            <li>now to the real topic, this cologne is not for the average male i would say.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Saw this mentioned on a men&#x27;s website among the \\&quot;The 10 Must-Try Colognes Of 2012,\\&quot; and with the added blessing of mostly good reviews here, I gave it a shot to replace the venerable \\&quot;standard\\&quot; of men&#x27;s office fragrances, Acqua di Gio.</li>

            <li> The person receiving this gift was super happy!  </li>
            <li> It smells great on paper but so much better on men.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with both the price and quality of product.</li>
            <li> I have Attimo and thought i&#x27;d give this a try, and very glad i did.</li>
            <li> Once again Amazon comes through with a great price and authentic product.</li>
            <li> I had tried it at a department store and found the musky scent with a touch of cardamon very interesting.  </li>
            <li> It is so nicee and sexy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful,sexy scent perfect for the nighttime or a hot date.</li>
            <li> Love it on my husband!</li>
            <li> I love smelling good for My wife and this fragrance comes through every time I plan on purchasing more great fragrances from amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Citrus based with Vanilla overtones and an amazing texture in the background.</li>
            <li> Amazingly packaged though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon.com does not allow returns for this product because it is considered a \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li> nice still use it to this day</li>
            <li> I was not blown away with the opening to be honest</li>
            <li> It is a good cologne, I recommend It, I love It</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this in the newspaper and we both liked it.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> Nice cologne</li>
            <li> Starts with a mellow flowery scent then transitions into a nice seductive scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I like the compliments I have gotten,a nice conversation starter.</li>
            <li> I took a chance getting this cologne as a gift because I liked it a lot...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good, refreshing, clean smell</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for my trusty Acqua, this is the new up and comer.</li>
            <li> should be used is very strong at night.</li>
            <li> I love this scrumptious scent on my handsome husband!</li>
            <li> smells very good, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Without question the most cost effective purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 35 year old hubby.</li>
            <li> When I received it from Amazon though, the scent was much more musky than I liked.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth testing out in a department store, and ordering through Amazon, to get a great saving on the price.</li>
            <li> so I can tell is original, came just in time, good service provided</li>
            <li> The merchandise received with out Damage or Scratches, the fragrancy is good, I recomend this product, the delivery was fast and time, the price is a good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but is also not that good.  </li>
            <li> The scent starts out good but dissipates quickly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Probably better to buy it from a department store that way</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent, it is irresistible.  </li>
            <li> I want to make a note that I bought this for my boyfriend at the time from the Macy&#x27;s. :)</li>
            <li> My wife likes it on me so it must be OK</li>
            <li> Mu husband love it</li>
            <li> But again, the scent is extremely exotic.</li>
            <li> ok to start off, shipping was excellent ordered it and two days later there it was.</li>
            <li> I have had many people ask me what type of clothing I&#x27;m wearing, tell them it&#x27;s ferragamo.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have to say is just okay for me.  </li>
            <li> I surely will recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;KK</li>
            <li> Ladys love it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and get glowing raves from the women.</li>
            <li> an adds a touch of sophistication to this cologne which i love.  </li>
            <li> LOve the uniqueness of it.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again and again because I get so many compliments when I wear this Cologne</li>
            <li> Girls love this</li>
            <li> and I am glad</li>
            <li> ...love it ..... : )</li>
            <li> I love it too.</li>
            <li> So I will preface this by stating that I love cologne.</li>
            <li> Got many compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will have to order another for my boyfriend who also fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Recipient was very pleased and confirmed it was genuine cologne.</li>
            <li> It is especially attractive to women with a fresh soft air of calming to their olfactory gland.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing, sophisticated, and unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, to my pleasant surprise, Amazon quickly made this right by crediting me for this sale.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous cologne at an outstanding price.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful, elegant, seductive smell.  </li>
            <li> Those who gave good feedback do not have a clue as to what the real Ferragamo smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sexy, confident, sophisticated, smart.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet smell that lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> The blend of Tonka Bean, Coriander, Black Pepper and resin is a perfect mix for me.</li>
            <li> I think this F Black is almost perfect.</li>
            <li> A very classy cologne which shares a good amount of similarity to Chanel Allure pour homme.  </li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> It is huge.  </li>
            <li> Just buy it and enjoy the ride.</li>
            <li> I have of the Ferragamo F fragrences except Salvatore Ferragamo F Free Which i&#x27;m planning to buy soon.</li>
            <li> Great scent but does not last</li>
            <li> smells very lavender and sexy and i would recommend this item to everyone its a safe product</li>
            <li> first off, it more feminine then you would think and is quite strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Chanel Allure after putting this on, to see if it would be worth the money to add Allure to my collection, but after doing so, I realized that this is a worthy replacement of that cologne for a much more affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> The first word that popped into my head when I smelled this fragrance was SEXY.  </li>
            <li> I believe it depends from seller to seller or how original the product is.</li>
            <li> Original as spected according to the description posted.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li> Not too spicy, not too clean.</li>
            <li> It is great, It actually has a fresh spring sweet manly scent.  </li>
            <li> I have met the perfect challenger, Ferragamo Black is everything that Acqua was when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> As a man I find this scent singularly special.</li>
            <li> A special occasion fragrance.</li>
            <li> At first I thought, \\&quot;Hmm, nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be much there, really.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very sexy in it&#x27;s scent, and it has fantastic lasting power and projection.  </li>
            <li> A real winner for men wanting something uniquely more communicative than their daytime &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents.</li>
            <li> Mild musk smell w sandalwood and clean notes.</li>
            <li> It has a spicy and sweet smell to it.  </li>
            <li> This is most likely not even safe to use, as who knows what chemicals they used to attempt to fabricate it.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> If you like Aqua Di Gio, you&#x27;ll more than likely love this scent.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a clean, warm, simple, yet powerful smell.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> several people at work liked it and asked the brand</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of \\&quot;wow\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but overall, a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> Not to knock Chanel, their colognes are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> got a very positive feedback from my son.</li>
            <li> Original packaging, smells and looks real.</li>
            <li> and I liked it very much, defiantly I&#x27;ll continue using it in future.</li>
            <li> I would have bought it right then and</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of the high-end type of colognes (Creed Aventus, Thierry Mugler Pure Malt, YSL Libre, Hanae Mori eau de parfum for men (Japanese), and ETC.  </li>
            <li> i like it since the first day, it is not strong it is very nice, perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the small bottle which is easier for me to fly with, especially because the price was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better, as there were a few people who commented that it was not the authentic Ferragamo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Happy to know I can get it a half price on this site versus a high end depARTMENT STORE.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping,&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Mall wanted more than twice the price for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased the first one for me</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to always smell the cologne first at a store, whether it is on a sample card or your skin.</li>
            <li> Just a side note, this definitely appears to be authentic product.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t \\&quot;over-smell\\&quot; - for lack of a better term, and will last longer that way.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this would have a higher rating from me.</li>
            <li> I have used several Ferragamo colognes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t forget the shoes because that will be the first thing someone will look at.</li>
            <li> The bottle and atomizer first class Louis Bullard</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time</li>
            <li> It starts with Channel Allure Homme vibe, and middle and the dry down (the best part) is very nice resemblance of YSL La Nuit de l&#x60;Homme without cardamon (more masculine) and a bit fresher which makes the scent all year round!.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Ferragamo make some high quality scents that make a worth while statement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my nearly exclusive go-to for special nights now.</li>
            <li> Attracks females attention in a positive way.  </li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and loved the smell.</li>
            <li> This is not, in any way, nor has been, a real Ferragamo.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the cologne he always wears and he was very exited to get it.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> but it fades way too fast on me.</li>
            <li> Authentic and as expected.</li>
            <li> This item went over very well..</li>
            <li> nice everyday and work smell.</li>
            <li> and i do love that it doesn&#x27;t lose masculinity like other citrus scents of today.</li>
            <li> It is a business casual or a great shirt and most certainly long pants or jeans.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my cologne and I will pay high dollar for something I really like.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it fits me and the smell is smooth but not loud like other colognes.</li>
            <li> It is a bit complex and hypnotically pleasant, yet masculine in effect.</li>
            <li> I like the regular Ferragamo (red box) much better.</li>
            <li> Is a product for a 40 and older, I think.</li>
            <li> Well if it&#x27;s so hazardous, how were you able to ship it to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying from Macy&#x27;s and paying double then using this cheap sorry excuse of an imitation.  </li>
            <li> I applaud Amazon loud and clear for doing the right thing here.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Final phase is my favorite and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New in box.</li>
            <li> The background texture is very masculine</li>
            <li> Loses scent faster than other products and barely able to smell it, but really good for low key cologne.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew, this gift is all the way in Central America Panama to be exact</li>
            <li> He usually wears Armani Mania and Armani Code, and this new one is equally nice in a different way.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and the scent last the whole day.</li>
            <li> This has a more subtle, unusual, slightly powdery fresh scent.</li>
            <li> smell is not overwhelming and not too strong - so you can wear to office.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to say that it could be an old product, or one that was left out in high temperature.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and it is taken seriously wherever I go.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gift for your boyfriend or husband or maybe a male friend I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ferragamo stipulates this scent for evening occasions rather than casual daily wear, with good reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sweet and fresh scent but like it also.</li>
            <li> it has pleasent smell right for middle aged men</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than most typical men&#x27;s colognes, many of which are overpowering and strong in a sickening way.</li>
            <li> This is for soft music and low lights, but I wear it for evening outings too.</li>
            <li> I really like these perfumes, just what I expected, thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> item arrived correctly, well packaged, the scent is genuine just as previous ones i´ve owned, long lasting</li>
            <li> it is not very famous here, but worth it to buy with reasonably very low price</li>
            <li> secondly, its very fruity and not much of a wood tone.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it and wore it a few times, I noticed it lasted a few hours at the most.</li>
            <li> now to the real topic, this cologne is not for the average male i would say.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it real, smell didn&#x27;t last long as previuos fragment</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and will produce the results that i like in a cologne as it will get noticed.</li>
            <li> seen complaints in some lower-rated reviews here that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> One tip: Don&#x27;t be afraid with this one to spray on more than you might have with others.</li>
            <li> its not as long lasting as some of the other perfumes in this range.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve seen similar inconsistencies with other Ferragamo colognes (see my review of &amp;#34;F Pour Homme&amp;#34; also made by Ferragamo.  </li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of Ferragamo Black I have used.</li>
            <li> Salvatore is not a run around the beech or run into the grocery store scent and especially the black.</li>
            <li> Not sure if Amazon is actually the seller here or another 3rd party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loves this black scent than other blue scents.</li>
            <li> Night time/date night -- that&#x27;s a different matter; you want something like Gucci Guilty Intense for that smouldering, come-hither scent.</li>
            <li> but this is a fake, the real F by ferragamo has a Red F</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last few minutes.</li>
            <li> I would have to drench myself in 10+ sprays for it to last longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be careful with buying this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a quiet aroma that arrives to your nose without the usual jolt of a man colone.</li>
            <li> Fake, I could tell it was repackaged, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> B006GJNMJA GUCCI GUILTY INTENSE by Gucci]]&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Very complex and lasts very long time and projects above avarage.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be black pepper &amp; tonka as the base and lavender for the top notes.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying two bottles for less than the price at the mall.</li>
            <li> but I forgot my wallet...went home and purchased it here for about half the price.</li>
            <li> is a bit less pricey than what the department stores have to offer.</li>
            <li> an the box isn&#x27;t supposed to be black sry guys :</li>
            <li> They propably got fake or very old stock.</li>
            <li> It was versatile, not invasive and year round.  </li>
            <li> I always get a lot of compliments everyday.  </li>
            <li> Ferragamo Black all the way!</li>
            <li> Seriously, do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T buy this cologne, or any other cologne, from amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> (one spray is usually all i use).</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past year and have made this my number one choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past two or three years.</li>
            <li> Just plain fades too quickly - on me at least.</li>
            <li> I know this scent will bring compliments, it has to as you could spray it on a pit bull and people wouldn&#x27;t leave until they knew what that old ugly dog was wearing.</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original, woman smells, my boyfriend hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Best fragrance ever but the color of the liquid looks like urine. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Probably better to buy it from a department store that way you can&lt;br /&gt;See what you are buying,</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne being somewhat skeptical of the quality I might receive, as well as unsure what it would even smell like as it was recommended to me by a friend.  I decided to give it a shot and I love it.  This is a great every day cologne to wear to work or out on the town.</li>
            <li> As a man I find this scent singularly special. Ferragamo stipulates this scent for evening occasions rather than casual daily wear, with good reason. It is a bit complex and hypnotically pleasant, yet masculine in effect. This is for soft music and low lights, but I wear it for evening outings too. It&#x27;s my nearly exclusive go-to for special nights now. A real winner for men wanting something uniquely more communicative than their daytime &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents.</li>
            <li> Make the ladies (or men) go crazy!</li>
            <li> Fell for this aroma. Mall wanted more than twice the price for a smaller bottle. Without question the most cost effective purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon. Ended up buying two bottles for less than the price at the mall.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  And this was pennies on the dollar compared to retail price!</li>
            <li> fragrance it self is just great but the shipping took about 10 days (including weekend and business days).</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I&#x27;m a woman and use it for myself. Thermostat women&#x27;s perfumes are too floral for me.</li>
            <li> I worshipped in the Acqua Di Gio house for quite some time.  It was versatile, not invasive and year round.  I have met the perfect challenger, Ferragamo Black is everything that Acqua was when it first came out.  It&#x27;s a female magnet, not overpowering, and seems to last longer than Acqua in any given day, now as I have both.  This is a perfect replacement for my trusty Acqua, this is the new up and comer.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of Ferragamo Black I have used. My wife purchased the first one for me and I was hooked. The blend of Tonka Bean, Coriander, Black Pepper and resin is a perfect mix for me. It is a fabulous cologne at an outstanding price. Ferragamo Black all the way!</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance in the Macy&#x27;s.  Then had a friend try the sample.  It is such a beautiful, elegant, seductive smell.  I am in love with this scent, it is irresistible.  It smells like something that can be worn all day at anytime of the year.  It is a clean, warm, simple, yet powerful smell.  It smells great on paper but so much better on men.  The first word that popped into my head when I smelled this fragrance was SEXY.  My suggestion is to always smell the cologne first at a store, whether it is on a sample card or your skin. Everyone has different taste in fragrances but this one to me is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I want to make a note that I bought this for my boyfriend at the time from the Macy&#x27;s. :)</li>
            <li> Totally fake. Didn&#x27;t even last few minutes. If I had known I am buying fake I would have not bought it. Very disappointed. Have used this in the past and loved the smell. Never ever buying any fragrance online here.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it on me so it must be OK</li>
            <li> Walking through Macy&#x27;s, a sales woman showed me this. I walked around smelling the tester card for the rest of the day.I would have bought it right then and there but I forgot my wallet...went home and purchased it here for about half the price.Just a side note, this definitely appears to be authentic product.Trust me, it smells so good I wear it on me even when I don&#x27;t leave the house!</li>
            <li> Seriously, do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T buy this cologne, or any other cologne, from amazon.com.  This is FAKE!  I should have known better, as there were a few people who commented that it was not the authentic Ferragamo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with 100% certainty that this is fake.  It does not smell like Ferragamo.  Those who gave good feedback do not have a clue as to what the real Ferragamo smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com does not allow returns for this product because it is considered a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot;.  Well if it&#x27;s so hazardous, how were you able to ship it to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying from Macy&#x27;s and paying double then using this cheap sorry excuse of an imitation.  This is most likely not even safe to use, as who knows what chemicals they used to attempt to fabricate it.  I&#x27;m not even going to say that it could be an old product, or one that was left out in high temperature.  This is not, in any way, nor has been, a real Ferragamo. STAY AWAY.....</li>
            <li> nice still use it to this day</li>
            <li> This is by far my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  It has a sweet smell that lasts most of the day.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, and works well for a night out or a day in the office.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume! Mu husband love it</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough... I believe it depends from seller to seller or how original the product is. I bought a bottle with $25 ... while in Salvatore&#x27;s store is around $100. But again, the scent is extremely exotic. Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> I really like these perfumes, just what I expected, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Me gustan mucho estos perfumes, justo lo que esperaba, gracias</li>
            <li> Fake, I could tell it was repackaged, very dissapointed. Tried to send back to get. Money back But no reply!</li>
            <li> Friend of mine had some and was glowing about this $300 fragrance.  I am that type of a a-hole who will steal your personal fragrance and make it mine.  Oh, it&#x27;s not $300.</li>
            <li> Loves this black scent than other blue scents.</li>
            <li> ok to start off, shipping was excellent ordered it and two days later there it was. now to the real topic, this cologne is not for the average male i would say. first off, it more feminine then you would think and is quite strong (one spray is usually all i use). secondly, its very fruity and not much of a wood tone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;And is a bit less pricey than what the department stores have to offer.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne. I have had many people ask me what type of clothing I&#x27;m wearing, tell them it&#x27;s ferragamo. This fragrance is a winner</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the perfume, perhaps was expecting a different scent.</li>
            <li> Please do not believe the snobs who throw 1 star for this beautiful fragrance. They propably got fake or very old stock. anyway.. I tried it today in Sephora.. I was not blown away with the opening to be honest but..... dammnn the drydown is something i can not explain... It is so nicee and sexy! I wanted to eat my wrist during all day! It starts with Channel Allure Homme vibe, and middle and the dry down (the best part) is very nice resemblance of YSL La Nuit de l&#x60;Homme without cardamon (more masculine) and a bit fresher which makes the scent all year round!. Very complex and lasts very long time and projects above avarage. Highly recommended! For this price, it is a bargain!</li>
            <li> It is a good cologne, I recommend It, I love It</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Love it. Have been using it for the past year and have made this my number one choice.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this in the newspaper and we both liked it.  Happy to know I can get it a half price on this site versus a high end depARTMENT STORE.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrances for men. Sexy, confident, sophisticated, smart. Another reviewer said this product was \\&quot;fruity\\&quot;. No! Just buy it and enjoy the ride. Good luck with your adventures.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping!! BUT IS BROKEN!!!</li>
            <li> The person receiving this gift was super happy!  This is the cologne he always wears and he was very exited to get it.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have never smelled this cologne prior to buying here on Amazon but I purchased it based on the reviews here.  I have to say is just okay for me.  The scent starts out good but dissipates quickly throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain the scent either.  It&#x27;s not bad but is also not that good.  I like the regular Ferragamo (red box) much better.</li>
            <li> very good product. excellent quality</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  It is huge.  I thought I was buying the small bottle which is easier for me to fly with, especially because the price was such a great deal.  When it showed up I was amazed by how big this is.  I will have enough for 2 years.  Great value and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> item arrived correctly, well packaged, the scent is genuine just as previous ones i´ve owned, long lasting so I can tell is original, came just in time, good service provided</li>
            <li> several people at work liked it and asked the brand name?,though it is not very famous here, but worth it to buy with reasonably very low price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sweet and fresh scent but like it also. It&#x27;s stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Very good product and good fragance. Original as spected according to the description posted. Good price for this perfume and the best of all is that it was original perfume</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with both the price and quality of product. I surely will recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;KK</li>
            <li> my son loved it, smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew, this gift is all the way in Central America Panama to be exact</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son. He absolutely loves it. Thinking about getting another for the holidays.</li>
            <li> great fragrance, great price</li>
            <li> Like this cologne a lot. Last a long time. Have no idea what some of these people are complaining about. They just imagine that these colognes don&#x27;t smell like they do at the store. Gimme a break.</li>
            <li> Mild musk smell w sandalwood and clean notes. Very pleasant and not over powering. Perfect for my 35 year old hubby. Not too spicy, not too clean. Just right.</li>
            <li> As Rick James would say, this stuff is cold...bloodied....  I own a lot of the high-end type of colognes (Creed Aventus, Thierry Mugler Pure Malt, YSL Libre, Hanae Mori eau de parfum for men (Japanese), and ETC.  I am very picky about my cologne and I will pay high dollar for something I really like.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I must say this is one of the best cologne I ever smell,and I get a tons of compliment about it</li>
            <li> Saw this mentioned on a men&#x27;s website among the \\&quot;The 10 Must-Try Colognes Of 2012,\\&quot; and with the added blessing of mostly good reviews here, I gave it a shot to replace the venerable \\&quot;standard\\&quot; of men&#x27;s office fragrances, Acqua di Gio. I like the Ferragamo. At first I thought, \\&quot;Hmm, nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be much there, really.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But I realize that&#x27;s the point: For a daily office scent or just casual out and about wear, you don&#x27;t want anything too assertive (or expensive). Night time/date night -- that&#x27;s a different matter; you want something like Gucci Guilty Intense for that smouldering, come-hither scent. lol [[ASIN:B006GJNMJA GUCCI GUILTY INTENSE by Gucci]]&lt;br /&gt;But this one just has to be pleasant and long-lasting.* Done, and done.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve seen complaints in some lower-rated reviews here that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I did not buy my bottle via Amazon, if that matters, but it holds up well enough. One tip: Don&#x27;t be afraid with this one to spray on more than you might have with others. It won&#x27;t \\&quot;over-smell\\&quot; - for lack of a better term, and will last longer that way.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this but this is a fake, the real F by ferragamo has a Red F an the box isn&#x27;t supposed to be black sry guys :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have been swindled</li>
            <li> i like it since the first day, it is not strong it is very nice, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;my wife also like the smell of the perfume.</li>
            <li> The merchandise received with out Damage or Scratches, the fragrancy is good, I recomend this product, the delivery was fast and time, the price is a good price</li>
            <li> Nice scent but it fades way too fast on me. It just does not last (as another reviewer mentioned). Otherwise, this would have a higher rating from me. Good smelling men&#x27;s cologne. Just plain fades too quickly - on me at least. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have of the Ferragamo F fragrences except Salvatore Ferragamo F Free Which i&#x27;m planning to buy soon.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a quiet aroma that arrives to your nose without the usual jolt of a man colone. It is especially attractive to women with a fresh soft air of calming to their olfactory gland. A special occasion fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne and it was great to receive it in a timely manner and not have to pay department store prices. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love it because it fits me and the smell is smooth but not loud like other colognes. I have been using it for the past two or three years.</li>
            <li> I think this F Black is almost perfect. Starts with a mellow flowery scent then transitions into a nice seductive scent. Final phase is my favorite and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice everyday and work smell. Ladys love it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and get glowing raves from the women.</li>
            <li> I have Attimo and thought i&#x27;d give this a try, and very glad i did. If you like Aqua Di Gio, you&#x27;ll more than likely love this scent. It&#x27;s Citrus based with Vanilla overtones and an amazing texture in the background. The background texture is very masculine an adds a touch of sophistication to this cologne which i love.  It&#x27;s long lasting and will produce the results that i like in a cologne as it will get noticed. Ferragamo make some high quality scents that make a worth while statement. This one will get you noticed and i do love that it doesn&#x27;t lose masculinity like other citrus scents of today.</li>
            <li> smells very good, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells wonderful.  Can be worn day or evening.  I have used several Ferragamo colognes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This was a Birthday Gift for my Boyfriend. he is a cologne Fanatic! He wears it daily and gets lots of compliments, from Men and Women.</li>
            <li> Is a product for a 40 and older, I think. should be used is very strong at night. I recommend</li>
            <li> it has pleasent smell right for middle aged men</li>
            <li> Original packaging, smells and looks real. The only problem I have is that it took extra time for me to get it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly packaged though. Came at the last possible day that it was supposed to arrive.  Loses scent faster than other products and barely able to smell it, but really good for low key cologne.</li>
            <li> LOve the uniqueness of it. I will buy it again and again because I get so many compliments when I wear this Cologne</li>
            <li> Thank You Will do Business With Again .........Very Fast Shipping,&lt;br /&gt;Great Price 100% Quality Name Brand Product A + !</li>
            <li> Beautiful,sexy scent perfect for the nighttime or a hot date. Girls love this and it&#x27;s a keeper in my book...Once again Amazon comes through with a great price and authentic product.</li>
            <li> The item was as described and it arrived on time. I love the scent and it is taken seriously wherever I go. I will keep a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I get lots of compliments when i wear this. I use it daily. Get it and be a man!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. smell is not overwhelming and not too strong - so you can wear to office. its not as long lasting as some of the other perfumes in this range. but overall, a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> lasts about 5+ hours and is not overpowering.  great scent to wear at the office.  It has a spicy and sweet smell to it.  I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be black pepper &amp; tonka as the base and lavender for the top notes.</li>
            <li> After years of wearing this fragrance,I still get a ton of compliments from both sexes and lingering glances as I walk away.</li>
            <li> Salvatore Ferragamo has always been known for their quality and beautiful fragrances. Formality, yes but in a casual way. Let me explain. Salvatore is not a run around the beech or run into the grocery store scent and especially the black. It is a business casual or a great shirt and most certainly long pants or jeans. Please don&#x27;t forget the shoes because that will be the first thing someone will look at. The movie, mall,dinner, concerts and plays there is no shortage on where to wear it. I know this scent will bring compliments, it has to as you could spray it on a pit bull and people wouldn&#x27;t leave until they knew what that old ugly dog was wearing. I like the compliments I have gotten,a nice conversation starter. If that is not you it&#x27;s probably best to not wear anything. I want to do a follow up on my lalique ecre noir review. A man can&#x27;t go thru life without trying it. the India vetiver in it will bring anyone who has lived fall and winter in the mountains wonderful memories. Enjoy,hundreds of thousands of others have. The bottle and atomizer first class Louis Bullard</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and I liked it very much, defiantly I&#x27;ll continue using it in future.</li>
            <li> A very classy cologne which shares a good amount of similarity to Chanel Allure pour homme.  It is somewhat different, but this only adds to it&#x27;s mystique, in that it has booziness similar to YSL&#x27;s La Nuit de l&#x27;homme, and a touch of the Iris scent of Dior Homme, without the femininity of that frag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very sexy in it&#x27;s scent, and it has fantastic lasting power and projection.  If you want to smell good to a woman, or if you want your man to smell good, do not pass this up.  It can probably be worn by just about any age group, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Chanel Allure after putting this on, to see if it would be worth the money to add Allure to my collection, but after doing so, I realized that this is a worthy replacement of that cologne for a much more affordable price.  Not to knock Chanel, their colognes are worth the money.  I am only saying that this is a virtual doppleganger to Allure.</li>
            <li> I got this for a present and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I got a very positive feedback from my son.</li>
            <li> Great buy....quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this scrumptious scent on my handsome husband! It&#x27;s fragrancetastic!</li>
            <li> smells very lavender and sexy and i would recommend this item to everyone its a safe product...love it ..... : )</li>
            <li> People love the smell,great price,I will order again!!</li>
            <li> Great value. Everyone is asking me what colone this is when I use it. Smells refreshing, sophisticated, and unique. Good buy!</li>
            <li> New in box. Authentic and as expected.</li>
            <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne a couple of years back.  I had tried it at a department store and found the musky scent with a touch of cardamon very interesting.  When I received it from Amazon though, the scent was much more musky than I liked.  I think Farragamo may have a quality control issue, since I&#x27;ve seen similar inconsistencies with other Ferragamo colognes (see my review of &amp;#34;F Pour Homme&amp;#34; also made by Ferragamo.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any Ferragamo colognes any time soon.</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original, woman smells, my boyfriend hate it! I bought two and really feel I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I took a chance getting this cologne as a gift because I liked it a lot... It&#x27;s different than most typical men&#x27;s colognes, many of which are overpowering and strong in a sickening way. This has a more subtle, unusual, slightly powdery fresh scent. Anyway, he loved it! I love it too. He usually wears Armani Mania and Armani Code, and this new one is equally nice in a different way. Definitely worth testing out in a department store, and ordering through Amazon, to get a great saving on the price.</li>
            <li> This item went over very well.. Recipient was very pleased and confirmed it was genuine cologne. Will anticipate another purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Great scent but does not last</li>
            <li> So I will preface this by stating that I love cologne. I buy a lot of it whether it&#x27;s online or in person at a big box store. This cologne smelled great in the store. It&#x27;s a very good, refreshing, clean smell and I applaud Ferragamo for this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured buying it on Amazon would simply give me a discount not found in the store. However, when I received it and wore it a few times, I noticed it lasted a few hours at the most. I would have to drench myself in 10+ sprays for it to last longer than a few hours. And even then, it would be gone in a matter of hours. To me, this bottle was either a counterfeit or a compromised bottle having been affected by temperature, or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful with buying this on Amazon. Not sure if Amazon is actually the seller here or another 3rd party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to my pleasant surprise, Amazon quickly made this right by crediting me for this sale. I applaud Amazon loud and clear for doing the right thing here.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful.  I always get a lot of compliments everyday.  Its all natural and the scent last the whole day.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Love it on my husband!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it real, smell didn&#x27;t last long as previuos fragment</li>
            <li> Amazing, spicy scent but not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> smells very good. great gift</li>
            <li> I love smelling good for My wife and this fragrance comes through every time I plan on purchasing more great fragrances from amazon you just can&#x27;t beat their prices.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne a couple of days ago and already I am getting compliments. I recommend this cologne for every men, you wouldn&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS EXPENSIVE COLOGNE FOR SOMETHING ELSE EVEN THOUGHT IT HAS NOT BEEN USED&amp;#62; IN FACT I RECEIVED IT WITH NO CELLOPHANE WRAPPING&amp;#62; NOW I AM STUCK&amp;#62; I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER ITEM FROM AMAZON AS THIS IS UNFAIR&amp;#62; IF YOU PURCHASE FROM NORDSTROM THEY WILL TAKE IT BACK&amp;#60; IF NECESSARY.</li>

            <li> It is great, It actually has a fresh spring sweet manly scent.  I love it.  It lasts a long time and is very smooth.  Attracks females attention in a positive way.
