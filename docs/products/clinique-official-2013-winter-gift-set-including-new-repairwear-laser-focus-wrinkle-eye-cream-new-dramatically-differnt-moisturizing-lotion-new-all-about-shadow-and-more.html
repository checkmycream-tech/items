            <li>Perfect price and perfect product</li>
            <li>Great products.  </li>
            <li>Great makeup set.</li>
            <li>Great assortment for the price.</li>
            <li>And it was a great deal for all the stuff you get in one purchase.</li>
            <li>Again, the products included in this set are great.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking either for travel sizes or to sample some of cliniques great products this is for you.</li>
            <li>All in all a great buy.</li>
            <li>I loved this set.</li>
            <li>I love the bag and everything in it!</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING</li>
            <li>It was a gift I could not give because it wasn&#x27;t even packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have this item to have the moisturiser handy for application any time of the day.</li>
            <li>make up remover and eye cream are nice.</li>
            <li>I love love love clinique bonus time!</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Love Clinique.</li>
            <li>I love to get these sets because of the mini mascaras.</li>
            <li>I purchased for the adorable bag, but most of all for the &amp;#34;take the day off&amp;#34; make-up remover.</li>
            <li>its okay for its price</li>
            <li>I love the gift assortments.  </li>
            <li>So many things to try.</li>
            <li>The chubby stick goes on more like gloss than a lipstick, kind of clear in color.</li>
            <li>They are so good on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I could purchase these by themselves instead of being there at the right time for a pwp or gwp.  </li>
            <li>I love Clinique and this is a wonderful way to try out products that are a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>That set was in perfect condition - the only difference in packaging being that inner items were in a sealed bag...</li>
            <li>A great value for someone looking for a travel makeup set or for someone wanting to sample a few Clinique items.</li>
            <li>My wife really loves it!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap bag with the tiny samples they give you (if you ask for them) after you buy make up at Clinique.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering these makeup bags.</li>
            <li>Love it so much , it what I expected</li>
            <li>the eye shadow duo is a deep rich chocolate brown and a rose blush color that when applied is very natural the lip balm/stain color was too red for me personally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: If the bag was a little smaller like it shows in the picture maybe it would have looked better because the items would have fit snug.</li>
            <li>I think next time, I will buy cosmetics through the official website or big mall like MACY or Bloomingdale, they often give the sample set as a gift when the order amount is more than  45$ or 50$ or so.</li>
            <li>I love Clinique and this set contained some of my favorite things - unfortunately the items were not inside a plastic bag - they were loose within the cosmetic case and something (eye shadow - brown powder?) had spilled out into the case and covered everything, ruining the inside of the case,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, wear contacts, and use waterproof eye products and colorstay lips.</li>

            <li> Awesome and roomy, well-made makeup bag. Great products.  Love Clinique.</li>
            <li> Great makeup set. I love to get these sets because of the mini mascaras. It&#x27;s easier for me to control my mascara when it&#x27;s in a small tube like this. The chubby stick goes on more like gloss than a lipstick, kind of clear in color. A great value for someone looking for a travel makeup set or for someone wanting to sample a few Clinique items.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife at Christmas. Perfect range of colors for the Winter season. Nicely packaged and very quick delivery. Great assortment for the price. My wife really loves it!</li>
            <li> I love love love clinique bonus time! some how i missed this one. I purchased for the adorable bag, but most of all for the &amp;#34;take the day off&amp;#34; make-up remover. if you haven&#x27;t tried it you are missing out! I have sensitive skin, wear contacts, and use waterproof eye products and colorstay lips. two swipes with this stuff and my face is naked. It is AMAZING</li>
            <li> The colors of the eyeshadow and lipstick were wonderfull. And it was a great deal for all the stuff you get in one purchase. Recomend it!</li>
            <li> Again, the products included in this set are great.  They are so good on sensitive skin.  I would rather use Clinique than any other product.  The chubby stick lipstick is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So glad that I could purchase these by themselves instead of being there at the right time for a pwp or gwp.  All the ladies in my family got one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap bag with the tiny samples they give you (if you ask for them) after you buy make up at Clinique. It was a gift I could not give because it wasn&#x27;t even packaged nicely. It looked sad and if my mom didn&#x27;t ask for it- it would have been returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: If the bag was a little smaller like it shows in the picture maybe it would have looked better because the items would have fit snug.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique and this is a wonderful way to try out products that are a bit on the expensive side. If you are looking either for travel sizes or to sample some of cliniques great products this is for you. I love the bag and everything in it!</li>
            <li> I loved this set. It was exactly as described. The eye cream is the best I have ever, ever used.&lt;br /&gt; ever used</li>
            <li> Love it so much , it what I expected</li>
            <li> Clinique is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any gift set, there will always be usable items - nothing is wasted&lt;br /&gt;New products to try in every set&lt;br /&gt;Great carry out bag</li>
            <li> I wanted to have this item to have the moisturiser handy for application any time of the day. And to have the other items in covenient sizes. I made a mistake and thought the mskeup removet was clarifying #2 but that was my fault for not checking closer. All in all a great buy. Thanks for offering these makeup bags.</li>
            <li> its okay for its price</li>
            <li> I love the gift assortments.  So many things to try.</li>
            <li> Perfect price and perfect product</li>
            <li> The product was poorly packaged. Item sizes were very small. The lip moisturizer was broken and lodged up inside the lid. I would not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I have never given a one star rating before. I was looking so forward to receiving this gift set - I love Clinique and this set contained some of my favorite things - unfortunately the items were not inside a plastic bag - they were loose within the cosmetic case and something (eye shadow - brown powder?) had spilled out into the case and covered everything, ruining the inside of the case, and of course, ruining the shadow and other items...  There was a very small dent in the package - not enough though to cause all this... If only the inner items had been packaged in a plastic bag as the other set that I ordered from the very same Supplier at the very same time...  That set was in perfect condition - the only difference in packaging being that inner items were in a sealed bag... I&#x27;m very disappointed that I had to return this Winter Gift Set...</li>
            <li> Everything as expected!</li>
            <li> A lot of useless products.</li>
            <li> I think next time, I will buy cosmetics through the official website or big mall like MACY or Bloomingdale, they often give the sample set as a gift when the order amount is more than  45$ or 50$ or so. So it seems the goods are not very attractive.</li>
            <li> make up remover and eye cream are nice. the eye shadow duo is a deep rich chocolate brown and a rose blush color that when applied is very natural the lip balm/stain color was too red for me personally.</li>
