            <li>100% would buy again :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ora really has figured out great healing/soothing formulas with her salves...</li>
            <li>I will buy some more.</li>
            <li>Ok so.. an update.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good.....makes me want to get a lot more work</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the tattoo salve</li>
            <li>This is wonderful healing ointment for tattoos and for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice light clean smell.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this much more than the aquaphor</li>
            <li>if it does great on this tattoo I would definitely buy more</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>The salve has a light aroma to it, which it cools the applied area a bit.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth and it spreads well.</li>
            <li>I use it for all sorts of skin bothers, and I love it for fresh tattoos.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>glad i got this product for my new 1 of many tatts</li>
            <li>It also goes of really easily and so far has been great for my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>One day while browsing on Amazon, I stumbled upon this product, I ordered it, and we absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Great for old and new tattoos</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is FANTASTIC it goes on smoothly and is very soothing.....</li>
            <li>Ora was fantastic the whole way through!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad there are larger containers available.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Ora&#x27;s salve that I haven&#x27;t even opened the other product.</li>
            <li>Came packaged great and got it fast :) ....a little does a long way.</li>
            <li>It really helps with itching and just soothing freshly tattooed skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than regular unscented lotion if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Got my first tat on my chest &amp; applied Aquaphor it then clogged my pores &amp; gave me a rash</li>
            <li>and oh my gosh it&#x27;s so cute and tiny!!</li>
            <li>I put some on my finger and it feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be using this when I get my first tattoo next week. :)</li>
            <li>Not only have some of my tattoos started healing faster but the smell of thyme and tea tree is enjoyable as well.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this while I get the rest of my tattoo finished, plus any tattoos I get in the future :)</li>
            <li>this product works better than anything else for me to heal tattoos short of tegaderm.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and therefore is not painful to apply.</li>
            <li>Being into more natural remedies I reached out to a group on Facebook about natural alternatives to lotion for my tattoo and someone suggested Ora&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will defiantly use this again and for what it&#x27;s worth, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>SO, as this is great for FRESH new tattoos and COMPLETELY HEALED tattoos, HEALING tattoos be careful!!!</li>
            <li>and it is working very well.</li>
            <li>I also used colloidal silver spray for my rash just in case it would stick around longer but its going away fast as well</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>After my wife had several reactions to petroleum based tattoo ointments, we began our search for a more natural option.</li>
            <li>I have a full back piece</li>
            <li>&amp; id highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural!!</li>
            <li>The price is great for the size and a little goes a long way so it will last you!</li>
            <li>Using product now on new tattoo</li>
            <li>and I like trying new things.</li>
            <li>I have a brand new tattoo.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on new tattoos.</li>
            <li>I thought I was doing well with aftercare of my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>and if it will help with the healing process more than my usual routine.</li>
            <li>I have about 9 empty containers from this salve - I have put it on a swollen / sprained ankle and it relieved the pain / irritation mildly.</li>
            <li>I was and I remain pleasantly surprised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m curious to see how his will work on freshly tattooed skin</li>
            <li>We first tried Ora&#x27;s Herbal Salve for sensitive skin for our young grandson&#x27;s sensitive skin and soon became devout users for all of our dry skin</li>
            <li>so when we heard of the tattoo salve it was only natural that my daughter and I tried it on our new ink.  </li>
            <li>originally purchased this along with another product that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I used this product first before even opening the other.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of this little bottle at first.</li>
            <li>Less itching, redness and really helped my eczema, too!</li>
            <li>The jar is tiny, so it makes it a little annoying to get the product out (especially with nails!), but overall, it does wonderfully for my new tattoo!  </li>
            <li>, my tattoo has been super wonky.</li>
            <li>My first few tattoos I had used the regular white, unscented lotion and vaseline, but compared to Ora&#x27;s, just isn&#x27;t the same.</li>

            <li> My first few tattoos I had used the regular white, unscented lotion and vaseline, but compared to Ora&#x27;s, just isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for long term color (working on shading, grey/black no colors)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from this or not, but I want to warn people about new tattoos and taking care of them.</li>
            <li> I wish they offered a bigger product size but other than that</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the itching usually associated with a healing tattoo go away completely.</li>
            <li> But once actually opening and using it it shows a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had a slight eczema breakout last week and applied it to that as well!</li>
            <li> Could use a little bigger jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see the results</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Bought this based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It soothes, relieves itching &amp; heals faster than any other product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You can even use it for other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Very minimal scabbing, and clothing doesn&#x27;t interfere with product.</li>
            <li> Not right away.</li>
            <li> And it comes in a little bag so you can carry it in your purse.</li>
            <li> so i knew i needed something natural &amp; randomly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the size, but it looking at it now, this will last for a while.</li>
            <li> , It healed quicker than usual and it soothed my skin as sometimes that area can get irritated after I get work done.</li>
            <li> I washed 3-4 times a day, lathered with dial soap as directed, then a thin coat of this over it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Arrived on time. Using product now on new tattoo and it is working very well. Very minimal scabbing, and clothing doesn&#x27;t interfere with product. Could use a little bigger jar.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, smells amazing and is doing a great job. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was and I remain pleasantly surprised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this along with another product that I have used in the past. It was a good price and I like trying new things. I used this product first before even opening the other. It&#x27;s been over a week and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Ora&#x27;s salve that I haven&#x27;t even opened the other product. It really helps with itching and just soothing freshly tattooed skin. A little goes a long way.. Doesn&#x27;t get all over my shirt and has a pleasant smell. I will defiantly use this again and for what it&#x27;s worth, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint.  The salve has a light aroma to it, which it cools the applied area a bit.  I was skeptical about the size, but it looking at it now, this will last for a while. I would recommend it, over redemption(given to me at the tattoo studio).</li>
            <li> Great company, fast shipping and delivery and a wonderful product. Tattoos healed up great</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of this little bottle at first. But once actually opening and using it it shows a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s good smelling and not cakey. When you smell it you think &amp;#34;oh this may burn &amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not the case. I have a full back piece and it works great .</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! My DEVO Energy Dome tattoo is healing beautifully!</li>
            <li> Works well. Nice light clean smell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!  A must if you love tattoos!</li>
            <li> Preferred this over A&amp;D ointment.  Nice scent also.</li>
            <li> Smells good, it id not greasy and stops itching on contact. I also gave some to a family member for a rash.</li>
            <li> I have a brand new tattoo. This stuff makes the itching usually associated with a healing tattoo go away completely. Minimizes the look of scabbing over. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I got this to help in the healing of my newest tattoo and it has worked wonderfully. It is easy to rub on, not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of filmy layer. It is very soft and therefore is not painful to apply. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came packaged great and got it fast :) ....a little does a long way. the herb smell is awsome glad i got this product for my new 1 of many tatts</li>
            <li> Awesome so far on healing will see how it finishes the healing and if it does great on this tattoo I would definitely buy more</li>
            <li> My brother used this product on his tattoo which healed much much - much faster than mine, and kept the colors great.</li>
            <li> Very tiny jar. But a little goes a long way! I love this stuff and my tattoo healed very nicely with it. Much better than regular unscented lotion if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Awesome balm!! Love this for tattoo healing and maintenance! And it&#x27;s natural!!</li>
            <li> Works great, better than the recommended A&amp;D ointment. It smells really nice as well.</li>
            <li> Got my first tat on my chest &amp; applied Aquaphor it then clogged my pores &amp; gave me a rash so i knew i needed something natural &amp; randomly came across this stuff &amp; id highly recommend for anyone. It soothes, relieves itching &amp; heals faster than any other product in my opinion. I healed in 5-6 days. I also used colloidal silver spray for my rash just in case it would stick around longer but its going away fast as well</li>
            <li> I ordered Ora&#x27;s tattoo salve in December. My husband and I had just gotten tattoos for Christmas. The artist suggested a store brand lotion during the healing process. Being into more natural remedies I reached out to a group on Facebook about natural alternatives to lotion for my tattoo and someone suggested Ora&#x27;s. Ora was fantastic the whole way through! She worked with me on shipping and got it out to me ASAP. As soon as I started using the product I was hooked! You can even use it for other skin ailments. I had a slight eczema breakout last week and applied it to that as well! The breakout was gone in 2 days! The price is great for the size and a little goes a long way so it will last you! I will never buy anything else for tattoos ever again! Thank you Ora!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful healing ointment for tattoos and for dry skin.  The smell is great and the price is great too!  I will definately buy more when this one is gone!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It smells nice, works well, and is packaged quite attractively!  100% would buy again :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The consistency is smooth and it spreads well. Works wonderfully on new tattoos.</li>
            <li> Just recieved this product this morning and oh my gosh it&#x27;s so cute and tiny!! And it comes in a little bag so you can carry it in your purse. I put some on my finger and it feels so soft and light. I&#x27;m going to be using this when I get my first tattoo next week. :)</li>
            <li> Great for old and new tattoos</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Finally a non-petrolatum based tattoo salve! Not only have some of my tattoos started healing faster but the smell of thyme and tea tree is enjoyable as well. Very good product and I would order this again for myself and for friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised. Works good.</li>
            <li> We first tried Ora&#x27;s Herbal Salve for sensitive skin for our young grandson&#x27;s sensitive skin and soon became devout users for all of our dry skin so when we heard of the tattoo salve it was only natural that my daughter and I tried it on our new ink.  Not only does it help in the healing process, but it also makes the area feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ora really has figured out great healing/soothing formulas with her salves...</li>
            <li> So far so good. I enjoy this much more than the aquaphor my tattoo artist recommended I use. I wish they offered a bigger product size but other than that no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting another session this coming week so I&#x27;m curious to see how his will work on freshly tattooed skin and if it will help with the healing process more than my usual routine. I started using at after a couple days of getting tattooed. Not right away. I&#x27;m curious to see the results</li>
            <li> I used this for after care of my last tattoo and I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else, It healed quicker than usual and it soothed my skin as sometimes that area can get irritated after I get work done. I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is amazing. It also goes of really easily and so far has been great for my new tattoo. It&#x27;s helped with the itching a ton and kept my skin moisturized. I will continue to use this while I get the rest of my tattoo finished, plus any tattoos I get in the future :)</li>
            <li> Work great I will buy some more.</li>
            <li> After my wife had several reactions to petroleum based tattoo ointments, we began our search for a more natural option. One day while browsing on Amazon, I stumbled upon this product, I ordered it, and we absolutely fell in love with it. It heals our tattoos faster, and it smells awesome! Will definitely continue to us.</li>
            <li> This is great for my tattoo. My first few tattoos I had used the regular white, unscented lotion and vaseline, but compared to Ora&#x27;s, just isn&#x27;t the same. Less itching, redness and really helped my eczema, too! The jar is tiny, so it makes it a little annoying to get the product out (especially with nails!), but overall, it does wonderfully for my new tattoo!  EDIT: Ok so.. an update. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from this or not, but I want to warn people about new tattoos and taking care of them. I thought I was doing well with aftercare of my new tattoo. It&#x27;s been about 1 month since then. I&#x27;ve since then, my tattoo has been super wonky. Let me explain. Using this salve, it did not peel like it was supposed to and instead clogged up my tattoo with the skin that was supposed to be peeling. I washed 3-4 times a day, lathered with dial soap as directed, then a thin coat of this over it. I think it messed up the healing because the dead skin coated the tattoo area too much. SO, as this is great for FRESH new tattoos and COMPLETELY HEALED tattoos, HEALING tattoos be careful!!! I switched to a white, unscented, sensative skin lotion with daily washes and it&#x27;s since started healing the way my artist described.</li>
            <li> Bought my second bottle! This stuff is so good.....makes me want to get a lot more work done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to see the growth and success of this company. I absolutely love the tattoo salve and I&#x27;m so glad there are larger containers available.  I have about 9 empty containers from this salve - I have put it on a swollen / sprained ankle and it relieved the pain / irritation mildly. I use it for all sorts of skin bothers, and I love it for fresh tattoos. Awesome, amazing product from a great company!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Fast Shipping. Works on EVERYTHING, NOT just Tattoos!</li>
            <li> this product works better than anything else for me to heal tattoos short of tegaderm.  it is also great for irritated skin!  I hope they come out with more products!</li>
            <li> I purchased a jar to use on my new arm sleeve; very happy with it! takes away the itching, leaves it feeling moisturized and not flakey at all like the h2ocean. can&#x27;t speak for long term color (working on shading, grey/black no colors) but, I will say that it stops the bleeding ink.</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC it goes on smoothly and is very soothing.....my ink on arm where I applied it looks fantastic felt so good also!!! I highly recommend this product. Will purchase again.</li>
