    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best blow dryer ever, I started doing my hair by myself after being a beauty salon junky,</li>

            <li>Very nice, sleek design.  </li>
            <li>it is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>:P I tried it out at the store; they have plugged-in displays.</li>
            <li>Have loved it in every way until yesterday when it lost all heat.</li>
            <li>It has been a good choice, I believe.  </li>
            <li>, I never realized how much I really loved this dryer until that trip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have good control over the hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  </li>
            <li>Good weight/feel.  </li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly shiny and frizz free!</li>
            <li>The tone of this unit is a VERY pleasant whirl sound of air, that comes from the unit.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly, and is the best blow-dryer I&#x27;ve owned to date.  </li>
            <li>The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    </li>
            <li>Regardless, I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of this dryer, and the four year warranty rocks!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>omg this is so amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing,</li>
            <li>I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.   </li>
            <li>and that is a nice to have.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.</li>
            <li>I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!</li>
            <li>But otherwise, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer, and probably not any better than a $20 model.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see any reason to spend more.</li>
            <li>I am soooo glad that I bought this</li>
            <li>what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>my favorite hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, I was up north visiting my daughter who has a T3, I had forgotten to pack my dryer</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom</li>
            <li>I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  </li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I love that it includes the difuser and concentrater.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    </li>
            <li>I love the attachments--</li>
            <li>I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers)</li>
            <li>I love love love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>She love it and uses most of the attachments.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>And it is VERY POWERFUL!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a new dryer and this had great reviews.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this one does everything I want it to...dries my hair quickly,</li>
            <li>makes it really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to get a better hair dryer than the pedestrian big box store offerings.  </li>
            <li>they are easy to put on but also stay put.</li>
            <li>, is very useful and easy to handle, I do my hair in 15 minutes and after months of using it...</li>
            <li>When I set out to buy a nicer hair dryer, I expected to spend more money than this, so I was happy with the cost and value of this one.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets hotter than anything I&#x27;ve tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    </li>
            <li>Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It is light in weight and the airflow is controlled.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn&#x27;t see a good reason to change it.  </li>
            <li>Great product not as loud as other hair dryers, although it is a bit heavier because of the material its made of...im happy with it.</li>
            <li>but this is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive it.    </li>
            <li>I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Three heat settings, two speed fan and a cool air button.  </li>
            <li>leaves it shiny and full</li>
            <li>The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>It has a true cool setting.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>However I keep hitting the \\&quot;cool</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying my new Remington hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us.</li>
            <li>I bought a T3 tourmaline dryer a while ago from Amazon and quickly found out that the seller (folica.com) is not an authorized dealer for T3 dryers and do not come with a manufacturers warranty.  </li>
            <li>and it dries hers quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheaper \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; dryer and took it back because it felt like a toy, and didn&#x27;t have a warm setting like it said.  </li>
            <li>The cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  </li>
            <li>It has cool to hot tempts and has a push button to hold your style.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful, quite, and works very well.</li>
            <li>to the information that&#x27;s included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  </li>
            <li>I love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair.</li>
            <li>Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high.</li>
            <li>Professional 1875 Tourmaline Ionic Professional Hair Dryer but Reading the reviews and by my own experience</li>
            <li>It dries my hair super fast, so</li>
            <li>Bought this hairdryer almost exactly a year ago.  </li>
            <li>Although she was retracting it daily, so I wondered how many times it could be retracted before it would not work.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for this hair dryer and was considering the Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043 by Hot Tools</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>It is light weight compare to my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Just hot and fry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first hairdryer I have purchased in 13 years.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Conair hair dryer at Wal Mart to replace it, got home, plugged it in, and couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap and loud it sounded.</li>
            <li>It IS not as heavy as that salon dryer, so that&#x27;s a good thing I guess.</li>
            <li>It works really great but is much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>High setting so powerful</li>
            <li>I like my previous hair dryer MUCH better!</li>
            <li>Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  </li>
            <li>This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  </li>
            <li>Cord is long enough, it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and not too noisy.  </li>
            <li>Combine that with the large holes in the diffuser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little concerned that they might break at some point while changing them, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use attachments) and I think the noise level is very manageable.  </li>
            <li>The holes are MUCH larger than in the picture, which is important to someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>It allows too much air flow which creates frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It is very versatile, with two blower settings and three heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I like that the dryer is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>This dryer works well and it is fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly hair that is very prone to frizziness and</li>
            <li>Could it really be the fact it is \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; or \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;??</li>
            <li>No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     </li>
            <li>Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent $30 instead of $300 on a T3.</li>
            <li>Good for the money, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li>so well that I don&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron unless I&#x27;m going for a super sleek look!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as heavy as most hair dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past and loved the attachments it came with...</li>
            <li>I purchased this exact blow dryer a little over a year ago from a local retailer where I live and at first I love it!...</li>
            <li>My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  </li>
            <li>After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money.</li>
            <li>It did a decent job when it worked</li>
            <li>I used an older version at my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>AND my hair actually looks and feels soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Going on Amazon to search for users&#x27; favorites, this Remington model was given a high rating and was in my price range.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice).</li>
            <li>It was very powerful, yet quiet and dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4\\&quot; Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like the look and feel of this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I checked around before I purchased it, and one of the selling points is that it is supposed to operate more quiet than your average hair dryer, but I can&#x27;t really hear much of a difference, if any.  </li>
            <li>If you want a powerful, quiet, well-made dryer, this is it.  </li>
            <li>I thought that since it had \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; in it, it would work pretty much the same as the T3.  </li>
            <li>The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I&#x27;m back-brushing</li>
            <li>It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don&#x27;t accidentally turn on and off while drying.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I needed a new blowdryer.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn&#x27;t limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  </li>
            <li>My hair which can be frizzy, looked better than usual.</li>
            <li>Pretty quiet.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and need to heat &amp; rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  </li>
            <li>fast, high setting gives proper amount of heat to hold a curl with a roller brush and my hair looks so shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers.  </li>
            <li>This blowdryer dried my hair in 5 minutes (I have very fine, short hair).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, but did want to upgrade to one that would be easier on my hair, since it is getting pretty long.  </li>
            <li>this has seemed to tame some of that chaos and makes straightening my hair really easy.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I can see is it&#x27;s quite large</li>
            <li>If you need a blow dryer that really packs a punch, look no further!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this is by far</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and well behaved for a change.  </li>
            <li>This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed by how it&#x27;s so quiet regardless of the heat level</li>
            <li>Definitely not a problem unless you&#x27;re used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way.</li>
            <li>Definitely feels more solid then other dryers in the lower price ranges.</li>
            <li>The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume.</li>
            <li>the cord is long (great) but it tends to get all twisted up on itself even though it was designed not to.</li>
            <li>It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>It cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth, shiny and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I plunged the dryer under water after unplugging the unit and letting it cool down for a period of time!</li>
            <li>But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  </li>
            <li>(I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have tried a lot of different dryers and diffuser attachments over the years.</li>
            <li>It was a quite spectacular, and quite frightening, way for it to go.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  </li>
            <li>I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    </li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair any better or worse than the $75 Babyliss model I bought from my salon three years ago.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this one has a 6&#x27; cord, where the previous model had a 9&#x27; cord.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work any better than my old ceramic con air.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it to style my hair, and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer, I felt it dried out the ends.  </li>
            <li>I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or</li>
            <li>After much time was spent on looking at different models and brands, I finally settled on this product.</li>
            <li>For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...</li>
            <li>Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has gotten more delicate and I almost quit using a hairdryer because it was so hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser in the picture is similar to one I had success with in the past.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first.</li>
            <li>I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  </li>

            <li> This is the best blow dryer ever, I started doing my hair by myself after being a beauty salon junky,</li>
            <li> but the design itself makes it one of the best ones out there, if not the best.  </li>

            <li> Very nice, sleek design.  </li>
            <li> it is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> :P I tried it out at the store; they have plugged-in displays.</li>
            <li> Have loved it in every way until yesterday when it lost all heat.</li>
            <li> It has been a good choice, I believe.  </li>
            <li> , I never realized how much I really loved this dryer until that trip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have good control over the hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  </li>
            <li> Good weight/feel.  </li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly shiny and frizz free!</li>
            <li> The tone of this unit is a VERY pleasant whirl sound of air, that comes from the unit.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, and is the best blow-dryer I&#x27;ve owned to date.  </li>
            <li> The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    </li>
            <li> Regardless, I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of this dryer, and the four year warranty rocks!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this one and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> omg this is so amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing,</li>
            <li> I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.   </li>
            <li> and that is a nice to have.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.</li>
            <li> I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!</li>
            <li> But otherwise, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer, and probably not any better than a $20 model.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any reason to spend more.</li>
            <li> I am soooo glad that I bought this</li>
            <li> what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> my favorite hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, I was up north visiting my daughter who has a T3, I had forgotten to pack my dryer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom</li>
            <li> I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I love that it includes the difuser and concentrater.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    </li>
            <li> I love the attachments--</li>
            <li> I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers)</li>
            <li> I love love love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> She love it and uses most of the attachments.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> And it is VERY POWERFUL!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new dryer and this had great reviews.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that this one does everything I want it to...dries my hair quickly,</li>
            <li> makes it really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to get a better hair dryer than the pedestrian big box store offerings.  </li>
            <li> they are easy to put on but also stay put.</li>
            <li> , is very useful and easy to handle, I do my hair in 15 minutes and after months of using it...</li>
            <li> When I set out to buy a nicer hair dryer, I expected to spend more money than this, so I was happy with the cost and value of this one.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets hotter than anything I&#x27;ve tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    </li>
            <li> Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It is light in weight and the airflow is controlled.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn&#x27;t see a good reason to change it.  </li>
            <li> Great product not as loud as other hair dryers, although it is a bit heavier because of the material its made of...im happy with it.</li>
            <li> but this is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive it.    </li>
            <li> I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Three heat settings, two speed fan and a cool air button.  </li>
            <li> leaves it shiny and full</li>
            <li> The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li> It has a true cool setting.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> However I keep hitting the \\&quot;cool</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> , I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new Remington hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us.</li>
            <li> I bought a T3 tourmaline dryer a while ago from Amazon and quickly found out that the seller (folica.com) is not an authorized dealer for T3 dryers and do not come with a manufacturers warranty.  </li>
            <li> and it dries hers quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, and dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; dryer and took it back because it felt like a toy, and didn&#x27;t have a warm setting like it said.  </li>
            <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  </li>
            <li> It has cool to hot tempts and has a push button to hold your style.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful, quite, and works very well.</li>
            <li> to the information that&#x27;s included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  </li>
            <li> I love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high.</li>
            <li> Professional 1875 Tourmaline Ionic Professional Hair Dryer but Reading the reviews and by my own experience</li>
            <li> It dries my hair super fast, so</li>
            <li> Bought this hairdryer almost exactly a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Although she was retracting it daily, so I wondered how many times it could be retracted before it would not work.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for this hair dryer and was considering the Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043 by Hot Tools</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> It is light weight compare to my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Just hot and fry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first hairdryer I have purchased in 13 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Conair hair dryer at Wal Mart to replace it, got home, plugged it in, and couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap and loud it sounded.</li>
            <li> It IS not as heavy as that salon dryer, so that&#x27;s a good thing I guess.</li>
            <li> It works really great but is much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> High setting so powerful</li>
            <li> I like my previous hair dryer MUCH better!</li>
            <li> Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  </li>
            <li> This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  </li>
            <li> Cord is long enough, it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and not too noisy.  </li>
            <li> Combine that with the large holes in the diffuser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned that they might break at some point while changing them, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use attachments) and I think the noise level is very manageable.  </li>
            <li> The holes are MUCH larger than in the picture, which is important to someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> It allows too much air flow which creates frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It is very versatile, with two blower settings and three heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I like that the dryer is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and it is fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair that is very prone to frizziness and</li>
            <li> Could it really be the fact it is \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; or \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;??</li>
            <li> No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     </li>
            <li> Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am glad I spent $30 instead of $300 on a T3.</li>
            <li> Good for the money, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> so well that I don&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron unless I&#x27;m going for a super sleek look!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as heavy as most hair dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past and loved the attachments it came with...</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact blow dryer a little over a year ago from a local retailer where I live and at first I love it!...</li>
            <li> My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  </li>
            <li> After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job when it worked</li>
            <li> I used an older version at my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> AND my hair actually looks and feels soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Going on Amazon to search for users&#x27; favorites, this Remington model was given a high rating and was in my price range.  </li>
            <li> Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice).</li>
            <li> It was very powerful, yet quiet and dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4\\&quot; Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like the look and feel of this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I checked around before I purchased it, and one of the selling points is that it is supposed to operate more quiet than your average hair dryer, but I can&#x27;t really hear much of a difference, if any.  </li>
            <li> If you want a powerful, quiet, well-made dryer, this is it.  </li>
            <li> I thought that since it had \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; in it, it would work pretty much the same as the T3.  </li>
            <li> The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I&#x27;m back-brushing</li>
            <li> It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don&#x27;t accidentally turn on and off while drying.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed a new blowdryer.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn&#x27;t limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  </li>
            <li> My hair which can be frizzy, looked better than usual.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and need to heat &amp; rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  </li>
            <li> fast, high setting gives proper amount of heat to hold a curl with a roller brush and my hair looks so shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers.  </li>
            <li> This blowdryer dried my hair in 5 minutes (I have very fine, short hair).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, but did want to upgrade to one that would be easier on my hair, since it is getting pretty long.  </li>
            <li> this has seemed to tame some of that chaos and makes straightening my hair really easy.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I can see is it&#x27;s quite large</li>
            <li> If you need a blow dryer that really packs a punch, look no further!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this is by far</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and well behaved for a change.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed by how it&#x27;s so quiet regardless of the heat level</li>
            <li> Definitely not a problem unless you&#x27;re used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way.</li>
            <li> Definitely feels more solid then other dryers in the lower price ranges.</li>
            <li> The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume.</li>
            <li> the cord is long (great) but it tends to get all twisted up on itself even though it was designed not to.</li>
            <li> It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> It cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth, shiny and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I plunged the dryer under water after unplugging the unit and letting it cool down for a period of time!</li>
            <li> But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  </li>
            <li> (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried a lot of different dryers and diffuser attachments over the years.</li>
            <li> It was a quite spectacular, and quite frightening, way for it to go.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  </li>
            <li> I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    </li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair any better or worse than the $75 Babyliss model I bought from my salon three years ago.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this one has a 6&#x27; cord, where the previous model had a 9&#x27; cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work any better than my old ceramic con air.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it to style my hair, and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer, I felt it dried out the ends.  </li>
            <li> I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or</li>
            <li> After much time was spent on looking at different models and brands, I finally settled on this product.</li>
            <li> For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...</li>
            <li> Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has gotten more delicate and I almost quit using a hairdryer because it was so hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser in the picture is similar to one I had success with in the past.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first.</li>
            <li> I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> I have enough trouble trying to prevent frizz; I don&#x27;t need my dryer to be the main cause.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.      </li>
            <li> I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it&#x27;s smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the long power cord.  </li>
            <li> I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4\\&quot; Flat Iron [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The smaller bowl makes my drying time twice as long.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> Lots of power, takes up less space than the old one.</li>
            <li> However, I did not want to spend a small fortune on a new dryer (hello, T3!)</li>
            <li> I have long hair (goes to my mid-back) and barrowed my cousins t-studio dryer when I was visiting her.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not incredibly loud.</li>
            <li> She is pretty rough on dryers and this one has stood up to her abuse and her thick hair.</li>
            <li> Various speed settings allow for both quick and dirty drying and for painless styling!&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and apparently durable!</li>
            <li> We tried one other so called \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; hair dryer from our local retailer and returned it.  </li>
            <li> i just hope it last longer than other remington products.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a little heavy, but is constructed well - feels very sturdy in the hand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take an hour for me to dry my hair..</li>
            <li> it dry.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous model prior to this that lasted for approx 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look less coarse and softer.</li>
            <li> and it cut the drying time in half, especially when straightening it.</li>
            <li> WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> but it was too heavy and didnt last long!</li>
            <li> I could not believe it dried my hair in half the time; my hair was soft, and sleek.  </li>
            <li> It is heavier than others, but I don&#x27;t mind getting a little extra muscle tone.</li>
            <li> The only thing that it is missing: a folding handle.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a con is that it is not a light weight fan.</li>
            <li> But for less curly hair or hair that&#x27;s less prone to frizz, that probably won&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li> The air flow is concentrated, so it takes significantly less time to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my last hair dryer this is like a little bit of heaven in the morning!  </li>
            <li> It has cut my drying time down by a few minutes, is quiet, and throws out a lot of air.  </li>
            <li> no hi-pitched whine like some other models.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like I just left the salon everyday!</li>
            <li> Thank you to the other reviewers for recommending this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that I had expected that the hair dryer would be quieter than it is.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat frizzy dry hair but after applying my styling products, this dryer was amzing the way it smoothed my hair and in half the time that my previous blow dryers</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the attachments are hard to get on and off.  </li>
            <li> It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn&#x27;t blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said it&#x27;s heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same, maybe lighter.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, so I decided to hunt down one for myself.</li>
            <li> shot\\&quot; when I don&#x27;t mean to while drying my hair, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I returned the dryer thinking I could find something else down the road, and I saw this one for much less.  </li>
            <li> Other dryers whine in my ear and this one seems to be extremely strong but not too annoying.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair in half the time</li>
            <li> this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> It took well over an hour to dry my hair on the cold setting with high speed.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, thick hair</li>
            <li> Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil)</li>
            <li> I prefer a wider barrel opening; this one is quite narrow.  </li>
            <li> The holes aren&#x27;t even round - they form a flower pattern.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, the dryer is heavy, though I didn&#x27;t mind.     </li>
            <li> it is as has been stated a bit heavy - but does the job.</li>
            <li> Heavy and stopped working after .</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than it&#x27;s ever been after being dried.</li>
            <li> It has lots of power, but is way too heavy.  </li>
            <li> But after using it a few times, I suppose I got used to it because now that&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> This one lasted for five and a half years!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord, which she was really starting to like on the other unit.  </li>
            <li> Her other hair dryers have an annoying high pitched whine and at 5am it is even more annoying.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn&#x27;t even a bad dryer to begin with).  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> fry my hair, no static</li>
            <li> But it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> I had an old 1875W hairdryer that was horrible, so I started to look for its replacement and had major reservations about getting this one, but after reading the reviews I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> Until yesterday when I was in the middle of normal routine blow drying, the dryer started making popping sounds and immediately then started sparking on the base of the dryer where the cord connects to the dryer itself!</li>
            <li> It is now December and the heating element stopped working, so it now only blows cold air.  </li>
            <li> But, hey, at least they don&#x27;t fall off while I&#x27;m using them like some dryers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and</li>
            <li> My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about what dryer to buy, this is one product to seriously consider.</li>
            <li> QUITE SCARY to say the least.</li>
            <li> After recently purchasing and using a Conair product that was worthless, I decided to bite the bullet and buy another dryer.  </li>
            <li> There were small flames and smoke coming out of it which I immediately shut the dryer off but a couple of the sparks hit my arm which BURNED as well as my shirt!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the diffuser attachment that came is NOTHING like what is pictured.</li>
            <li> The on/off and heat setting buttons are in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed that the product lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself is disappointing.</li>
            <li> My hair looked limp and just terrible.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a 4 year warranty; can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> it was a very sad day.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I HATE blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> This dryer and its diffuser attachment are the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> we tried everything from the reset but to calling costumer service nothing helped horrible product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this hairdryer almost exactly a year ago.  Have loved it in every way until yesterday when it lost all heat.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer ever, I started doing my hair by myself after being a beauty salon junky, omg this is so amazing, is very useful and easy to handle, I do my hair in 15 minutes and after months of using it... I&#x27;ve never burned my hair or something like that.... Now even my mom uses it.... lol.... A must have...</li>
            <li> Very nice, sleek design.  I just got it, haven&#x27;t used it yet but the design itself makes it one of the best ones out there, if not the best.  The only thing that it is missing: a folding handle.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new Remington hair dryer!  It has been a good choice, I believe.  I especially like the long power cord.  It&#x27;s also very good not to get tangled.  My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that I had expected that the hair dryer would be quieter than it is.  I checked around before I purchased it, and one of the selling points is that it is supposed to operate more quiet than your average hair dryer, but I can&#x27;t really hear much of a difference, if any.  Regardless, I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li> This Remington D-2009 T-Studio dryer may be the best value on the market for this type of dryer.   Pros: Low-pitched, quiet motor, not too heavy, variety of heat and speed settings, very well made, dries with relatively low heat.  Cons: High setting so powerful I couldn&#x27;t use it to style my hair, and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer, I felt it dried out the ends.  Neutral: I prefer a wider barrel opening; this one is quite narrow.  If you want a powerful, quiet, well-made dryer, this is it.  If you want a gentler dryer, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Three heat settings, two speed fan and a cool air button.  We tried one other so called \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; hair dryer from our local retailer and returned it.  I read some of the reviews on here and suggested this unit to my wife.  Her other hair dryers have an annoying high pitched whine and at 5am it is even more annoying.  The tone of this unit is a VERY pleasant whirl sound of air, that comes from the unit.  After hearing this one I have suggested that my wife buy one for all of the family females as gifts over the next year.    Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord, which she was really starting to like on the other unit.  Although she was retracting it daily, so I wondered how many times it could be retracted before it would not work.</li>
            <li> Yes, I give this five stars because it does what the name says: dries hair. It does not dry my hair any better or worse than the $75 Babyliss model I bought from my salon three years ago. It IS not as heavy as that salon dryer, so that&#x27;s a good thing I guess. But otherwise, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer, and probably not any better than a $20 model.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, and is the best blow-dryer I&#x27;ve owned to date.  I had a previous model prior to this that lasted for approx 5 years.  Hoping this one will last even longer...</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer for my wife in March.  It is now December and the heating element stopped working, so it now only blows cold air.  It did a decent job when it worked but I am very disappointed that the product lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers.  I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  After using it once I am SO happy with it.  It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn&#x27;t even a bad dryer to begin with).  My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4\\&quot; Flat Iron [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4\\&quot; Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.  Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil) I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it&#x27;s smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity.  It&#x27;s amazing, I can&#x27;t see any reason to spend more.</li>
            <li> It is very good fan for the price. I noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us. The only thing that is a con is that it is not a light weight fan. Otherwise I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product not as loud as other hair dryers, although it is a bit heavier because of the material its made of...im happy with it. i just hope it last longer than other remington products.</li>
            <li> Remington D-2012 T-Studio Collection Tourmaline and Ceramic Hair Dryer I&#x27;m going to buy this hair dryer today it is fantastic!!!!!!!!!I I have long hair (goes to my mid-back) and barrowed my cousins t-studio dryer when I was visiting her.  I could not believe it dried my hair in half the time; my hair was soft, and sleek.  I just got back from my trip I was looking for this hair dryer and was considering the Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043 by Hot Tools Professional 1875 Tourmaline Ionic Professional Hair Dryer but Reading the reviews and by my own experience I&#x27;m going to buy this one</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/</li>
            <li> I think I have about 8 hairdryers and I can honestly say that this one does everything I want it to...dries my hair quickly, leaves it shiny and full (I don&#x27;t use attachments) and I think the noise level is very manageable.  Other dryers whine in my ear and this one seems to be extremely strong but not too annoying.  Definitely feels more solid then other dryers in the lower price ranges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who usually writes reviews (this is my first) but felt I had to share my experience with this one.    This dryer and its diffuser attachment are the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally curly hair and have tried a lot of different dryers and diffuser attachments over the years. I bought this because I needed a new dryer and this had great reviews. The diffuser in the picture is similar to one I had success with in the past. I was excited to receive it.    Unfortunately, the diffuser attachment that came is NOTHING like what is pictured. It is MUCH smaller (the bowl measures about 4 inches in diameter) and the fingers are short. The smaller bowl makes my drying time twice as long. The holes are MUCH larger than in the picture, which is important to someone with curly hair. It allows too much air flow which creates frizz. I have enough trouble trying to prevent frizz; I don&#x27;t need my dryer to be the main cause. The holes aren&#x27;t even round - they form a flower pattern. Here they chose a cutesy look over function.    The dryer itself is disappointing. Even on the lowest heat and power settings, the temperature is scalding. Combine that with the large holes in the diffuser and it&#x27;s a recipe for a burnt scalp. It took well over an hour to dry my hair on the cold setting with high speed. Like others have stated, the dryer is heavy, though I didn&#x27;t mind.     The overall performance is severely lacking. I found the product information and picture to be deceptive. I do not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is exactly what I had hoped it would be. It is very powerful, quite, and works very well.</li>
            <li> If you need a blow dryer that really packs a punch, look no further! This dryer straightens my hair and eliminates frizz so well that I don&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron unless I&#x27;m going for a super sleek look! I love the look and feel of this dryer, and the four year warranty rocks! I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I had an old 1875W hairdryer that was horrible, so I started to look for its replacement and had major reservations about getting this one, but after reading the reviews I took a chance.  I am soooo glad that I bought this hairdryer- it is AMAZING!  It dries my hair super fast, so what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great! It is light weight compare to my old hairdryer. It makes my hair look less coarse and softer. My old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse. I just love it!</li>
            <li> A dryer that meets all your styling needs.  It&#x27;s not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that&#x27;s UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to the information that&#x27;s included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that&#x27;s less prone to frizz, that probably won&#x27;t be necessary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  Well done, Remington.  An invaluable product for any styling arsenal.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to get a better hair dryer than the pedestrian big box store offerings.  The air flow is concentrated, so it takes significantly less time to dry your hair.  The cord is extra long and that is a nice to have.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, I was up north visiting my daughter who has a T3, I had forgotten to pack my dryer so I used hers. My hair looked limp and just terrible. My Remington T studio did a much better job on my hair than the expensive T3. I&#x27;m going to buy another one so I have a backup, I never realized how much I really loved this dryer until that trip.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; dryer and took it back because it felt like a toy, and didn&#x27;t have a warm setting like it said.  Just hot and fry.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this one based on Amazon reviews.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s feels like a pro dryer.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  It maybe a tad heavy, but it works so fast, it&#x27;s not an issue for me.  I wanted something that would last and work well.  It has a true cool setting.  My hair is soft and well behaved for a change.  Since I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has gotten more delicate and I almost quit using a hairdryer because it was so hard on my hair.  I thought I&#x27;d try again because sometimes I want my hair sleek instead of curly.&lt;br /&gt;Like the matte finish.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the attachments are hard to get on and off.  But, hey, at least they don&#x27;t fall off while I&#x27;m using them like some dryers I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;m a little concerned that they might break at some point while changing them, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer almost 2 years ago. Just yesterday the switch broke-- it was a very sad day. After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money. It is relatively quiet for the airflow it produces- no hi-pitched whine like some other models. And it is VERY POWERFUL! It is heavier than others, but I don&#x27;t mind getting a little extra muscle tone. It doesn&#x27;t have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom floor-- trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way. The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume. It is very versatile, with two blower settings and three heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the one I had would have lasted, but I&#x27;m not taking any chances with another dryer. This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Only gripes are 1) the switch breaking and 2) the cord is long (great) but it tends to get all twisted up on itself even though it was designed not to. For these reasons it fell just short of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update - November 2013**  Well, I bought it again. This one lasted for five and a half years! It bit the dust, and actually produced flames on it&#x27;s way out! They may have originated from the switch mechanism. It was a quite spectacular, and quite frightening, way for it to go. Because of safety concerns, I will not be purchasing this hair dryer again.</li>
            <li> NO issues with this dryer-- it is as has been stated a bit heavy - but does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought a T3 tourmaline dryer a while ago from Amazon and quickly found out that the seller (folica.com) is not an authorized dealer for T3 dryers and do not come with a manufacturers warranty.  I returned the dryer thinking I could find something else down the road, and I saw this one for much less.  I thought that since it had \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; in it, it would work pretty much the same as the T3.  Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work any better than my old ceramic con air.  So, if you&#x27;re expecting this dryer to perform like a tourmaline/ceramic/ionic hair dryer, think again.  Good for the money, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have this!  I love it!  I got it from Target on TPC for $29.99.  It&#x27;s the first hairdryer I have purchased in 13 years.  What a difference!  It dries my hair in half the time and it&#x27;s not incredibly loud.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and need to heat &amp; rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn&#x27;t feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6&#x27; cord, where the previous model had a 9&#x27; cord.  The cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn&#x27;t see a good reason to change it.  It probably won&#x27;t be a problem for you if you didn&#x27;t have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I&#x27;m back-brushing I don&#x27;t have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn&#x27;t blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.</li>
            <li> With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I&#x27;m in love. It doesn&#x27;t take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I&#x27;ve owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don&#x27;t accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer, but did want to upgrade to one that would be easier on my hair, since it is getting pretty long.  So far I really like the look and feel of this dryer.  When I set out to buy a nicer hair dryer, I expected to spend more money than this, so I was happy with the cost and value of this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact blow dryer a little over a year ago from a local retailer where I live and at first I love it!...It wasn&#x27;t as heavy as most hair dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past and loved the attachments it came with...I have somewhat frizzy dry hair but after applying my styling products, this dryer was amzing the way it smoothed my hair and in half the time that my previous blow dryers took!...Until yesterday when I was in the middle of normal routine blow drying, the dryer started making popping sounds and immediately then started sparking on the base of the dryer where the cord connects to the dryer itself! There were small flames and smoke coming out of it which I immediately shut the dryer off but a couple of the sparks hit my arm which BURNED as well as my shirt!!! QUITE SCARY to say the least. I plunged the dryer under water after unplugging the unit and letting it cool down for a period of time! I will NEVER buy another Remington product EVER AGAIN!!!...BE WARNED!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. It&#x27;s light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and it is fast. But it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. I have pretty thick hair and it cut the drying time in half, especially when straightening it. I love that it includes the difuser and concentrater. It&#x27;s sleek and very easy to use. However I keep hitting the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; when I don&#x27;t mean to while drying my hair, but not a big deal. Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  I have really thick hair and this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    [...]</li>
            <li> I was recently visiting my sister and asked to borrow her hair dryer.  From the minute I turned on the Remington I was impressed. It was very powerful, yet quiet and dried my hair very quickly. My hair which can be frizzy, looked better than usual. I immediately went to Amazon and ordered myself a dryer. Great dryer and great price!</li>
            <li> It works really great but is much bigger than I expected. It doesn&#x27;t fold for storage &amp; since I have storage issues &amp; I kept hitting myself in the head when I used it, I gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I HATE blow drying my hair but this is quick and easy. I love the attachments-- they are easy to put on but also stay put. I also think it looks great on my shelf.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I&#x27;ve used.  It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  The only drawback I can see is it&#x27;s quite large so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter kept borrowing my blow dryer until i finally purchased another (of the same) for her.  I love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair. My daughter has long, thick hair and it dries hers quickly as well.  It is light in weight and the airflow is controlled. I use mine daily and have not have any problems in the 18 months since i purchased it.</li>
            <li> I used an older version at my friend&#x27;s. I was absolutely amazed by how it&#x27;s so quiet regardless of the heat level AND my hair actually looks and feels soft and smooth after using it. I never knew a hair blow dryer can do that! Again, I&#x27;m probably from a nutshell. LOL Anyway, so I decided to hunt down one for myself. I actually got mine at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, because I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping. :P I tried it out at the store; they have plugged-in displays. This one is even quieter than my friend&#x27;s! I love it! My hair loves it too!</li>
            <li> Heavy and stopped working after . Worked well on my hair though but it was too heavy and didnt last long!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned!! It cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth, shiny and frizz-free. My hair looks like I just left the salon everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dryer for quite some time and was getting close to ordering a $200 dryer (but just couldn&#x27;t see actually spending that on a hair dryer).  But low and behold I took a chance on this one and absolutely love it!  I have wavy/curly hair that is very prone to frizziness and this has seemed to tame some of that chaos and makes straightening my hair really easy.  It has cut my drying time down by a few minutes, is quiet, and throws out a lot of air.  Compared to my last hair dryer this is like a little bit of heaven in the morning!  I would definitely recommend.  Also, it has a 4 year warranty; can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  On vacation I used my sisters &amp; was so impressed that once I got home, I went online &amp; ordered it.  This hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;ve had plenty over the years.  Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high. This one is very quiet, almost \\&quot;whooshing\\&quot; it dry.  Also, my hair is \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than it&#x27;s ever been after being dried. Could it really be the fact it is \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; or \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;?? No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the other reviewers for recommending this dryer.  After recently purchasing and using a Conair product that was worthless, I decided to bite the bullet and buy another dryer.  Going on Amazon to search for users&#x27; favorites, this Remington model was given a high rating and was in my price range.  After receiving it and using it once, all I can say is that the reviewers were spot on.  This is a great dryer!  Dries fast, high setting gives proper amount of heat to hold a curl with a roller brush and my hair looks so shiny afterwards.  Cord is long enough, it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and not too noisy.  I like it so much, I may buy another one just in case they discontinue this model.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about what dryer to buy, this is one product to seriously consider.</li>
            <li> my wife think this is dryer is really great! Lots of power, takes up less space than the old one.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I&#x27;ve tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it&#x27;s heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you&#x27;re used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn&#x27;t limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love love love this hair dryer.  It has a lot of power and a lot of heat.  The ceramic technology leaves my hair looking sleak and shinny.</li>
            <li> Very solid design and assembly.  Has a safety short fuse.  Pleasant and easy to use.  Pretty quiet.  My wife is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money. I recommend it for anyone--also great gift idea    UPDATE I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this hair dryer.  It has lots of power, but is way too heavy.  The on/off and heat setting buttons are in the wrong place.  I keep accidentally turning it off or changing the heat setting when I&#x27;m using it.  I like my previous hair dryer MUCH better!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is quite nice.  It has cool to hot tempts and has a push button to hold your style.  It comes with two attachments the do their job.</li>
            <li> Worked well, died after a year of use.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for years until the surge protector button on the plug kept popping out. I bought a Conair hair dryer at Wal Mart to replace it, got home, plugged it in, and couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap and loud it sounded. I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.   I&#x27;m completely sold on this hair dryer. The motor is quiet and drying time is short. The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first. But after using it a few times, I suppose I got used to it because now that&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> Gift for girlfriend. She love it and uses most of the attachments. She is pretty rough on dryers and this one has stood up to her abuse and her thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed a new blowdryer.I have heard all about ions, ceramic, tourmaline, etc. and decided it was time to upgrade. However, I did not want to spend a small fortune on a new dryer (hello, T3!) After much time was spent on looking at different models and brands, I finally settled on this product. It is wonderful! This blowdryer dried my hair in 5 minutes (I have very fine, short hair). My hair is incredibly shiny and frizz free! The dryer is a little heavy, but is constructed well - feels very sturdy in the hand. Best of all Remington gives you a 4 year warranty, longer than Revlon and Conair. I am extremely pleased with this product. I am glad I spent $30 instead of $300 on a T3.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a birthday gift along with the hair straighter this worked great for  her until it just stoped working out of nowhere we tried everything from the reset but to calling costumer service nothing helped horrible product</li>
            <li> Got it 5 years ago- still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, no static no frizz. Various speed settings allow for both quick and dirty drying and for painless styling!&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and apparently durable!</li>
