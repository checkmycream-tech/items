            <li>The most amazing skin moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best overall body products I have found!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the feel.  </li>
            <li>It has more of a citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li>so, I looked it up online and ordered it and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just love it.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, natural, pleasant smell, amazing.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it more if I to the right shipment,...</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Lemon Pledge, and the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li>But the scent is a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>Great when using hand sanitizers that dry out your skin!</li>
            <li>love it, fast shipment</li>
            <li>The lotion feels so good, especially for the weather we are having.</li>
            <li>I love it, nice moisture for dry skin areas.</li>
            <li>i can have the same nice lotion that the spa had</li>
            <li>not too greasy just right</li>
            <li>but i found it here on Amazon for a great price as usual.....</li>
            <li>but i am using it on a daily basis and my skin never felt better.</li>
            <li>I first used this at a place that did my mani/pedi.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the moisture!  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally sold in nail salons</li>
            <li>/&gt;it keeps the skin soft and smooth both in the winter when ur skin gets dry.</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and this was in DE.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the more moist lotions I have tried, but it&#x27;s not absolutely amazing.  </li>

            <li> This is by far the best skin cream on the market.Works great on my skin without an oily residue.Feels great going on and smells fantastic.Bought it for my wife but i am using it on a daily basis and my skin never felt better.It&#x27;s normally sold in nail salons so i&#x27;m told but i found it here on Amazon for a great price as usual.....</li>
            <li> not too greasy just right</li>
            <li> Sinks right in. Heavenly scent. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I first used this at a place that did my mani/pedi.  It smelled so good, do I asked what they used and if they sold it.  They did, and I got a tube.  I live in Alaska and this was in DE.  I couldn&#x27;t find it here, do ordered it on line. I, also, decided to order the pump type dispenser for the kitchen. Non-greasy, natural, pleasant smell, amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best overall body products I have found!  No smell not greasy just makes you feel smoother I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I had to buy the larger bottle to keep at home because the smaller one travels with me.  I also purchased an additional small one to keep on my desk at work.  Great when using hand sanitizers that dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> The nail shop I go to uses this product! It moisturizes your skin without being to oily or drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> Dream body olive oil is great for my skin. My skin is smooth and soft all day. I love it</li>
            <li> I would have liked it more if I to the right shipment,...I ordered the set and only received the pump size.  It did not have the accompanying tube.  Amazon gave me a refund for the tube, but I wanted the lotion instead. They said they couldn&#x27;t give me the lotion..why was that?. Very disappointed in this shipment.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! You can feel the difference when you use this on your skin. Has a pleasant smell and lasts. The price is more than fair, too.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the feel.  My husband even likes it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell girlie.  It has more of a citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> love it, fast shipment</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin care lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the very best lotion that i have ever used!  used by my nail salon.  you don&#x27;t need a lot!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good during a winter in I don&#x27;t know how long!  Thanks for the moisture!  Marvelous!</li>
            <li> This is one of the more moist lotions I have tried, but it&#x27;s not absolutely amazing.  What is more important is that the scent is atrocious and problematic.  It smells exactly like Lemon Pledge, and the smell is very strong.  Aside from not being a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; scent, it activated my asthma.  (&amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34; lemon scents are notorious asthma triggers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion-wise it&#x27;s fine, even good.  But the scent is a huge problem.  I cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Wait 2-3 minutes and the this is the best cream ever!</li>
            <li> The most amazing skin moisturizer I have ever used. Price is right and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  Pedicure recommended it to me because my feet always had so much dead skin.. I use it day and night and last pedicure i got i didnt even need my feet scraped!</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;it keeps the skin soft and smooth both in the winter when ur skin gets dry. and in the summer.</li>
            <li> My sister was the one who told me about this. The lotion feels so good, especially for the weather we are having. Keeps my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> at a spa they used this product and I asked if they could sell me some and they said no. so, I looked it up online and ordered it and glad I did. I love it, nice moisture for dry skin areas. i can have the same nice lotion that the spa had and I don&#x27;t have to go to the spa to get it.</li>
            <li> Excellent refreshing and greaseless</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  It absorbs well into the skin and has a very pleasant aroma.  Just love it.  Have used it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Someone gave me a bottle a few months ago and when I was close to running out, I went online and found the website.  Very generous amount for the price and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot of ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce! Very emollient and smells just slightly citrusy! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My friend brought olive oil hand cream back from her trip to Turkey. I loved and searched for it on line. No luck until I found Dream Olive Oil lotion and handcream on Amazon.  Love it love it !</li>
            <li> They used it in the nail spa that I go to and I really liked it, so I went on line to find it.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful for my dry skin. I never seen any lotion like this. It is good for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
