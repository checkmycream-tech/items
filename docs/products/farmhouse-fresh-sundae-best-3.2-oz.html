            <li> Wonderful and soft on the skin</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! I used ie for about 6 months , twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Its too natural ingredients and smells delicious .&lt;br /&gt;my skin was look horrible and i this helped to renewal it  .</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I think it smells gross. Not like chocolate, but more like paint. which is gross to just sit there and smell :|&lt;br /&gt;It did make my skin soft though, just a but disappointing that it smells gross.</li>
            <li> My clients LOVED this mask! It worked really well!</li>
            <li> Yet another mask that does exactly as it says on the label. It smells devine and made me skin so soft and smooth. With regular use my skin has become so much better, to the point I barely wear foundation any more.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  The sugar scrub works well to slough Off  dry skin and leaves it smooth and glowIng.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> i like it , ifelt my skin liftede</li>
            <li> It make my facial skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!! I love what&#x27;s in it, and what&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve used some other organic products that are a lot more expensive, and I think this works just as well if not better. My skin looks firmer and smoother. My husband even asked me if I had gone somewhere for a treatment.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOO good!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> It really does feel and smell amazing! The only thing I am disappointed about it- and its my fault- is I have tried the Pumpkin mask from Farmhouse fresh and loved the tingly- burn feel of getting all my pores ungunked. I just assumed this mask did the same thing and was just a different flavor. This one is mainly to leave skin tight, and soft. Very good if you&#x27;re looking for smooth soft skin!</li>
            <li> This mask leaves skin feeling smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom and it smells like heaven. The additional benefit is that is made in the U.S. So I feel good knowing that I am supporting a local company out of Texas.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask I like the smell and when I put it in my face and clean it I feel Soft Skin &amp; healthy</li>
            <li> I like all products from Farmhouse Fresh, and I have used alot of them, tonight I tried Sundae Best, and I am amazed as how soft and tight my face feels.

            <li> I bought it to my wife and my sister , they realy like it</li>
            <li> The description does NOT say it is not to be used if your skin is sensitive or rosacea-prone.  Otherwise it smells like chocolate and goes on smoothly.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like it but that I can&#x27;t use it. The warning is on the box and should be part of the description.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Keep returning for more.:)</li>
            <li> thank U, Initially appeared to be an excellent product; and I am now under experimentation</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t good for my skin at all. It irritated it</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Farmhouse fresh products and I love it so far. This chocolate mask is great.

            <li> Excellent and practical</li>
