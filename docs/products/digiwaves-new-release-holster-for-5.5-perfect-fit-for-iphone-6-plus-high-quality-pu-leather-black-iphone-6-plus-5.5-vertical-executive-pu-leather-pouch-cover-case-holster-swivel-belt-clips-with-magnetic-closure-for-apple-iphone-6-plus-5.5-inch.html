            <li>I have a slim case and my phone fits perfectly, just as they advertised.</li>

            <li>Plus holster is the best solution I&#x27;ve found so that I can carry my phone without having to carry a purse or shoulder bag to put it in (which I never did anyway even when I was carrying my purse/bag around).  </li>
            <li>Plus and Juice pack at Best Buy out of necessity.</li>
            <li>Close and swivels very good.</li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great holder for the iPhone 6</li>
            <li>And it looks great.</li>
            <li>Great case holds my iPhone plus with</li>
            <li>great.  </li>
            <li>Very nice case for iPhone 6 plus</li>
            <li>Then loved it.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly for iPhone 6 Plus even with a slim phone case.  </li>
            <li>Am very pleased with the purchase and the product.  </li>
            <li>Nice leather material and good plastic click.</li>
            <li>: it fits the iPhone 6 plus perfectly and it can be easily rotated into the most comfortable position e.g., vertical when walking, horizontal when sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think this case does a very good job of providing a belt mount without much bulk.  </li>
            <li>I too, love the swivel capability which comes in handy to reach into the pocket it might be covering.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and well-built, great magnet to keep flap down and fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Very secure.  </li>
            <li>And I love the swivel clip--I can move the phone away to access something in my pocket.</li>
            <li>No problem fitting my IPhone 6 plus with leather sleeve.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better to hold my iPhone 6</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>Plus is too big to fit in my pants pocket comfortably, this is the best thing ever.  </li>
            <li>The clip is strong and it rotates which helps a lot when sitting.</li>
            <li>At first I liked it.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Again the material is fine, it is just the color layer.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the cheap look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a snug fit</li>
            <li>While walking, I thought my phone was secure in this holster, but in fact it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW APR 2015:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have this product for a good two weeks when the clip broke on the back...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a full cover belt clip holster, this is rugged and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I rate it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Quick solution is Sharpie permanent ink pen to touch it up</li>
            <li>It is made with premium material and it is very durable!!</li>
            <li>I accidently broke the belt attachment off my first one and liked the case well enough to order another one to replace the original unit.</li>
            <li>It keeps it accessible and safe at the same time.</li>
            <li>I sometimes run errands  in sweatpants in the mornings and I needed something I could put my iPhone 6 plus in that would clip to my waist band because the phone would slide right out of my pockets.</li>
            <li>For iPhone 6 plus, the openings on the side (top) should be another 1/4 - 1/2 inch longer to be able to access the down button for volume control without removing the phone from the holster.</li>
            <li>Fit was tight for a few days, now it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The magnetic closure is top notch--it&#x27;s very powerful and really holds the flap down.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d rather have a tight, strong, gripped clip than something that will easily fall off.</li>
            <li>The Mophie is heavier and bigger all around, and fits the Grip Case covered iPhone easily.  </li>
            <li>The phone is so large, even vertically it would block my pocket otherwise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Had a protective case on my plus six and fits in very snugly.</li>
            <li>So go in with your eyes open on fit.  </li>
            <li>Received this digiwaves new release holster for the iPhone 6 plus in very speedy fashion.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend anyone with an iPhone 6 plus to purchase this case..</li>
            <li>I broke the part that swivels but they where kind enough to let me buy another half off.</li>
            <li>Leather case cover is fragile and is easily eroded by abrasion or chafing such as on auto seat belt or interior auto components.</li>
            <li>Fully protects my new iPhone 6</li>
            <li>I think I will need to get a new one in a year because the corners get dinged up.  </li>
            <li>Someone else makes a real leather version of this case, with a smaller flap, allowing headphone connections.  </li>
            <li>That leather case is too tight for a Speck Grip Case, and seems to be made for the bare phone only, or a really, really slim case, maybe like the Incipio.  </li>
            <li>I should also mention that the swivel clip that you hook onto your pants is very sturdy and holds on extremely tight and well.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, this is the only VERTICAL holster I can find that has my requirement for the J hook for the belt clip, and that can fit the iPhone 6 with the Speck Grip Case, which is necessary for my butter fingers...</li>
            <li> This faulty product cost me over $800 replacement value of my new iPhone 6 Plus because the magnetic closure did not securely seal.  </li>
            <li> Also, quality is not what I had expected, the liner inside has some creases (should be flat), but since there is so much space the screen is not touching the wall, so no need to worry about the creases scratching the screen.</li>
            <li> Way too much space inside, if the phone with case was 1/2&amp;#34; thick this holster would work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright kind of hard to get it out of the case in a hurry!!!!</li>
            <li> Flap too long and magnet not strong enough.</li>
            <li> This case will only accept an iPhone 6 Plus with a skin tight case.  </li>
            <li> Be careful in and out of car.</li>
            <li> As expected and as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all that the other reviewers said.  </li>
            <li> Other clips just don&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> There is no functional degradation, just cosmetic, the underlying gray color starts to show when the the black surface color gets dinged/cracked.  </li>
            <li> I even have trouble at times removing the holster from my pants the clip is so tightly gripped.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it a few months now with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, I&#x27;m not happy with this holster, can&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;perfect fit&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s definitely not high quality.</li>
            <li> I use it with my iPhone 6 Plus with a small case and it fits like a glove.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will hold up over the years if you used it every day all day</li>
            <li> One of the very few cases I found that meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat this holder for the price...</li>
            <li> I would order another, but needed to go on travel, so I was forced to buy a Mophie Hip Holster for iPhone 6</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> but I just hate carrying purses or shoulder bags</li>

            <li> Absolutely great holder for the iPhone 6 Plus. Exactly as advertised. I have a slim case and my phone fits perfectly, just as they advertised. The magnetic closure is top notch--it&#x27;s very powerful and really holds the flap down. And I love the swivel clip--I can move the phone away to access something in my pocket. The phone is so large, even vertically it would block my pocket otherwise. And it looks great.</li>
            <li> One of the very few cases I found that meets my needs. No problem fitting my IPhone 6 plus with leather sleeve. It has a swivel belt clip. It does not have the cheap look. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it. At first I liked it. Then loved it. Be careful in and out of car. I broke the part that swivels but they where kind enough to let me buy another half off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this case for my iPhone 6 Plus.  I like to have my phone attached to my belt and I think this case does a very good job of providing a belt mount without much bulk.  The iPhone is big enough and I wanted a case that is not too bulky.  This case will only accept an iPhone 6 Plus with a skin tight case.  I have the Apple slim case on my phone.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second case I purchased.  I accidently broke the belt attachment off my first one and liked the case well enough to order another one to replace the original unit.</li>
            <li> Flap too long and magnet not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly for iPhone 6 Plus even with a slim phone case.  Also, like the plastic swivel belt clip.</li>
            <li> I use it with my iPhone 6 Plus with a small case and it fits like a glove. The 360 click allows you to place it in the best position for you comfort. Nice leather material and good plastic click. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> As expected and as advertised. Leather case cover is fragile and is easily eroded by abrasion or chafing such as on auto seat belt or interior auto components. Has compact and neat appearance.</li>
            <li> For iPhone 6 plus, the openings on the side (top) should be another 1/4 - 1/2 inch longer to be able to access the down button for volume control without removing the phone from the holster.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and without any damage.Product was as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> I sometimes run errands  in sweatpants in the mornings and I needed something I could put my iPhone 6 plus in that would clip to my waist band because the phone would slide right out of my pockets. And I didn&#x27;t want to have to take the iPhone out if it&#x27;s case every time. This worked perfectly. It&#x27;s a snug fit but the phone slides in and out in its silicon case just fine. The clip is strong and it rotates which helps a lot when sitting. Not sure how it will hold up over the years if you used it every day all day but I&#x27;ve had it a few months now with no problems at all. Hard to beat this holder for the price...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have this product for a good two weeks when the clip broke on the back...</li>
            <li> I wish I had the option of wearing the phone sideways, but I imagine they had to make accommodations for such a big phone.</li>
            <li> Great case holds my iPhone plus with it&#x27;s protective cover</li>
            <li> excellent case for iPhone 6 plus</li>
            <li> This faulty product cost me over $800 replacement value of my new iPhone 6 Plus because the magnetic closure did not securely seal.  While walking, I thought my phone was secure in this holster, but in fact it wasn&#x27;t.  I bent over to do something, the magnetic closure opened and my phone slid out, smashed the screen and cost me over $800 to replace.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER HOLSTER!  I suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li> Better then I thought it would be. Had a protective case on my plus six and fits in very snugly. Close and swivels very good.</li>
            <li> This case last about 1 month. The clip broke</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better to hold my iPhone 6 Plus.  It&#x27;s all that the other reviewers said.  I&#x27;m a woman but I just hate carrying purses or shoulder bags so I go without.  This iPhone 6 Plus holster is the best solution I&#x27;ve found so that I can carry my phone without having to carry a purse or shoulder bag to put it in (which I never did anyway even when I was carrying my purse/bag around).  Since the iPhone 6 Plus is too big to fit in my pants pocket comfortably, this is the best thing ever.  I too, love the swivel capability which comes in handy to reach into the pocket it might be covering.  Sturdy and well-built, great magnet to keep flap down and fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly.  I should also mention that the swivel clip that you hook onto your pants is very sturdy and holds on extremely tight and well.  I have no fear of this holster fall off.  I even have trouble at times removing the holster from my pants the clip is so tightly gripped.  But I&#x27;d rather have a tight, strong, gripped clip than something that will easily fall off.</li>
            <li> Fully protects my new iPhone 6 Plus.  If you&#x27;re looking for a full cover belt clip holster, this is rugged and does the job.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice case for iPhone 6 plus</li>
            <li> falling apart already within 3 weeks. Leather is wearing off on certian spots and looks like Ive had the case for over a year! Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> LOOKS: it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34; at all and it looks quite &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34;;&lt;br /&gt;FUNCTION: it fits the iPhone 6 plus perfectly and it can be easily rotated into the most comfortable position e.g., vertical when walking, horizontal when sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days and I will provide an update in a month or so, if indeed it falls apart as reported by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright kind of hard to get it out of the case in a hurry!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this case. It is made with premium material and it is very durable!! I rate it a full 5 stars. Thank you and I highly recommend anyone with an iPhone 6 plus to purchase this case..</li>
            <li> UPDATE SEP 2015: After about 5 months, the clip broke at the hinge pins and holster is unusable.  Unfortunately, this is the only VERTICAL holster I can find that has my requirement for the J hook for the belt clip, and that can fit the iPhone 6 with the Speck Grip Case, which is necessary for my butter fingers... I would order another, but needed to go on travel, so I was forced to buy a Mophie Hip Holster for iPhone 6 Plus and Juice pack at Best Buy out of necessity. I probably will buy another of these after the Mophie breaks.  The Mophie is heavier and bigger all around, and fits the Grip Case covered iPhone easily.  ORIGINAL REVIEW APR 2015: Fits the bill for me and my iPhone 6 Plus with Speck CandyShell Grip Case.  Fit was tight for a few days, now it is just perfect. FWIW, this case will be loose with just a bare phone.  Someone else makes a real leather version of this case, with a smaller flap, allowing headphone connections.  That leather case is too tight for a Speck Grip Case, and seems to be made for the bare phone only, or a really, really slim case, maybe like the Incipio.  So go in with your eyes open on fit.  The rotating clip with the J shape hook is the set up for belt use.  This was the key feature for me.  Other clips just don&#x27;t do it.  The J shaped hook is critical for security and this big phone.  I have used this on dress pants every day with a belt, as well as jeans and shorts, also with a belt.  Very secure.  The only issue with this case, since it is Polyurethane (PU) is that it does not wear as well as leather.  I think I will need to get a new one in a year because the corners get dinged up.  There is no functional degradation, just cosmetic, the underlying gray color starts to show when the the black surface color gets dinged/cracked.  Again the material is fine, it is just the color layer.  Quick solution is Sharpie permanent ink pen to touch it up</li>
            <li> Received this digiwaves new release holster for the iPhone 6 plus in very speedy fashion.  I have a sena Lugano case on my phone and it fits in this holster great.  Am very pleased with the purchase and the product.  It is just what I had in mind for carrying my phone around.  It keeps it accessible and safe at the same time.</li>
            <li> Way too much space inside, if the phone with case was 1/2&amp;#34; thick this holster would work.  Also, quality is not what I had expected, the liner inside has some creases (should be flat), but since there is so much space the screen is not touching the wall, so no need to worry about the creases scratching the screen. To sum it up, I&#x27;m not happy with this holster, can&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;perfect fit&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s definitely not high quality.</li>
