            <li>These are great for cleaning my  face and just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>They work great and are just the right size.</li>
            <li>Price is great and shipment is fast!</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping cost more than the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these sponges for cleaning my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>have gotten more than a handful of uses for the sponges I&#x27;ve used already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for cleansing my  face for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely thing that you could use to wash your face.</li>
            <li>much more I can say</li>
            <li>These are great sponage they have held up very well.</li>
            <li>I have used the sponges for many years and love them, but the image and description of this item is deceiving.</li>
            <li>These are more like loofa sponges.</li>
            <li>For the seller, the items were delivered fast and in a good condition.</li>
            <li>These sponges are not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Fine product, but wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse clean or throw in the washing machine for periodic cleaning (in a delicates bag so it doesn&#x27;t get lost).  </li>
            <li>This is my second order from this vendor and the quality difference between the two was great.</li>
            <li>Work great, and they last along time</li>
            <li>I am not using them on my face but for pottery because they fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend nicely to fit in the crevices of the face, around the nose and eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many facial sponges in my life, but these are top quality!</li>
            <li>Now I can do it fast and easy!</li>
            <li>I use these to clean her eyes and nose at night.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are as described and very soft and nice for removing make up.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it and these are pretty much just like those.</li>
            <li>as expected; these are GREAT for washing your face, more gentle than wash cloths, and they hold up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They become soft once placed in water and are very easy to clean with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These cleansing facial sponges are great!.They are soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>they dry out  they are a good for washing your face.  </li>
            <li>They are also very brittle and will break easy.</li>
            <li>Each sponge close to 1/2 \\&quot;thickness after absorbed water.</li>
            <li>Really liked the thickness and size (quality); larger then retail stores.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are good for cleansing the face; however they can be very rough on the face.</li>
            <li>I liked that its natural, a bit soft on my face so its safe for sensitive skin and genital for removing masks and cleanser, but nothing else.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend runs a small spa and offices massages and facials and needed these for her spa, the prices in locals stores where high these were a very good price</li>
            <li>I have used facial sponges for years and have been looking for great facial sponges since then.</li>
            <li>Exactly like what the esthecticians use in a spa, they provide gentle yet effective cleansing, i would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Very dinky!</li>
            <li>I wanted more like a facial sponge used in facials.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these sponges,  as I bought them from a private label make up place in Chicago that has recently closed.</li>
            <li>They are going directly in the trash, hoping my skin will recover quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, the sponges are very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They work well to gently lift off makeup, can be rinsed and reused.</li>
            <li>More than what expected</li>
            <li>These do the trick, they cleanse very well,  </li>
            <li>They are as rough as sandpaper and resemble shredded wheat more than sponges.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them&lt;br</li>
            <li>when wet... work fine.</li>
            <li>But....since I cannot find facial sponges at any other store, I am happy to at least find a facsimile of the original.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges--just the right size for my small hands, they really help cleanser lather up, and you can rinse them out and they last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These would probable be better used on someone&#x27;s dry crackly feet but definitely NOT on anyone&#x27;s face!!</li>
            <li>With a few extra rinses my face is clean and soap free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do be informed, these sponges do visually and physically shrink a bit when they dry after use, but will become usable once placed in water again.&lt;br /&gt;After more than a month of use, the sponges I used have not broken or fallen apart.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, they are half the thickness of the original</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hard to find at drugstores for some reason, so I was really pleased to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent and just enough texture</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>I threw my whole pack away and had to order from a different vendor.</li>
            <li>In the picture it looks like the sponges are soft but they are not at all.</li>
            <li>These are a bit soft for my liking.</li>
            <li>Unless, of course, someone wants to take off several layers of skin.</li>
            <li>They are natural and I think they are probably made of old luffa&#x27;s core fiber.</li>
            <li>As a teenager I used to use buff puffs to cleanse my face which are pretty rough</li>
            <li>Small enough that it easily dries between uses.  </li>
            <li>you can  barely wash your face with it</li>
            <li>The sponges itself were OK but not great.</li>
            <li>I use one for a few weeks and then throw them away because they aren&#x27;t even worth washing in the washing machine and reusing them.</li>
            <li>They are very thin - would have liked a &amp;#34;normal size&amp;#34; cleansing sponge.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; are hard and rough, more for scrubbing grout than one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>it is soft and also it is big enough to hold in hand.</li>
            <li>I do facial peels at home and the days following when your skin is still a bit sensitive, cleanse my face that something that isn&#x27;t abrasive.  </li>
            <li>was worried these sponges would be pretty harsh similar to the buff puff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These sponges may be good for scraping feet, but are bad for facial care.</li>

            <li> These sponges may be good for scraping feet, but are bad for facial care.</li>
            <li> I agree with one review that they are more like loofa, sliced very thin with exposed cut edges on one side.</li>
            <li> They are often hard to find locally plus with a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The seller stated on the questions &amp; answer area that these get soft when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, not really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine using a coarse, rough wet sponge on your face -yep, that&#x27;s what it feels</li>
            <li> They are super thin and have smell which is not naturel.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time since they will have limited use in the painting of reborn dolls I got them for.</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get to me.....</li>
            <li> These are not natural sponges as depicted on website, but are what appears to be compressed paper or cardboard.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what these are made from but they are not a natural sponge.</li>
            <li> Very soft and not too small for when I removed cleansers and masks off my clients faces during facials.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to go with these sponges make sure you rub your face very gently with them, so that it does not leave a mark or make acne worst.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to use them every day though because they can exacerbate dry skin.</li>
            <li> also like the fact the sponges add a little exfoliation component when I use them in my facials and add the extra perk of the spa feel.</li>
            <li> just that its a bit rough for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are extremely rough and don&#x27;t expand with water.</li>
            <li> They are sponges...they get wet...</li>
            <li> They are extremely rough to the point where you can probably use them for sanding.</li>
            <li> Falls apart after approximately three gentle uses.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh, in fact I cant think of what I will actually use these for.</li>
            <li> They are too rough to be used on skin.</li>
            <li> Sponges were very rough.  </li>
            <li> I thought they would expand a little when wet.  </li>
            <li> these sponges were about 1/2 as thick as the last ones I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Still do the job, but would like to find the thicker sponges.</li>
            <li> These are too thick for use with facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I find it weird that shipping should be more expensive than the sponges themselves.</li>
            <li> little sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are thinner than a regular sponge but tough.  </li>
            <li> Use everyday.</li>
            <li> Very rough!!  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like that it smell bad when I dip it in the water, and the fact that it came under the label (kitchen/ Dinning), which lighten me that its no special from my normal \\&quot;dish wash\\&quot; sponge!.</li>
            <li> The pads are very hard and rough.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I thought the picture of the thin sponges were because they were compressed and once they were wet would expand.</li>
            <li> Hated to do masks because then you spent so much time to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I like but does the job.</li>
            <li> not sure I would order them again!</li>
            <li> They are so thin and small...</li>
            <li> They are definitely not good quality.</li>
            <li> This one is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these facial cleansing sponges.</li>
            <li> The second order was very disappointing with the sponges being of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> False advertisement.</li>
            <li> What is wrong with this product?</li>
            <li> I chose the wrong ones.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Price is great and shipment is fast! What can you ask for? Great deal.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Very absorbent and just enough texture</li>
            <li> These are great--quantity and quality.  Nice size for washing face and substantial.  Easy to rinse clean or throw in the washing machine for periodic cleaning (in a delicates bag so it doesn&#x27;t get lost).  Small enough that it easily dries between uses.  Great addition to your beauty/cleansing routine.  Goodbye makeup-stained washcloths!</li>
            <li> The sponges itself were OK but not great. I liked that its natural, a bit soft on my face so its safe for sensitive skin and genital for removing masks and cleanser, but nothing else. What I didn&#x27;t like that it smell bad when I dip it in the water, and the fact that it came under the label (kitchen/ Dinning), which lighten me that its no special from my normal \\&quot;dish wash\\&quot; sponge!. Also, the shipping cost more than the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the seller, the items were delivered fast and in a good condition.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges for cleaning my face and neck.  I use one for cleaning morning and evening and replace this sponge weekly.</li>
            <li> This is my second order from this vendor and the quality difference between the two was great. The second order was very disappointing with the sponges being of inferior quality. I do not recommend them.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I used to use buff puffs to cleanse my face which are pretty rough feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried these sponges would be pretty harsh similar to the buff puff.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, the sponges are very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I use these sponges when wiping off cleanser and rinsing off a face mask application when I give myself facials.&lt;br /&gt;They become soft once placed in water and are very easy to clean with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten more than a handful of uses for the sponges I&#x27;ve used already.&lt;br /&gt;Do be informed, these sponges do visually and physically shrink a bit when they dry after use, but will become usable once placed in water again.&lt;br /&gt;After more than a month of use, the sponges I used have not broken or fallen apart.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact the sponges add a little exfoliation component when I use them in my facials and add the extra perk of the spa feel.</li>
            <li> Very rough!!  Couldn&#x27;t see using this on my face.  Maybe my feet.</li>
            <li> Each sponge close to 1/2 \\&quot;thickness after absorbed water. it is soft and also it is big enough to hold in hand.</li>
            <li> good product for the price.</li>
            <li> These sponges are as described and very soft and nice for removing make up.  I highly recommend them&lt;br /&gt;although I find it weird that shipping should be more expensive than the sponges themselves.</li>
            <li> This sponges are terrible! They are definitely not good quality. What a waste of my money! And as always the client looses as you do not receive credit. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Amazon should not carry this item.</li>
            <li> These are great because they hold water well and don&#x27;t drip on your clothing as you&#x27;re washing your face.  They&#x27;re hard to find at drugstores for some reason, so I was really pleased to find them on Amazon.  Good value too.</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get to me.....not sure I would order them again!</li>
            <li> These are not natural sponges as depicted on website, but are what appears to be compressed paper or cardboard.  I would not recommend these to be used as intended.</li>
            <li> These are not like the ones that I used to get at Sephora - very harsh on the face - was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was not what I was expecting.  I thought they would expand a little when wet.  Nope.</li>
            <li> Use everyday. Gave also as a gift and the friend raved about them</li>
            <li> Please understand this is durable little sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Its just that its a bit rough for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.. its good deal.</li>
            <li> these are great, good price semi-exfoliates as it cleans.</li>
            <li> These sponges are GREAT!! Wished I would have ordered 3 packages of them!! I will be ordering more of them!! They do the job that I need them to!!</li>
            <li> These are the same sponges my aesthetician uses. They work well to gently lift off makeup, can be rinsed and reused. They are also inexpensive enough to toss when they are well used.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend runs a small spa and offices massages and facials and needed these for her spa, the prices in locals stores where high these were a very good price and she is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I was over abrasive mits and scrubbies for my face and wanted something softer. I had a facial recently and the girl used something like this. I really liked it and these are pretty much just like those.</li>
            <li> Very soft and not too small for when I removed cleansers and masks off my clients faces during facials.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these facial cleansing sponges. My facialist uses them and recommended I buy some for use at home. I found these and was so disappointed with them once I got them. They are so thin and small...I use one for a few weeks and then throw them away because they aren&#x27;t even worth washing in the washing machine and reusing them.</li>
            <li> Awesome, these are solvent resistant and can be cut for replacement of solvent absorbent sponges in eco solvent printers.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like they are advertised in the photo. They are extremely rough and don&#x27;t expand with water. I threw my whole pack away and had to order from a different vendor. Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I like but does the job. With a few extra rinses my face is clean and soap free.</li>
            <li> I have used facial sponges for years and have been looking for great facial sponges since then. This one is not a good product.  They are super thin and have smell which is not naturel. The package comes with 12 sponges and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna used these for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually just found out that this is my repurchase. My first purchase was in 2013 and I had actually very good experience! What is wrong with this product?</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Exactly like what the esthecticians use in a spa, they provide gentle yet effective cleansing, i would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> More than what expected</li>
            <li> Work great, and they last along time</li>
            <li> Sponges were very rough.  Could not use them to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> These are great ..quality as described.</li>
            <li> These cleansing facial sponges are great!.They are soft and very good quality. I am very happy with my purchase and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> DOnt like it this time..the sponges were thinner than the last ones i had ordered ..but did come on time. wish they made the thicker ones..you can  barely wash your face with it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Really liked the thickness and size (quality); larger then retail stores.  I have used this product for cleansing my  face for many years.  These sponges are not always easy to find.  This will last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely thing that you could use to wash your face.</li>
            <li> these sponges were about 1/2 as thick as the last ones I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Still do the job, but would like to find the thicker sponges.</li>
            <li> Time saver! Hated to do masks because then you spent so much time to wash your face. Now I can do it fast and easy!</li>
            <li> The seller stated on the questions &amp; answer area that these get soft when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, not really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine using a coarse, rough wet sponge on your face -yep, that&#x27;s what it feels like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would probable be better used on someone&#x27;s dry crackly feet but definitely NOT on anyone&#x27;s face!!</li>
            <li> These are regular sponges that are cut into circles.  They are about 2 inches across kind of the size of a SOS pad&lt;br /&gt;They are thinner than a regular sponge but tough.  I am not using them on my face but for pottery because they fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Not much more I can say</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The pads are very hard and rough. Will not use on my face for fear of scarring.</li>
            <li> I used to like these. BUT this time I reordered and they are NOT THE SAME as they used to be. Cheaper quality! Disappointing.</li>
            <li> as expected; these are GREAT for washing your face, more gentle than wash cloths, and they hold up. texture feels nice, too.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I like the way they&#x27;re sold. They are often hard to find locally plus with a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These are great sponage they have held up very well.I even though them in the washer(,air dry)must have for all women.</li>
            <li> They are sponges...they get wet...they dry out  they are a good for washing your face.  Good quality sponges though...not that junk you get at the dollar store that disintegrates once they touch water.  I like them....I think they will last a while</li>
            <li> These are about 1/3 of an inch when wet... work fine. Nothing special, but not bad.  Will last a long time since they will have limited use in the painting of reborn dolls I got them for.</li>
            <li> These sponges are good for cleansing the face; however they can be very rough on the face. In the picture it looks like the sponges are soft but they are not at all. If you do decide to go with these sponges make sure you rub your face very gently with them, so that it does not leave a mark or make acne worst.</li>
            <li> False advertisement. I bought these based on the written measurements in the description, and they are thinner than that. Very dinky!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what these are made from but they are not a natural sponge.</li>
            <li> I do facial peels at home and the days following when your skin is still a bit sensitive, cleanse my face that something that isn&#x27;t abrasive.  These do the trick, they cleanse very well,  I just dab my sponge with my Cetaphil bar and wash away.  They&#x27;re also good for travel.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought the picture of the thin sponges were because they were compressed and once they were wet would expand. They are very thin - would have liked a &amp;#34;normal size&amp;#34; cleansing sponge. They serve the purpose, but won&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> I have used sponges like this for years and years. This kind will at best not ruin your skin, though I did break out completely after using one once. They are extremely rough to the point where you can probably use them for sanding. They are also very brittle and will break easy. They are going directly in the trash, hoping my skin will recover quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these sponges,  as I bought them from a private label make up place in Chicago that has recently closed. However, they are half the thickness of the original and I am a bit disappointed in the quality. Don&#x27;t think they will hold up as well. But....since I cannot find facial sponges at any other store, I am happy to at least find a facsimile of the original.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than I thought they would be. But I do like the fact that they are softer looking than pictured.</li>
            <li> Love these! Great for keeping my skin nice and fresh!</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning my  face and just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> These are a bit soft for my liking. I don&#x27;t feel like they are actually getting any dirt off my face.</li>
            <li> I have a tiny 4lb Yorkie who likes to nuzzle into the dirt and bushes in the yard.  I use these to clean her eyes and nose at night.  They work great and are just the right size.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many facial sponges in my life, but these are top quality! I am a certified aesthetician, so I will definitely order these again!</li>
            <li> these sponges are great.</li>
            <li> Falls apart after approximately three gentle uses.</li>
            <li> As expected. Simple facial cleansing sponges. Could have bought at Walmart for the same price. Fine product, but wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!!! These are loofahs, not sponges. I have used the sponges for many years and love them, but the image and description of this item is deceiving. Plus, the seller does not allow returns so I am stuck with a product I cannot use!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. These are more like loofa sponges. Need to return. I wanted more like a facial sponge used in facials.</li>
            <li> Too abrasive for use on the face.</li>
            <li> These sponges may be good for scraping feet, but are bad for facial care. Unless, of course, someone wants to take off several layers of skin.</li>
            <li> These arrived looking nothing like the photo.  The &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; are hard and rough, more for scrubbing grout than one&#x27;s face.  I agree with one review that they are more like loofa, sliced very thin with exposed cut edges on one side.</li>
            <li> These are the worst sponges I have ever seen.  They are as rough as sandpaper and resemble shredded wheat more than sponges.  They don&#x27;t even hold water.  The reviews I read that said the sponges were just like the ones aestheticians use could not have been referring to the same product.  The entire package went into the trash because they were a non-returnable item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these sponges would be so abrasive. I was purchasing these for my esthetics practice to remove cleansers and masks. Way too harsh, in fact I cant think of what I will actually use these for. Likely nothing.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges--just the right size for my small hands, they really help cleanser lather up, and you can rinse them out and they last. Have to be careful not to use them every day though because they can exacerbate dry skin.</li>
            <li> There were several options when choosing facial cleansing sponges on Amazon.  I chose the wrong ones.  These are too thick for use with facial cleansers.  They don&#x27;t bend nicely to fit in the crevices of the face, around the nose and eyes.  I&#x27;m using them but not that happy with them.</li>
            <li> They are natural and I think they are probably made of old luffa&#x27;s core fiber. They are too rough to be used on skin. I saw the review and couldn&#x27;t believe they could do the facial cleansing job. They can hurt the skin. Disappointed!</li>
