            <li>nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I use it after it healed a bit it gave it that nice cooling feeling</li>
            <li>Try a warm peppermint foot bath/scrub with a pumice stone before you put on this cream.  </li>
            <li>A great mix of mint and sweet which kind of reminded me of chocolate candy cane bark.....</li>
            <li>Very easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and effective at keeping calluses at bay.</li>

            <li>This stuff is magic on my feet.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my hubby when he started using all of my more pricy foot lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worse than that, the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; is more like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>so I could have gotten a better deal on the price through amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Your feet will love the at home pampering...</li>
            <li>Really a favorite skin cream.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this product soon.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more menthol feel on my skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as an all over lotion, but I do use it for more than just the recommended &amp;#34;foot and leg&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for any area needing some extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product with good ingredients, and It really does smell like peppermint candy.</li>
            <li>Smells great, has a smooth light consistency just right for feet/legs.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice, thick lotion and it is almost as nice giving a foot rub as getting it as your hands are nicely moisturized and smell great.  </li>
            <li>, I have never had a more comfortable summer.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet smell great and feel soft.</li>
            <li>some may find the scent a bit strong, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It is wonderfully rich, creamy and so minty it makes my feet tingle.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rich and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I do a little massage every night on my feet and calves and they feel great after using this cream.  </li>
            <li>Smells gorgeous, soaks quickly into skin, lasts a long time, very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>It is thick, rich, herbal - great scent.  </li>
            <li>Just right to apply to feet before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Smell is slightly strong, so may not be recommended for those sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five because I don&#x27;t like the fragrance very much.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely!  </li>
            <li>Yep, and I would seek out more of the Deep Steep line.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too much peppermint.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a great feel to it (not greasy, not too thin, not too think).</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>and it really helps soften them..</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cream to use to rub into your feet right before you go to bed to help soften dry heels and other spots on your feet.  </li>
            <li>A nice rich cream that softens and soothes tired feet at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I did not find it to be any better than other products that I have used.</li>
            <li>Perfect for tired aching feet after a long day.</li>
            <li>He is on his feet all day so the mint-tingle from the lotion feels good when he finally gets to sit down and put his feet up.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of your product line, especially the foot care cream.</li>
            <li>But with this cream, I give them a little more attention.  </li>
            <li>but it lingered for hours and all you want is for your body to feel normal again.</li>
            <li>My dr. Told me I had to take better care of my feet as I had cracked callouses and overall dry skin, which put my feet at risk for infection.  </li>
            <li>I threw it in the trash as I don&#x27;t want it anywhere near me.</li>
            <li>That being said, this lotion is not tested on animals, it is made of natural extracts and there are no chemicals or preservatives in the lotion.  </li>
            <li>The product smells like peppermint and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I recently got a pedicure and the attendant said that aquaphor healing ointment  in the tube is what she would recommend.</li>
            <li>It help the old skin on the bottom also I cut my foot on side</li>
            <li>I was alittle unsure of it when I ordered it, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I can put it on and then put my socks on right after with that wet feeling you get from some creams.</li>
            <li>This was my first Deep Steep product and the reason that I bought several  others.</li>
            <li>Very soothing after a long day.  </li>

            <li> Smells great, has a smooth light consistency just right for feet/legs.  Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  rejuvenates your feet in no time at all.  Smell is slightly strong, so may not be recommended for those sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> This is a very thick moisturizing cream.  Just right to apply to feet before going to bed.  It takes a little while to absorb, so may need to put on some socks.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five because I don&#x27;t like the fragrance very much.  It&#x27;s a stronger mint smell than I care for.</li>
            <li> My dr. Told me I had to take better care of my feet as I had cracked callouses and overall dry skin, which put my feet at risk for infection.  So tried this foot lotion.  It felt wonderful And kept my feet in better shape.  Calluses are not cracked and split and do not hurt.  I put it on the first time before a bike ride and my friend kept telling me how great I smelled.  Very pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic on my feet. It&#x27;s refreshing and effective at keeping calluses at bay.</li>
            <li> I just got a tester of this in my November Eco-Emi box and it&#x27;s awesome, soaks right in and smells frakkin delicious! &#x3D;D I just ordered a foot stick for my mom. ^_^</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby when he started using all of my more pricy foot lotion. He loves it after a hot shower after a hard day. He is on his feet all day so the mint-tingle from the lotion feels good when he finally gets to sit down and put his feet up. I started using it a bit too. Not greasy, soaks right in. Feels good.</li>
            <li> Addicted!  Yes, I am.........and proud of it!  I have been using this deep steep cream for years!!!  It is the perfect partner to a good foot rub.  The smell is invigorating and the cream is luscious!  I always stock up on this stuff.  Delicious!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product with good ingredients, and It really does smell like peppermint candy.</li>
            <li> The scent is overpowering unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like food ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Worse than that, the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; is more like a burning sensation. The burning feeling lingers for hours and is hard to get rid of. Maybe it&#x27;s too much peppermint. I washed my feet to try to get rid of the feeling but it lingered for hours and all you want is for your body to feel normal again. I threw it in the trash as I don&#x27;t want it anywhere near me.</li>
            <li> Wow, I found this foot cream in a little shop while vacationing.  My only regret was not knowing about it sooner so I could have gotten a better deal on the price through amazon.  That being said, this lotion is not tested on animals, it is made of natural extracts and there are no chemicals or preservatives in the lotion.  It is a nice, thick lotion and it is almost as nice giving a foot rub as getting it as your hands are nicely moisturized and smell great.  A great mix of mint and sweet which kind of reminded me of chocolate candy cane bark.....it leaves your feet, legs (and hands) nicely moisturized.  Would I recommend?  Absolutely!  Buy again?  Yep, and I would seek out more of the Deep Steep line.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The product smells like peppermint and leaves your skin soft. I did not find it to be any better than other products that I have used. I recently got a pedicure and the attendant said that aquaphor healing ointment  in the tube is what she would recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is hypoallergenic (for me), softens &amp; refreshes my feet &amp; extends the pedi day softness. Luxurious feeling! Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> A nice rich cream that softens and soothes tired feet at the end of the day.  This is a good cream to use to rub into your feet right before you go to bed to help soften dry heels and other spots on your feet.  I do a little massage every night on my feet and calves and they feel great after using this cream.  I also like the peppermint candy smell.  It&#x27;s very soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It is thick and really helps with my dry feet.</li>
            <li> Smells gorgeous, soaks quickly into skin, lasts a long time, very concentrated.  What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
            <li> The smell alone will keep me coming back for this product.  The lotion has a great feel to it (not greasy, not too thin, not too think). It cools your feet and that feeling lasts longer than I thought it would.  I am a person who does not like &#x27;feet&#x27; - and usually just stuff them in my socks and shoes and go.  But with this cream, I give them a little more attention.  I have also tried some of your shower gels and a body scrub.  I will definitely buy more of your product line, especially the foot care cream.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have feet issues and decided to try this and it really helps. I will have to stock up!</li>
            <li> I expected a minty feeling that lasted on my feet.  Not so.  Smells good but didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> i gave it a five because it is great on my feet It help the old skin on the bottom also I cut my foot on side I use it after it healed a bit it gave it that nice cooling feeling</li>
            <li> Very soothing after a long day.  Warning:  some may find the scent a bit strong, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It is thick, rich, herbal - great scent.  I put it on my feet with socks and it really helps soften them.. Try a warm peppermint foot bath/scrub with a pumice stone before you put on this cream.  Your feet will love the at home pampering...</li>
            <li> This was my first Deep Steep product and the reason that I bought several  others. It is wonderfully rich, creamy and so minty it makes my feet tingle. Really a favorite skin cream.</li>
            <li> I use this in my business and clients seem to love it.  Good texture and smell</li>
            <li> this stuff works so well, I have never had a more comfortable summer.</li>
            <li> 4th tube and works as well as European products three times the price</li>
            <li> Great foot cream. Very soothing. Not sticky or greasy. I can put it on and then put my socks on right after with that wet feeling you get from some creams. Also love the peppermint.</li>
            <li> Heck yes!! So amazing!! Will be a repeat buy for me!! Kinda reminds me of jack blacks hand creme in the respect that it&#x27;s non greasy!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I was alittle unsure of it when I ordered it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will be ordering more of this product soon.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick, which I like, however the smell is truly candy mint, too much!. I was hoping it would be more menthol feel on my skin</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Great smell and it&#x27;s rich and moisturizing without being greasy. I don&#x27;t use it as an all over lotion, but I do use it for more than just the recommended &amp;#34;foot and leg&amp;#34; cream. It is perfect for any area needing some extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Gave this for Christmas and the recipients were very happy!!  Very easy transaction.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff.  I use the foot cream and foot stick every night and visions of candy canes dance through my head.</li>
            <li> This smells so wonderful. I love it. Makes my feet smell great and feel soft. Perfect for tired aching feet after a long day.</li>
