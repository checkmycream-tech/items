            <li>this is the best set for clearing hair.works</li>
            <li>Does a very good job!</li>
            <li>Works great for the netherparts.</li>
            <li>Great Package...</li>
            <li>A Great pair...</li>
            <li>Love them!!</li>
            <li>I used it for one week and loved it.  </li>
            <li>best performance for close sensitive shave!</li>
            <li>; is my favorite kind of euphemism.  </li>
            <li>Both products are safe, effective, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If you have more than peach fuz...</li>
            <li>then you may be better off buying a body groomer</li>
            <li>I use AA Enloop rechargeable batteries in each product, though if you use a C-battery in the 412 it does seem to give off slightly more power.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also just as safe as well.</li>
            <li>(it actually worked best when it wasn&#x27;t pulled</li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for this combo without any other &amp;#34;value added&amp;#34; products included.</li>
            <li>well / easy to use.</li>
            <li>Both products are easy on your skin</li>
            <li>Great if you want to keep yourself smooth every day by touching up daily.</li>
            <li>However, for the surrounding areas and bikini line, I could never get a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Mangroomer Pro Body Groomer which I&#x27;d say is more versatile in its own way and does do a faster job of getting rid of my hair on my private part faster</li>
            <li>The PS335 does a good job trimming spots missed by a razor, but are still a bit long for the ES412.</li>
            <li>The ES412 feels pretty solid and good.</li>
            <li>would agree with that the 412 may get quite as smooth as you may want it to, however for me that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s finally nice to shave personal areas and not get nicked to death...</li>
            <li>It works well for the &amp;#34;very sensitive private areas&amp;#34; - nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can use my own batteries because if they were internal NiCAD or NiMH batteries that take who knows how long to charge and not be able to replace/interchange as I want, would annoy me a lot.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Cleancut Personal Shaver and Trimmer for &amp;#34;private areas&amp;#34; for 5 weeks now, so this is a very fair assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer cut down to a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; level, which is what the description said it would - no issues</li>
            <li>and you first have to use the trimmer, then go over and over the areas</li>
            <li>I first thought it was the batteries and no luck.</li>
            <li>Before this product I also got myself a body groomer at the beginning of the year, which I&#x27;ll talk about again later on, but basically if you&#x27;re looking for something with more functionality and features</li>
            <li>What I will say is that the product appears to have been around for several years now and an upgrade product would probably be more than welcomed.</li>
            <li>I personally use my Wahl buzz cutter on the easy to reach/safer spots.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;d say you do have to be silghly more carefully</li>
            <li>Also to me it works best for those left over long individual hairs that need to be cut down and, given the shape, in tighter areas.</li>
            <li>and I think it cuts down about just as short so much so that I think most wouldn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Even if you do plan on using a razor this help get rid ofas much hair as possible.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried before and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>taught).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be prepared to shave for about 20 minutes everyday to keep the few smooth spots smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the bottom black plastic part, that&#x27;s taken off to insert battery, certainly feels a little bit cheap compare to the rest of the parts.</li>
            <li>I did everything that was recommended - skin dry, shaved with trimmer to &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; level first, fresh battery, shaved in a small circular motion, with powder and without, skin pulled taught and not pulled taught</li>
            <li>The wand is nice but the silver shaver is useless.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;d wish the head was less wide for even more harder to reach areas..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to remember cut down the hair as short as possible that could mean using a bigger different shaver at first, depending on how long your hair happens to be at the moment.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me as long as I used it every other day.  </li>

            <li> best performance for close sensitive shave!</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever used</li>
            <li> shaver doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and you first have to use the trimmer, then go over and over the areas and then I still had to use my razor. disappointed.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;personal shaver&amp;#34; is my favorite kind of euphemism.  Works great for the netherparts.</li>
            <li> Great Package...this is the best set for clearing hair.works well / easy to use.</li>
            <li> The ES412 Cleancut never worked from day 1.  I first thought it was the batteries and no luck.</li>
            <li> They do the job but it takes a while.  Keep batteries on hand too. They don&#x27;t last long. Great if you want to keep yourself smooth every day by touching up daily.</li>
            <li> Both products exceeded my expectations in precision in personal grooming. Both products are safe, effective, and easy to use.  Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Does a very good job!</li>
            <li> If you have more than peach fuz... this is not going to work for you.</li>
            <li> The wand is nice but the silver shaver is useless. It doesn&#x27;t cut hair at all, hair has to be almost non existent on body. Hair can&#x27;t be long at all or it just skips over it. Product description is misleading.</li>
            <li> A Great pair...it&#x27;s finally nice to shave personal areas and not get nicked to death...Love them!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to remember cut down the hair as short as possible that could mean using a bigger different shaver at first, depending on how long your hair happens to be at the moment. I personally use my Wahl buzz cutter on the easy to reach/safer spots. Before this product I also got myself a body groomer at the beginning of the year, which I&#x27;ll talk about again later on, but basically if you&#x27;re looking for something with more functionality and features then you may be better off buying a body groomer instead.&lt;br /&gt;The PS335-T blade has some curvature to it which I think helps. Also to me it works best for those left over long individual hairs that need to be cut down and, given the shape, in tighter areas. Though I&#x27;d wish the head was less wide for even more harder to reach areas.. The box came with a AA battery. The ES412 feels pretty solid and good. I&#x27;d say the bottom black plastic part, that&#x27;s taken off to insert battery, certainly feels a little bit cheap compare to the rest of the parts. I use AA Enloop rechargeable batteries in each product, though if you use a C-battery in the 412 it does seem to give off slightly more power.

Even if you do plan on using a razor this help get rid ofas much hair as possible. What I will say is that the product appears to have been around for several years now and an upgrade product would probably be more than welcomed. Also I would think the cost could be lower, both boxes do say Made In Japan, so maybe that has something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Mangroomer Pro Body Groomer which I&#x27;d say is more versatile in its own way and does do a faster job of getting rid of my hair on my private part faster and I think it cuts down about just as short so much so that I think most wouldn&#x27;t notice a difference. Though I&#x27;d say you do have to be silghly more carefully but it&#x27;s also just as safe as well. So I think you should look into the Mangroomer Groomer. Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB / ER-GK models and Philips Norelco BG models are also others out there. Ultimately what will get you the closest shave without having to use a razor is probably a high-end foil shaver for your face, like the ones Panasonic and Braun manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for this combo without any other &amp;#34;value added&amp;#34; products included. I already had a Seiko branded ES412. This one performs just as well. I was slightly disappointed that the ES412 no longer comes with a travel cover. The PS335 I hadn&#x27;t tried before and was pleasantly surprised. The PS335 does a good job trimming spots missed by a razor, but are still a bit long for the ES412.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver and did not use it until after the return period had expired.  I used it for one week and loved it.  However it no longer turns on.  After reading all the reviews I think some of you might not be shaving with a razor before beginning to use the shaver.  It worked very well for me as long as I used it every other day.  I never used powder with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cleancut Personal Shaver and Trimmer for &amp;#34;private areas&amp;#34; for 5 weeks now, so this is a very fair assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer cut down to a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; level, which is what the description said it would - no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleancut Personal Shaver is VERY disappointing. It works well for the &amp;#34;very sensitive private areas&amp;#34; - nice and smooth. However, for the surrounding areas and bikini line, I could never get a completely smooth shave. There would be spots it would just not shave close. I did everything that was recommended - skin dry, shaved with trimmer to &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; level first, fresh battery, shaved in a small circular motion, with powder and without, skin pulled taught and not pulled taught (it actually worked best when it wasn&#x27;t pulled taught).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be prepared to shave for about 20 minutes everyday to keep the few smooth spots smooth. It is a very tedious process, so you will go through A LOT of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could return it I definitely would!</li>
