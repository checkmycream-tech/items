            <li>They work great!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li>and I need it to pull up off my neck, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li>What a great find!</li>
            <li>These clips are the perfect length.</li>
            <li>These are great hair clips.  </li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>They work great for my hair</li>
            <li>So glad to find!!</li>
            <li>The Goody brand used to be good and one I used, but something has happened, and this didn&#x27;t work out well.</li>
            <li>but this is a good product</li>
            <li>So glad I found them &amp; have them again!</li>
            <li>so easy to make hair look good</li>
            <li>pulled back, they stayed in great and the price was great also</li>
            <li>These go in very quickly and look amazing, get many complements on my hair.</li>
            <li>So glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hope I can find some more reviews on those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many compliments when I use by &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love this clip...</li>
            <li>one searcha nd was able to find her these.</li>
            <li>Like i said before these are the best and I will be ordering more in the future....</li>
            <li>But I love them.</li>
            <li>Love these clips, work well.</li>
            <li>AND THE FACT THAT THEY GIVE A SASSY OR EVEN MORE DRESSED-UP LOOK TO A PONYTAIL.  </li>
            <li>THEY WORK BETTER WITH THICKER OR EVEN CURLY HAIR TYPES.</li>
            <li>I like using these instead of a pony tail holder because I get more volume whereas the ponytail restricts your hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Goody clincher combs for many years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product....</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>2 sets cause I love these things</li>
            <li>love love love the banana clips.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use &amp; I like the look even better than when my hair is up.  </li>
            <li>I use with caution because they feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.  </li>
            <li>May not be the prettiest most decorative, although they hold your hair back great.  </li>
            <li>It makes it way easy to close it doing it that way.</li>
            <li>The secure mechanism holds together even better than the original set.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to manage with my curls.  </li>
            <li>If they had a tighter grip it might be fine.</li>
            <li>I tried to get all of my hair into this, and the clip a. wouldn&#x27;t fit all of my hair between the combs and b.</li>
            <li>These are the same that I used to buy over a decade ago, I was so happy to find them again</li>
            <li>So far so good, so we shall see.</li>
            <li>These long banana combs are great.  </li>
            <li>These are the ORIGINAL banana clip by GOODY.</li>
            <li>My hair is full and curly</li>
            <li>I ran across them online &amp; love them now just as much as I did then.  </li>
            <li>Just love these and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Love these banana clips--keeps the hair off my neck and makes my hair cascade down my back, looking great!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for this product, as it is excellent for long hair, finally found it thru amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair is going through a transitional phase right now.  </li>
            <li>Will get more just for back up.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to wear my very only hair in the summer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hold my long hair very securely, they slide out of place.</li>
            <li>This is a very large comb, you get two, but I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have always loved banana clips and can hardly ever find them in the store.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>someone had shorter hair they might work better- mine is tailbone length, so it is pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>The clip is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold thicker (not impossibly thick) hair in place.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick curly hair and these clips hold it up and back beautifully!</li>
            <li>I remember using these when I was in high school &amp; college, and then they disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I have always wanted these combs as i had them when i was in High School</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little stiff at first but work good</li>
            <li>Next time I will try a more expensive brand and see if it is any better.</li>
            <li>Would NEVER waste my money purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li>just what I have been looking for and don&#x27;t fit tight on the head.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; like the one I&#x27;ve had since junior high</li>
            <li>This size is hard to find, but works better for thicker and longer hair.  </li>
            <li>My 4A hair is only about 8\\&quot; long, but with these clips I can get a pretty decent afro puff without a blow out!</li>
            <li>I am growing out my relaxer and going natural.  </li>
            <li>And, actually, that&#x27;s what really matters in the end.</li>
            <li>This comb clip would probably work better on a young girl with thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Black was really the only useful color.</li>
            <li>However, instead of white and red, the new colors are more or less clear and brown which I can definitely use.</li>
            <li>It was priced a bit higher than what I had purchased them in the past at local drugstores, but the item is no longer available locally.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length thick curly hair and my hair fits just fine in these combs.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair (down to the middle of my back) and these clips hold my hair back from my face securely, and it makes a lovely cascade of hair down my back.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair with sometimes wavy, sometimes straight hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way they hold all of my hair together regardless if it&#x27;s thick and tangled, or even wet.  </li>
            <li>Bought because I saw a natural hair blogger named Kimmaytube use these for multiple styles for natural black hair.</li>

            <li> Bought because I saw a natural hair blogger named Kimmaytube use these for multiple styles for natural black hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, however as you see from my first sentence I have managed to have the same clip practically my entire life and never broke that or had one issue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are not available in stores anymore, but I love the clip for long thick hair, feet or dry.</li>
            <li> so I could never get it closed properly.</li>
            <li> Will not hold up long.</li>
            <li> I USED THESE 20 YEARS AGO WHEN MY HAIR WAS LONG AND NOW THAT IT&#x27;S GROWN OUT AGAIN, THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> These work well with shorter hair as well as long hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very flimsy and doesnt support my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I bought the Goody 3 pk and the colors were white, red and black.</li>
            <li> Very thin and cheaply made, not the Goody product line I was used to.</li>
            <li> and I bought the pack expecting to basically waste the white and red since I still have those mostly useless colors from the original pack.</li>
            <li> I leave it open wide then carefully spread my hair out and scrunch the comb closer together.</li>
            <li> not worth sending back</li>
            <li> I put my hair in  a loose ponytail and place the comb in my hair vertically.</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re made with much less sturdy plastic than the ones I had years back.  </li>
            <li> so it NEVER grabs and stays closed.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but you can&#x27;t really find these anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I like these combs the best,when putting them on the comb doesn&#x27;t scrap your scalp like some other combs do.</li>
            <li> It holds hair extremely well and works especially well on curly or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the side that is to be opened and closed has a little bitty ball on it</li>
            <li> They work well to hold back my chin-length somewhat thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I lost the black (which isn&#x27;t sold separately)</li>
            <li> Came as expected, when expected, not good quality, but will continue to purchase from this seller</li>
            <li> too long on head but fits my very thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> Two broke right out the pack :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little ones because my hair is thick and shoulder length</li>
            <li> Many days would be awful hair days were it not for these 7\\&quot; clips by Goody.  </li>
            <li> There are a few imitators, but not one duplicator!  </li>
            <li> This was truly a big disappointment for the comb was half the weight of the ones which goody produced years ago.  </li>
            <li> The clincher comb is one of the clips that tends to be hard to find in stores too</li>
            <li> so I have a hard time finding something that will keep my hair up.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and sometimes can be a bit hard to manage, but after a shower, this is music to my ears.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or even just a lot of hair, I would think twice about this product.</li>
            <li> The comb may work for a child, but not meant for thick hair - it wouldn&#x27;t even come close to closing.  </li>
            <li> Not for thick hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and pony tails give me a head ache and braids</li>
            <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t show you how thin they are.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this purchase and since I had to open it to find out</li>
            <li> Also difficult to get in to begin with.</li>
            <li> Also a bit difficult to snap</li>
            <li> Unable to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked.</li>

            <li> This is a very large comb, you get two, but I have long, fine hair and it just kept sliding out.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.  not worth sending back</li>
            <li> I ahve been looking for these all over. So glad to find them on Amazon. They work great!</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair with sometimes wavy, sometimes straight hair. And I have a lot of it. I tried to get all of my hair into this, and the clip a. wouldn&#x27;t fit all of my hair between the combs and b. wouldn&#x27;t stay shut. I don&#x27;t want to give up on this product yet, but I am pessimistic. If you have thick hair or even just a lot of hair, I would think twice about this product.</li>

However, they&#x27;re made with much less sturdy plastic than the ones I had years back.  I use with caution because they feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.  So far so good, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> May not be the prettiest most decorative, although they hold your hair back great.  And, actually, that&#x27;s what really matters in the end.</li>
            <li> This comb clip would probably work better on a young girl with thin straight hair.  My hair is full and curly so I could never get it closed properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinner than in the 80&#x27;s, but I just use clips or bobby pins to keep my hair from falling out.  They are easy to use &amp; I like the look even better than when my hair is up.  I&#x27;ve rec&#x27;vd many compliments when I use by &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34;.  So glad I found them &amp; have them again!</li>
            <li> Love this clip... Been looking all over for the seven inch... Always found the smaller one. I have long, thick curly hair and these clips hold it up and back beautifully! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> My wife was complaining she couldn&#x27;t find any banana clips, so i did one searcha nd was able to find her these.</li>
            <li> I like these combs the best,when putting them on the comb doesn&#x27;t scrap your scalp like some other combs do.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and sometimes can be a bit hard to manage, but after a shower, this is music to my ears.  Light and easy to manage with my curls.  When I pressed my hair out, it was another simple fix.  Will get more just for back up.</li>
            <li> Like i said before these are the best and I will be ordering more in the future....</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair!</li>
            <li> Not for thick hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are great hair clips.  I remember using these when I was in high school &amp; college, and then they disappeared.  I ran across them online &amp; love them now just as much as I did then.  I have very long hair (down to the middle of my back) and these clips hold my hair back from my face securely, and it makes a lovely cascade of hair down my back.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere! I know they are so 80&#x27;s I guess, But I love them. I don&#x27;t like the little ones because my hair is thick and shoulder length and I need it to pull up off my neck, so these are perfect. So glad to find!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold my long hair very securely, they slide out of place. Also difficult to get in to begin with. If they had a tighter grip it might be fine. Also a bit difficult to snap together.&lt;br /&gt;If someone had shorter hair they might work better- mine is tailbone length, so it is pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> too long on head but fits my very thick hair</li>
            <li> Love these clips, work well. Seller packaged well and on time.</li>
            <li> Bought because I saw a natural hair blogger named Kimmaytube use these for multiple styles for natural black hair. They work great. Now, it only I could find them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are not available in stores anymore, but I love the clip for long thick hair, feet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick curly hair and my hair fits just fine in these combs. I was so shocked. I put my hair in  a loose ponytail and place the comb in my hair vertically. It makes it way easy to close it doing it that way. When I do close it I leave it open wide then carefully spread my hair out and scrunch the comb closer together.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to wear my very only hair in the summer. My hair is very thick and pony tails give me a head ache and braids are to time consuming  to put in. These go in very quickly and look amazing, get many complements on my hair.</li>
            <li> These are the same that I used to buy over a decade ago, I was so happy to find them again</li>
            <li> This size is hard to find, but works better for thicker and longer hair.  Arrived promptly in package.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought the Goody 3 pk and the colors were white, red and black. Black was really the only useful color. Somehow I lost the black (which isn&#x27;t sold separately) and I bought the pack expecting to basically waste the white and red since I still have those mostly useless colors from the original pack. However, instead of white and red, the new colors are more or less clear and brown which I can definitely use. The secure mechanism holds together even better than the original set. Going to order an extra set for if and when needed years from now!!!</li>
            <li> Flimsy plastic. Will not hold up long. I wish there was a reliable source for these in a rainbow of colors.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; banana clips forever! These are terrific for curly hair! Keeps your hair in place and out of your eyes. What a great find!</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; like the one I&#x27;ve had since junior high and I am 37 now. These clips are the perfect length. The problem is the side that is to be opened and closed has a little bitty ball on it so it NEVER grabs and stays closed. I have thick hair, however as you see from my first sentence I have managed to have the same clip practically my entire life and never broke that or had one issue. I am very disappointed in this purchase and since I had to open it to find out it will never be used I can&#x27;t do anything with them.</li>
            <li> I USED THESE 20 YEARS AGO WHEN MY HAIR WAS LONG AND NOW THAT IT&#x27;S GROWN OUT AGAIN, THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED AGAIN.  CAN&#x27;T FIND &#x27;EM IN THE STORES.  I LIKE THE EASE OF USE AND THE FACT THAT THEY GIVE A SASSY OR EVEN MORE DRESSED-UP LOOK TO A PONYTAIL.  OF COURSE THEY WORK BETTER WITH THICKER OR EVEN CURLY HAIR TYPES.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hair tool.  I like using these instead of a pony tail holder because I get more volume whereas the ponytail restricts your hair.  These work well with shorter hair as well as long hair.  I used these a lot while I was transitioning.  Although, after a while the fastening mechanism starts to lose grip and pop open.</li>
            <li> I have always loved banana clips and can hardly ever find them in the store.  They work great for my hair and I have very thick long hair so I have a hard time finding something that will keep my hair up.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Very thin and cheaply made, not the Goody product line I was used to. Picture doesn&#x27;t show you how thin they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Goody clincher combs for many years.  This was truly a big disappointment for the comb was half the weight of the ones which goody produced years ago.  It is very flimsy and doesnt support my long thick hair.  Would NEVER waste my money purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> 7&amp;#34; is too big for me...but this is a good product</li>
            <li> Recieved item asap and it was just what I wanted......Thanks for the great product....The hair clips are not in stores around my area....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores. These are the ORIGINAL banana clip by GOODY. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THEME!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Too flimsy. Unable to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> just what I have been looking for and don&#x27;t fit tight on the head. love them. I bout 2 sets cause I love these things</li>
            <li> Love these banana clips--keeps the hair off my neck and makes my hair cascade down my back, looking great! Just love these and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> love love love the banana clips. so easy to make hair look good pulled back, they stayed in great and the price was great also</li>
            <li> I have always wanted these combs as i had them when i was in High School and they are a life saver for my hair.  These are it for me.  Highly recommended.</li>
