            <li>The Idea of flip magnigying glasses is a really good one but</li>
            <li>The quality is not as good as it should be.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved the glasses.</li>
            <li>These are not as good as a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Magnification not  as good as advertised.</li>

            <li>Great value for the money-seems to work quite well in doing everything it was advertsied as being able to do.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love them!</li>
            <li>I would think that the product could be made much better!</li>
            <li>am planning to make my own from some reading glasses.</li>
            <li>they fit good and allow me to see everything I never used to be able to see without them...</li>
            <li>and I gave some to my friends who love them too.</li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve searched Amazon for a better mirror.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have been able to figure that our from just looking at them, but photos can be deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were probably a +3 or plus 3 1/2.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>but so that it was more a a hassle than a help.</li>
            <li>Look for something better.</li>
            <li>You might have better luck with them than I did.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend getting something with a much greater magnification.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help see any better</li>
            <li>If glass flipped up, would have worked better.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>Would have paid more to receive something better.</li>
            <li>but it is not as easy to put on makeup around glasses and my eye keeps trying to focus which is distracting.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to see to put on eye makeup but the frames get in the way when you put on mascara or eyeliner .</li>
            <li>the magnifying strength was too strong, I would have been happier with some thing like a 2 and not a 3</li>
            <li>...lens are way too strong</li>
            <li>The lenses work fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine</li>
            <li>If anyone had ever found a pair of makeup glasses that really work, I&#x27;d sure like to know about them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were comfortable and fit fine.</li>
            <li>I got the strongest strength available, and still I could not see with them on.</li>
            <li>Good makeup glasses as far as vision.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find them very useful at all -  regret I purchased them.</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 pair, one for me the others for gift to relatives, glad I tried them first.</li>
            <li>I got them quickly and they do work</li>
            <li>They are fair quality for the price and easy to flip over to flip up instead of down.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed on the quality of the product!!  </li>
            <li>Not to happy a 3X dual is to heavy</li>
            <li>good quality, be sure you pay attention to the 3x magnification, also received them three days later than the last they said I would receive them.</li>
            <li>I ordered two pair of these they seem to be a better quality than the others they should last her many years , thanks</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had a pair of these magnifying glasses for many years, but they finally broke, and I cannot pluck my eyebrows without these glasses.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works OK but the bottom rim of the left lens does not allow my eyeliner pen unobstructed access.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit me very comfortably, which is why I don&#x27;t usually buy glasses off the internet.</li>
            <li>I liked that the lens flip down and the frame is not where you are trying to work which makes it easier to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>Too large for face.</li>
            <li>They are stored in a little cloth pouch which is nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well</li>
            <li>These are ok, but didn&#x27;t work as expected.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful when applying makeup</li>
            <li>Also the nose pieces really urt the bride of my know.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>although I haven&#x27;t used them much.</li>
            <li>Metal is much thinner than the one I had before which I used for years.  </li>
            <li>So shipping is slow but quality is good.</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze it back into working (barely, it took a lot of force) with a pair of Vicegrips.</li>
            <li>If they had flipped up instead of down, maybe they would have been better.</li>
            <li>They would be better if they flipped up instead of down.</li>
            <li>Is a clever concept.</li>
            <li>they are not powerful enough must be complaining about their own eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheaply made; not worth sending back.</li>
            <li>These glasses do work well, EXCEPT I couldn&#x27;t get my tweezers or eyeliner to fit between the lense that was down and the ear stem.</li>
            <li>The frame does not even sit properly on my face and I have a normal size face.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, they arrived without being visibly broken, but one hinge was so loose that the lens would not stay up.</li>
            <li>Neverthe less, these glasses are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit well on your head, the lenses are dull and I couldn&#x27;t see anything out of them.  </li>
            <li>very disappointed...flimsy, bent and not very helpful with helping put on make-up.  </li>
            <li>The part where the glass is supposed to swivel up or down is lose on the left and stuck on the right side.</li>
            <li>After just the second use, the right lens refused to stay in the upright position after I had bent it down to apply make-up.</li>
            <li>The lenses really should flip up instead of down.</li>
            <li>I understand these need to be large enough to fit a variety of faces, however, I find them so wide it is difficult to keep them in place when applying my makeup.</li>

            <li> the  lenses has a high focus,cant not even see the another eyes when i had wear it.was waste of time getting one wont reccomend to anyone to get this.</li>
            <li> These are pretty hard to wear/use.  </li>
            <li> They were an uncomfortable fit as well.</li>
            <li> My vision is not that bad- 1.75, but can see better with a standard, though cumbersome, 10x magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my eyes are too close together or if they just made the lenses too far apart.</li>
            <li> I only use for mascara; lenses always  fall down</li>
            <li> Very cheap and bad design.</li>
            <li> These makeup glasses do help somewhat, but with only one eye corrected when the other lens is down, my vision is still quite distorted.</li>
            <li> They are way too wide.  </li>
            <li> not really what I was hoping for, not really the products fault</li>
            <li> These makeup glasses turned out to be not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The lens&#x27; really do not help putting on makeup for me.  </li>
            <li> These 3x Dual Lense Flip-Up Magnifying Makeup Glasses were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> You still need to have your prescription in the other glass</li>
            <li> looking thru one side to see the other eye</li>
            <li> One of the lenses would not stay up and the other would not move without a lot of force.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now pretty useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> The other flops down due to a faulty hinge.  </li>
            <li> First, does not appear to be 3X magnification at all, and Secondly, it is difficult to work the bottom half of the eye as the frame is in the way.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to apply eye makeup around the large frame</li>
            <li> was a gift power not right for them</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t drop as low as the picture hard to get to eyes</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put on my make up now that my eyes are old and tired.</li>
            <li> There is some getting used to them because of the magnification, but I&#x27;m sure they will help when I am trying to apply make up and especially false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> They do flip down and magnify -</li>
            <li> Bought these to help with putting contacts in, but when the lens is down it gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> Glasses slide off of your nose when you look down.  </li>
            <li> down a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The glasses were shipped in a little cloth bag, in an envelope.</li>
            <li> The product is  weak different the image in the site.</li>
            <li> Aging eyes have a tough time especially when you are away from your magnifying mirrors at home.  </li>
            <li> They feel apart when I put them on, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see out of the one lens while putting makeup on the other eye.  </li>
            <li> One of the lens is hard to up and down  in both glasses.</li>
            <li> and I get very little improvement in vision.</li>
            <li> They did not have the usual strength of +1 for example.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these in the past.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with these glasses.</li>
            <li> only one eye magnifies  - useless</li>
            <li> my vision is beyond the edge, so hard to see.  </li>
            <li> Glasses hard to wear and use.  </li>
            <li> The way these glasses are constructed makes it hard to put on makeup.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S AWKWARD TO USE, THE LENS FLIPS DOWN, BUT YOU  STILL HAVE THE BULKY ARM IN THE WAY.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get that wrong.</li>
            <li> part that rests on the bridge of your nose is somewhat painful, but the worst part is you can&#x27;t get your fingers around the frame and lens to be able to apply your makeup.</li>
            <li> I did manage to apply makeup using these, but frustrating.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult trying to put eye makeup on.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail and one lense was broken in that it the screw didn&#x27;t hold the lense up!  </li>
            <li> They are very uncomfortable and poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Very awkward and hard  to get to area for applying makeup..</li>
            <li> I can now wear all the prettymakeup and do my eyes without looking like a crazy lady</li>
            <li> Terrible and clumsy design.  </li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t terrible for the price, but quality does not matter when a product is  almost impossible to</li>
            <li> I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased them as a gift for my mother, and the magnification was terrible.</li>

            <li> Difficult to use.  You still need to have your prescription in the other glass so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put on my make up now that my eyes are old and tired. Perfect.</li>
            <li> The frame gets in the way so I cannot get to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I so NEEDED these.  Very handy if you wear glasses.</li>
            <li> good quality, be sure you pay attention to the 3x magnification, also received them three days later than the last they said I would receive them. So shipping is slow but quality is good.</li>
            <li> These did not work out too good for me. If they had flipped up instead of down, maybe they would have been better. Couldn&#x27;t put eyeliner on bottom eyelid...</li>
            <li> Very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> They are way too wide.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  No way of adjusting.</li>
            <li> Everything was great ,thank you for your concern.</li>
            <li> The glasses arrived in excellent time and was as advertised.  They&#x27;re great and I gave some to my friends who love them too.</li>
            <li> I use these for self eye examination and taking fallen eyelashes out of my eyes, not for applying makeup. The lenses work fine. They are +3.00 just like in the description. It is hard to get that wrong. Reviewers that say they can&#x27;t see through them or they are not powerful enough must be complaining about their own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glasses were shipped in a little cloth bag, in an envelope. No padding, no box, not even any plastic blister pack (come on, these are  glasses!). Surprisingly, they arrived without being visibly broken, but one hinge was so loose that the lens would not stay up. I don&#x27;t know if this was a manufacturing flaw or damage in shipping. I was able to squeeze it back into working (barely, it took a lot of force) with a pair of Vicegrips.</li>
            <li> They work fine but it is not as easy to put on makeup around glasses and my eye keeps trying to focus which is distracting.</li>
            <li> Terrible and clumsy design.  They don&#x27;t drop as low as the picture hard to get to eyes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Still can&#x27;t see well enough with the one eye and the frame gets in the way.  I bought a magnified, lighted make-up mirror instead.</li>
            <li> the magnifying strength was too strong, I would have been happier with some thing like a 2 and not a 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my eyes are too close together or if they just made the lenses too far apart. I get dizzy when I use them and I get very little improvement in vision. I guess I should&#x27;ve searched Amazon for a better mirror. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed on the quality of the product!!  They feel apart when I put them on, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit well on your head, the lenses are dull and I couldn&#x27;t see anything out of them.  Would definitely not recommend these.</li>
            <li> not really what I was hoping for, not really the products fault</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lke it. Could not see at all.</li>
            <li> I understand these need to be large enough to fit a variety of faces, however, I find them so wide it is difficult to keep them in place when applying my makeup. I do, however, like the magnification.</li>
            <li> These glasses do work well, EXCEPT I couldn&#x27;t get my tweezers or eyeliner to fit between the lense that was down and the ear stem.</li>
            <li> The lenses could be wider. looking thru one side to see the other eye my vision is beyond the edge, so hard to see.  Other than that fine.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before buying these and they weren&#x27;t favorable, but I foolishly decided to give them a try anyway. Big mistake! They are very uncomfortable and poorly designed. The quality isn&#x27;t terrible for the price, but quality does not matter when a product is  almost impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that rests on the bridge of your nose is somewhat painful, but the worst part is you can&#x27;t get your fingers around the frame and lens to be able to apply your makeup. I guess I should have been able to figure that our from just looking at them, but photos can be deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to make my own from some reading glasses. The lenses really should flip up instead of down. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to do it, but I&#x27;ve got to try. If anyone had ever found a pair of makeup glasses that really work, I&#x27;d sure like to know about them!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;They were comfortable and fit fine.They did not have the usual strength of +1 for example.They were probably a +3 or plus 3 1/2.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Idea of flip magnigying glasses is a really good one but the glasses I got had one glass that would not stay but so that it was more a a hassle than a help.</li>
            <li> Have requested return.  Too large for face.</li>
            <li> Good makeup glasses as far as vision.  The quality is not as good as it should be.  Alright for cheaper glasses.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations . Difficult to apply eye makeup around the large frame</li>
            <li> The frame does not even sit properly on my face and I have a normal size face. The part where the glass is supposed to swivel up or down is lose on the left and stuck on the right side. Look for something better. Very cheap and bad design.</li>
            <li> They were shipped timely.  They are stored in a little cloth pouch which is nice for traveling.  There is some getting used to them because of the magnification, but I&#x27;m sure they will help when I am trying to apply make up and especially false eyelashes.  My mom used these back in the 60&#x27;s and I didn&#x27;t even know that they still made them.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the glasses.She said they work great , and are very easy to use.She would buy them again</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these magnifying glasses for many years, but they finally broke, and I cannot pluck my eyebrows without these glasses. My husband and I love them!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item!  Aging eyes have a tough time especially when you are away from your magnifying mirrors at home.  This is just the ticket.</li>
            <li> One of the lenses would not stay up and the other would not move without a lot of force.  You  should be ashamed of yourself for even selling such junk</li>
            <li> Glasses hard to wear and use.  Thought they would make it easier to see the eye to do makeup, specifically the brow, but they did not help.  Did not like them at all!</li>
            <li> Did not work very well</li>
            <li> The quality was sub-par because only one lens stays in place.  The other flops down due to a faulty hinge.  Neverthe less, these glasses are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have ordered these in the past. They are fair quality for the price and easy to flip over to flip up instead of down.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for MOM !!</li>
            <li> I only use for mascara; lenses always  fall down but I have learned to sit at a tilt or lie on the bed to keep one lens in place.  I would think that the product could be made much better!</li>
            <li> These are pretty hard to wear/use.  It&#x27;s hard to see out of the one lens while putting makeup on the other eye.  I gave up and put these away in the closet.  You might have better luck with them than I did.  They do flip down and magnify - I just couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> The product is  weak different the image in the site. I din&#x27;t like. One of the lens is hard to up and down  in both glasses.</li>
            <li> Blinder than ever trying to use the flipping-up glasses. The things do not work mechanically or optically! These are not as good as a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I needed...lens are way too strong</li>
            <li> They make it easy to see to put on eye makeup but the frames get in the way when you put on mascara or eyeliner .</li>
            <li> These are ok, but didn&#x27;t work as expected.  First, does not appear to be 3X magnification at all, and Secondly, it is difficult to work the bottom half of the eye as the frame is in the way.  I don&#x27;t find them very useful at all -  regret I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I got them quickly and they do work I can now wear all the prettymakeup and do my eyes without looking like a crazy lady lol</li>
            <li> Had to return.  I could not see with them.  They were an uncomfortable fit as well.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when applying makeup</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S AWKWARD TO USE, THE LENS FLIPS DOWN, BUT YOU  STILL HAVE THE BULKY ARM IN THE WAY. I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Also need some made with a stronger magnifying strength. 10X for example.</li>
            <li> For a couple of years I&#x27;ve been looking for glasses like these, thinking that they would help me insert my contact lenses and apply eye makeup. I&#x27;m far-sighted, so as soon as I take off my eyeglasses, my eyes look blurry in the mirror. These makeup glasses do help somewhat, but with only one eye corrected when the other lens is down, my vision is still quite distorted. I find that using my regular glasses perched on the end of my nose is still clearer than using the makeup glasses.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with these glasses. I purchased them as a gift for my mother, and the magnification was terrible. I would recommend getting something with a much greater magnification.</li>
            <li> The glasses will work great for putting on make up. It will slove my problem of my glassed getting in the way.</li>
            <li> After just the second use, the right lens refused to stay in the upright position after I had bent it down to apply make-up. It&#x27;s now pretty useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> my girl friend had a pair of these she had for years they finally broke  I ordered two pair of these they seem to be a better quality than the others they should last her many years , thanks</li>
            <li> However, as one  who wears trifocals it was not useable for me personally. Gave two pair to others who could utilize. Is a clever concept. Found adjustment, with flip up/ down a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> These makeup glasses turned out to be not what I expected. They r not as flexible or solid as I thought! It was difficult trying to put eye makeup on. I have gone back to using a magnifying mirror! I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> The lens&#x27; really do not help putting on makeup for me.  Also the nose pieces really urt the bride of my know.  I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T HAVE THIS YET</li>
            <li> Not to happy a 3X dual is to heavy would like to try a weaker lens</li>
            <li> Great value for the money-seems to work quite well in doing everything it was advertsied as being able to do. Delivery was as promised and it continues to work well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help see any better</li>
            <li> Pretty cheaply made; not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> was a gift power not right for them</li>
            <li> This product works very well for the intended purpose. I would recommend to others needing magnification assistance in applying make-up or maintaining brows.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail and one lense was broken in that it the screw didn&#x27;t hold the lense up!  I need to return it but there was no paperwork in the order!!</li>
            <li> The way these glasses are constructed makes it hard to put on makeup.  They would be better if they flipped up instead of down.</li>
            <li> These 3x Dual Lense Flip-Up Magnifying Makeup Glasses were a total waste of money. I got them because I can&#x27;t see to put on eye makeup without my glasses and I couldn&#x27;t see to put on eye makeup with these glasses either. I got the strongest strength available, and still I could not see with them on. I would not recommend these for anyone.</li>
            <li> only one eye magnifies  - useless</li>
            <li> I liked that the lens flip down and the frame is not where you are trying to work which makes it easier to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend that has been looking for a pair for along time and I found these for her and she loves them .</li>
            <li> These work perfectly...they fit good and allow me to see everything I never used to be able to see without them...thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought to put on eye makeup- still can&#x27;t see.  My vision is not that bad- 1.75, but can see better with a standard, though cumbersome, 10x magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Bought these to help with putting contacts in, but when the lens is down it gets in the way.  They don&#x27;t easily open and close.</li>
            <li> Very awkward and hard  to get to area for applying makeup.. If glass flipped up, would have worked better. I did manage to apply makeup using these, but frustrating. I purchased 3 pair, one for me the others for gift to relatives, glad I tried them first. My money was refunded.</li>
            <li> the  lenses has a high focus,cant not even see the another eyes when i had wear it.was waste of time getting one wont reccomend to anyone to get this.</li>
            <li> Magnification not  as good as advertised. Otherwise product okay, although I haven&#x27;t used them much.</li>
            <li> Great concept and well-made.  They don&#x27;t fit me very comfortably, which is why I don&#x27;t usually buy glasses off the internet.</li>
            <li> Did not like them at all. Could not ppt make up on with them.</li>
            <li> The reason I got them was for putting eyeliner on my left eyelid while watching out of my better/magnified right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works OK but the bottom rim of the left lens does not allow my eyeliner pen unobstructed access.</li>
            <li> very disappointed...flimsy, bent and not very helpful with helping put on make-up.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Metal is much thinner than the one I had before which I used for years.  Glasses slide off of your nose when you look down.  Any adjusting would probably break the glasses.  Would have paid more to receive something better.</li>
