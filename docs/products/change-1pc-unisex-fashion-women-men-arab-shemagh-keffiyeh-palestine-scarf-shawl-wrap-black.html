            <li> but I was expecting something slightly larger, but this is not a major issue.</li>
            <li> Ok material,got here really late though.couple months late</li>

            <li> Not a normal scarf.</li>
            <li> Not itchy, but I expected it to be softer.</li>

            <li> Slight smell...not as bad as some reviews made it out to be!! Hung it outside for a couple of days. Like it alot!!!</li>
            <li> Much thinner than expected with a machinery smell to it. Not soft, almost like a thin fishing line woven loosely into a square of fabric and passed off as a scarf. Shipping took over a month and overall just not impressed.</li>
            <li> It has a funny smell to it. Otherwise it is nice.</li>
            <li> I know this is a very cheap scarf(for the amount)..but it had one of the worst smells you could ever imagine! Threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li> Item Had horrible smell when I recieved it and material was definetly not made well. Ended up giving to goodwill</li>
            <li> This product came to me smelling of oil or some other type of chemical. It wasn&#x27;t the size that I expected, it was more like a piece of cloth than a scarf. I suspect that it came from China and thats why it smelled of chemicals. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I throw mine in the trash.</li>
            <li> The scarf is good for the price. It is inexpensive and you get what you pay for. It is stylish and is true to its description.</li>
            <li> I really actually like this scarf. I wear it a lot and it looks good. I do have a couple issues with it though. when I pulled it out of the bag, the smell was horrible. It smelled like it had sat in my attic for years. I had to was it 3 times, and even then the smell took a while to go away. also, the fabric is a little rough. Not itchy, but I expected it to be softer. Finally, it was a little smaller than I expected. I&#x27;m still able to wear it comfortably but I was expecting something slightly larger, but this is not a major issue. Other than those 3 things, its not a bad little scarf.</li>
            <li> Good long scarf but the smell on arrival was very strong of gasoline&lt;br /&gt;Color and quality good ,after washing it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This scarf was meant to be a gift and i see them wearing it all the time. It was a great price for what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Good material,  too bad they deliver by 2 legged turtle......I waited forever</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! Lots of swag in this scarf. Not a normal scarf. Its a larg...rag if you will.</li>
            <li> Has a very strong chemical smell on it &amp; look to thin to wash off the smell. So its been sitting in my closet. Hoping that bad smell on it will fade...</li>
            <li> I live in this scarf. I had bought a beautiful cashmere scarf for almost 100 bucks and have barely worn it since i got this one. it makes me feel like a navy seal. Very hip (though maybe a little too over the top for some people&#x27;s tastes but i like what i like). My only problem is that it took forever to get here. Also, I think it shipped from overseas and it has a bit of a funky scent.</li>
            <li> Ive never gotten a garment in the mail that quite smelled the way this does.. Smells like it was washed in an oil drum. Ive washed it several times and it still has this smell to it. i have it airing outside now. it is very nice looking though. Only other problem is that it took over a month to receive this product. I will not buy from this seller anymore.</li>
            <li> Beautiful excellent price, but don&#x27;t smell so good had to send to dry cleaner very strong smell of mold m</li>
            <li> Ok material,got here really late though.couple months late</li>
            <li> To be honest, I never expect to much from an item that cost just 3$. But for my surprise the scarf out stand my expectations, well done and very decent materials. I received the shipment ten days before that Amazon says. About the smell, wasn&#x27;t so bad as the comments of the other buyers. I am really happy with this nice and inexpensive scarf. Thanks Amazon.</li>
