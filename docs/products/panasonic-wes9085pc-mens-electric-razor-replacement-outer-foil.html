            <li>I now have the 8077 and find it the best I&#x27;ve yet tried.  </li>
            <li>but this foil is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It has been working perfectly.</li>
            <li>Of course, the razor is successful because of a number of factors working together</li>
            <li>Item received as advertised in good time.</li>
            <li>Now my shaver works effectively</li>
            <li>If you already own a matching shaver, the outer foil is a perfectly safe buy.</li>
            <li>Original replacement at good price.</li>
            <li>This replacement foil fits the shaver nicely, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>this makes-much more so than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to replace the screens more often.</li>
            <li>I have had my shaver for many years and just found these replacements.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed to replace them, but glad I did.</li>
            <li>Was pleased about its performance.</li>
            <li>Glad to have a source for these.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work great, but then again, I never get a decent shave</li>
            <li>Easy to change.</li>
            <li>Shaver works as good as new.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t fit that model</li>
            <li>genuine product, as showned...</li>
            <li>The razor part fit well</li>
            <li>This seems a fine replacement part for the original.  </li>
            <li>I bought this when my shaver&#x27;s original foil wore to the point that it was nicking my face.  </li>
            <li>The original foil on my razor (ES-RT51) chipped within a month or two of my using it.</li>
            <li>Price for both screen and blades is real reasonable-quick easy and free delivery.</li>
            <li>Fit just right.</li>
            <li>For a quick and efficient shave it cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li>I replaced the original because of a nick in the foil which was tough on my face but the replacement has been excellent.</li>
            <li>exact fit to my razor.  </li>
            <li>Better than the razor had ever been, even when new.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This should last me another 2 or 3 years for sure.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered....</li>
            <li>I bought two of these back in March in order to facilitate Free Super Saving Shipping.</li>
            <li>it probably won&#x27;t fit quite a few more.</li>
            <li>I gave the Panasonic ES-RT51-S Electric Razor a good review, however, the foil cutter didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much since a new shaver is only 40 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Really a quality buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I really should have bought this much sooner.</li>
            <li>did the job required and fast service</li>
            <li>Then I just kept using it for most of a year even though the chip lead to occasional cuts because I am kind of dumb sometimes.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!-I have a real heavy beard-shaver ES 8077]  is a few years old-got a good clean  </li>
            <li>I got this and my Panasonic shaver works like new.</li>
            <li>Getting this replacement foil saved me a ton of money on buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>the new foil gave me a closer shave.</li>
            <li>If you think your razor needs new blade and foil ..</li>
            <li>New razor head improved shave.</li>
            <li>foils don&#x27;t seem to last long thinking of getting a new razor other than Panasonic,waiting for a good sale on Braun or norelco.</li>
            <li>I clean and maintain it on a regular basis and after two months of use, it gave me shave cuts on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>They still haven&#x27;t healed completely after about 3 months.</li>
            <li>It was a direct replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li>When I checked and found that it was nearly four years old</li>
            <li>These foils don&#x27;t last as long as they did when I first bought the shaver in early 2010.</li>
            <li>The new foil made a big difference in the comfort of my Panasonic electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades fit and cut but aren&#x27;t as sharp as some in hte past.</li>

            <li> Should have purchased one long ago.</li>

            <li> I have had my wet dry shaver for around 9 months, so it will be time to replace.</li>

            <li> Emmediately I can tell the difference in quality and performance compared to other foils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Hard to reach in the back,</li>

            <li> you forget how worn down blades get over a year or two.  </li>

            <li> I am not familiar with electric razors</li>
            <li> Despite satisfaction in the past, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll ever purchase a Panasonic shaver again...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down to Panasonic for Customer Service for not returning my call and adddressing this serious complaint.</li>
            <li> This is just a common replacement for my outer foil electric shaver.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT THE ES8078!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Outer Foil and the WES9064PC blades separate because at the time of purchase it was less expensive than the combination together.  </li>
            <li> My Panasonic shaver was shaving badly and was getting noisy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well.  you forget how worn down blades get over a year or two.  amazon says to replace it every 6 months but the owners manual says every year for the outer foil and 2 years for the inner blades.</li>
            <li> It does what is says it will. Replace foil every year, blades every two. I got this and my Panasonic shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my shaver&#x27;s original foil wore to the point that it was nicking my face.  This seems a fine replacement part for the original.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how big a difference this makes-much more so than the replacement blades. I&#x27;m going to replace the screens more often.</li>
            <li> This is just a common replacement for my outer foil electric shaver. The panasonic manual says it should be replaced every year. I have had my wet dry shaver for around 9 months, so it will be time to replace. soon.</li>
            <li> Anywhere, without a snag.  Hard to reach in the back, but that is the problem with all shavers...</li>
            <li> foils don&#x27;t seem to last long thinking of getting a new razor other than Panasonic,waiting for a good sale on Braun or norelco.</li>
            <li> Items arrived from Amazon in only 4 days. WOW!!!-I have a real heavy beard-shaver ES 8077]  is a few years old-got a good clean  shave like I had just bought razor today.  Price for both screen and blades is real reasonable-quick easy and free delivery. Will continue to purchase these items from Amazon as long as the battery in razor keeps going.</li>
            <li> These foils don&#x27;t last as long as they did when I first bought the shaver in early 2010.</li>

            <li> This replacement foil fits the shaver nicely, and it worked fine. Really a quality buy for the price. Now my shaver works effectively</li>
            <li> The new foil made a big difference in the comfort of my Panasonic electric razor.  Better than the razor had ever been, even when new.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this model of foil for years.  It works.  It doesn&#x27;t work great, but then again, I never get a decent shave (given my skin type).</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that there were no surprises. If you already own a matching shaver, the outer foil is a perfectly safe buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet-dry razors in various iterations for a number of years.  I now have the 8077 and find it the best I&#x27;ve yet tried.  Of course, the razor is successful because of a number of factors working together but this foil is excellent.  I replaced the original because of a nick in the foil which was tough on my face but the replacement has been excellent.</li>
            <li> As advertised.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I gave the Panasonic ES-RT51-S Electric Razor a good review, however, the foil cutter didn&#x27;t last long at all. I clean and maintain it on a regular basis and after two months of use, it gave me shave cuts on my upper lip. They still haven&#x27;t healed completely after about 3 months. I complained to Panasonic about this issue several times and they never returned my call. Thumbs down to Panasonic for Customer Service for not returning my call and adddressing this serious complaint. I will never buy another Panasonic Razor ever again because of this.</li>
            <li> It was a direct replacement for my old one. It improved my shaving performance...the new foil gave me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic shaver was shaving badly and was getting noisy.  When I checked and found that it was nearly four years old I decided it was time to change the blades.  The Manual recommends every year.  I ordered this Outer Foil and the WES9064PC blades separate because at the time of purchase it was less expensive than the combination together.  Amazon&#x27;s Prime shipping zipped it to me almost faster than I could have driven to the store to purchase it.  Shaver works as good as new.</li>
            <li> Item received as advertised in good time.</li>
            <li> No complaints here.  I received exactly what I ordered....exact fit to my razor.  I definetly notice the difference in my shave after replacing the foil and blade.  If you think your razor needs new blade and foil ..it probably does....I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed to replace them, but glad I did.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT THE ES8078!! States on the package that it does but it&#x27;s too small. If it doesn&#x27;t fit that model it probably won&#x27;t fit quite a few more.</li>
            <li> New razor head improved shave. Was pleased about its performance. Should have purchased one long ago. Been using Panasonic cordless for 5 years.</li>
            <li> This was just what we ordered, but come to find out we needed the inner blade set too.  I am not familiar with electric razors so I didn&#x27;t know what was needed.  Had to place a separate order for the inner blade set.</li>
            <li> genuine product, as showned... what else to say to give enough words to put in a review and have it put on..</li>
            <li> Easy to change. Fit just right.</li>
            <li> This foil beats other generic competative foil replacements. Emmediately I can tell the difference in quality and performance compared to other foils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a source for these.  Wish I could quit dropping my razor and ruining the screens; I&#x27;ve yet to actually wear one out!</li>
            <li> This item was picked up for my son.  He was looking for a replacement part for his razor.  The razor part fit well and he&#x27;s using it with no problems.</li>
            <li> The original foil on my razor (ES-RT51) chipped within a month or two of my using it. Then I just kept using it for most of a year even though the chip lead to occasional cuts because I am kind of dumb sometimes. But this replacement worked wonders. I really should have bought this much sooner.</li>
            <li> For a quick and efficient shave it cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li> Original replacement at good price. I will order again when the time comes for another replacement. It is made by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> did the job required and fast service +++ +++ +++ +++ ++ ++ + + + + + + +</li>
            <li> this replacement was the manufacturers replacement. It has been working perfectly. I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much since a new shaver is only 40 dollars more.</li>
