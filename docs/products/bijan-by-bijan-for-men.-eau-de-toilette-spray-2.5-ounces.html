            <li> It smells good - what more can one say? I don&#x27;t know how long a squirt will last, however. Try it. Find out yourself...smell good (for a change...hi...hi...) - it won&#x27;t break you!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this brand and could not find it in stores so I went to Amazon. Will purchase again if I can get a better price but he wanted it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents my husband wears.  It is awesome - spicy, yet sweet.  Mild, yet lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought Bijan Eau De Toilette a number of years ago. Until I saw it on Amazon, I thought it was no longer available. It has a potency more like a cologne along the lines of a Chanel for men. Consequently, it is a bargain-but don&#x27;t use too much or it will be overpowering...</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Smells slightly different than what I remember from my younger days, but maybe that&#x27;s just me... I bought this on Amazon Prime and it&#x27;s definitely the real deal!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> i have been using Bijan for 18 years now and won&#x27;t give it up for NO other. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Husband was in dispair when his ran out and did not know where it find it.  He is a happy man now.</li>

            <li> I have been using Bijan for men since the mid 90s when I received a sample at the St Regis hotel in NYC.  Not overpowering and lasts through the day. Very pleasant, spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he love it!</li>
            <li> Like others, I did not even know this was still being made.  I bought this the first year it came out and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clearly for evening use and probably in the fall and winter.  It can be very strong for day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> Normally my favorite, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in department stores so was excited to find it on line. Much to my disappointment, this was so old it smelled strongly &amp;#34;rank&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Husband loved it! Enough said!</li>

            <li> I bought the male and the female bottle - I have 16 top end colognes and this one is just fascinating just like the first time I stopped a strange Lady to ask her what perfume she was wearing..the original Bijan before they also added a Man&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the product especially this price and the Amazon provider service was top notch!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have a girlfriend to give the female version to - but with this &#x27;fro Men&#x27; Bijan - I am optimistic!</li>

            <li> This is NOT the original Bijan For Men.  Don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done to it but it&#x27;s not even close to what it used to be.  Beware if you think you are buying the same stuff you had in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> He has always loved fragrance with a hint of citrus wood, with just a little bit and have all day.</li>
