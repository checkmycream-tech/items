            <li>and I saw a huge decrease in occurrence after using.</li>
            <li>Great shower or wash your face in your daily life.</li>
            <li>-- otherwise, your moisturizer is just sitting on top of your skin, waiting to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Brush is made from silicone, no need for replacing the head, waterproof with interesting and useful design.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle and soft and get the job done pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>The unique shape allows it to contour to any curve of your face.</li>
            <li>I chose this one for the price, shape and general good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it instead of investing in the higher price name brand device at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I like it seems to really clean your skin well.  </li>

            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $$ on the more expensive brands -- this one works great.  </li>
            <li>packaging is very pretty</li>
            <li>Within the first wash I felt a difference.  </li>
            <li>Do you make one in Blue would love to purchase it for my sons.  </li>
            <li>Very comfy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a facial at a spa!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean, soft and you would see the difference before and after using it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants to have soft and clean face.</li>
            <li>Pointy top really helps to clean smaller parts of my face , like above your nose, under your nose, between your eyebrows, eye conners and chin.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I like that there&#x27;s a timer because it makes sure you don&#x27;t spend too much time on a single area of your face.</li>
            <li>It really makes sense to do that</li>
            <li>Thank You much....</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>It works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>It does its job really well</li>
            <li>With the face wash I use, this brush creates foam which feels really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of getting it for my mom soon too since I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks K.SHOP.</li>
            <li>I think this product is a great bang for your buck, especially compared to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li>It takes all of my makeup off with no issues and I&#x27;m left with perfectly clean skin.</li>
            <li>sure you use a face wash product you like, and turn down the vibrations if your face finds it too</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face tingling and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Its buttons are like an iPhone, very minimal and easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>and then you turn the vibration down on the nodules to cleanse the more sensitive area under the eyes and the nose area.  </li>
            <li>but at the same time it&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>The material is very soft but you can make it tougher by turning up the vibration level</li>
            <li>lol -- it does reach narrow and wide facial areas and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also comes with a USB charger just like most other gadgets we use daily.</li>
            <li>Just used this brush for the first time and my skin feels softer and cleaner compared to traditional methods.</li>
            <li>I tried every cleansing product over the counter from Burts Bees all natural sensitive skin to Neutrogena acne wash.</li>
            <li>Really gets the suds foamy, though I suspect the old &amp;#34;Neutrogena Urban Legend&amp;#34; with the multiple speeds!</li>
            <li>I was ready to shell out the big bucks for a more expensive sonic cleanser, but $40 vs. $200</li>
            <li>I live in a state where there is summer my face gets oily and  in winter my face gets dry.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but definitely worth it in the long term!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this discounted item for review purposes. My opinion for this items are: this is a very comfortable silicone brush vibration. Great shower or wash your face in your daily life. It has 15 speeds vibration levels, it is easy to adjust. It is water-resistant. Feels nice as it massages and tones the skin and it stimulates blood flow.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face tingling and vibrant. It removes makeup and the bristles won&#x27;t wear down. The unique shape allows it to contour to any curve of your face. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a deep facial cleanse. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth it in the long term!</li>
            <li> I was having problems with my skin and I&#x27;d tried different cleansers, moisturizers, exfoliants -- you name it!  I heard about sonic cleansers and checked them out on Amazon.  I chose this one for the price, shape and general good reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and my skin is much less flaky and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference in the appearance of my pores.  And it&#x27;s not just a cleanser -- the other side is used after you moisturize, to massage the product deeper into your skin.  It really makes sense to do that -- otherwise, your moisturizer is just sitting on top of your skin, waiting to be absorbed.  I was ready to shell out the big bucks for a more expensive sonic cleanser, but $40 vs. $200 -- it&#x27;s a no-brainer.  I would have liked to see a bit more direction on how to optimize the usage.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in exchange of an honest review. I live in a state where there is summer my face gets oily and  in winter my face gets dry. There are some beauty products that I tried to put on my face but none of those helped me.The brush is gentle and soft and get the job done pretty impressive. It leaves my face clean, soft and you would see the difference before and after using it. I recommend this to everyone who wants to have soft and clean face. I am glad I tried this. Indeed and great product !</li>
            <li> Good product but does not come with electic plug to recharge.  This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received I could not wait to use it. I love the simplicity of the product yet very effective. Within the first wash I felt a difference.  My face neck and chest felt smoother and radiant .I look forward to using it every time I wash.  Do you make one in Blue would love to purchase it for my sons.  Thank You much....Paula Pitruzzello</li>
            <li> Used for two weeks and works beautifully! Noticeably softer skin. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the price.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $$ on the more expensive brands -- this one works great.  Comes in nice packaging as well if you&#x27;re purchasing as a gift.</li>
            <li> I like it seems to really clean your skin well.  I am glad I tried it instead of investing in the higher price name brand device at Sephora.</li>
            <li> This made my face feel so clean after using! I have problems with Acne and I saw a huge decrease in occurrence after using. My skin feels wonderful!:-)</li>
            <li> Brush is made from silicone, no need for replacing the head, waterproof with interesting and useful design.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.

Very comfy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I must say I have ALWAYS dealt with acne and bumpy skin, especially on my forehead. I tried every cleansing product over the counter from Burts Bees all natural sensitive skin to Neutrogena acne wash. Nothing seemed to work..and I was always applying acne zone cream every night.. which stains our pillows:(  Recently I started doing Oxygen Facials and trying the Intraceutical product line, which although expensive, really helped my skins complexion and the overall frequency of breakouts. My forehead stayed slightly bumpy however and it was embarrassing, especially in photos. I am so happy to say that I now have a pimple free, SMOOTH forehead since using this cleansing massager!! I LOVE IT!..and so does my face!! haha. My skin is clear, and beautiful! My husband told me last night that my skin looks like porcelain...which every woman loves to hear!! I still use the Neutrogena grapefruit cleanser but only a small amount on the massager, and what a difference it has made!!! YAYY!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these type facial cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like this one.  I definitely think it makes a difference and it not as hard on my skin as my Clarisonic was.  I&#x27;m using this instead.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much. It works really well with my skin. It takes all of my makeup off with no issues and I&#x27;m left with perfectly clean skin. It does its job really well but at the same time it&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. The material is very soft but you can make it tougher by turning up the vibration level (there are a total of 15 levels). I like that there&#x27;s a timer because it makes sure you don&#x27;t spend too much time on a single area of your face. With the face wash I use, this brush creates foam which feels really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very pretty and it&#x27;s a perfect gift. I&#x27;m thinking of getting it for my mom soon too since I like it so much.</li>
            <li> Received this item for a discounted price and for product testing. Arrived quickly and in great condition. This cleaner/massager great  for the eye area, and a massager increases circulation to stimulate collagen production.  It is good for any skin type . I use the cleaner/massager every night before I go to bed and my skin feels really clean. It also comes in a very beautiful box.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Thanks K.SHOP.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel great.  I liked how smooth and clean my face felt afterwards.  It&#x27;s better than a facial at a spa!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and I can already tell my skin feels smoother and looks firmer. So far the battery life seems great, hasn&#x27;t needed charging and I use it twice daily for about two minutes at a time. I think this product is a great bang for your buck, especially compared to the more expensive options. So far I haven&#x27;t found any down side to this product yet!</li>
            <li> Really gets the suds foamy, though I suspect the old &amp;#34;Neutrogena Urban Legend&amp;#34; with the multiple speeds! What does your face need extra speeds for? lol -- it does reach narrow and wide facial areas and my skin feels exfoliated without chemicals. Not too rough.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE.</li>
            <li> Just used this brush for the first time and my skin feels softer and cleaner compared to traditional methods. I wish the directions would explain what levels brought out the best results, and how long one should stay in one area. However, this seems to do the job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
