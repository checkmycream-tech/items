    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product, no complaints, arrived on time!</li>
            <li>and I could tell that they do produce great curls, but at the end of the day these were unusable for me given the plastic ends kept melting and then getting in my hair!  </li>
            <li>It is the greatest.  </li>
            <li>I love these electric rollers!!!!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews online I decided to buy these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of how to use the clips to hold the rollers it works great.</li>
            <li>they both work great and do not leave a crimp mark in my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is you have the option to use the metal pins or plastic clips because it comes with both.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good hairsetter, I&#x27;d recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>I heat them up for about 20 minutes and they are good to go-</li>
            <li>The price I think, is worth the quality of the product as well. :D</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I decided on this product and was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have both clips and pins in this set.</li>
            <li>The ceramic curlers have nice insulation</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best heated roller set I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy (after you get the hang of it), and you get great results.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>These rollers make my hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The velvet flocking is nice for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but they sure curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product ...</li>
            <li>It has plastic clips, which I love, and also those metal ones which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>I love the three sizes---my hair is almost shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I love the option to use the metal clips or the butterfly clips---</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on these rollers and glad I choose these.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be practicing much more.  </li>
            <li>But I also love the volume it provides for your hair.  </li>
            <li>The time I save in not having to wait for the rollers to heat up is lost when I have to struggle with inserting each pin all the way around each roller, making sure I haven&#x27;t accidentally inserted one end of the pin into the slit.</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely and quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>The metal clips hold the curlers in fine hair better than the plastic, but when used together (plastic over metal), they stay in place until removed.</li>
            <li>So finding them in the box was a welcome surprised.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers are by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>These are good curlers and heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, and they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are easy to handle...</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, and I like the plastic alligator clips, just unsatisfied with the end result.</li>
            <li>Babyliss ceramic rollers heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product - definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li>The flocked rollers are easy to handle and hold fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I used hot curlers 20 years ago and liked the metal clips, which is partly why I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting frequent comments on how nice my hair looks since I bought these!</li>
            <li>winner\\&quot;  Product works fine and does not  damage hair.  </li>
            <li>My baby fine hair is chin / shoulder length</li>
            <li>I actually saw this exact set in a Hammer &amp; Shlemmer magazine listed as \\&quot;the best set of</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and they give it a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>and I can get lots of curls or just beautiful body depending on how long I leave the curlers in!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked at all different prices and reviews, and this one had the most good ones.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them, the heat melted the plastic ends!!  </li>
            <li>and I love the new clips they come with (much better than the pins, in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used hot rollers in probably close to 10 years, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>I started using right away!  </li>
            <li>The ready indicator is just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This unit heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I put the big ones on top for more body.  </li>
            <li>These curlers heat quickly and curl within the 10 minutes as instructed.</li>
            <li>I thought they weren&#x27;t very hot</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>and I rarely can make it look shiney and wavy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times since buying them, and they give nice, smooth, bouncy curls!  </li>
            <li>So I figured, I should spend a little more on something of better quality.  </li>
            <li>actually more than my daughter needs to do a full head of long hair.   </li>
            <li>But they do not curl very much.</li>
            <li>I have brought hot roller machines and had to buy the plastic clips seperately.  </li>
            <li>I have been a hot roller junkie since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>really like these!  </li>
            <li>But, once inserted, the rollers work very well, and the different sizes are great for achieving different hair styles.</li>
            <li>Next time i will splurge for the mac daddy set, just wanted to replace my cracked top 15 year old cheap set and am not dissapointed.</li>
            <li>My hair looked just as good as if I&#x27;d sat there with a curling iron for 30+ minutes, with much less hassle!  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat fast, stay hot, and don&#x27;t burn fingers.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair (asian) and it curls well.  </li>
            <li>Nice styling tool for my hair, which is a little longer than chin length.  </li>
            <li>I set my hair and then finish getting ready so the rollers stay in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>These rollers were really easy/quick to use.  </li>
            <li>go brush you teeth, or whatever, and it will be ready in no time.  </li>
            <li>It really is a transformation.  </li>
            <li>Debated getting the $80.00 babyliss pro color coded stand up rollers but couldn&#x27;t justify that much for hair curlers and didn&#x27;t know how they worked.</li>
            <li>And the two types of clips are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I just curled my hair with my new hot roller machine.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice assortment of small, medium and large rollers...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, who has very long, fine, hard-to-curl hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a set since the old ones that were too hot to hold on to.  </li>
            <li>However, the problem is that there is a long slit in the middle of each roller which allows each roller to fit into the unit and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>, they both hold the rollers tight and give you more options.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, I was not sure that I would like the flocked rollers -- I thought my hair would slide right off.  </li>
            <li>On the first attempt (and with no prior experience using rollers), my daughter had full, bouncy curls that actually lasted (with a touch of hairspray) all day.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, very thick, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>The red buttoned curler - the one that&#x27;s supposed to tell you when the curlers are ready to use - stopped working after I used it once...  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all the prior reviewers&#x27; info which helped me to decide to buy these curlers.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate, so that may have something to do with it, but when I use a curling iron the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>I just have to guess when the curlers are ready, whcih is a drag when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Combining the two styles for securing the roller - both old, \\&quot;pick\\&quot; style and the big, claw clip - keeps the roller in without creases.   </li>
            <li>hot rollers\\&quot; , I went to Amazon with the picture and description and found it for about $20.00 less that</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and I pop them in when my hair is looking a little flat.  </li>

            <li> They heat up quickly and I pop them in when my hair is looking a little flat.  </li>
            <li> It has 6 small, 6 medium, and 8 large which works well with my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find hot rollers with the metal pins now.</li>
            <li> It did not take long to heat up at all.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> However, my hair is long</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair and these rollers curl it very well.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair, so I looked for one that had high reviews.</li>
            <li> They heated up in only a few minutes</li>
            <li> When securing the roller, the instructions warn to be careful not to let one leg of the pin go inside the slit.</li>
            <li> I looked through all the other reviews before I bought this product.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times, I&#x27;ve found that I have to leave the curlers in at least 30 minutes, and the curl only lasts about an hour.</li>
            <li> They do take a bit longer to heat up but that is a minimal complaint.  </li>
            <li> One complaint.  </li>
            <li> if you have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers said it gave them hair like a \\&quot;Victoria Secret&#x27;s model.\\</li>
            <li> I wanted them to work so badly that I tried them in every outlet in my home and got the same results...too bad.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> UPON OPENING THE COVER IT FELL OFF, YES FELL OUT OF ITS HINGES AND OFF IT CAME.  SO EVERYTHING AFTER THAT FOR ME WENT DOWNHILL.  THE ROLLERS HEATED UP OK, BUT I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MANUFACTURING OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find hot rollers with the metal pins now. They seem to hold the hair tighter without leaving dents like the plastic clips. The good thing about this product is you have the option to use the metal pins or plastic clips because it comes with both. Great product, no complaints, arrived on time!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews online I decided to buy these rollers.  The first time I used them, the heat melted the plastic ends!!  I managed to try them anyway and I could tell that they do produce great curls, but at the end of the day these were unusable for me given the plastic ends kept melting and then getting in my hair!  I wanted them to work so badly that I tried them in every outlet in my home and got the same results...too bad.  I would not recommend buying these rollers.</li>
            <li> This unit heats up quickly. The ready indicator is just OK in my opinion. I set my hair and then finish getting ready so the rollers stay in about 15 minutes. I have thick medium length hair and these rollers curl it very well. I like both the butterfly clips and the metal clips, they both hold the rollers tight and give you more options. The rollers are easy to handle...I thought they weren&#x27;t very hot but they sure curl my hair. I haven&#x27;t had a set since the old ones that were too hot to hold on to.  This unit is well built and seems sturdy. I like it!</li>
            <li> I used hot curlers 20 years ago and liked the metal clips, which is partly why I purchased this set.  The curlers heat fast, stay hot, and don&#x27;t burn fingers.  The velvet flocking is nice for fine hair.  The metal clips hold the curlers in fine hair better than the plastic, but when used together (plastic over metal), they stay in place until removed.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used hot rollers in probably close to 10 years, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  These rollers were really easy/quick to use.  They heated up in only a few minutes and I love the new clips they come with (much better than the pins, in my opinion).  I left them in my hair for maybe 15 minutes while I put my makeup on, and then took them out.  My hair looked just as good as if I&#x27;d sat there with a curling iron for 30+ minutes, with much less hassle!  I&#x27;d definitely recommend these rollers.</li>
            <li> I love this product ... it makes my hair very smooth.  Once you get the hang of how to use the clips to hold the rollers it works great.</li>
            <li> I just curled my hair with my new hot roller machine.  It is the greatest.  It has plastic clips, which I love, and also those metal ones which I do not like.  I have brought hot roller machines and had to buy the plastic clips seperately.  So finding them in the box was a welcome surprised.  It has 6 small, 6 medium, and 8 large which works well with my medium length hair.  It did not take long to heat up at all.  Plug it in...go brush you teeth, or whatever, and it will be ready in no time.  Do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a hot roller junkie since they first came out.  I generally don&#x27;t write reviews but this is by far the best heated roller set I have ever owned.  They do not break your hair.  I like the option of using either the metal or plastic clips.  When I am in a hurry I use the plastic ones. I have been through and trashed a lot of sets.  These are definitely a keeper.  They do take a bit longer to heat up but that is a minimal complaint.  The on/off switch is another plus.</li>
            <li> I love these electric rollers!!!!  I never thought they would work for my African American hair.  They heat up quickly and I pop them in when my hair is looking a little flat.  I love the three sizes---my hair is almost shoulder length.  I put the big ones on top for more body.  Whenever, I use the rollers---everyone thinks I just got my hair done.</li>
            <li> Nice styling tool for my hair, which is a little longer than chin length.  One complaint.  The red buttoned curler - the one that&#x27;s supposed to tell you when the curlers are ready to use - stopped working after I used it once...  I just have to guess when the curlers are ready, whcih is a drag when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I looked through all the other reviews before I bought this product. I have thick, course hair, so I looked for one that had high reviews. After using this a few times, I&#x27;ve found that I have to leave the curlers in at least 30 minutes, and the curl only lasts about an hour. I live in a humid climate, so that may have something to do with it, but when I use a curling iron the curls last all day. The product is easy to use, and I like the plastic alligator clips, just unsatisfied with the end result.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are by far the best I have ever used.  I have long curly hair and I rarely can make it look shiney and wavy...but now I can have that anytime !  They heat up quickly, and they are very easy to use.  They stay put once rolled, and don&#x27;t fall out.  I would purchase this item again in a heartbeat !</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A winner\\&quot;  Product works fine and does not  damage hair.  Big plus.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, I was not sure that I would like the flocked rollers -- I thought my hair would slide right off.  Well, they didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these!  I love the option to use the metal clips or the butterfly clips--- they both work great and do not leave a crimp mark in my hair at all.  I read the reviews on these rollers and glad I choose these.  My baby fine hair is chin / shoulder length and I can get lots of curls or just beautiful body depending on how long I leave the curlers in!&lt;br /&gt;Great choice!</li>
            <li> I did lots of researching before I decided to buy the Conair Babyliss Pro set.  I looked at all different prices and reviews, and this one had the most good ones.  So I figured, I should spend a little more on something of better quality.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times since buying them, and they give nice, smooth, bouncy curls!  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my hair after using this set.  It heats up nicely and quite quickly.  I have fine hair (asian) and it curls well.  Although, I&#x27;m quite a beginner on using them, I like how it curls and I&#x27;ll be practicing much more.  But I also love the volume it provides for your hair.  It really is a transformation.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good hairsetter, I&#x27;d recommend this one.  It&#x27;s quick, easy (after you get the hang of it), and you get great results.  The price I think, is worth the quality of the product as well. :D</li>
            <li> Babyliss ceramic rollers heat up very quickly. No waiting.  However, the problem is that there is a long slit in the middle of each roller which allows each roller to fit into the unit and heat up quickly.  When securing the roller, the instructions warn to be careful not to let one leg of the pin go inside the slit. This is tricky, esp. if you have thick hair.  The time I save in not having to wait for the rollers to heat up is lost when I have to struggle with inserting each pin all the way around each roller, making sure I haven&#x27;t accidentally inserted one end of the pin into the slit. But, once inserted, the rollers work very well, and the different sizes are great for achieving different hair styles.</li>
            <li> I actually saw this exact set in a Hammer &amp; Shlemmer magazine listed as \\&quot;the best set of hot rollers\\&quot; , I went to Amazon with the picture and description and found it for about $20.00 less that the H &amp; S price.  I bought it, and I like it. However, my hair is long and I wish it had jumbo rollers. Debated getting the $80.00 babyliss pro color coded stand up rollers but couldn&#x27;t justify that much for hair curlers and didn&#x27;t know how they worked. They work well, and hair is shiny and holds curls. Next time i will splurge for the mac daddy set, just wanted to replace my cracked top 15 year old cheap set and am not dissapointed. Nice to have both clips and pins in this set.</li>
            <li> I started using right away!  These are perfect for my hair.  I heat them up for about 20 minutes and they are good to go- The curl last all day.  I do have curly hair.  These rollers make my hair very smooth.  I love them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has very long, fine, hard-to-curl hair.  After reading all the reviews, I decided on this product and was very satisfied.  What a bargain ($45)!  The flocked rollers are easy to handle and hold fine hair.  There is a nice assortment of small, medium and large rollers...actually more than my daughter needs to do a full head of long hair.   On the first attempt (and with no prior experience using rollers), my daughter had full, bouncy curls that actually lasted (with a touch of hairspray) all day.  Some reviewers said it gave them hair like a \\&quot;Victoria Secret&#x27;s model.\\&quot;  I would agree.</li>
            <li> These are good curlers and heat up fast.  I have fine hair and they give it a lot of body.  But they do not curl very much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the prior reviewers&#x27; info which helped me to decide to buy these curlers. I have very fine, very thick, very straight hair. These curlers heat quickly and curl within the 10 minutes as instructed. And the curl lasts all day and into the evening. I&#x27;m not kidding. I have never found anything before that would keep the curl in my hair all day. The three different size curlers allows for a variety of hairstyles, even with the same hairlength. And the two types of clips are very helpful. The ceramic curlers have nice insulation so you don&#x27;t feel the heat of the curler as you handle them. I&#x27;m getting frequent comments on how nice my hair looks since I bought these! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Combining the two styles for securing the roller - both old, \\&quot;pick\\&quot; style and the big, claw clip - keeps the roller in without creases.   Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that can actually curl my hair, and keep it curled! Of course hairspray helps. Great product - definitely recommend! :)</li>
