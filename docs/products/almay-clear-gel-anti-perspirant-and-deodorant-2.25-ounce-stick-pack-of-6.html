            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with Almay Gel.  </li>
            <li>This is a very effective product.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for years ,no burning ,no rash ,just a good product.</li>
            <li>I looked for a hypoallergenic deorderant and this got good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I ordered more and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This Almay aloe deodorant is absolutely perfect -- it has a very light scent that is fresh but not overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>This deoderant/antiperspirant is amazing for anyone who has allergies.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best deodorant for us as it does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Many anti-perspirants irritate my skin</li>
            <li>If that is one of your objectives, you will love Almay too.</li>
            <li>We used to be able to get it at Rite Aid but they seem to no longer carry it, looked elsewhere without luck.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and this deodorant gives me absolutely no problems and great odor/sweat control!  </li>
            <li>I began using this Clear Gel with its light scent four years ago and it has never failed me!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very natural and light.</li>
            <li>Reviewed all ready!</li>
            <li>love the stuff , especially  when the stick rub on was done away with.</li>
            <li>Thanks Almay and amazon!</li>
            <li>The scent is so light, I barely smell it, but my husband tells me he can</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of antiperspirant and found they either didn&#x27;t work or they left residue all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I never thought mine was particularly so--I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li>My husband is very particular as far a what he uses</li>
            <li>And as an anti-antiperspirant, it works just as hard and effectively as those marketed as &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;maxi-strength&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It works as well as any other anti perspirant, but is really easy on your sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad amazon provides a way to find things that stores have replaced with newer but possible less functional items.</li>
            <li>no less!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin--</li>
            <li>I wish natural deodorants worked for me, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was using old spice.  </li>
            <li>It used to be sold in stores in all kinds of different fragrances, but one is fortunate to find it in \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; these days (not exactly what a man desires for his deodorant)!  </li>

            <li> The problem comes with other brands that scent free can mean odor break-through, and scented anti-antiperspirants trigger my asthma.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive skin like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and asthma, so using anti-antiperspirants with little or no scent is essential.</li>
            <li> But seriously, you&#x27;ll notice that there are only really two major differences between brands - the percentage of active ingredient and the form of the delivery agent (gel, stick, spray).</li>
            <li> The next time you&#x27;re at the drug store, go ahead and check out the active ingredients list on a few different brands of antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> Using this hypoallergenic deodorant stopped  the itching I has with other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why you would choose a different brand (unless you insist on something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; like one of those crystals) when this one offers a hypoallergenic base, a high concentration of active ingredient, a moisturizing base that leaves little to no residue, and a subtle but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This one smells a little bit stronger than I&#x27;d wish, but it works</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years, and it is very hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is one of the few I can use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble with allergic reaction caused by deodorant, then give it a try!  </li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;stinky pits&amp;#34; complaints, and</li>
            <li> he loves this Almay deodorant and is soo hard</li>
            <li> My girlfriend complained I had &amp;#34;stinky pits&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> For me, not every deodorant works well without either discoloring fabric or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It does leave discolored marks in the armpits of some of my clothes unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband because he gets a terrible rash from any deodorant he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine, and doesn&#x27;t give him a rash, and in the miserable summer heat...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Reviewed all ready! love the stuff , especially  when the stick rub on was done away with.</li>
            <li> This deoderant/antiperspirant is amazing for anyone who has allergies. It does the job that the product is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> When my drugstore stopped carrying this product I had to search elsewhere for it.  Many anti-perspirants irritate my skin but I have never had a problem with this.  Both my husband and I find this to be the best we have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of antiperspirant and found they either didn&#x27;t work or they left residue all over my clothes.  This Almay aloe deodorant is absolutely perfect -- it has a very light scent that is fresh but not overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.  Oh, and lest I forget -- I have not had one bit of underarm perspiration or odor since I started using it.  Thank you Almay!</li>
            <li> great product.  I have allergies and this deodorant gives me absolutely no problems and great odor/sweat control!  definitely a return customer</li>
            <li> Using this hypoallergenic deodorant stopped  the itching I has with other products. I ordered more and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and asthma, so using anti-antiperspirants with little or no scent is essential. The problem comes with other brands that scent free can mean odor break-through, and scented anti-antiperspirants trigger my asthma. I began using this Clear Gel with its light scent four years ago and it has never failed me! The scent is so light, I barely smell it, but my husband tells me he can and it&#x27;s very natural and light. And as an anti-antiperspirant, it works just as hard and effectively as those marketed as &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;maxi-strength&amp;#34;. Sadly, my local drug store stopped selling this scent so I have to get a dozen at a time through Amazon. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I can find that works for me.  It used to be sold in stores in all kinds of different fragrances, but one is fortunate to find it in \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; these days (not exactly what a man desires for his deodorant)!  Aloe is great!  It provides a lasting fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all!  If you&#x27;re having trouble with allergic reaction caused by deodorant, then give it a try!  I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
            <li> Gave me an itchy and persistent underarm rash.  If you have sensitive skin-- I never thought mine was particularly so--I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband because he gets a terrible rash from any deodorant he&#x27;s tried. this doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine, and doesn&#x27;t give him a rash, and in the miserable summer heat... boy could he use it!</li>
            <li> I wish natural deodorants worked for me, but they don&#x27;t. This one smells a little bit stronger than I&#x27;d wish, but it works and so I use it. It does leave discolored marks in the armpits of some of my clothes unfortunately.</li>
            <li> the deodorant works.  And it does not cause me to get rashes because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic.  If that is one of your objectives, you will love Almay too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any Almay deordorant in local stores.  If I use anthing else I get itchy pits.  This is a very effective product.</li>
            <li> It works as recomened by my Dr., It is also inexpencive compared to others products on the market.  It has not caused one problem in the area of my arm pit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years, and it is very hard to find locally. It works as well as any other anti perspirant, but is really easy on your sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered the multiple containers of this product. For me, not every deodorant works well without either discoloring fabric or irritating my skin. This one avoids both those issues while doing what it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m so glad amazon provides a way to find things that stores have replaced with newer but possible less functional items. Thanks Almay and amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years ,no burning ,no rash ,just a good product. Would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The next time you&#x27;re at the drug store, go ahead and check out the active ingredients list on a few different brands of antiperspirant/deodorant. Go ahead, I&#x27;ll wait... But seriously, you&#x27;ll notice that there are only really two major differences between brands - the percentage of active ingredient and the form of the delivery agent (gel, stick, spray). I don&#x27;t know why you would choose a different brand (unless you insist on something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; like one of those crystals) when this one offers a hypoallergenic base, a high concentration of active ingredient, a moisturizing base that leaves little to no residue, and a subtle but pleasant smell. This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular as far a what he uses&lt;br /&gt;For perfume he doesn&#x27;t like Anything too perfumidy&lt;br /&gt;But he loves this Almay deodorant and is soo hard&lt;br /&gt;To find in this scent... So I will be a buyer for ever&lt;br /&gt;Since now I know you guys have it..!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is one of the few I can use. It was helpful that I could also get it in about two days.</li>
            <li> i have been using this brand for several years. the aloe is my fav as it relieves burning sensation after shaving. will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant for us as it does not irritate your skin. We used to be able to get it at Rite Aid but they seem to no longer carry it, looked elsewhere without luck. Went to Amazon and there it was, in an inexpensive 6-pack no less! Yay Amazon!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend complained I had &amp;#34;stinky pits&amp;#34;.  I was using old spice.  I looked for a hypoallergenic deorderant and this got good reviews.  I&#x27;ve been really happy with Almay Gel.  No more &amp;#34;stinky pits&amp;#34; complaints, and it doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive skin like some other products I&#x27;ve tried. Two thumbs up.</li>
