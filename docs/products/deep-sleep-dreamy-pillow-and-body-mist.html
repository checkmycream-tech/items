            <li>This stuff is so wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product, very great smell.</li>
            <li>Great company, great product.</li>
            <li>Still a great bedtime scent.</li>
            <li>Great idea, just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my pillows 10 minutes before i went bed and its smells great not over powering, but the Limey scent is not what i would want at night before bed.</li>
            <li>Nice smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and relaxing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Good as a gift for someone with ptsd, anxiety issues.</li>
            <li>Excellent scent to calm the nerves!</li>
            <li>Nice for the pillows and sheets.</li>
            <li>Spray right on the pillowcase for a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, and use it nightly when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>I still think Bath &amp; Body Works is much better.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t LOVE the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is the latest product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells more like citrus than lavender to me.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on a separate occassion just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke.  </li>
            <li>It has a Limey scent and its more of a Summer season use.</li>
            <li>This is defenately more for Summer use, because of the Lime scent.</li>
            <li>I love using this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>and to my surprise.. I slept through the whole night without waking up even once!!!!</li>
            <li>This may work great for others that don&#x27;t have sensitive allergies, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>use this on my pillowcases -- just a couple of sprays for a light scent.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this and would consider buying it again when I am close to running out.</li>
            <li>There is a light under scent of lavender.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to sleep any more soundly or get sleepy any sooner than I normally do.  </li>
            <li>Better scent and really replaces me.</li>
            <li>This spray scent is wonderful, rather delicate.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion I forget to spray my pillow, I don&#x27;t sleep well at all.</li>
            <li>I when purchased it, i though it was going to be more Soft of a scent to it.</li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t lose anything right?)</li>
            <li>I use it right before getting into bed (no waiting).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a problem (for me), but it is something to be aware of if you are thinking of buying this.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the soft smell of this product on my pillow.  </li>
            <li>Spraying this on pillows and top sheet, get into bed later and rest your head......goodnight.  </li>
            <li>It relaxes me so much.</li>
            <li>This mist really works.</li>
            <li>However, for whatever reason, ever since I started the ritual of calming myself down 30 minutes before bed and spraying it on my pillow, I have been sleeping much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it the old college try and use it a few more times to get a better idea if it helps or not then I will give another review in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t actually say how long it lasts because I have been falling asleep pretty quickly and staying asleep all night.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really leave the pillowcases wet or anything, as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been sleeping enough lately and I am trying to do what I can to improve the quality of the sleep I do get (so, magnesium oil on the feet, white noise, frequently washing sheets, room-darkening shades, etc.).  </li>

            <li> I appreciate the little things in life.  </li>
            <li> It makes me want to snuggle down in my bed after a hard day at work and a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up 5-6 times a night and it bothered the crap out of me!</li>
            <li> I have read that any bad scents can cause bad dreams-</li>

            <li> I use this to spray my pillow case at night...the scent of lavender induces sleep.....this is great!  It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Well.. I have been insomniac since i was 7 or 8! I usually wake up 5-6 times a night and it bothered the crap out of me! I found this product at the body shop and decided to try it out (I wouldn&#x27;t lose anything right?) and to my surprise.. I slept through the whole night without waking up even once!!!! It&#x27;s part of my pre-sleeping routine now and I love it!!!! I would def recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Nice smell! Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great company, great product. Love the scent, and use it nightly when I go to bed. Spray right on the pillowcase for a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Meh. It was OK. I still think Bath &amp; Body Works is much better. Better scent and really replaces me.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I use it every night. On the rare occasion I forget to spray my pillow, I don&#x27;t sleep well at all.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t LOVE the fragrance.  The shipping and prices were spot on...</li>
            <li> This spray scent is wonderful, rather delicate. It is not overwhelming to someone with a sensitive nose like me. I sleep well and since I haven&#x27;t got any sort of scientific background I can&#x27;t affirm it is due to the continuous use of the product. However, for whatever reason, ever since I started the ritual of calming myself down 30 minutes before bed and spraying it on my pillow, I have been sleeping much better.</li>
            <li> Still a great bedtime scent. The company has not changed the mix. Good as a gift for someone with ptsd, anxiety issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent to calm the nerves! Nice for the pillows and sheets. I recommend this- I have read that any bad scents can cause bad dreams- so this can help just in case!</li>
            <li> I have issues sleeping. While the spray doesn&#x27;t work all the time, it still helps. I really enjoy the smell and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> This stuff is so wonderful.  I spray it on and sleep all night.  It relaxes me so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided that I like to apply a little scent to my pillow before I go to sleep.  I haven&#x27;t been sleeping enough lately and I am trying to do what I can to improve the quality of the sleep I do get (so, magnesium oil on the feet, white noise, frequently washing sheets, room-darkening shades, etc.).  This is the latest product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my pillowcases -- just a couple of sprays for a light scent.  I use it right before getting into bed (no waiting).  It doesn&#x27;t really leave the pillowcases wet or anything, as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.  I can&#x27;t actually say how long it lasts because I have been falling asleep pretty quickly and staying asleep all night.  I can&#x27;t attribute that solely to this product, but I do think this helps.  It&#x27;s pleasant and relaxing and soothing.  And it hasn&#x27;t stained my pillowcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells more like citrus than lavender to me.  That&#x27;s not a problem (for me), but it is something to be aware of if you are thinking of buying this.  Of course if you spray it on yourself, it could be different, since fragrances are known to react differently to various individuals&#x27; body chemistries.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this and would consider buying it again when I am close to running out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this mist really bothered my allergies.  I sprayed it on my pillow at night, and woke up with red swollen, itchy eyes that next morning.  I tried it on a separate occassion just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke.  This may work great for others that don&#x27;t have sensitive allergies, though.</li>
            <li> I tried this spray and used it as directed on the bottle. Didn&#x27;t seem to sleep any more soundly or get sleepy any sooner than I normally do.  I&#x27;ll give it the old college try and use it a few more times to get a better idea if it helps or not then I will give another review in the very near future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep smell at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t works for me</li>
            <li> To me, it has a predominant citrus scent (Lemon or Lime).  There is a light under scent of lavender.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times, none the less, and found it didn&#x27;t last long and it was not inductive of deep sleep.  Great idea, just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the little things in life.  The little things, such as relaxation methods of enjoyment.  I enjoy the soft smell of this product on my pillow.  The scent makes me go mmmmmmm.  It makes me want to snuggle down in my bed after a hard day at work and a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Spraying this on pillows and top sheet, get into bed later and rest your head......goodnight.  This mist really works. A must have now!</li>
            <li> I when purchased it, i though it was going to be more Soft of a scent to it. It has a Limey scent and its more of a Summer season use. I spray it on my pillows 10 minutes before i went bed and its smells great not over powering, but the Limey scent is not what i would want at night before bed. This is defenately more for Summer use, because of the Lime scent.</li>
            <li> I love using this product.  I believe it helps me sleep.  I love the fragrance.  Lavender is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, very great smell.</li>
