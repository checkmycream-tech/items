            <li>NOTHING TO SAY PERFECT FOR ME!</li>
            <li>Very nice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>I find it nice as well and burns evenly and the price was great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a good deal of fragrances, and this one is tied for my all-time favorites.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Friends come over and comment on how nice it is.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nicely packed.</li>
            <li>I could see mixing this scent with something like jasmine blossom or maybe Ylang-Ylang and loving it even more.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that the scent was not so over powering or sweet that it smoked you out of the room!</li>
            <li>HEM has proven to be my regular incense provider, and Gardenia and Frangipanni are pleasant surprises to add to a great product line.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find them available in bulk on Amazon at a much better price!</li>
            <li>I love the way these smell.  </li>
            <li>shipper was prompt and the package was wrapped appropriately &amp; arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>The gardenia was a refreshing scent just like the flower</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>certainly a favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Hem incense for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very flowery but still very nice.</li>
            <li>Very clean scent</li>
            <li>They smell pretty good and the smell lingers</li>
            <li>This will cover strong smell of &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34;, if that is what you need.</li>
            <li>Light smelling, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good this smells</li>
            <li>but if I light 3 my 4 room flat smells great for an hour or maybe a bit longer.</li>
            <li>enjoy clean light scents.&lt;br /&gt;Hem</li>
            <li>but this one is so light and clean smelling</li>
            <li>This really does not smell like a gardenia plant but rather a strong cheap gardenia perfume.</li>
            <li>Clear refreshing uplifting scent.  </li>
            <li>Not unlike fresh gardenia soap.  </li>
            <li>My daughter thought the smell to powerful.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the back of my throat, and it lingers nicely.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it really did smell like flowers (unless you were right on top of the burning stick).  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this scent and brand of incense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not in my top ten but</li>
            <li>Gardenia Incense  smells like our Gardenia Bush after the sun has warmed it on a hot June afternoon.</li>
            <li>a nice refreshing scent that is not at all overwhelming... not ideal if you are trying to cover other smells but doesnt give me a headache when i light it...</li>
            <li>If you like the scent of gardenia you will really like this.</li>
            <li>Normally light scents put me off, but this is definitely an exception.</li>
            <li>nice smell, but a bit too flimsy &amp; uneven</li>
            <li>nice fresh smell, not overly floral like I expected, after reading the other reviews decided to try it as I am an incense junkie....</li>
            <li>It had a relatively strong scent, so I placed it in the center of my house &amp; let it drift throughout.  </li>
            <li>very nice my mom and dad hate the most incense</li>
            <li>and I find it doesn&#x27;t expand very far</li>
            <li>used to get this exact brand and scent from a street vendor who recently stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Clear scent lingers after burning.</li>
            <li>The smell clears your senses and even those who are not into incense have commented on the clear smell.</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy perfumy cloying scent.  </li>
            <li>can make it where you need to open a window to get smoke out not the smell which is not to much.</li>
            <li>Very smoky and burns very fast, less than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>my husband actually likes it so that says a lot because normally he hates incense...</li>
            <li>I always have bad luck with jasmine as much as I love it, and thought Gardenia would be the same, but this fragrance is strong enough to linger.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have several scents in this brand and it is excellent--good price as well</li>
            <li> Very smoky and burns very fast, less than a couple minutes. Gardenia scent very faint. A waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way these smell.  Friends come over and comment on how nice it is.

            <li> Clear refreshing uplifting scent.  Not unlike fresh gardenia soap.  This is not a heavy perfumy cloying scent.  Clear scent lingers after burning. A definite repurchase. The smell clears your senses and even those who are not into incense have commented on the clear smell.</li>
            <li> There is an underlinging smell with the gardina scent I cant figure out. They smell pretty good and the smell lingers but there is a lot of smoke with they are burning to the point 2-3 sticks in the same area can make it where you need to open a window to get smoke out not the smell which is not to much. I will not orders these again but it didnt hurt to try them, and i do like they are wrapped in sets of 20 so you dont have to open all at once.</li>
            <li> Light smelling, not too strong. Very nice!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this scent and brand of incense.  The stick burns for a relatively long period of time.  It had a relatively strong scent, so I placed it in the center of my house &amp; let it drift throughout.  The floral scent lingered in the house for several hours afterwards.  I was pleasantly surprised that it really did smell like flowers (unless you were right on top of the burning stick).  I will definitely purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was prompt and the package was wrapped appropriately &amp; arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> very nice my mom and dad hate the most incense but this one is so light and clean smelling they don&#x27;t mind it.  I find it nice as well and burns evenly and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a good deal of fragrances, and this one is tied for my all-time favorites.

            <li> NOTHING TO SAY PERFECT FOR ME!</li>
            <li> Smells burnt. After smell is less than desireable</li>
            <li> Very clean scent but it doesn&#x27;t last and I find it doesn&#x27;t expand very far but if I light 3 my 4 room flat smells great for an hour or maybe a bit longer.</li>
            <li> nice fresh smell, not overly floral like I expected, after reading the other reviews decided to try it as I am an incense junkie....my husband actually likes it so that says a lot because normally he hates incense...</li>

            <li> I was very pleased that the scent was not so over powering or sweet that it smoked you out of the room! The gardenia was a refreshing scent just like the flower I was very pleased. If you like the scent of gardenia you will really like this.</li>
            <li> Love it. My house smells like my Nana Shug&#x27;s parlor. It&#x27;s a beautiful thing.</li>
            <li> Normally light scents put me off, but this is definitely an exception. It&#x27;s not in my top ten but certainly a favorite. I would recommend this for a home that has a mix of preference... even, dare I say, people who like musk&#x27;s I can see liking this one. I could see mixing this scent with something like jasmine blossom or maybe Ylang-Ylang and loving it even more.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Hem incense for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy clean light scents.&lt;br /&gt;Hem Gardenia Incense  smells like our Gardenia Bush after the sun has warmed it on a hot June afternoon.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because I don&#x27;t like the smell.Expected smell something like gardenia,but, for my opinion,nothing like that.Waist of money.Do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fragrant but doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia.</li>
            <li> Very flowery but still very nice. Like sticking your face in a bunch of flowers. Smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the back of my throat, and it lingers nicely.</li>
            <li> Nicely packed. Long burn. This really does not smell like a gardenia plant but rather a strong cheap gardenia perfume.This will cover strong smell of &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34;, if that is what you need.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good this smells and I grow gardenia&#x27;s so it&#x27;s helping feel like I&#x27;m outside in my garden.</li>
