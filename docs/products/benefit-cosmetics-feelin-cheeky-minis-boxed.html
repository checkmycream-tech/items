    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are the best cheek/lip tints.</li>
            <li>themselves - Benefit is an excellent brand, and each of these products is awesome.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Great value for all 3 bottles.</li>
            <li>Great minis to buy before you commit.</li>
            <li>Love this set!!</li>
            <li>I love anything by Benefit Cosmetics!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; sampler of the Benefit Cosmetics cheek tint because I wasn&#x27;t sure of which color would suit me best.  </li>
            <li>I like the compact size of them and they are great because you can see which one you like best and then buy the full size of your fave-</li>
            <li>great... love it!</li>
            <li>The posietint works good as a blush, but I didn&#x27;t care for it as a lip product.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>The tints are especially great with hot humid weather- doesn&#x27;t melt off.</li>
            <li>I truly am IN LOVE with this kit!</li>
            <li>it is nice and light and has a beautiful color and glow that it adds to my cheeks</li>
            <li>I really like the package, very good!</li>
            <li>out that it&#x27;s a nice purse size tint if you need a refresher, but i wouldn&#x27;t spend money on that size again.</li>
            <li>I love the posietint and benetint.  </li>
            <li>I love benefit&#x27;s benetint.</li>
            <li>I love the size of these.</li>
            <li>I will try more of their colors now.</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident in buying full-size versions.</li>
            <li>I love the Benetint.</li>
            <li>They seem to love it</li>
            <li>the darkest color is actually my favorite.</li>
            <li>In the package, the tree items are all my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the mini size.</li>
            <li>I hope you also dealt with the seller appropriately.</li>
            <li>I love this make up</li>
            <li>I have never purchased these three products before but have purchased many benefit products.</li>
            <li>To top it off, mine came about 1/3 empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good for daily use and gave you a great cherry shine on your nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>the circle logo is more centered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to get a full size of the benetint, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because of my light skin, but I almost feel like a shiny eyeshadow would work better on the corners of your eyes than this does.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing on my fair skin and is great with red or burgundy lips or even when wearing no makeup at all for a natural flush.  </li>
            <li>and I decided that it would be more cost effective to buy the minis vs the large bottles, just in case I didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped my order very quickly and it arrived just as described.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to rub it in immediately or you&#x27;ll look like a clown!</li>
            <li>This set is great for testing these out, but be warned they are TINY!</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money buying these great products from someone who&#x27;s marking it up so much!</li>
            <li>The rose one smelled normal but it wasn&#x27;t filled all the way-</li>
            <li>However, Benetint and Posietint retail on Benefit&#x27;s own website for $30 for .4oz ($75 an ounce), and High Beam retails for $26 for .45oz ($57.78 per ounce).</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to try out the posietint and highbeam before paying for a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>I am a convert for life with the BeneTint and will get a full size as soon as the mini is used up.  </li>
            <li>but i have tried the real benefit lip and cheek stains and love them.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for being understanding and giving me a quick refund.</li>
            <li>I love the high beam to highlight my brow bone.</li>
            <li>I do in fact, love the high beam because it gives me an amazinggg glow to my cheekbones, the bridge of my nose and my cupids</li>
            <li>I love the high beam.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s very small, it&#x27;s really nice for the price since each Benefit cheek thing is about 30 dollars, and it&#x27;s good if you want to try them out.</li>
            <li>The tints last a long time and the minis are perfect travel size companions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for evening and a little dab for the daytime.</li>
            <li>High beam is my favorite, used benetint on my lips and liked that too (except it has a strange taste/smell).</li>
            <li>Bottles are also only filled to about 3/4th of their capacity compared to authentic product.</li>
            <li>and I was okay with it being a bit old.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try them before buying the full sized items first.</li>
            <li>worth to try</li>
            <li>was very excited about the price, however makeup came and the packaging was old, thinned out and fading/scratched.</li>
            <li>This product has the original color, and a Posietint (which is a lighter pinkish color), and High Beam, (which is a shimmer highlighter).</li>
            <li>They hold quite a lot, as you don&#x27;t need much, just the right size for my makeup bag or just to toss in my purse, no need to worry about leakage).</li>
            <li>in addition the real benetint circle logo leans towards the right while on the picture</li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s real products are awesome, but sadly, this is not it.</li>
            <li>If you like the product you will obviously have to buy the full size pretty soon because these things are minuscule!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my own fault, but nonetheless I thought it important to provide a review in order to warn other potential buyers of the issue.</li>
            <li>These also all have a strange, powerfully chemical smell, which genuine Benefit products do not.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certainly filing a complain.</li>
            <li>so the lip stain really brightens up my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use much since a dab will do for my taste</li>
            <li>If you order this and need to tell if it&#x27;s the real deal or not, there are videos and guides on the Internet that can help you figure it out.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t the real thing .</li>
            <li>The Benetint is too light, I swear they put red Kool-Aid in it.</li>
            <li>Posietint is a nice clean pink, Benetint is a subtle reddish pink, and High Beam looks great as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>I personally love high beam and it lasted for a very long time</li>
            <li>The high beam doesn&#x27;t do much at all for me.</li>
            <li>The benetint cheek stain also works a lot better than I expected, it doesn&#x27;t smear, but blends very well; I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I like the lighter color in particular</li>
            <li>The High Beam was more than half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>per ounce &#x3D; $9.75, and High Beam would be .13oz*$57.78 per ounce &#x3D; $7.51, and $9.75+$9.75+$7.51 &#x3D; $27.01.)</li>
            <li>and I ended up giving away the &#x27;high beam&#x27; tone since I thought it didn&#x27;t go with my complexion.</li>
            <li>I already used the High Beam highlighter, but my friend recommended the cheek and lip tints, so I bought this set.  </li>
            <li>i got to use them all in this little sample box, and i fell in love with all the colors.</li>
            <li>, it gives such a fresh girly look.</li>
            <li>its a very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I love the PosieTint, too, especially in the spring time for a natural pink glow.  </li>
            <li>Many companies resell other brand&#x27;s items (\\&quot;Never, ever the same place twice\\&quot; ring a bell?)</li>
            <li>The highbeam was pretty much useless, since it&#x27;s so shiny on its own</li>
            <li>I have a feeling these will last a long time, though, so it is probably worth it!</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;posie&#x27; and &#x27;bene&#x27; equally and will probably buy larger versions of both as soon as they run dry.</li>
            <li>if you look closely on the real ones, the tube rim is clear while on the picture the tube rim is white.</li>
            <li>and it completely disappears under a powder.</li>
            <li>I use this product and for some reason this one I ordered from them is watery and seems old.</li>
            <li>I knew from the beginning that this mini was a Sephora exclusive product, so I wasn&#x27;t planning on fussing if it was near expiration.</li>
            <li>Possibly old products?</li>
            <li>These are the only products I use for blush and highlighter now - they stay on much longer than traditional blush and look very natural.</li>
            <li>I put the High Beam right under my eyebrows and a little bit under my eyes and it brightens them up!</li>
            <li>Small enough bottles, but they sure can last a long time.</li>
            <li>But if it is, it&#x27;s a good fake!</li>
            <li>The High Beam is too light and doesn&#x27;t blend well, and the Posietint is a close fake, but too runny.</li>
            <li>I also wish the full prices for the items weren&#x27;t so darn expensive, it makes me really have to conserve what I use.</li>
            <li>I saw this smart little kit of minis.</li>

            <li> I have had them for a while now and have to admit that they are rather long lasting!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the consistency is supposed to be of the pose tint and the high beam</li>
            <li> It is not one of my favorites, the shipping was fast although it was really hard for me to blend it out on my cheeks without the line as of where i applied on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to try out the posietint and highbeam before paying for a full size bottle. I thought the benetint would be too dark for my skin tone, but I was wrong. It&#x27;s very subtle, and you can layer it to make it darker. The posietint works good as a blush, but I didn&#x27;t care for it as a lip product. The highbeam was pretty much useless, since it&#x27;s so shiny on its own and it completely disappears under a powder. I&#x27;m definitely going to get a full size of the benetint, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the posietint and benetint.  I have fair skin so the lip stain really brightens up my face. The benetint cheek stain also works a lot better than I expected, it doesn&#x27;t smear, but blends very well; I was pleasantly surprised. The high beam doesn&#x27;t do much at all for me. Maybe it is because of my light skin, but I almost feel like a shiny eyeshadow would work better on the corners of your eyes than this does. I also wish the full prices for the items weren&#x27;t so darn expensive, it makes me really have to conserve what I use. I have a feeling these will last a long time, though, so it is probably worth it!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very small, it&#x27;s really nice for the price since each Benefit cheek thing is about 30 dollars, and it&#x27;s good if you want to try them out.</li>
            <li> Although I couldn&#x27;t find any use for the highlight, I like the tints. Small enough bottles, but they sure can last a long time. I like the lighter color in particular, it gives such a fresh girly look. But not really made-up look. Great value for all 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> I love benefit&#x27;s benetint. This product has the original color, and a Posietint (which is a lighter pinkish color), and High Beam, (which is a shimmer highlighter). I love the size of these. They hold quite a lot, as you don&#x27;t need much, just the right size for my makeup bag or just to toss in my purse, no need to worry about leakage). I will try more of their colors now. I love the high beam to highlight my brow bone.</li>
            <li> These are the best cheek/lip tints. Buy the small versions for traveling or to keep in your purse. These are the only products I use for blush and highlighter now - they stay on much longer than traditional blush and look very natural. Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to rub it in immediately or you&#x27;ll look like a clown!</li>
            <li> I saw this smart little kit of minis. I had not ever used these products and I decided that it would be more cost effective to buy the minis vs the large bottles, just in case I didn&#x27;t like the product. All I can say is that they are all now half gone and I feel more confident in buying full-size versions. The tints last a long time and the minis are perfect travel size companions. Posietint is a nice clean pink, Benetint is a subtle reddish pink, and High Beam looks great as a highlighter. I would even purchase this kit again for travel. The tints are especially great with hot humid weather- doesn&#x27;t melt off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terminally ill, so you can imagine how pale I am most of the time. I was having a hard time finding a blush that didn&#x27;t make me look like a clown! My mom used this when she was a teenager! I love the Benetint. I blends in so well that you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve put on blush. You can also put it on your lips as well. One recommendation though; use a make-up sponge because it WILL stain your fingers! I put the High Beam right under my eyebrows and a little bit under my eyes and it brightens them up! I truly am IN LOVE with this kit!</li>
            <li> I like the compact size of them and they are great because you can see which one you like best and then buy the full size of your fave- I personally love high beam and it lasted for a very long time</li>
            <li> Bought for teenage girls.  They seem to love it</li>
            <li> ive been wanting to try these for a while, but never wanted to dish out the money for it.   i got to use them all in this little sample box, and i fell in love with all the colors. i use them daiy.  the darkest color is actually my favorite. its a very natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I really like the package, very good! In the package, the tree items are all my favorite. What&#x27;s more, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> This set is great for testing these out, but be warned they are TINY! If you like the product you will obviously have to buy the full size pretty soon because these things are minuscule! High beam is my favorite, used benetint on my lips and liked that too (except it has a strange taste/smell).</li>
            <li> Please know that I&#x27;m not giving this product a one star rating because of the quality of the products themselves - Benefit is an excellent brand, and each of these products is awesome. However, Benetint and Posietint retail on Benefit&#x27;s own website for $30 for .4oz ($75 an ounce), and High Beam retails for $26 for .45oz ($57.78 per ounce). Therefore, the retail value of this set would be $27.01. (My math: each of these minis is .13oz, so Benetint and Posietint would be .13oz*$75 per ounce &#x3D; $9.75, and High Beam would be .13oz*$57.78 per ounce &#x3D; $7.51, and $9.75+$9.75+$7.51 &#x3D; $27.01.) Please do not waste your money buying these great products from someone who&#x27;s marking it up so much!</li>
            <li> I ordered Benefit Cosmetics Feelin&#x27; Cheeky! Minis (Boxed). I love the mini size. They are perfect for travel. The seller shipped my order very quickly and it arrived just as described.</li>
            <li> Fake product emulating special edition sizing from Sephora. Has weird smell, different packaging, and cheap and weird shades/colors. Bottles are also only filled to about 3/4th of their capacity compared to authentic product. Complete waste of money, wish I had realized this sooner to get a refund.</li>
            <li> ╰☆╮I like, not necessarily love these products, the reason being is because since i&#x27;m a medium/tan skinned, the Bene-tint and the posie-tint don&#x27;t show up as well. I do in fact, love the high beam because it gives me an amazinggg glow to my cheekbones, the bridge of my nose and my cupids bow.&lt;br /&gt;✯ 4/5. ✯</li>
            <li> was very excited about the price, however makeup came and the packaging was old, thinned out and fading/scratched. Product consistency is weird - I use this product and for some reason this one I ordered from them is watery and seems old. This was supposted to be a stocking stuffer but no avail.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; sampler of the Benefit Cosmetics cheek tint because I wasn&#x27;t sure of which color would suit me best.  I have had them for a while now and have to admit that they are rather long lasting!  I don&#x27;t really use much since a dab will do for my taste and I ended up giving away the &#x27;high beam&#x27; tone since I thought it didn&#x27;t go with my complexion. I love &#x27;posie&#x27; and &#x27;bene&#x27; equally and will probably buy larger versions of both as soon as they run dry.</li>
            <li> It is not one of my favorites, the shipping was fast although it was really hard for me to blend it out on my cheeks without the line as of where i applied on.</li>
            <li> Fake products. If you order this and need to tell if it&#x27;s the real deal or not, there are videos and guides on the Internet that can help you figure it out. Benefit&#x27;s real products are awesome, but sadly, this is not it. Thank you, Amazon, for being understanding and giving me a quick refund. I hope you also dealt with the seller appropriately.</li>
            <li> I already used the High Beam highlighter, but my friend recommended the cheek and lip tints, so I bought this set.  I am a convert for life with the BeneTint and will get a full size as soon as the mini is used up.  It looks amazing on my fair skin and is great with red or burgundy lips or even when wearing no makeup at all for a natural flush.  I love the PosieTint, too, especially in the spring time for a natural pink glow.  Love this set!!</li>
            <li> I knew from the beginning that this mini was a Sephora exclusive product, so I wasn&#x27;t planning on fussing if it was near expiration. Many companies resell other brand&#x27;s items (\\&quot;Never, ever the same place twice\\&quot; ring a bell?) and I was okay with it being a bit old. However, I am NOT okay with buying used cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottles had sticky, greasy fingerprints all over them. The item comes boxed, so who was touching the interior product with dirty hands, and why?&lt;br /&gt;2. Next unpleasant surprise: the brush and screw mechanism inside two of the three bottles was broken and nearly torn off.&lt;br /&gt;3. Worst of all: all three bottles were at least one-third empty. The High Beam was more than half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is obviously a returned product that was resold. Words cannot express how revolted I am, knowing I bought a used product that is intended to be applied to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item immediately after a long-distance move, so in the unpacking chaos, the box sat unopened past the return deadline. That&#x27;s my own fault, but nonetheless I thought it important to provide a review in order to warn other potential buyers of the issue.</li>
            <li> I love this make up it is nice and light and has a beautiful color and glow that it adds to my cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my mini products and I&#x27;m terribly disappointed. THIS IS FAKE. being a long term admirer of Benetint and HighBeam I can definitely say that the ones I received in the mail are FAKE! All three of them have weird smell, and I know how these products should smell. Moreover, HighBeam and PosiTint have inconsistent texture.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend buyin from this seller (BEAUTY COLLECTION) and I&#x27;m certainly filing a complain.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake it isn&#x27;t the real thing . I was very disappointed  I guess this is what I get for trying to get it cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased these three products before but have purchased many benefit products. Not sure what the consistency is supposed to be of the pose tint and the high beam but it was rather thick and goopy. Possibly old products? The rose one smelled normal but it wasn&#x27;t filled all the way- maybe 3/4 of the bottle. Odd. Some reviews are saying this is a fake but I have no way of knowing. Oh well. I just wanted to try them before buying the full sized items first. I just looked at a YouTube video and I don&#x27;t think mine is a fake. But if it is, it&#x27;s a good fake!</li>
            <li> Samples were too small, and looked bigger on the picture.  Pose tint was dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that it&#x27;s a nice purse size tint if you need a refresher, but i wouldn&#x27;t spend money on that size again.</li>
            <li> I use Benefit cosmetics myself, and buy and sell them as well, and there are most definitely fake. The Benetint is too light, I swear they put red Kool-Aid in it. It has no pigmentation or staying power. The High Beam is too light and doesn&#x27;t blend well, and the Posietint is a close fake, but too runny. These also all have a strange, powerfully chemical smell, which genuine Benefit products do not. The box is different from the real box these came in when they were released through Sephora, and the printing on the bottles is wrong. To top it off, mine came about 1/3 empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say these are dangerous is counterfeit and replica cosmetics are manufactured under no health guidelines. Fake cosmetics have been tested and found to contain bacteria, animal feces, human fecal matter, high amounts of heavy metals, and other dangerous things.</li>
            <li> I love anything by Benefit Cosmetics!! This product is a MUST HAVE for any GIRL 💗</li>
            <li> Great minis to buy before you commit. I love the high beam. It&#x27;s great for evening and a little dab for the daytime.</li>
            <li> These are not the same quality as the ones they used to sell at the department store. I had bought minis from Macys in the past and they were the same quality as the full-size products, but for some reason not this one. Seems like a different product altogether.</li>
            <li> great... love it! all of them .. good for daily use and gave you a great cherry shine on your nose and cheeks. worth to try</li>
            <li> impulse buy makes me look like a hooker, not a movie star, my dogs did not like it  go away</li>
            <li> i didnt purchse this item from amazon but i have tried the real benefit lip and cheek stains and love them. i just wanted to post a review to inform customers that the last two pictures that is shown are pictures of fake benefit products. if you look closely on the real ones, the tube rim is clear while on the picture the tube rim is white. in addition the real benetint circle logo leans towards the right while on the picture the circle logo is more centered.</li>
