            <li>It&#x27;s the best ever.</li>
            <li>never mind how great it works!</li>
            <li>Balm is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I did through Amazon which was great!</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>

            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Great results!</li>
            <li>Great merchant.</li>
            <li>Works well, smells great.</li>
            <li>And it does, indeed, smell amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply to hair and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straightish already.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>that I know love to touch it</li>
            <li>I blowdried my hair with a boars bristle brush and my hair came out shiny, straight and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightening balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to eliminate the shine spray, the frizz-ease, etc etc.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and makes it quite shiny!</li>
            <li>AND CURLEY THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS ME TO WEAR MY HAIR IN A SLEEK SRAIGHT STYLE AND STILL LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>My hair is also exponentially more responsive to flat-ironing if I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you with a mirror-shine, but your hair will look healthy.</li>
            <li>I ran out of this product and had to stop using it for a couple of months, friends noticed the improvement in my hair when I was able to use the product again...  </li>
            <li>She tried many products in between and felt they made her hair ditry.</li>
            <li>My hair is more bouncy and shinning.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but as the ingredients are identical to original formulation, I&#x27;m confident it will be as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even able to apply this to my hair, perfume/fragrance is so strong, way too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>This product prevents the hairs from curling up-leaving my hair looking smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light and clean feel.</li>
            <li>The seller is a good seller, but the balm is nothing from the other world and it doesn&#x27;t smell so good.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for my fine, shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find a straightening hair gel to replace no longer available</li>
            <li>I have full, but fine, frizzy curly hair and this leave-in does not do anything for it.</li>
            <li>I love this straight balm.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li>If you want a quick way to style hair, if you want to defeat frizz--then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Great product--definitely helps with keeping the frizz down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Framesi products for years and really love them, especially the Options Way Smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells and makes my hair feel extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair its probably best to just use a bit and only on the ends, otherwise it can look a bit limp if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>IT SMELLS TERRIFIC AND LEAVES MY HAIR HEALTHY, NOURISHED, STRAIGHT AND SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>have baby fine, naturally curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>but it feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It helps with frizz, it keeps your hair straight for days, and it smells, SOOOOOOOOOO!</li>
            <li>Plus my hair is still straight!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price.</li>
            <li>A pea-sized drop of this really is all I need for good movement, smoothness, manageability, and softness without being weighed down.</li>
            <li>It is a balm that has a wonderful, chic smell and specially for hair that is really, i mean really DRY and colored.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scared to use any other products now to be honest...</li>
            <li>like but previous formula was BETTER !</li>
            <li>I can also blow it dry after using the Framesi, and I end up with an even better style.  </li>
            <li>and even when I would use the straightner on it I would not stay straight with this product</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I also found that using this with Chi Silk Infusion and Chi Iron Guard works really well.</li>
            <li>Graham Webb Stick Straight.</li>
            <li>My son has very curly hair, this product does not take out the curl, but prevents that frizzy look.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this wio by framesi straight balm.</li>
            <li>so I tried their new Straight Balm instead.  </li>
            <li>With this product though my hair stays straight, soft and swingy all day and does not tangle up on itself!</li>
            <li>Keeps my naturally curly hair from getting too frizzy, even in the Texas heat and humidity!</li>
            <li>My hair alway felt silky smooth and straight with the old product and this one leaves my hair somewhat stiff...</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use this product I get a lovely tangley bit at the back half way through the day.</li>
            <li>my hair never felt soft</li>
            <li>not only does it stay straight</li>
            <li>Several years ago, my hairdresser used a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; of Framesi on my hair and it gave me exactly what I had been looking for--CONTROL for short, naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my hair wet,but I really like putting it on for a touch up on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Have been using it very morning before I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would bring the old product back, I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>

            <li> The only products w/ minimal fragrance seem to be Redken and Kenra.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product on my unruly wavy hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this product (about a dime size) after I get out of the shower before I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY DRY</li>
            <li> I use those 3 products (and only those 3) every single day (for at least the last 6 months) and my hair has been noticeably shinier and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have curly African American hair that is so hard to blowdry  </li>
            <li> This one actually works to tame curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> You can dry your hair put a small amount over your hair and use a curling iron or flat iron for an even smoother/silkier look.</li>
            <li> It does NOT cause my hair to lay completely flat or limp looking like other products....</li>
            <li> A small dime-sized dollop worked into my short (sometimes wiry) hair, was all that I needed to give softness, control, and sheen to my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive, but if you&#x27;re hesitant, the smell alone is worth it,</li>
            <li> This cut my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, frizzy-ish hair that can be hard to tame at times, especially in humidity.</li>
            <li> Once in a while if it happens to be pouring rain or 98% humidity in the summer, I&#x27;ll add a little Moroccan Oil and frizz solved.</li>
            <li> I hated touching it</li>
            <li> My hair is very difficult to straighten and I was purchasing my Framesi BY WIO Straight Balm from my hair dresser but when she moved out of state I needed to find it my self</li>
            <li> One of the few thinks that work well on my overly frizzy hair !</li>
            <li> I have a slight wave that can be difficult to tame, but when I use this before blow-drying, my hair lies straighter and holds style all day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product has been discontinued</li>
            <li> It was an expensive and disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this straight balm. My hair is very fine and straightish already. When I don&#x27;t use this product I get a lovely tangley bit at the back half way through the day. Or if I&#x27;m outside in the wind, same thing, a birds nest at the nape of my neck.  With this product though my hair stays straight, soft and swingy all day and does not tangle up on itself! Can actually run my fingers through it because it keeps that just brushed feeling all day.  If you have fine hair its probably best to just use a bit and only on the ends, otherwise it can look a bit limp if you use too much.  I highly, highly recommend this wio by framesi straight balm. And can&#x27;t wait for my shipment because I&#x27;m all out!!!!</li>
            <li> I was given this by a stylist that I know and I love it I have wire for hair kinky wire my hair never felt soft I hated touching it and even when I would use the straightner on it I would not stay straight with this product not only does it stay straight but it feels so soft and smooth that I know love to touch it I could not be happier with this product</li>
            <li> I bought this from a salon and it really works. I have curly African American hair that is so hard to blowdry  it takes almost 4 hours to finish. This cut my blow drying time in half. I blowdried my hair with a boars bristle brush and my hair came out shiny, straight and in great condition. The best I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightening balm. It&#x27;s the best ever. It helps with frizz, it keeps your hair straight for days, and it smells, SOOOOOOOOOO! good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine, naturally curly, frizzy hair. I tried everything. After using this product, I haven&#x27;t even thought about buying anything else. I&#x27;ve even been able to eliminate the shine spray, the frizz-ease, etc etc. Once in a while if it happens to be pouring rain or 98% humidity in the summer, I&#x27;ll add a little Moroccan Oil and frizz solved. Plus my hair is still straight! You can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive, but if you&#x27;re hesitant, the smell alone is worth it, never mind how great it works!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as promised.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair wet,but I really like putting it on for a touch up on dry hair.You can dry your hair put a small amount over your hair and use a curling iron or flat iron for an even smoother/silkier look. My son uses it on his unruley, wavey ,teenage bangs and loves it.Every morning I have to go to his bathroom and retrieve it! I would recommend this product to any one with wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product happens to work wonders on my hair. I have slightly wavy, frizzy-ish hair that can be hard to tame at times, especially in humidity. I use this product (about a dime size) after I get out of the shower before I blow dry it. It leaves my hair smooth and makes it quite shiny! I also found that using this with Chi Silk Infusion and Chi Iron Guard works really well.

I&#x27;m scared to use any other products now to be honest... this works well for me!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even able to apply this to my hair, perfume/fragrance is so strong, way too strong for me.  The only products w/ minimal fragrance seem to be Redken and Kenra.  I&#x27;m trying to find a straightening hair gel to replace no longer available Graham Webb Stick Straight.</li>
            <li> The seller is a good seller, but the balm is nothing from the other world and it doesn&#x27;t smell so good.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product, but, unfortunately, it did not work well for my hair. I have full, but fine, frizzy curly hair and this leave-in does not do anything for it. It was an expensive and disappointing purchase. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Balm is wonderful.  Keeps frizzes in check and makes hair manageable.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY DRY AND CURLEY THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS ME TO WEAR MY HAIR IN A SLEEK SRAIGHT STYLE AND STILL LOOK HEALTHY. IT SMELLS TERRIFIC AND LEAVES MY HAIR HEALTHY, NOURISHED, STRAIGHT AND SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Keeps my naturally curly hair from getting too frizzy, even in the Texas heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for my fine, shoulder-length hair. It basically makes my hair behave. I have a slight wave that can be difficult to tame, but when I use this before blow-drying, my hair lies straighter and holds style all day. My hair is also exponentially more responsive to flat-ironing if I&#x27;ve used it. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with a mirror-shine, but your hair will look healthy. A pea-sized drop of this really is all I need for good movement, smoothness, manageability, and softness without being weighed down. And it does, indeed, smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Framesi products for years and really love them, especially the Options Way Smooth.  Unfortunately this product has been discontinued so I tried their new Straight Balm instead.  I was so disappointed.  My hair alway felt silky smooth and straight with the old product and this one leaves my hair somewhat stiff...it definately straightens it, but not with the same silky feel.  Wish they would bring the old product back, I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, my hairdresser used a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; of Framesi on my hair and it gave me exactly what I had been looking for--CONTROL for short, naturally wavy hair.  A small dime-sized dollop worked into my short (sometimes wiry) hair, was all that I needed to give softness, control, and sheen to my hair.  I wash my hair, towel-dry it, work in the Framesi, and then arrange everything with my fingers.  Voila!  A finished look.  I can also blow it dry after using the Framesi, and I end up with an even better style.  If you want a quick way to style hair, if you want to defeat frizz--then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> like but previous formula was BETTER !</li>

            <li> item arrived promptly and sealed. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but as the ingredients are identical to original formulation, I&#x27;m confident it will be as good as the original. Immediate de livery. Great merchant.</li>
            <li> Have been using it very morning before I dry my hair.  Works well, smells great. Would buy this product again</li>
            <li> Always works perfecty to elimate my frizz.</li>
            <li> Great product--definitely helps with keeping the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I&#x27;ve tried them all.This one actually works to tame curly, frizzy hair. It has a very light and clean feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products to keep my hair from frizzing in humidity or rainy weather.  My sister who lives on the Oregon coast recommended it.  I was using &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; but this product beats it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my unruly wavy hair for a long time. It&#x27;s very easy to apply to hair and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product while I lived in Iceland. I have hair that is not quite curly but is sort of wavy and has a lot of body.  This product prevents the hairs from curling up-leaving my hair looking smooth and healthy.  It does NOT cause my hair to lay completely flat or limp looking like other products.... I ran out of this product and had to stop using it for a couple of months, friends noticed the improvement in my hair when I was able to use the product again...  My son has very curly hair, this product does not take out the curl, but prevents that frizzy look.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST hair products in the market. It is a balm that has a wonderful, chic smell and specially for hair that is really, i mean really DRY and colored. It feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. She had been looking for it for a year. She tried many products in between and felt they made her hair ditry. She loves this product</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells and makes my hair feel extremely soft.  I&#x27;ve bought it for years and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. This product was exactly what I was looking for at agreat price. It was described correctly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I will buy these products by framesi again.This product delivers what it says. My hair is more bouncy and shinning. Leaves no sticky feel.Great results!</li>
