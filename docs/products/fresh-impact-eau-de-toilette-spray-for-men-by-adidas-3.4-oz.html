            <li>/&gt;This is a great cologne if your into sports, if your going on a day or anything like that, then this is not built for you</li>
            <li>so I was happy about that.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent from this line.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this fragrance and I enjoy it on him!</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t purchase more then one of this style.</li>

            <li>When i run out i plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>my son fell in love with the scent</li>
            <li>I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s a knock off or not, since it&#x27;s Amazon and they would know better.</li>
            <li>It smells ok but after a while there not even a trace of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this Fresh Impact Eau De Toilette Spray for Men by Adidas for my son ,he really liked it</li>
            <li>This a nice adidas product not too strong and it good for  daily use or after a shower and just want to smell fresh.</li>
            <li>I got mine at TJ Maxx for cheap.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a cheap clone to use here</li>
            <li>its cheaper there.amazon again thank you fo everything you brings and keep your lower prices and free shippings.</li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance, good price, fast delivery...</li>
            <li>and he told me later all his friends like his cologne scent that smells very nice</li>
            <li>It has a cool and fresh smell but nothing more, so if you are looking for an affordable cologne that will get you compliments, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyhow it is better than the US made one since this ones are made in Spain, in my oppinion smels better, and do last better too.</li>
            <li>Worth the money that I spend!</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this for him as long as he will continue to wear it :) definitely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of an unusual sent</li>
            <li>Has a crispy, fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li>True full scent that lasts all</li>
            <li>For the price its not a bad buy....</li>
            <li>It smells great and stands up to other colognes twice the price (I.E. Lacoste).</li>
            <li>but now I say spend a little more on some good stuff.</li>
            <li>fresh and clean smell</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>you get off the shelves at any super market, or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I still recommend spending a bit more for a better smelling and longer lasting cologne, but at this price range, Adidas wins.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>cologne bottle looks pretty cool</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see Fresh Impact on their website.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for my husband frequently and I absolutely love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>After receiving the package with Yacht Man Blue, another cheap cologne I wanted to try out, this Adidas cologne is much, much better.</li>
            <li>This line of fragrances is modern, fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Adidas always does right by me.  </li>
            <li>Probably okay if playing sports or for teens and young adults, but for daily wear, it would be better to spend a little more for a decent cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: To be fair I have to increase the rating on this product.</li>
            <li>the plus side, when i play soccer i always spray some Fresh Impact and it doesnt wash off with your sweat that fast, so you can always smell fresh when playing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this cologne if you want to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Adidas accessories and would definitely recommend this particular spray for men.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>The title describes the smell pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you want something that stands out more, I suggest trying Deep energy though.</li>
            <li>You probably have to spray 10 or more times to get some lasting scent, but one shouldn&#x27;t have to bathe in this stuff which would most likely cause nausea.</li>
            <li>Smells good, I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s watered down or not, but it lasts 3-4 hours on clothes, 2-3 hours on skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last long through out day!</li>
            <li>I would say that it&#x27;s a recognizable name at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It did not last too long, makes a good impression fast but it will fade fast too.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, fine daily cologne.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely what I want.</li>
            <li>:: I also purchased the Adidas Deep Energy which has a better smell and lasts longer; in the end i use the Fresh Impact for sports and the Deep Energy for everything else.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it so much he doesn&#x27;t want me to give one away</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My son wanted this and really likes its scent and the length of time the scent lasts.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last during the day and at the same time not so strong to bother you.</li>
            <li>COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I bought this for my older son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Its mild pleasing scent that last long and not as strong as other cheap ones that fade fast.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>im in high school</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, but as others have stated, it does not last long compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a scent as some other ones(for</li>
            <li>very good fragrance for the price and long lasting other like fragrances!!!</li>
            <li>I had never smelled this particular brand of Adidas cologne but have been happy with the other scents in the past.  </li>
            <li>So i read some reviews and gave the Fresh Impact a try, at first the smell seemed forgettable but after a couple of days i started liking it more.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the low low price.  </li>
            <li>I like it its just a little light</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s scent is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from a cologne costing so low, but thought I&#x27;d give the Adidas brand a shot.</li>
            <li>Not so good, poor lasting effect.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a perfume that i can use when im not on a date or special occasions, you know kinda like a everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>is important when buying any item in Amazon.com to add up this small present of perfume.</li>
            <li>So I open the box..grab my cologne..and only half the bottle is full</li>
            <li>crisp and a little woody too</li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worthy.</li>
            <li>A small quick spray goes a long way and it can last for hours.</li>

            <li> I would say that it&#x27;s a recognizable name at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It did not last too long, makes a good impression fast but it will fade fast too.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, fine daily cologne.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely what I want.</li>
            <li> :: I also purchased the Adidas Deep Energy which has a better smell and lasts longer; in the end i use the Fresh Impact for sports and the Deep Energy for everything else.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it so much he doesn&#x27;t want me to give one away</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this and really likes its scent and the length of time the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to last during the day and at the same time not so strong to bother you.</li>
            <li> COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Its mild pleasing scent that last long and not as strong as other cheap ones that fade fast.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> im in high school</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but as others have stated, it does not last long compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a scent as some other ones(for</li>
            <li> very good fragrance for the price and long lasting other like fragrances!!!</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this particular brand of Adidas cologne but have been happy with the other scents in the past.  </li>
            <li> So i read some reviews and gave the Fresh Impact a try, at first the smell seemed forgettable but after a couple of days i started liking it more.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the low low price.  </li>
            <li> I like it its just a little light</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s scent is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from a cologne costing so low, but thought I&#x27;d give the Adidas brand a shot.</li>
            <li> Not so good, poor lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume that i can use when im not on a date or special occasions, you know kinda like a everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> is important when buying any item in Amazon.com to add up this small present of perfume.</li>
            <li> So I open the box..grab my cologne..and only half the bottle is full</li>
            <li> crisp and a little woody too</li>
            <li> But this doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worthy.</li>
            <li> A small quick spray goes a long way and it can last for hours.</li>
            <li> Especially, considering the super decent prize, you can do nothing wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; directly from Amazon, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure</li>
            <li> Weird right??</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast,very affordable price .</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this Eau De Toilette but says that the smell doesn&#x27;t last even for a few hours!!</li>
            <li> are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order these colognes for the price.</li>
            <li> Almost like as if you just got out of the shower, but a little muskier.</li>
            <li> This is just water with so little fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells bad it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy with the way the outside looked smashed and torn is what the box looked like from the outside,  </li>
            <li> product I would not recommend because the scent is too common and not very sniff catchy.  </li>
            <li> but YMB is basically water, maybe sea water, and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little weak.</li>
            <li> but it seems like a common sent</li>
            <li> This is my everyday go to cologne whenever I go out anywhere casually, or just to wear to work.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it was difficult to find in store.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re just ugly,  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this all I got</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> WILL NEVER USE IT CONTACT COTY AND TELL THEM THAT IT SMELLS AWFUL</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells awful like Axe body spray.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All da ladies love it. im in high school</li>
            <li> I was looking for more of an unusual sent but it seems like a common sent you get off the shelves at any super market, or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;This product I would not recommend because the scent is too common and not very sniff catchy.  Too Basic.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely what I want. If you are a layman in cologne, and do not want to spend too many time to pick up one yourself, this one will be a perfect one for you. Especially, considering the super decent prize, you can do nothing wrong!</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to tell you to buy it too...the price is very good, better than Walmart where I found it in 2.5 oz with $ 7.00 plus taxes.It did not last too long, makes a good impression fast but it will fade fast too. Anyhow it is better than the US made one since this ones are made in Spain, in my oppinion smels better, and do last better too. Weird right??</li>
            <li> Excellent experience! All according to the agreement. Impeccable compliance deadlines. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> He loved it. I love it. Smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> For the price it is one of the best colognes you can get.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume that i can use when im not on a date or special occasions, you know kinda like a everyday cologne. So i read some reviews and gave the Fresh Impact a try, at first the smell seemed forgettable but after a couple of days i started liking it more. It has a cool and fresh smell but nothing more, so if you are looking for an affordable cologne that will get you compliments, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, when i play soccer i always spray some Fresh Impact and it doesnt wash off with your sweat that fast, so you can always smell fresh when playing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:: I also purchased the Adidas Deep Energy which has a better smell and lasts longer; in the end i use the Fresh Impact for sports and the Deep Energy for everything else.</li>
            <li> i give this cologne a 4 out of 5,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: cologne bottle looks pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells like nautica voyage witch is actually 30 bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: Only lasts up to an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;projection isn&#x27;t the best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cologne if your into sports, if your going on a day or anything like that, then this is not built for you</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived on time so I was happy about that. For 9 bucks this cologne is a steal. It smells great and stands up to other colognes twice the price (I.E. Lacoste).</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order these colognes for the price. I was getting them as gifts so I ordered 5 all at once, they just came and they are great. My husband likes it so much he doesn&#x27;t want me to give one away so he can have it! lol Really great deal for the price, perfect for gifts because it is brand named :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent from this line.  It smells citrusy like grapefruit and tangerine and crisp and a little woody too I think like cedar maybe?  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I got mine at TJ Maxx for cheap.  This line of fragrances is modern, fresh and clean smelling.  I also like their deep energy one.  I don&#x27;t see Fresh Impact on their website.  I hope they keep making it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy with the way the outside looked smashed and torn is what the box looked like from the outside,  it&#x27;s terrible I opened,  it and things we&#x27;re just ugly,  I&#x27;m unpleased.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance and I enjoy it on him!</li>
            <li> Yes it was everything and more !</li>
            <li> Wanted a cheap clone to use here and there when I needed it, these were great when they were like $5, now at this price they don&#x27;t make no sense.</li>
            <li> So I open the box..grab my cologne..and only half the bottle is full</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE YOU CAN SAY &amp;#34;IT STINKS&amp;#34; WILL NEVER USE IT CONTACT COTY AND TELL THEM THAT IT SMELLS AWFUL</li>
            <li> Smells nice lasts all day, two sprays and all day of good smell! Shipping was fast no problems and price is very good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. It&#x27;s just a little weak. You have to use 3 sprays.</li>
            <li> Where I can&#x27;t speak to this product&#x27;s impact on the olfactory glands (since I purchased it as a gift),  I would say that it&#x27;s a recognizable name at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good, I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s watered down or not, but it lasts 3-4 hours on clothes, 2-3 hours on skin.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this Eau De Toilette but says that the smell doesn&#x27;t last even for a few hours!! Bummer:(</li>
            <li> This is my everyday go to cologne whenever I go out anywhere casually, or just to wear to work. It smells great and the scent is cool, and refreshing, memorable. A small quick spray goes a long way and it can last for hours.</li>
            <li> As the title suggests, I bought this spray for daily use. It is strong enough to last during the day and at the same time not so strong to bother you. I have always liked Adidas accessories and would definitely recommend this particular spray for men.</li>
            <li> It smells bad it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh it just smell like peppermint with ass! I was really disappointed with this all I got was 5 dollars back!</li>
            <li> Not so good, poor lasting effect.</li>
            <li> ...a gift to my grandson.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Bought it for my hubby and he loved it! The price is just great too. Would definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Always a good choice for the price you are paying and the quality you are receiving. For a daily use, basic!</li>
            <li> Has a great smell, and i get a lot of compliments on it. The smell however last for hours and you may need to reapply later. The smell is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> Lol I love it it&#x27;s so fresh lol</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband frequently and I absolutely love the way it smells on him. As you can see in the photo it is time to order more! It&#x27;s not too strong and it is very refreshing! I will continue to purchase this for him as long as he will continue to wear it :) definitely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys this cologne.  I really enjoy the low low price.  This is the cheapest I have found these colognes, anywhere.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised. Fast Delivery! Thanks.</li>
            <li> is important when buying any item in Amazon.com to add up this small present of perfume. For all it days he goes perfect, he does not have a very persistent aroma. fresh and clean smell</li>
            <li> Has a crispy, fresh, light scent. Smells pretty good, but as others have stated, it does not last long compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li> It is Ok. But it&#x27;s scent is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> very good fragrance for the price and long lasting other like fragrances!!!</li>
            <li> Its mild pleasing scent that last long and not as strong as other cheap ones that fade fast.&lt;br /&gt;For its price, I would just buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this Fresh Impact Eau De Toilette Spray for Men by Adidas for my son ,he really liked it he wore it when he was going to college and he told me later all his friends like his cologne scent that smells very nice he then told them its by Adidas get it at amazon its cheaper there.amazon again thank you fo everything you brings and keep your lower prices and free shippings.</li>
            <li> After using this for awhile, I&#x27;ve decided that I don&#x27;t like it. Scent gave me a headache. I originally gave it a good review but now I say spend a little more on some good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am most happy with this item and amazon ordering was awesome.the toilette spray was and is better then my cologns i have used for years.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. I tend to think all the Adidas cologne of this style smell really similar. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but its nothing special. For the price its not a bad buy....just don&#x27;t purchase more then one of this style.</li>
            <li> They shipped it super quick and arrived in 2 days and it smells great! 5 stars! I would recomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> sobre este articulo no tengo critica alguna estoy totalmente conforme y satisfecho, hasta me gustaria comprar otro, cuando aparesca otra oferta.......</li>
            <li> La compr&amp;eacute; para mi hijo adolescente de 15 a&amp;ntilde;os. le gusta mucho y la usa diariamente despu&amp;eacute;s del ba&amp;ntilde;o para ir al colegio</li>
            <li> if you mixed fruit and sport together, this is what you get.  Adidas always does right by me.  I love this scent.</li>
            <li> adidas is the best scent on the market in my opinion!buy it for yourself or your love one&#x27;s.i recommend.buy it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great gift, thanks.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this and really likes its scent and the length of time the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Fresh Impact is an awesome cheap cologne. It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a scent as some other ones(for example, Adidas Deep energy or Adidas Moves is stronger). But this doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worthy. If you are trying to smell nice, without being over powering this is a great cheap choice. The title describes the smell pretty well. It smells clean and fresh. Almost like as if you just got out of the shower, but a little muskier. If you want something that stands out more, I suggest trying Deep energy though.</li>
            <li> This a nice adidas product not too strong and it good for  daily use or after a shower and just want to smell fresh.</li>
            <li> el producto aun no me ha llegado y hace mas de un mes que lo compre, la empresa de envio dice que el articulo esta da&amp;ntilde;ado y nadie me responde por el envio?</li>
            <li> I like it its just a little light</li>
            <li> ADOLPH DASLER....addy.... adidas...always good</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because i no longer could find it in stores. I liked the scent and wanted to keep using it. When i run out i plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Very good cologne! True full scent that lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;I Like my purchase! I advise everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS SO GOOD!!! It&#x27;s so clean and fresh and just GREAT! I have always been a fan of the ADIDAS cologne line, but this one is exceptional. I bought it for my boyfriend and I end up spraying it on myself too because it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, fine daily cologne. COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
            <li> my son fell in love with the scent but it was difficult to find in store. the price was great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older son for Christmas.  I had never smelled this particular brand of Adidas cologne but have been happy with the other scents in the past.  It was great and my son loved it!  It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best smelling scents I have ever smelled. When I go to work, a lot of people complement me on it. I completely recommend this cologne if you want to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> the material of the lotion is excellent, 100% finished, it is best to be at a good price, I recommend these lotion are great and do not weigh anything, are super comfortable.</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast,very affordable price . This was a gift for my son, he loves it, thank you!</li>
            <li> Had bought a bottle at $13 and thought it was a steal. Now I bought another bottle for $7! They&#x27;re giving it away! Smells good.</li>
            <li> My sons loved the smell! and for the price, I loved it too!</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance, good price, fast delivery...&lt;br /&gt;Five stars</li>
            <li> Smells great and last long through out day!</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; directly from Amazon, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it&#x27;s a knock off or not, since it&#x27;s Amazon and they would know better. Then again the liquid isn&#x27;t as blue as shown in the picture which would be one indication of being diluted I suppose. I didn&#x27;t expect much from a cologne costing so low, but thought I&#x27;d give the Adidas brand a shot. This is just water with so little fragrance. You probably have to spray 10 or more times to get some lasting scent, but one shouldn&#x27;t have to bathe in this stuff which would most likely cause nausea. The fragrance smells awful like Axe body spray. Probably okay if playing sports or for teens and young adults, but for daily wear, it would be better to spend a little more for a decent cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: To be fair I have to increase the rating on this product. After receiving the package with Yacht Man Blue, another cheap cologne I wanted to try out, this Adidas cologne is much, much better. Still not a fan of the scent but YMB is basically water, maybe sea water, and a waste of money. I still recommend spending a bit more for a better smelling and longer lasting cologne, but at this price range, Adidas wins.</li>
            <li> Worth the money that I spend! Recommended for daily use if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot! I use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Excelent. A good product</li>
            <li> It smells ok but after a while there not even a trace of it. I really don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
