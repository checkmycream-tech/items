            <li>This was quite amazing.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and none of them could be that effective.</li>
            <li>to pass by in USA, thus we bought as many as we could, to stacked up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a good conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that has not made my scalp break out and has mostly stopped the itch.</li>
            <li>Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff starts working from the first time and the results are astonishing.</li>
            <li>From the first wash , my hair was completely free of dandruff !</li>
            <li>My others sisters used itand loved it too,so if I could give this product ten starts</li>
            <li>And the best part is that I can use a different shampoo occasionally, and it won&#x27;t have an adverse effect.</li>
            <li>I agree with all other reviewers that this is indeed a very effective shampoo at combating dandruff and itchiness of the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but I believe that over time it will be even more effective.</li>
            <li>I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this shampoo - maybe that will get fixed as well :)</li>
            <li>I bought it and believe it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>The price of this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>didnt expect much, because I had the same problem for years and kind of accepted that I will always have to wash my hair every day, or else it would be itchy and full of dandruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of using it, he is fairly happy because the flakes are almost gone and the itchiness is much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves the results though, so we will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because one of my sisters did first, so shehigly recommended it ,even thoug</li>
            <li>recently I found a much better alternative--tea tree shampoo and conditioner by Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And it is natural product, free of parabens.</li>
            <li>This shampoo like it says worked for me after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>It worked like a charm after the first us.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty good at eliminating the oiliness too, although I still get some of that by late evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>he first time I used it ifelt the difference my scalp was clean and free of embarrasing dead skin flakes.</li>
            <li>I am using this product according to its directions and it is working very well every time.</li>
            <li>It made my hair super dry, ripped off my hair color, and strangely enough, my scalp is more itchy now than it was</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>so I eventually resorted to using Scalpicin when necessary and avoided touching my scalp as much as possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend this shampoo for combating dandruff, itchy scalp and oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving that product a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>At the end of one month everything goes normal and also it is improving the appearance of my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li>It completely eliminates dandruff!</li>
            <li>After my first wash, I noticed less dandruff right away.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling clean and definitely helped with my dandruff/itchy scalp</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks dandruff is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I will,delivery was fast and as expected,seller sent me coupons that I can use for my next order</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are made of mostly natural oils and contains no sulfur, the foaming agent, which is what I believe the culprit for causing all that itchiness.</li>
            <li>I try to expose and put shampoo on as much of my scalp as possible.</li>
            <li>(again, not rubbing any of it near the scalp).</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive scalp and skin issues it may help.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week, the dandruff completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>and my itching has been completely stopped as well.</li>
            <li>Has a medical smell, but not super strong.</li>
            <li>so I was worried about tangles since there wasn&#x27;t a matching conditioner, but this shampoo left my hair feeling very soft and silky, and for that alone</li>
            <li>It cleans and shines my hair like no other did, and took itches out of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Your scalp will be medicated and your hair will still be soft, and you&#x27;re using theexpensive shampoo ONLY where you need it (saving money).</li>
            <li>This shampoo dramatically decreased the flakes from the first wash, and my scalp rarely itches.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that stated that the dandruff seems to disappear after only a few washes, but it&#x27;s actually true for me.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with a weird, itchy kind of dandruff forever and have tried dozens of different over the counter shampoos.</li>

            <li> I have been dealing with a weird, itchy kind of dandruff forever and have tried dozens of different over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li> The Aveda scalp spray did show some promising results, but the tiny bottle is $26 and it hardly lasted for me since I have issues over my entire scalp.</li>
            <li> just wish it didnt dry and tangle up my hair</li>
            <li> It can dry out your hair, so here is what I do:</li>
            <li> During the winter season, my scalp gets dry</li>
            <li> The only complaint he has is after use his hair is left  feeling a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> not much flakes.</li>
            <li> am going to try to use this every other day now to see if it still can keep its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Not sure if it even helped my scalp either because I only could use twice it was just ruining my hair</li>
            <li> Wife demanded it, due to her problem.</li>
            <li> According to the directions you should not use any other shampoo while you are using this product.</li>
            <li> No more scratching constantly in public, worrying about dandruff flakes all over my shoulders, the dandruff is gone.  </li>
            <li> This was extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I am african american, and have a relaxer in my hair that I am trying to grow out, and the thicker my roots have become the worse the dandruff was.</li>
            <li> The thought of spending that much money on shampoo for the rest of my life frustrated me, so I went back to Amazon to try something</li>
            <li> it makes my hair really dry and tangle wish sucks</li>
            <li> it wsa a little pricey</li>
            <li> Now my scalp does not itch every few days like it used to.  </li>
            <li> I still get the itching scalp everyday in the afternoon when I shower in the morning with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I got itchy scalp a few months ago --but</li>
            <li> I like to lather my hair and leave the product in my hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Dandruff disappears after few washes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if I recommend this for dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders, neutrogena dandruff shampoo and other other foul-smelling expensive dandruff shampoo products before, and none of them have gotten rid of my dandruff as well as this product has.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, after a week&#x27;s usage, I hardly feel the itchiness anymore, and no dandruff at all.</li>
            <li> Now I hardly see any flakes at all, and I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for months.</li>
            <li> My scalp often get itchy by late afternoon</li>
            <li> my hair makes it impossible to comb thru it &amp; smells gross.</li>
            <li> When I have serious dandruff problems, I am using this product.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out really bad</li>
            <li> there but no white annoying flakes at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re disappointed with other products or you don&#x27;t like the smell (like T/gel), you should give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, either.</li>
            <li> Dries the crap outta</li>
            <li> Either it works for you or you hate it.&lt;br /&gt;So not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product on time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does smell and it works the same us head and shoulders blue bottle version. I still have it under my sinc</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product, for me, has lived up to it&#x27;s claims. I have been dealing with a weird, itchy kind of dandruff forever and have tried dozens of different over the counter shampoos. This is the first one that has not made my scalp break out and has mostly stopped the itch. I have only used it once so far, but I believe that over time it will be even more effective. I have long, fine hair so I was worried about tangles since there wasn&#x27;t a matching conditioner, but this shampoo left my hair feeling very soft and silky, and for that alone I think it was worth it. Hopefully I will continue to have great results, but so far, I&#x27;m off to a great start and couldn&#x27;t be happier! You&#x27;ll be hearing from me if my experience somehow changes!</li>
            <li> I cannot say this is the best shampoo ever, but I can say it is the best shampoo I have used.  It cleans and shines my hair like no other did, and took itches out of my scalp.  Now my scalp does not itch every few days like it used to.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It actually works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I didnt expect much, because I had the same problem for years and kind of accepted that I will always have to wash my hair every day, or else it would be itchy and full of dandruff. I dont have any dandruff anymore, but my hair does get oily the second day. I will continue using this shampoo - maybe that will get fixed as well :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He said he could see results after using the shampoo for a couple of days. After 4 weeks dandruff is completely gone. The only complaint he has is after use his hair is left  feeling a bit oily.  He loves the results though, so we will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products for several years and nothing worked. Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff starts working from the first time and the results are astonishing. It completely eliminates dandruff!</li>
            <li> My sisters,mom and I habe battled with dandruff for years and spent tons of money and so many different products thAt sometimes just didn&#x27;t work or worse exhacerbated our problem. I tried this product because one of my sisters did first, so shehigly recommended it ,even thoug it wsa a little pricey I bought it and believe it&#x27;s worth every penny .since he first time I used it ifelt the difference my scalp was clean and free of embarrasing dead skin flakes. My others sisters used itand loved it too,so if I could give this product ten starts I will,delivery was fast and as expected,seller sent me coupons that I can use for my next order</li>
            <li> I had some issue with scalp  and was recommended this shampoo it worked, and redness itchiness i had was gone.I am still using it on regular basis.It does wash color out if you color your hair but same is with every dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the only Anti-dandruff shampoo that has worked for me .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing ! From the first wash , my hair was completely free of dandruff !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for 2 weeks now before I write this review just so I have big enough a sample space to comment on the effectiveness of this shampoo. I agree with all other reviewers that this is indeed a very effective shampoo at combating dandruff and itchiness of the scalp. I have tried Selsun Blue and Head &amp; Shoulder. Neither is very effective, esp. when to comes to itchy scalp. My scalp often get itchy by late afternoon (enough I shampoo every morning), and dandruff gets everywhere when I start scratching it. With this shampoo, after a week&#x27;s usage, I hardly feel the itchiness anymore, and no dandruff at all. It&#x27;s also pretty good at eliminating the oiliness too, although I still get some of that by late evening.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this shampoo for combating dandruff, itchy scalp and oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to use this every other day now to see if it still can keep its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to point out is that the price for this product varies a great deal over a period of time. So keep an eye on the price history of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/11/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my rating from 5-star to 3-star after 2 bottles of usage of this shampoo. It seems after using it for a while the effect of controlling itchiness is either reduced or gone. I still get the itching scalp everyday in the afternoon when I shower in the morning with the shampoo. Plus the price of this shampoo is getting ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;So recently I found a much better alternative--tea tree shampoo and conditioner by Trader Joe&#x27;s. The shampoo and conditioner are made of mostly natural oils and contains no sulfur, the foaming agent, which is what I believe the culprit for causing all that itchiness. I highly recommend giving that product a try. Oh, BTW. buy them from local store (around 4 bucks a bottle) if you have a local Trader Joe&#x27;s nearby, as people are selling here on Amazon with a big mark-up.</li>
            <li> No no no. Dries the crap outta my hair makes it impossible to comb thru it &amp; smells gross. Not sure if it even helped my scalp either because I only could use twice it was just ruining my hair</li>
            <li> Wife demanded it, due to her problem. seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to pass by in USA, thus we bought as many as we could, to stacked up.&lt;br /&gt;As per statement it&#x27;s a hit or miss. Either it works for you or you hate it.&lt;br /&gt;So not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product on time.</li>
            <li> Great product..all recommendations!!!!!</li>
            <li> Has a medical smell, but not super strong. Left my hair feeling clean and definitely helped with my dandruff/itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo with wonderful smell of a peach. This shampoo removes dandruff and oil, gives radiance to my hair. I use it every 2-3 days. And it is natural product, free of parabens.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair really dry and tangle wish sucks but after i good conditioning i can say i am flake free. i still get itch here and there but no white annoying flakes at all. i use it every 3 days and wash twice for good results. just wish it didnt dry and tangle up my hair it rips my hair out when i try to comb it</li>
            <li> When I have serious dandruff problems, I am using this product. My problem is related with the stress level of my life, so, its repeating itself when I am stressful. I am using this product according to its directions and it is working very well every time. So, I am using this product when I have dandruff problem for one month. According to the directions you should not use any other shampoo while you are using this product. At the end of one month everything goes normal and also it is improving the appearance of my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent shipmemt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have been using this shampoo for 4 weeks now. I&#x27;ve had Seborrheic  Dermatitis since I was a teenager and now I&#x27;m in mid 30s. I&#x27;ve used almost everything out there, and if you have SD you already know that you need to switch between medicated shampoos to find what works for you. I should say this shampoo works fine(gets rid of the flakes in a week or two). If you&#x27;re disappointed with other products or you don&#x27;t like the smell (like T/gel), you should give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> I have had chunky white dandruff and an itchy, oily scalp for years now and I had no idea what to do about it. I tried every over-the-counter medicated shampoo on the market. The Aveda scalp spray did show some promising results, but the tiny bottle is $26 and it hardly lasted for me since I have issues over my entire scalp. I couldn&#x27;t afford that so I eventually resorted to using Scalpicin when necessary and avoided touching my scalp as much as possible. After doing some research on products sold on Amazon, I tried a medicated shampoo from La Roche Posay (I think that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s spelled). It worked the best of all I had used but I started to see that if I didn&#x27;t use that specific shampoo every time I washed, the flakes would come back immediately. The thought of spending that much money on shampoo for the rest of my life frustrated me, so I went back to Amazon to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this shampoo and I&#x27;m so happy I did. This shampoo dramatically decreased the flakes from the first wash, and my scalp rarely itches. Now I hardly see any flakes at all, and I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for months. And the best part is that I can use a different shampoo occasionally, and it won&#x27;t have an adverse effect. It can dry out your hair, so here is what I do: I wet my hair, then comb it into sections, revealing the scalp, and rub in dabs of the shampoo directly on the scalp as I go. I try to expose and put shampoo on as much of my scalp as possible. Then WITHOUT RINSING, I continue with my shower and wash my body, shave, etc. as I let the medication soak into the scalp. After about 10 minutes (min.), I grab whatever regular shampoo I have on hand and shampoo my actual HAIR (not messing with the medicated shampoo already on the scalp). Then I rinse it all at once. Afterward I condition JUST my hair (again, not rubbing any of it near the scalp). Then rinse and you&#x27;re done. Your scalp will be medicated and your hair will still be soft, and you&#x27;re using theexpensive shampoo ONLY where you need it (saving money). I hope this review helps anybody who is in the same predicament I used to be in. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on a whim since I have tried everything from prescription shampoos, apple cider vinegar, to monistat on my scalp to get relief from cakey, chunky gross dandruff! This shampoo like it says worked for me after the first wash.  I am african american, and have a relaxer in my hair that I am trying to grow out, and the thicker my roots have become the worse the dandruff was. But since using this shampoo, the burning, itching chunky gross dandruff is completley gone!  No more scratching constantly in public, worrying about dandruff flakes all over my shoulders, the dandruff is gone.  I highly recommend this product.  It does dry my hair out really bad so make sure you have a good conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I bought this about 3 weeks ago, and I have used it maybe 4 times, and I still do not have one flake.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and myself. He has been suffering from itchy scalp and flakes all his adulthood and I got itchy scalp a few months ago --but not much flakes. We both have very short hairs, mine is pixie short now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using it, he is fairly happy because the flakes are almost gone and the itchiness is much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it didn&#x27;t do the job for me at all. It made my hair super dry, ripped off my hair color, and strangely enough, my scalp is more itchy now than it was and I see lots of flakes falling off that they weren&#x27;t there before. I switched to my regular shampoo, but my husband will use this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I recommend this for dyed hair.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive scalp and skin issues it may help. I&#x27;ve tried many others and none of them could be that effective. Even clinical shampoos with coal tar.</li>
            <li> During the winter season, my scalp gets dry and I get a lot of dandruff as a result. I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that stated that the dandruff seems to disappear after only a few washes, but it&#x27;s actually true for me. After my first wash, I noticed less dandruff right away. After using it for a week, the dandruff completely disappeared. I like to lather my hair and leave the product in my hair for a few minutes. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, either. The price of this product is completely worth it. I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders, neutrogena dandruff shampoo and other other foul-smelling expensive dandruff shampoo products before, and none of them have gotten rid of my dandruff as well as this product has. I plan to keep using this product during the winter time.</li>
            <li> Works very good. Dandruff disappears after few washes.</li>
            <li> This was quite amazing. I have tried several so called anti-dandruff shampoos before and nothing worked. They would all eliminate the flakes for couple of days and then they are back. They do no eliminate the root cause. This was extremely helpful. It worked like a charm after the first us. I do not have flakes anymore and my itching has been completely stopped as well. I do not remember when was the last time I had this peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use 2-3 times a week initially, after that you can reduce the usage to 1-2 times a week. Great product, highly recommend.</li>
