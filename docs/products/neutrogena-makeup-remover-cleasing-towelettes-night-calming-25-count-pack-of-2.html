            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love these makeup remover wipes!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I use this product every night and love the way it removes every trace of makeup, including eye makeup!</li>
            <li>These work great and smell FRESH!</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena are the easiest, fastest, and most effective.  </li>
            <li>They are handy:)</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t tried too many, but this is by far the best makeup remover towelette I have tried!</li>
            <li>It is nice and smooth, taking eye and face makeup off very easily.</li>
            <li>The calming sent is a nice added bonus and not too strong.</li>
            <li>I love these, use them every day to remove makeup before I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different makeup wipes and must say these are the best.  </li>
            <li>SO CONVENIENT, AND SAFE, THANKS&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li>I prefer to take my makeup off before I wash my face, and these get most of it.</li>
            <li>I chose the Neutrogena towelettes because they&#x27;re alcohol and paraben-free and safe for eye makeup removal.  </li>
            <li>Wish there was a more reliable way to re-seal the package, but the towelettes stayed moist despite sealing issues.  </li>
            <li>I love this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I am not so sure about the \\&quot;night-calming\\&quot; part, but whatever they say.</li>
            <li>Eh - it worked, but I didn&#x27;t love it like</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s an even better deal.  </li>
            <li>They are the best at taking off waterproof mascara, and after doing that, I still have enough room on the towel to wash the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li>I also love the size of these.  </li>
            <li>and I love them for traveling.  </li>
            <li>These towelettes work at taking my make up off (mascara removal requires more work than eye makeup remover on a cotton call) but leave a residue on my skin that makes me feel as though I need to wash my face immediately after using them.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job though is not as effective on eye make up as straight make up remover.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, but don&#x27;t buy it if your skin is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cake on a whole bunch of make up, so using both sides wisely helps take off almost everything before I wash my face with [[ASIN:B00021C1LI Philosophy Purity</li>
            <li>They smell nice, they clean off even waterproof eye makeup, and they leave my skin feeling clean and not dried-out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I travel quite a lot and being able to pack this so easy in my suitcase without much weight and no spillage, I love!      </li>
            <li>Its a great way to finish off the day, and my face feels soft and smooth after using them.</li>
            <li>They work fine but smell really strongly like cheap men&#x27;s after shave, and the smell sticks.</li>
            <li>These wipes are absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I dont mind the smell - it&#x27;s kind of relaxing, but they dont seem to remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using them to wipe off all my makeup before bed.  </li>
            <li>They leave my face smooth and refreshed and I do not feel the need to use a cleanser after using these.</li>
            <li>This product was great for removing waterproof mascara, but it made me break out after using it on my entire face.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure they make those, just haven&#x27;t found one yet.  </li>
            <li>They leave my face clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m clean and set for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the way they smell and make your face feel much cleaner after using them.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, very much a &amp;#34;night calming&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>Hopefully now my laziness won&#x27;t cause me to have crappy skin when I&#x27;m older. :)</li>
            <li>This is pretty amazing considering the large amount of make up I wear on my face and the large amount of mascara I wear on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the original, and the moisturizing kind, and both are OK, but they do make my face burn a little.</li>
            <li>easily and gently and leave the face moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Best cleanser following a long day.  </li>
            <li>Handy product to remove makeup at night without leaving you with no excuse to cleanse your face.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, large enough to clean the whole face.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a huge fan of the wipes in the blue package but got suckered in by the night calming thing</li>
            <li>These are great - heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>The towelettes are very large and I can remove all of my eye</li>
            <li>Great for my face though when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li>The top sticks pretty well, but I always place them on the counter upside down so the top doesn&#x27;t come up by mistake.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could use a better solution is the seal and re-seal portion of the package.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;re probably not removing all of your coverup, which only causes more acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands, but these are my favorite make up wipes.</li>
            <li>I tried them after hearing these specific &#x27;Night Calming&#x27; wipes were a favorite of Kim Kardashian.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands where it is necessary to supplement with additional liquid, lotion, etc just to effectively remove makeup, and even then the towelettes are too flimsy to withstand it.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and not only does this keep my skin hydrated, it does a great job on my stubborn eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>First off, these DO get off your makeup, but they burn the absolute heck out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and Rosacea, and these actually cool my face off instead of burning it like most other wipes.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes in the light blue container.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing</li>
            <li>removes makeup really well.  </li>
            <li>I use these all the time and really like them.</li>
            <li>I really like neutrogena&#x27;s products, but this one really leaves me dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>They irritated my skin and are much thinner than ponds.</li>
            <li>Since it is gentle on my skin that is an added plus bc</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>These really remove all traces of my makeup including waterproof eye liner and mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I actually feel like my face is clean without splashing water all over my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face is clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>They are also very soothing, so if I was ever unable to wash my face, these would be a great alternative.</li>
            <li>They remove all makeup quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave my eyes red and burning.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like these wipes a lot for when I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do my normal cleansing.  </li>
            <li>so I used the wipes to remove it before washing and mosturizing like normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going out at lunch today to buy the normal ones because never again will I use the scented.</li>
            <li>They are bigger than most other similar products so they are easier to clean with</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for cleansing on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I find that there&#x27;s a lot less tugging on the delicate eye area if I loosen mascara first with a cream-to-oil makeup remover and then use a towelette.    </li>
            <li>These are more expensive than other kinds, but in my opinion, they seem larger, softer, and hold more cleanser, so I don&#x27;t have to use more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel soft, non-greasy, and totally touch worthy.</li>
            <li>However, these are facial towelettes and I wouldn&#x27;t really expect any other towelette to perform much better.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I can use a new part of the cloth for each part of my face.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t wash my face and I feel lazy, I&#x27;m still fine with just wiping everything off!    </li>
            <li>They take off all my make-up instantly, and my skin is left feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>They are big enough that you can wash your entire face with them and still have a section available to take off your eye makeup (waterproof liner and mascara!)  </li>
            <li>many of the other facial cleaners have.  </li>
            <li>Their aroma is not unpleasant and thankfully, is not strong (had some makeup remover towelettes I had to give away due to the strong perfumed odour), but the residue issue would prevent me from repurchasing.  </li>
            <li>I ususally cleanse my face when I shower but on nights I&#x27;m out late and have been overserved :-)</li>
            <li>I like how soft these leave my face, without that sticky or greasy feeling</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have unusually sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In this product&#x27;s defense, I do have sensitive skin; I break out if I spray perfume directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a decently priced facial cleansing cloth, I would recommend these</li>
            <li>I usually take off my makeup right before crawling into bed for the night, and the lavender scent is very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I usually rip a sheet in half to make it last longer, although this is probably the best deal you will find on these, which usually go for seven or eight dollars in the store.</li>
            <li>hours later I can still smell it loud and clear.</li>
            <li>I have extra sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.</li>
            <li>I gave one to my daughter one night because I wanted her to try a new eyeliner, and she came back later and said, \\&quot;can I have some of those for Christmas?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I wear pretty heavy eye makeup, so I generally still have to use eye makeup remover to get all of that off, but these get everything else!</li>
            <li>They are worth the extra few cents!</li>
            <li>I usually use an additional moisturizer at night, but when I am too tired or get home late, it is great to know my skin will not suffer if I just use these towelettes and go straight to bed.  </li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and Rosacea, and these actually cool my face off instead of burning it like most other wipes.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes in the light blue container.</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing</li>
            <li> removes makeup really well.  </li>
            <li> I use these all the time and really like them.</li>
            <li> I really like neutrogena&#x27;s products, but this one really leaves me dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> They irritated my skin and are much thinner than ponds.</li>
            <li> Since it is gentle on my skin that is an added plus bc</li>
            <li> I really</li>
            <li> These really remove all traces of my makeup including waterproof eye liner and mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I actually feel like my face is clean without splashing water all over my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> They are also very soothing, so if I was ever unable to wash my face, these would be a great alternative.</li>
            <li> They remove all makeup quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave my eyes red and burning.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like these wipes a lot for when I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do my normal cleansing.  </li>
            <li> so I used the wipes to remove it before washing and mosturizing like normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going out at lunch today to buy the normal ones because never again will I use the scented.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than most other similar products so they are easier to clean with</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for cleansing on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I find that there&#x27;s a lot less tugging on the delicate eye area if I loosen mascara first with a cream-to-oil makeup remover and then use a towelette.    </li>
            <li> These are more expensive than other kinds, but in my opinion, they seem larger, softer, and hold more cleanser, so I don&#x27;t have to use more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel soft, non-greasy, and totally touch worthy.</li>
            <li> However, these are facial towelettes and I wouldn&#x27;t really expect any other towelette to perform much better.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I can use a new part of the cloth for each part of my face.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my face and I feel lazy, I&#x27;m still fine with just wiping everything off!    </li>
            <li> They take off all my make-up instantly, and my skin is left feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> They are big enough that you can wash your entire face with them and still have a section available to take off your eye makeup (waterproof liner and mascara!)  </li>
            <li> many of the other facial cleaners have.  </li>
            <li> Their aroma is not unpleasant and thankfully, is not strong (had some makeup remover towelettes I had to give away due to the strong perfumed odour), but the residue issue would prevent me from repurchasing.  </li>
            <li> I ususally cleanse my face when I shower but on nights I&#x27;m out late and have been overserved :-)</li>
            <li> I like how soft these leave my face, without that sticky or greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have unusually sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In this product&#x27;s defense, I do have sensitive skin; I break out if I spray perfume directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a decently priced facial cleansing cloth, I would recommend these</li>
            <li> I usually take off my makeup right before crawling into bed for the night, and the lavender scent is very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I usually rip a sheet in half to make it last longer, although this is probably the best deal you will find on these, which usually go for seven or eight dollars in the store.</li>
            <li> hours later I can still smell it loud and clear.</li>
            <li> I have extra sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my daughter one night because I wanted her to try a new eyeliner, and she came back later and said, \\&quot;can I have some of those for Christmas?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I wear pretty heavy eye makeup, so I generally still have to use eye makeup remover to get all of that off, but these get everything else!</li>
            <li> They are worth the extra few cents!</li>
            <li> I usually use an additional moisturizer at night, but when I am too tired or get home late, it is great to know my skin will not suffer if I just use these towelettes and go straight to bed.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I have found is if you run vigorously and/or for a long period of time, these do start to burn your face - another reason I prefer eye makeup remover to these for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> (Plus, the lavender smell is subtle, and very relaxing!)</li>
            <li> This product also gives a moisturizer and face doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed that these facial towelettes do not remove more dirt from my face.</li>
            <li> These are very dry and overpriced.</li>
            <li> Watch out that you seal them tightly after every use, and they&#x27;ll last you awhile.</li>
            <li> There are times when it doesn&#x27;t stay closed as it should.</li>
            <li> And they have slowly gotten more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; face wipes out there, and they all left my face feeling raw and \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on water-proof mascara, and other make-up removal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what that other person is complaining about</li>
            <li> They remove makeup that other products miss.</li>
            <li> My eyelids feel especially dry after using these</li>
            <li> I have occasionally used these on my eyes, and while they get the job done, I feel like it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to either rub what I took off my eyes all over my face or the other way around.  </li>
            <li> ...perfection in a little wipe</li>
            <li> I will admit they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Almay makeup remover pads (the ones in the small round container) for years.  </li>
            <li> A must for me, as I travel and am quite lazy about washing my face.</li>
            <li> I basically just use these when I am too lazy to wash my face</li>
            <li> Bought these on Amazon, as they are hard to find in all drugstores.</li>
            <li> They take off all makeup..even that hard to remove mascara.</li>
            <li> (there are usually at least a couple days</li>
            <li> For a long time, I had a bad habit of not washing my face at night because I was either too tired or didn&#x27;t see why I ought to.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> My face feels dirty after using them.</li>
            <li> Anyway, they take off my mac eye products without burning the crap out of my eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product works extremely well on water-proof mascara, and other make-up removal.  The scent is very pleasing and I actually feel like my face is clean without splashing water all over my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I love these, use them every day to remove makeup before I wash my face.  I find that the resealing isn&#x27;t the greatest.  I need to get a plastic container and put refills in it.  I am pretty sure they make those, just haven&#x27;t found one yet.  removes makeup really well.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These wipes are absolutely fantastic.  For a long time, I had a bad habit of not washing my face at night because I was either too tired or didn&#x27;t see why I ought to.  These wipes have been a life- and skin-saver for me.  They take off all my make-up instantly, and my skin is left feeling smooth and moisturized.  I will say though that you ought to get a separate eye make-up remover product, either pads or solution to use with cotton balls.  I have occasionally used these on my eyes, and while they get the job done, I feel like it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to either rub what I took off my eyes all over my face or the other way around.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  Hopefully now my laziness won&#x27;t cause me to have crappy skin when I&#x27;m older. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover, really! It is nice and smooth, taking eye and face makeup off very easily. It if very refreshing and does not irritate the skin. I usually rip a sheet in half to make it last longer, although this is probably the best deal you will find on these, which usually go for seven or eight dollars in the store. The calming sent is a nice added bonus and not too strong. I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different makeup wipes and must say these are the best.  They remove makeup, mascara, etc. easily and gently and leave the face moisturized.  I usually use an additional moisturizer at night, but when I am too tired or get home late, it is great to know my skin will not suffer if I just use these towelettes and go straight to bed.  I have tried many other brands where it is necessary to supplement with additional liquid, lotion, etc just to effectively remove makeup, and even then the towelettes are too flimsy to withstand it.  The Neutrogena are the easiest, fastest, and most effective.  They are worth the extra few cents!</li>
            <li> SO CONVENIENT, AND SAFE, THANKS&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR TRAVELING TOO</li>
            <li> These are great for getting the foundation off of my face...I prefer to take my makeup off before I wash my face, and these get most of it. They are also very soothing, so if I was ever unable to wash my face, these would be a great alternative. They don&#x27;t pull of eye makeup so well, but I don&#x27;t think they are designed for that.</li>
            <li> These work great and smell FRESH! I don&#x27;t know what that other person is complaining about -_-    Anyway, they take off my mac eye products without burning the crap out of my eyes. I don&#x27;t cake on a whole bunch of make up, so using both sides wisely helps take off almost everything before I wash my face with [[ASIN:B00021C1LI Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser, 16 Ounce]] and I feel perfect! If I don&#x27;t wash my face and I feel lazy, I&#x27;m still fine with just wiping everything off!    Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought these on Amazon, as they are hard to find in all drugstores. A must for me, as I travel and am quite lazy about washing my face. I think I&#x27;ve tried every \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; face wipes out there, and they all left my face feeling raw and \\&quot;tight\\&quot;. These wipes are a godsend...if you have combo skin like me, they give just enough moisture so you can skip a nighttime lotion if need be. They remove all makeup quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave my eyes red and burning. Watch out that you seal them tightly after every use, and they&#x27;ll last you awhile. Best travel companion I can recommend! (Plus, the lavender smell is subtle, and very relaxing!)</li>
            <li> I have been using these towelettes for sometime now. They are great at removing waterproof mascara and makeup. They leave my face clean and moisturized. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> They work fine but smell really strongly like cheap men&#x27;s after shave, and the smell sticks. hours later I can still smell it loud and clear.</li>
            <li> I chose the Neutrogena towelettes because they&#x27;re alcohol and paraben-free and safe for eye makeup removal.  They&#x27;re great for cleansing on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I find that there&#x27;s a lot less tugging on the delicate eye area if I loosen mascara first with a cream-to-oil makeup remover and then use a towelette.    Pleasant scent, large enough to clean the whole face.  Wish there was a more reliable way to re-seal the package, but the towelettes stayed moist despite sealing issues.  Delivery from Amazon was prompt, well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I dont mind the smell - it&#x27;s kind of relaxing, but they dont seem to remove makeup very well. My face feels dirty after using them. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover.  I have very dry skin and not only does this keep my skin hydrated, it does a great job on my stubborn eyeliner.  I ususally cleanse my face when I shower but on nights I&#x27;m out late and have been overserved :-), a shower is out of the question when I get home.  This is the perfect alternative!  I travel quite a lot and being able to pack this so easy in my suitcase without much weight and no spillage, I love!      The only thing that could use a better solution is the seal and re-seal portion of the package. There are times when it doesn&#x27;t stay closed as it should.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I travel quite a bit for business and refuse to check baggage, so non-liquids are a plus. I find these remove make up well. They leave my face feeling conditioned and moist, and I can get away without moisturizer in a pinch when I use these 2x a day. I also have used these when I am on the run to work without time to properly cleanse -- I keep them with my make up bag in the car, and use one before leaving for work -- then throw on some foundation and blush when I get to the office. They are handy:)</li>
            <li> Love these makeup remover wipes!  I love the way they smell and make your face feel much cleaner after using them.</li>
            <li> I like these wipes a lot for when I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do my normal cleansing.  I feel like my face is clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> Handy product to remove makeup at night without leaving you with no excuse to cleanse your face.  This product also gives a moisturizer and face doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the cleansing cloths on the market, and nothing compares to these. I have very sensitive skin, and Rosacea, and these actually cool my face off instead of burning it like most other wipes. I use the night calming at all times of day (I guess they are marketed for night because of the lavender?). I&#x27;ve tried the original, and the moisturizing kind, and both are OK, but they do make my face burn a little. These are more expensive than other kinds, but in my opinion, they seem larger, softer, and hold more cleanser, so I don&#x27;t have to use more than one at a time. I hope they don&#x27;t stop selling them now that I admitted to loving them!</li>
            <li> I love these! Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t tried too many, but this is by far the best makeup remover towelette I have tried! I wear pretty heavy eye makeup, so I generally still have to use eye makeup remover to get all of that off, but these get everything else! I am not so sure about the \\&quot;night-calming\\&quot; part, but whatever they say. The only downside I have found is if you run vigorously and/or for a long period of time, these do start to burn your face - another reason I prefer eye makeup remover to these for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy. I use these all the time and really like them. I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Very effective at removing makeup!! Definitely use these if you have acne issues - you&#x27;re probably not removing all of your coverup, which only causes more acne. Also, I would use a facewash after, especially for those with acne, as this only removes makeup (it&#x27;s not supposed to wash or exfoliate).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Almay makeup remover pads (the ones in the small round container) for years.  And they have slowly gotten more expensive.  So for awhile I switched to gauze pads and an eye-makeup remover solution.  Eh - it worked, but I didn&#x27;t love it like I did the Almay pads.  Then, I stumbled across the Neutrogena makeup remover cleansing towelettes.  I&#x27;m hooked.  They are big enough that you can wash your entire face with them and still have a section available to take off your eye makeup (waterproof liner and mascara!)  They have a wonderful lavender smell.  (I suppose if you don&#x27;t like lavender you may not like these.)  I gave one to my daughter one night because I wanted her to try a new eyeliner, and she came back later and said, \\&quot;can I have some of those for Christmas?\\&quot;  I will admit they are not cheap.  But, the 2 pack of 25 means it lasts me 2 months (there are usually at least a couple days I go without makeup), and I get them on the Subscribe &amp; Save, so it&#x27;s an even better deal.  I like how soft these leave my face, without that sticky or greasy feeling many of the other facial cleaners have.  I keep these sitting in my basket next to the couch, take off my makeup as I am finishing up work emails for the night, then rinse my face with water when I go to bed.  Great item - very happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena makeup remover towelettes since they came out. They are the best at taking off waterproof mascara, and after doing that, I still have enough room on the towel to wash the rest of my face. I usually take off my makeup right before crawling into bed for the night, and the lavender scent is very calming and relaxing. Its a great way to finish off the day, and my face feels soft and smooth after using them. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I really like neutrogena&#x27;s products, but this one really leaves me dissatisfied. It leaves a greasy residue-like feeling. I much prefer the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes in the light blue container.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and love the way it removes every trace of makeup, including eye makeup! I have it on subscription so I never run out!</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed that these facial towelettes do not remove more dirt from my face. However, these are facial towelettes and I wouldn&#x27;t really expect any other towelette to perform much better. I basically just use these when I am too lazy to wash my face LOL The towelettes are very large and I can remove all of my eye make up and my face make up with two towelettes. This is pretty amazing considering the large amount of make up I wear on my face and the large amount of mascara I wear on my eyelashes! If you are looking for a decently priced facial cleansing cloth, I would recommend these but I would not expect to see any improvement in the quality of your skin.</li>
            <li> Ahh the joys of wiping anything including tacky oil paints off your skin</li>
            <li> I am not impressed. These are very dry and overpriced. They irritated my skin and are much thinner than ponds.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a while now and I would so recommend to anyone. They make my skin feel soft, non-greasy, and totally touch worthy. They even take off my water proof mascara(which is always a pain to take off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With saying all that; do NOT hesitate on buying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li> This is all I use to remove make up at night.  It works great for me.  Since it is gentle on my skin that is an added plus bc I have extra sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job though is not as effective on eye make up as straight make up remover.  Great for my face though when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a huge fan of the wipes in the blue package but got suckered in by the night calming thing and boy was I wrong. First off, these DO get off your makeup, but they burn the absolute heck out of your eyes. My eyelids feel especially dry after using these but that was not the biggest concern I have. I&#x27;ve only been using them for three days and last night I removed my eye make up and saw a bit of eye shadow glitter had landed on my cheeks so I used the wipes to remove it before washing and mosturizing like normal. I woke up today with puffy and red cheeks!!! They&#x27;re the driest I&#x27;ve ever experienced!! I&#x27;m going out at lunch today to buy the normal ones because never again will I use the scented. I don&#x27;t even have unusually sensitive skin but these destroyed it.</li>
            <li> I really likethe night calming towelettes.  They smell great and I enjoy using them to wipe off all my makeup before bed.  These really remove all traces of my makeup including waterproof eye liner and mascara.  I also love the size of these.  They are bigger than most other similar products so they are easier to clean with and I feel like I can use a new part of the cloth for each part of my face.  The price on amazon is also the best I have found.  However the night calming ones aren&#x27;t always in stock.</li>
            <li> These are great - heavy duty.  They remove makeup that other products miss. I have now seen them in local stores, so I will be purchasing them locally and avoiding shipping charges from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect makeup whip.  Work great at removing even waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  I use these every night and I love them for traveling.  They leave my face smooth and refreshed and I do not feel the need to use a cleanser after using these.</li>
            <li> This product was great for removing waterproof mascara, but it made me break out after using it on my entire face. I continued to use it on just my eyes, only to have my eyelids and eyebrows break out. I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible. In this product&#x27;s defense, I do have sensitive skin; I break out if I spray perfume directly on my skin. It smells great, but don&#x27;t buy it if your skin is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> These towelettes work at taking my make up off (mascara removal requires more work than eye makeup remover on a cotton call) but leave a residue on my skin that makes me feel as though I need to wash my face immediately after using them.  So I can&#x27;t recommend.  Their aroma is not unpleasant and thankfully, is not strong (had some makeup remover towelettes I had to give away due to the strong perfumed odour), but the residue issue would prevent me from repurchasing.  Will be giving away the 2nd package.</li>
            <li> They smell nice, they clean off even waterproof eye makeup, and they leave my skin feeling clean and not dried-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the &#x27;bargain brand&#x27; at a drugstore when I was on vacation and had forgotten my Neutrogena makeup remover towelettes... NO COMPARISON!  These win, hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper ones burned my eyes. These don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep these in the nightstand and when I climb into bed then realize I&#x27;ve forgotten to take off my makeup, I can just grab one and I&#x27;m clean and set for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for over a year now and they are awesome! They take off all makeup..even that hard to remove mascara. The smell is also really nice! Not too strong, very much a &amp;#34;night calming&amp;#34; scent. Would recommed these to anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands, but these are my favorite make up wipes. I tried them after hearing these specific &#x27;Night Calming&#x27; wipes were a favorite of Kim Kardashian. Glad these turned out to be great and I wasn&#x27;t duped. The top sticks pretty well, but I always place them on the counter upside down so the top doesn&#x27;t come up by mistake.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser following a long day.  Moisturizes my skin and I wake up with a glow...perfection in a little wipe</li>
