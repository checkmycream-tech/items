            <li>I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>The rubber nipple is smooth in texture, plyable and very comfortable on the tongue.</li>
            <li>While it does last though, it&#x27;s a very good pacifier.</li>
            <li>, I love them this seller is vary cheap compared to others and</li>

            <li>After a year of use sing mine every day it needs replaced, and im fine with that for this price</li>
            <li>and it does fine.  </li>
            <li>As long as you are already aware of this and everyone is alright its the best pacifier ever.</li>
            <li>The Large pacifiers fit comfortably in the mouth, and allow for sucking easily while not being restrictive.</li>
            <li>For the longest time I&#x27;ve had problems with dry mouth and sinuses with pain and nosebleeds so my therapy hasn&#x27;t been very effective, until now.</li>
            <li>Love this pacifer for my 13 year old, special needs daughter!</li>
            <li>Baby Pants has the adult-size versions available, from those who are interested in playtime or just needing something to help with jaw or snoring issues.</li>

            <li>I hope this works for adult babies also make sure it&#x27;s shipped by Tuesday October 21st</li>
            <li>The Nuk Medic Pro arrived in the original manifacturer box with the medical guidance pamphlet.</li>
            <li>I wish the mouth guard was about 1/3rd bigger than it is (it would be more comfortable against my mouth if it were bigger), but that is my only real</li>
            <li>Irritated my mouth tissues and felt like I couldn&#x27;t catch a full deep</li>
            <li>Really made me feel smaller because of its large size.</li>

            <li>but I was wondering if it&#x27;s an adult Nuk #5?</li>
            <li>Instead, my 85 yr old mother has a swallowing disorder and a problem nervously clanking her teeth severely.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely in an adult sized mouth.</li>
            <li>Quality, adult size, made by Nuk.</li>

            <li> I have an old one and it is bigger than the new one.</li>
            <li> I do wish the shield was a little larger but its decent as is.</li>
            <li> but the shank isn&#x27;t long enough to suck on it.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
            <li> It does not fit an adult mouth.</li>
            <li> It encourages my mouth to stay closed as I sleep.</li>
            <li> Although I wish the alternate colour options weren&#x27;t using a baby shield that is too small.</li>
            <li> The Nuk Medic Pro pacifiers are a quality product no matter the age range, but the smaller pacifiers for young children are terribly uncomfortable (and ill-fitting).</li>
            <li> It is an extremely noticeable noise I tried poking a hole in it as others had suggested but it ended up severely compromising the performance and made it not worth it.</li>
            <li> (I just bite down on the guard instead).</li>
            <li> This soothes and calms her down, and sometimes we allow her to use it for up to 2 hours when she has excessive tooth chatter.  </li>
            <li> Too small and the rubber portion is made of latex.  </li>
            <li> I am an AB/DL, and I have had two of these pacifiers in the past.</li>
            <li> the plastic was too small.</li>
            <li> She does give it a beating and chews hard, and has yet to rip or break or tear it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s..very frustrating.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of sucking on baby sized pacifiers, so I saved up my money, and bought a Nuk 5.</li>
            <li> This product was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this Nuk #5.</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have two from this seller a blue nuk and orange nuk, I love them this seller is vary cheap compared to others and And its a vary nice Pacifire, I use mine at night, and a few hours in the day and they hold up vary well.  Id say the &amp;#34;nipple&amp;#34; is comparable to a normal thumb if it was flater, but they do fill a adult mouth vary well and get past the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; in your mouth. After a year of use sing mine every day it needs replaced, and im fine with that for this price</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this Nuk #5. I have an old one and it is bigger than the new one. It&#x27;s OK but I was wondering if it&#x27;s an adult Nuk #5?</li>
            <li> It gives you a sore mouth when you SUCK on it</li>
            <li> Well its great, I bought it just out of curiosity but I already fell in love with it. I noticed it created an urge to suck when I put it in my mouth and it was soothing. I would defiantly say pacifiers are great for babies and adults.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to dress up like a giant baby like some of the purchasers online.  Instead, my 85 yr old mother has a swallowing disorder and a problem nervously clanking her teeth severely.  She cannot use mouth guards so I tried this.  IT WORKS.  This soothes and calms her down, and sometimes we allow her to use it for up to 2 hours when she has excessive tooth chatter.  Sometimes we do have to put a cloth on her chest because she will salivate.  I disinfect it with clorox like the real thing and it does fine.  She does give it a beating and chews hard, and has yet to rip or break or tear it.  I&#x27;m glad I found it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was a great item and I had no issues with it this I would tell others about it !</li>
            <li> I have always loved this pacifier and this vendor. Have been using them for many years now. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I use BiPAP therapy nightly for severe sleep apnea. For the longest time I&#x27;ve had problems with dry mouth and sinuses with pain and nosebleeds so my therapy hasn&#x27;t been very effective, until now. As I sleep, my mouth opens and that&#x27;s where the problems start. My doctor recommended this as a potential solution for me. It fits inside my mask and is very comfortable to use. It encourages my mouth to stay closed as I sleep. I&#x27;ve only had it about a week and I&#x27;m still getting accustomed to it, but the dryness and bleeding have stopped. I am now able to tolerate the mask most of the night. If you&#x27;re considering using this for the same purpose please CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. Every sleep disorder is different!</li>
            <li> Good size pacifier that doesn&#x27;t cause sore teeth for me like baby pacifiers did. Although I wish the alternate colour options weren&#x27;t using a baby shield that is too small.</li>
            <li> Nice size and shape. It really helped me sleep well and cleared my sinuses so I do not snore anymore.</li>
            <li> The Nuk Medic Pro pacifiers are a quality product no matter the age range, but the smaller pacifiers for young children are terribly uncomfortable (and ill-fitting). Baby Pants has the adult-size versions available, from those who are interested in playtime or just needing something to help with jaw or snoring issues. The Large pacifiers fit comfortably in the mouth, and allow for sucking easily while not being restrictive. The soft pliable depressor is comfortable in the mouth, while the exterior plastic is durable and rests easily against the lips. The pacifier is both soothing to use and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s (or any little one&#x27;s) quiet time. I would definitely recommend these to anyone interested in them.</li>
            <li> Cute and quality you expect of nuk brand</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this pacifier. It was the perfect size, super soothing, and all around pretty excellent except for the squeaking that others have mentioned. It is an extremely noticeable noise I tried poking a hole in it as others had suggested but it ended up severely compromising the performance and made it not worth it. My advice is to get it if you know the squeaking will not bother anyone. As long as you are already aware of this and everyone is alright its the best pacifier ever.I do wish the shield was a little larger but its decent as is. The rubber was just fine after a few uses as well.</li>
            <li> The Nuk Medic Pro arrived in the original manifacturer box with the medical guidance pamphlet. It fits nicely in an adult sized mouth.</li>
            <li> I use this at night to get to sleep, and it really helps.  It worked even better after I got dentures, which I remove at night.  I also think I&#x27;m calmer the next day when I use it.</li>
            <li> Too small and the rubber portion is made of latex.  I don&#x27;t believe I saw a warning concerning the latex contents.  I have no problem with latex but your next customer may.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have some TMJ issues that regular mouth guards weren&#x27;t helping with (I just bite down on the guard instead). I found an English-language page describing the Medicpro on Nuk&#x27;s website and while they don&#x27;t sell it here in the US yet, I found it here. It was absolutely worth it. My jaw and neck feel a lot better now.</li>
            <li> I am an AB/DL, and I have had two of these pacifiers in the past. Within a month, the rubber nipple cracks. It&#x27;s..very frustrating. While it does last though, it&#x27;s a very good pacifier.</li>
            <li> this was a disapointment. the plastic was too small. still snore. do not recommend try something else. keep shopping elsewhere</li>
            <li> Quality, adult size, made by Nuk. I&#x27;m not an AB (adult baby), but was curious, and tried it as an option to prevent bruxism (teeth grinding).&lt;br /&gt;Not my thing. Irritated my mouth tissues and felt like I couldn&#x27;t catch a full deep breath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it, even though it didn&#x27;t suit me well.</li>
            <li> This is the adult size -- most soothing...</li>
            <li> Love this pacifer for my 13 year old, special needs daughter! The Bulb on it is a good size for an older teenager.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into this sort of thing, it was great.  Really made me feel smaller because of its large size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an AB and I was tired of sucking on baby sized pacifiers, so I saved up my money, and bought a Nuk 5. I just wanted to say that this seller has came through for me a second time, the was when I ordered a onesie from them. I absolutely love this binky, I usually fall asleep sucking on it. thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> This pacifier is soothing to the mouth and is the perfect size for adults. I am Never going back to a size two again!</li>
            <li> This product was falsely advertised. It does not fit an adult mouth. It&#x27;s more for a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;If you bite it with your front teeth, you can hold it in your mouth but the shank isn&#x27;t long enough to suck on it.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t accept returns. It is way too expensive. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it a one star if I didn&#x27;t have to give it something.</li>
            <li> I received the product in plenty of time, but had to pay to return it because it&#x27;s made out of latex. It does not tell you in the description for the item that the nipple is latex.</li>
            <li> The Nuk 5 (AKA the Nuk Medic Pro Large) is an outstanding pacifier for adult use. The rubber nipple is smooth in texture, plyable and very comfortable on the tongue. I wish the mouth guard was about 1/3rd bigger than it is (it would be more comfortable against my mouth if it were bigger), but that is my only real complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful tool if you are looking for something to help relax you or help you get to sleep at night. Once you have tried it, you will wonder how you ever lived without one in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip- attach it to a neck lanyard so that if it falls out of your mouth, it won&#x27;t fall on the floor!</li>
            <li> I hope this works for adult babies also make sure it&#x27;s shipped by Tuesday October 21st thanks</li>
            <li> Love it, it puts me to sleep</li>
            <li> I AM 72 YEARS OLD AND USE THIS EVERY NIGHT FOR MYSELF SINCE I CHEW ON IT INSTEAD OF GRINDING MY TEETH. IT TAKES ABUSE BECAUSE I CHEW ON IT. I LOVE IT....LYNN</li>
