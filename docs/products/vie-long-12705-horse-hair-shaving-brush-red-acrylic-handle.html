            <li>I have great control with this brush over where my shaving soap goes on my face.</li>

            <li>Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush.</li>
            <li>A very nice brush with a lot of backbone and texture to it.  </li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>A pleasant surprise it turned out to be.</li>
            <li>This would be a good addition to your shave den</li>
            <li>Brush is well made and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>has a good backbone</li>
            <li>This is a good deal and you owe it to yourself to try a horse hair brush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good brush</li>
            <li>The lather it creates is good</li>
            <li>This a really great brush and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent brush and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not an animal activist by any means, but it is nice to know they don&#x27;t hurt an animals in the making of these.</li>
            <li>I own four brushes a cheap Escali 100% Pure Badger, Semogue 1520 Superior Boar, Captain Fawcett&#x27;s &#x27;Best&#x27; Badger and this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different category from Boar/Badger and works best in a Paintbrush motion rather than circular.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sheds 5 or more hair every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This brush is going to fit nicely into my rotation.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite out of all four.  </li>
            <li>You get easier lather than a boar while getting a bit more backbone than a badger.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>but I could happily use this as my only brush, and it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>It is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>I can see that this will probably become my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m pleased with the knot.</li>
            <li>and I love the ones that I have, but this horse hair brush is my every day favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It is an ok brush.</li>
            <li>If it did not have the smell I would like it more.</li>
            <li>Great brush my new favorite, stiffer than badger softer than boar.</li>
            <li>after cleaning it to get rid of the smell, worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>While I do enjoy the stiffer bristle of the horse hair, I find that I get a better lather with badger.  </li>
            <li>It came with a strong smell of the rear end of a horse.</li>
            <li>Lathers fine with Praraso soap I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>I use a home made shave soap that has an excellent and stable lather typically.</li>
            <li>and they are all just fine.</li>
            <li>but, it is such a great brush</li>
            <li>or I must say if this were my one and only brush I would be happy.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I like the appearance and comfortable size of this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is soft yet has a good backbone to it.</li>
            <li>It holds ample water to face to make a good lather for a nice wet shave.</li>
            <li>this brush is pretty and works okay, but the horse hair takes a while to get rid of the stink.</li>
            <li>Its very soft on my legs, bikini line and arm pits and it whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Nothing special though.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and the bristles are long and work well in producing good lather.</li>
            <li>It is nice and soft yet has plenty of backbone.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as the badger but a nice mix of softness and stiffness.</li>
            <li>By around the 5th shave the brush will only smell like the good shaving soap you have been using.</li>
            <li>The maker really should do a better job of descenting these, before selling them.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say luxurious), has a good backbone and is great for hard and soft soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love the horse hair softness and, although I am new to wet-shaving, I am definately a convert and can&#x27;t imagine a nicer brush.  </li>
            <li>Nice back bone but softer than a boar hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell at first but went away quickly after first use now it smells just like the soap.  </li>
            <li>It does smell pretty strongly at first, but after about a weeks worth of shaving with Proraso eucalyptus oil shave cream</li>
            <li>It really whips up a wonderful lather, especially with Italian soft soaps.</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak this brush above the knot in hot water before using to soften the hair.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare it to</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and delivery was realistically much quicker than projected, ordered on Thursday, received on Monday.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>This was my first ever shave brush</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Probably badger and a different brand for sure.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s exactly what the brush now smells like --</li>
            <li>However it seems to be breaking in nicely and it is soft with moderate backbone, which I&#x27;m likely better than I figured I would.</li>
            <li>Smells like the back end of the hoarse when wet, but a good shampooing and it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous quality brush from Spain with bristles that are a bit stiffer than badger but not quite as stiff as most boar brushes.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush, firm enough to whip up a good lather let soft and comfy on my face, don&#x27;t listen to the talk about the smell</li>
            <li>This is so the brushes can better dry out between shaves.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a nice little purchase.  </li>
            <li>A great all purpose brush that will work with anything from a hard puck soap to a soft cream.  </li>
            <li>After two years of using it, I&#x27;d have to say it holds up really well.</li>
            <li>Works really well, and its inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Real hair and no animal cruelty.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>As an update I now really cannot recommend the Vie-Long horse hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a very costly brush and for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain about it because it does function as advertised, is manufactured well, and will get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too pleased with the size and shape, just not very ergonomic for me.</li>
            <li>much longer it will be till the handle splits or the knot falls out.</li>
            <li>But, I guess for $20 I&#x27;m not out too much.</li>
            <li>An additional benefit is that the brush really works the foam around your face while simultaneously softening/lifting up the stubble in preparation for the shaving.  </li>
            <li>I also found the knot to be flimsier than badger which was expected but it also didn&#x27;t hold as much lather as I would have liked or expected and being flimsy made getting a good lather a slightly longer process.  </li>
            <li>I nearly chucked it after its first use.</li>
            <li>I do not know why horse hair shaving brushes are not more popular.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job with both creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m lucky it will only shed 3 or 4</li>
            <li>The brush will hold a ton of water and makes a decent lather.</li>
            <li>As the book says, more expensive does not necessarily mean better.</li>
            <li>start, you HAVE to clean it properly, it smells like complete garbage!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone wishing to entertain a change up.</li>
            <li>The hair is a little stiffer than the badger hair brushes and it does require a little more work to whip up a nice lather, but I really don&#x27;t mind the extra thirty seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very well, is soft (</li>
            <li>I dared to be happy (silly me.)</li>
            <li>Normal</li>
            <li>so I only rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Horse hair was popular waaaay back before a big anthrax outbreak last century.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, no animals are harmed in the production of horsehair brushes -- the hair is harvested in normal grooming -- which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once It was broken in, it produces a good moist lather with my tub of tobs...</li>
            <li>it was losing a couple of hairs each shave when it was new.</li>
            <li>So, that being said I&#x27;ve started shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft but scritchy brush.</li>
            <li>also very soft bristles comparable to badger.</li>
            <li>That I could live with but the fact that it is starting to crack after a month of use real upsets me.</li>
            <li>I am pretty new to wet shaving and wanted to try out a new brush.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and much softer than I expected, and the hairs do not fall out.</li>
            <li>The tips are a bit more scratchy compared to a high end badger or well broken in boar and the initial stench is a bit much at first.</li>
            <li>And the horse hairs feel soft on the face.</li>
            <li>I thought that straight out of the box it did have a bit of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent, but this has dissipated after using it for a short time.</li>
            <li>I like that this brush is a natural hair brush and not synthetic</li>
            <li>but overall has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a natural hair brush so there is no way around that.</li>
            <li>Additionally I actually like that the hair is stiffer as the brush doesn&#x27;t flop around too much</li>
            <li>I still have not got the stench to go completely away after shampoo, conditioner, dish soap, and shaving soap.</li>
            <li>With that said, for an additional $8-9 you can get a much nicer to use badger Chinese brush from the big auction site.  </li>
            <li>It can be a real nuisance picking loose hairs out of the soap bowl, or off the razor while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li>I use it with a few different itallan bowl-type soaps; I load the wet brush with soap, then work the soaped brush into a good lather using a wide cup for a container.</li>
            <li>and it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The brush holds water well and can produce a thick smooth lather.</li>
            <li>and it produces a fabulous, thick lather, resulting in a shave so close</li>
            <li>Seems like a very well made brush that should last me a long time!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it lathers, especially on harder soaps, seeing as it it slightly stiffer than silvertip badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my first horse hair brush, only other one I have is a silvertip badger.</li>
            <li>No loose hairs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the Omega Professional Boar Bristle Shaving Brush at the same time and both will be used as a travel or backup brush only.  </li>
            <li>Brush does shed a little at first, but it gradually stops  </li>
            <li>far as durability, I have had mine for some time now and other than a few hairs dropping out in the beginning, the brush is holding up nicely -- more so than some of my other, more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>Odd smell at first, not gross, just odd, but a couple of shampoos fixed that.</li>

            <li> After two years of using it, I&#x27;d have to say it holds up really well.</li>
            <li> Works really well, and its inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Real hair and no animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> As an update I now really cannot recommend the Vie-Long horse hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very costly brush and for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain about it because it does function as advertised, is manufactured well, and will get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too pleased with the size and shape, just not very ergonomic for me.</li>
            <li> much longer it will be till the handle splits or the knot falls out.</li>
            <li> But, I guess for $20 I&#x27;m not out too much.</li>
            <li> An additional benefit is that the brush really works the foam around your face while simultaneously softening/lifting up the stubble in preparation for the shaving.  </li>
            <li> I also found the knot to be flimsier than badger which was expected but it also didn&#x27;t hold as much lather as I would have liked or expected and being flimsy made getting a good lather a slightly longer process.  </li>
            <li> I nearly chucked it after its first use.</li>
            <li> I do not know why horse hair shaving brushes are not more popular.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job with both creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m lucky it will only shed 3 or 4</li>
            <li> The brush will hold a ton of water and makes a decent lather.</li>
            <li> As the book says, more expensive does not necessarily mean better.</li>
            <li> start, you HAVE to clean it properly, it smells like complete garbage!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone wishing to entertain a change up.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little stiffer than the badger hair brushes and it does require a little more work to whip up a nice lather, but I really don&#x27;t mind the extra thirty seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> Lathers very well, is soft (</li>
            <li> I dared to be happy (silly me.)</li>
            <li> Normal</li>
            <li> so I only rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Horse hair was popular waaaay back before a big anthrax outbreak last century.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, no animals are harmed in the production of horsehair brushes -- the hair is harvested in normal grooming -- which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once It was broken in, it produces a good moist lather with my tub of tobs...</li>
            <li> it was losing a couple of hairs each shave when it was new.</li>
            <li> So, that being said I&#x27;ve started shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft but scritchy brush.</li>
            <li> also very soft bristles comparable to badger.</li>
            <li> That I could live with but the fact that it is starting to crack after a month of use real upsets me.</li>
            <li> I am pretty new to wet shaving and wanted to try out a new brush.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and much softer than I expected, and the hairs do not fall out.</li>
            <li> The tips are a bit more scratchy compared to a high end badger or well broken in boar and the initial stench is a bit much at first.</li>
            <li> And the horse hairs feel soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I thought that straight out of the box it did have a bit of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent, but this has dissipated after using it for a short time.</li>
            <li> I like that this brush is a natural hair brush and not synthetic</li>
            <li> but overall has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a natural hair brush so there is no way around that.</li>
            <li> Additionally I actually like that the hair is stiffer as the brush doesn&#x27;t flop around too much</li>
            <li> I still have not got the stench to go completely away after shampoo, conditioner, dish soap, and shaving soap.</li>
            <li> With that said, for an additional $8-9 you can get a much nicer to use badger Chinese brush from the big auction site.  </li>
            <li> It can be a real nuisance picking loose hairs out of the soap bowl, or off the razor while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> I use it with a few different itallan bowl-type soaps; I load the wet brush with soap, then work the soaped brush into a good lather using a wide cup for a container.</li>
            <li> and it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The brush holds water well and can produce a thick smooth lather.</li>
            <li> and it produces a fabulous, thick lather, resulting in a shave so close</li>
            <li> Seems like a very well made brush that should last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it lathers, especially on harder soaps, seeing as it it slightly stiffer than silvertip badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my first horse hair brush, only other one I have is a silvertip badger.</li>
            <li> No loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Omega Professional Boar Bristle Shaving Brush at the same time and both will be used as a travel or backup brush only.  </li>
            <li> Brush does shed a little at first, but it gradually stops  </li>
            <li> far as durability, I have had mine for some time now and other than a few hairs dropping out in the beginning, the brush is holding up nicely -- more so than some of my other, more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> Odd smell at first, not gross, just odd, but a couple of shampoos fixed that.</li>
            <li> With that said, I plan on ordering another horse hair Vie Long, possibly the white horse hair, that just came out.</li>
            <li> Had a little bit of a smell to it, but that disappeared after a quick shampoo treatment/scrub and a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> Well first off the smell, apon arrival this brush did have an odor as expected, but took very little time to wash that out.</li>
            <li> I gave the brush an initial soak in a 50/50 vinegar-to-water solution, then shook the brush out and let it air dry overnight.</li>
            <li> Mine had a little odor the first few uses</li>
            <li> long hairs each time.</li>
            <li> More &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; than a soft badger brush, but in a pleasurable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells absolutely horrific when you get it wet the first time, but after repeated immersion in soap suds</li>
            <li> Other mornings its a big fallout (see photo).</li>
            <li> Even though it has a soft feel, it is also firm and not floppy when wet.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this brush for about two months and have NOT lost a single hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush daily with creams, wash it after each use, and hang it in a stand bristles down after each use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more scritchy than my omega boar brushes with less backbone and the handle is really awkward for me to hold</li>
            <li> I use this brush in an vintage Old Spice shaving mug with puch style hard shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Not too soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> A few uses with scented soaps or shampooing takes care of the odor in short order.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious about horse hair brushes, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> That was expected.</li>
            <li> The squarish dimple handle design is not to my liking as I prefer round, my only critique.  </li>
            <li> It effortlessly created a thick creamy lather with my Proraso soap and holds enough for multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a badger hair brush for a long time and decided, for a little variety, to try one of these horse-hair brushes from Vie-Long.</li>
            <li> other brushes</li>
            <li> have other brushes (badger and synthetic)</li>
            <li> but mine has extremely sharp tips.</li>
            <li> it is VERY VERY minimal.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is annoying to pick out the fallen hair out from the face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a better horse hair manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Softer than boar, no need to break it in,almost like a badger in feel but so much less money.</li>
            <li> They are easier to break-in than a boar hair brush and costs less than a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a dirty horse stall for the first two shaves.</li>
            <li> I can overlook a little horse smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a little scritch/scrubbiness that seems to soften up over time.</li>
            <li> It took at little longer to work the &amp;#34;horse&amp;#34; smell out of it than it takes to work the &amp;#34;boar&amp;#34; smell out of a boars hair brush.</li>
            <li> I initally bought this just to have a horse hair brush to round out my collection of badger and boar brushes.</li>
            <li> Did have an oder to it but disappeared after a few uses.</li>
            <li> if you like your brush a little stiff, you will like this brush.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit stiffer, but not as stiff as a boar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure hom</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush that does the job then get this, if you want to display it as a work of art then go elsewhere as the handle base isn&#x27;t pretty when hanging on a stand.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because it lathered well and was pleasantly soft on the face, but</li>
            <li> Also, it did not lose any hairs nor did it have a rank smell to it when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;ve had the brush for a little over 3 months and it sheds hair a lot; I mean like crazy.</li>
            <li> Only downside I can think of is the horrific smell in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I got rid of the bad smell in about three days using Dawn detergent, shampoo, and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get this brush, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like bad breath x10!</li>
            <li> Horrible construction!!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible and took days of washing to get it to lessen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This a really great brush and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. It is nice and soft yet has plenty of backbone. It really whips up a wonderful lather, especially with Italian soft soaps. Mine had a little odor the first few uses but, it is such a great brush I can overlook a little horse smell. A few uses with scented soaps or shampooing takes care of the odor in short order. If you&#x27;re curious about horse hair brushes, give this one a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush for shave soap. I use this brush in an vintage Old Spice shaving mug with puch style hard shaving soap. Thie has become my brush of choice for shaving soap. I do have a badger as well as a boar hair brush and would put this somewhere in between. Not as soft as the badger but a nice mix of softness and stiffness. This would be a good addition to your shave den or I must say if this were my one and only brush I would be happy.</li>
            <li> I got this brush from my wife for Christmas. It is my first horse hair brush, only other one I have is a silvertip badger. This one is a bit stiffer, but not as stiff as a boar. I rather like it. Been using it exclusively since I got it. Seems like a very well made brush that should last me a long time!</li>
            <li> After two years of using it, I&#x27;d have to say it holds up really well. It&#x27;s a different category from Boar/Badger and works best in a Paintbrush motion rather than circular. It does have a little scritch/scrubbiness that seems to soften up over time. Does a decent job with both creams and soaps.  Make sure to soak this brush above the knot in hot water before using to soften the hair. Brush does shed a little at first, but it gradually stops  Only downside I can think of is the horrific smell in the beginning. I nearly chucked it after its first use.</li>
            <li> Hoarse hair? You bet. This brush is fantastic.  Works really well, and its inexpensive. Nice back bone but softer than a boar hair. Smells like the back end of the hoarse when wet, but a good shampooing and it faded quickly. Real hair and no animal cruelty. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty new to wet shaving and wanted to try out a new brush.  Brush is well made and feels good in the hand.  Had a little bit of a smell to it, but that disappeared after a quick shampoo treatment/scrub and a few shaves.  While I do enjoy the stiffer bristle of the horse hair, I find that I get a better lather with badger.  YMMV</li>
            <li> Horrible construction!!!&lt;br /&gt;The brush was smelly in the beginning..that is no problem.  It lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the construction quality is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;It sheds 5 or more hair every time I use it. It has been two months already.... 20% of the hair is already gone.&lt;br /&gt;It is annoying to pick out the fallen hair out from the face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a better horse hair manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. It took at little longer to work the &amp;#34;horse&amp;#34; smell out of it than it takes to work the &amp;#34;boar&amp;#34; smell out of a boars hair brush. However it seems to be breaking in nicely and it is soft with moderate backbone, which I&#x27;m likely better than I figured I would. This brush is going to fit nicely into my rotation. I highly recommend to anyone wishing to entertain a change up.</li>
            <li> We had brought this for a Christmas gift and came it on time. It&#x27;s everything the description said it would be and is everything we wanted.</li>
            <li> if you like your brush a little stiff, you will like this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a badger hair brush for a long time and decided, for a little variety, to try one of these horse-hair brushes from Vie-Long. A pleasant surprise it turned out to be. I use it with a few different itallan bowl-type soaps; I load the wet brush with soap, then work the soaped brush into a good lather using a wide cup for a container. The brush holds water well and can produce a thick smooth lather. And the horse hairs feel soft on the face. Nice! Some reviewers have remaked about a horse scent to the brush. I thought that straight out of the box it did have a bit of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent, but this has dissipated after using it for a short time. I gave the brush an initial soak in a 50/50 vinegar-to-water solution, then shook the brush out and let it air dry overnight. By around the 5th shave the brush will only smell like the good shaving soap you have been using. Give it a try. The cost is reasonable. Work on your technique with the brush to get the lather the way you like it; I think you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Like other brushes it was losing a couple of hairs each shave when it was new. Normal I figured. But now I&#x27;ve had the brush for a little over 3 months and it sheds hair a lot; I mean like crazy. It can be a real nuisance picking loose hairs out of the soap bowl, or off the razor while I&#x27;m shaving. If I&#x27;m lucky it will only shed 3 or 4 long hairs each time. Other mornings its a big fallout (see photo). As an update I now really cannot recommend the Vie-Long horse hair shaving brush. Too bad, because it lathered well and was pleasantly soft on the face, but . . . . This one is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I own four brushes a cheap Escali 100% Pure Badger, Semogue 1520 Superior Boar, Captain Fawcett&#x27;s &#x27;Best&#x27; Badger and this one. It is my favorite out of all four.  It lathers very well has a good backbone and it&#x27;s not scratchy.  Will remain my go to if I can stop at four.</li>
            <li> For $20 this has got to be the best brush for the money IMO. I agree with the person who said it feels like between a badger and a boar brush. You get easier lather than a boar while getting a bit more backbone than a badger. The tips are a bit more scratchy compared to a high end badger or well broken in boar and the initial stench is a bit much at first.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare it to but I&#x27;m happy with it.  Lathers fine with Praraso soap I&#x27;m using.  It does shed a hair or two but nothing alarming, just about what I would expect from any natural hair brush.  It does have a smell at first but went away quickly after first use now it smells just like the soap.  If you are looking for a brush that does the job then get this, if you want to display it as a work of art then go elsewhere as the handle base isn&#x27;t pretty when hanging on a stand.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very costly brush and for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain about it because it does function as advertised, is manufactured well, and will get the job done.  With that said, for an additional $8-9 you can get a much nicer to use badger Chinese brush from the big auction site.  I ordered this and the Omega Professional Boar Bristle Shaving Brush at the same time and both will be used as a travel or backup brush only.  I also found the knot to be flimsier than badger which was expected but it also didn&#x27;t hold as much lather as I would have liked or expected and being flimsy made getting a good lather a slightly longer process.  I use a home made shave soap that has an excellent and stable lather typically.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and much softer than I expected, and the hairs do not fall out. Even though it has a soft feel, it is also firm and not floppy when wet. I have great control with this brush over where my shaving soap goes on my face.</li>
            <li> After a couple of practice runs I figured out how to control moisture and it produces a fabulous, thick lather, resulting in a shave so close you would think I had my face waxed. Worth every penny, and delivery was realistically much quicker than projected, ordered on Thursday, received on Monday.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! Softer than boar, no need to break it in,almost like a badger in feel but so much less money. This is a good deal and you owe it to yourself to try a horse hair brush. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. No loose hairs. Retains its shape.</li>
            <li> this brush is pretty and works okay, but the horse hair takes a while to get rid of the stink. It&#x27;s much more scritchy than my omega boar brushes with less backbone and the handle is really awkward for me to hold so I only rarely use it.</li>
            <li> This was my first ever shave brush and I love it. Its very soft on my legs, bikini line and arm pits and it whips up a nice lather. I Dont feel the need to purchase anything else.</li>
            <li> This is a quality horse hair shaving brush. It loads well. It&#x27;s my second horse hair brush. Horse hair was popular waaaay back before a big anthrax outbreak last century. They&#x27;re starting to make somewhat of a comeback. They are easier to break-in than a boar hair brush and costs less than a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I do not know why horse hair shaving brushes are not more popular. I have put my badger and boar brushes in storage for now. This brush is soft yet has a good backbone to it. And the price simply can&#x27;t be beat. Also, it did not lose any hairs nor did it have a rank smell to it when it was brand new. Get this brush, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, firm enough to whip up a good lather let soft and comfy on my face, don&#x27;t listen to the talk about the smell it is VERY VERY minimal.  I washed it a couple of times with shampoo and conditional and shaved with it twice and it is barely noticeable.  I bet within a week there will be no smell at all.  I like that this brush is a natural hair brush and not synthetic yet the hair was harvested without killing the animal.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a nice little purchase.  It is exactly as advertised.  The brush &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; a bit stiffer and I like that.  Been using it daily since I purchased it - no bristle loss that I can detect.</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s softness is in my opinion between Boar bristle and Badger.  A great all purpose brush that will work with anything from a hard puck soap to a soft cream.  For the price a must have to add to your shaving brush collection.</li>
            <li> Makes a real nice lather, I face lather.</li>
            <li> Attractive and practical alternative to badger. Odd smell at first, not gross, just odd, but a couple of shampoos fixed that.</li>
            <li> A very nice brush with a lot of backbone and texture to it.  More &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; than a soft badger brush, but in a pleasurable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells absolutely horrific when you get it wet the first time, but after repeated immersion in soap suds the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, no animals are harmed in the production of horsehair brushes -- the hair is harvested in normal grooming -- which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other brushes (badger and synthetic) but I could happily use this as my only brush, and it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great brush. It is now my favorite. Not too soft and not too hard. The only complaint I had was the smell. It smelled like a dirty horse stall for the first two shaves. That was expected. The maker really should do a better job of descenting these, before selling them. With that said, I plan on ordering another horse hair Vie Long, possibly the white horse hair, that just came out. This is so the brushes can better dry out between shaves. I do not like the idea of getting mold or mildew on these.</li>
            <li> Excellent value.  Lathers very well, is soft (but I wouldn&#x27;t say luxurious), has a good backbone and is great for hard and soft soaps.  The acrylic handle does chip if you happen to drop it. The squarish dimple handle design is not to my liking as I prefer round, my only critique.  It sheds a hair here and there but overall has held up very well.  It&#x27;s made from horse-hair so it doesn&#x27;t contribute to animal cruelty as do boar and badger brushes.</li>
            <li> After a week I&#x27;m still working on getting rid of the smell! Like bad breath x10! I&#x27;m using some deodorizing dog shampoo daily. The brush is very well made. Not losing a lot of hairs. Nothing special though. Like using a big paintbrush. Will stick with badger or boar.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Finally got the smell out! I dared to be happy (silly me.) Opened my med cabinet. A bottle fell out. Crashed onto the brush stand. Sent brush flying. Handle cracked! Welcome to the Truman Show!</li>
            <li> Very nice horse hair brush, already one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush. It came with a strong smell of the rear end of a horse. I got rid of the bad smell in about three days using Dawn detergent, shampoo, and hair conditioner. It is a very soft but scritchy brush. The scritch is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and am very happy.  The handle is comfortable and the bristles are long and work well in producing good lather.</li>
            <li> After reading about horse hair brushes in Liesure Guys Guide to Gourmet Shaving, I decided to give this a try. This is a fabulous quality brush from Spain with bristles that are a bit stiffer than badger but not quite as stiff as most boar brushes. It effortlessly created a thick creamy lather with my Proraso soap and holds enough for multiple passes. I can see that this will probably become my favorite brush. As the book says, more expensive does not necessarily mean better. I have five brushes, two badgers, two boars and this one, all under $20 and they are all just fine. I think this horse hair may just beat the badger.</li>
            <li> Well first off the smell, apon arrival this brush did have an odor as expected, but took very little time to wash that out. This is a natural hair brush so there is no way around that. The brush will hold a ton of water and makes a decent lather. The brush was not too scratchy even from the start so all in all I guess I&#x27;m pleased with the knot. Now, the handle is another matter all together. I&#x27;m not too pleased with the size and shape, just not very ergonomic for me. That I could live with but the fact that it is starting to crack after a month of use real upsets me. I use this brush daily with creams, wash it after each use, and hang it in a stand bristles down after each use. I&#x27;m not sure hom much longer it will be till the handle splits or the knot falls out. So, that being said I&#x27;ve started shopping for a new brush. Probably badger and a different brand for sure. But, I guess for $20 I&#x27;m not out too much. Just disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the appearance and comfortable size of this brush.  It seems like I especially draw to the Vie-Long brand.  I love the horse hair softness and, although I am new to wet-shaving, I am definately a convert and can&#x27;t imagine a nicer brush.  I could, however, build a collection of the Vie-Long brushes.  I have now been using this brush for about two months and have NOT lost a single hair.  I wish I could say that about my head!!</li>
            <li> I thought the only way to go was badger hair brushes -- and I love the ones that I have, but this horse hair brush is my every day favorite.  The hair is a little stiffer than the badger hair brushes and it does require a little more work to whip up a nice lather, but I really don&#x27;t mind the extra thirty seconds or so.  Additionally I actually like that the hair is stiffer as the brush doesn&#x27;t flop around too much and I can actually hold the brush by the handle rather than the two finger and thumb technique I have to use with the badger hair brushes.  An additional benefit is that the brush really works the foam around your face while simultaneously softening/lifting up the stubble in preparation for the shaving.  The face feels good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as durability, I have had mine for some time now and other than a few hairs dropping out in the beginning, the brush is holding up nicely -- more so than some of my other, more expensive brushes.  It does smell pretty strongly at first, but after about a weeks worth of shaving with Proraso eucalyptus oil shave cream, that&#x27;s exactly what the brush now smells like -- very pleasant indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent brush and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I initally bought this just to have a horse hair brush to round out my collection of badger and boar brushes. Since it arrived, this has become my daily-use brush. I absolutely love the way it lathers, especially on harder soaps, seeing as it it slightly stiffer than silvertip badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, you HAVE to clean it properly, it smells like complete garbage! Once I cleaned it, and gave a soak in vinegar water, it takes on the scent of your soap quite rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well, holds enough lather for my three pass shave quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an animal activist by any means, but it is nice to know they don&#x27;t hurt an animals in the making of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s a lather machine but mine has extremely sharp tips. Hopefully they will soften over time. Otherwise a good brush</li>
            <li> Great brush my new favorite, stiffer than badger softer than boar. Did have an oder to it but disappeared after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Vie-Long&#x27;s horse hair shave brush is a quality product! It is well made and looses virtually no hair. It smells a bit in the beginning but the smell fades away after 5 or 6 uses. It holds ample water to face to make a good lather for a nice wet shave. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> after cleaning it to get rid of the smell, worked pretty good. once It was broken in, it produces a good moist lather with my tub of tobs...also very soft bristles comparable to badger. great value for the price!</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible and took days of washing to get it to lessen. I still have not got the stench to go completely away after shampoo, conditioner, dish soap, and shaving soap. It is an ok brush. The lather it creates is good but I still prefer a badger brush. If it did not have the smell I would like it more.</li>
