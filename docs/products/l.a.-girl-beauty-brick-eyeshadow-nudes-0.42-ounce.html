            <li>but when i put them on, i need to put like a lot before i get the color i want because it&#x27;s soo light, and its easy to come off, not even like 2 hours yet</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some lovely eye shadows with subdued colors but golden hues and</li>

            <li>In love with this palette!!üòçüòç such amazing and cute combinations.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Most of the shades are very shimmery which I love, so if you&#x27;re looking for matte, this is probably not the palette for you.</li>
            <li>but if you like natural pinks, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this on Groupon so before I purchased it I said let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I really like most of these colors.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that, as with most metallic shadows, you really have to put it on your skin to see what it will look like versus what it looks like in the container.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift, my friend loved it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Has good pigment but doesn&#x27;t stay long without a primer.</li>
            <li>The neutral shades are really pigmented and go on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to have a soft brown to blend with</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li>Im shocked with how nice these are, the color is good pigmentation is ok</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I completely love this palette the only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying &amp;#34;nudes&amp;#34; instead of browns</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this:)</li>
            <li>This is my first palette</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this.</li>
            <li>I use this more than my naked palette!!</li>
            <li>I received my package a day before it was due to arrive; this I am pleased about!  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>Great colors, and the palette arrived earlier that it was expected</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like this product so much...</li>
            <li>Really powdery and creases even with a primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple and basic and just perfect for teenage girls just starting to learn how to do makeup like me !</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Even comes with a decent brush inside.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t thick and heavy and the color choice is perfect!</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow</li>
            <li>fair, pink skin and the nudes are just too dark and orange for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good one if you&#x27;re looking into more expensive Naked palettes or similar.</li>
            <li>I love this little pallete!</li>
            <li>Such pretty colors</li>
            <li>I was nervous about getting this LA girls pallet, but I will say that I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It does have quite a bit of sparkle to it, more than I usually wear.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with is your average cheap brush.</li>
            <li>It is not an exact dupe for Naked 3</li>
            <li>many matte colors, and the last color towards the end is a purple brown (mostly a dark brown).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But overall I really like this pallet</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for basic makeup, not for professionals.</li>
            <li>Barely pigmented...</li>
            <li>Colors barely show</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there are only 2 matte shades which are the light pink color and white.  </li>

            <li> I completely love this palette the only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying &amp;#34;nudes&amp;#34; instead of browns</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this:)</li>
            <li> This is my first palette</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this.</li>
            <li> I use this more than my naked palette!!</li>
            <li> I received my package a day before it was due to arrive; this I am pleased about!  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> Great colors, and the palette arrived earlier that it was expected</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this product so much...</li>
            <li> Really powdery and creases even with a primer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple and basic and just perfect for teenage girls just starting to learn how to do makeup like me !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Even comes with a decent brush inside.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t thick and heavy and the color choice is perfect!</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow</li>
            <li> fair, pink skin and the nudes are just too dark and orange for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good one if you&#x27;re looking into more expensive Naked palettes or similar.</li>
            <li> I love this little pallete!</li>
            <li> Such pretty colors</li>
            <li> I was nervous about getting this LA girls pallet, but I will say that I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It does have quite a bit of sparkle to it, more than I usually wear.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is your average cheap brush.</li>
            <li> It is not an exact dupe for Naked 3</li>
            <li> many matte colors, and the last color towards the end is a purple brown (mostly a dark brown).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But overall I really like this pallet</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for basic makeup, not for professionals.</li>
            <li> Barely pigmented...</li>
            <li> Colors barely show</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there are only 2 matte shades which are the light pink color and white.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the darker ones were glittery and that doesn&#x27;t really work for me since I usually use those instead of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The colors blend well &amp; are long lasting.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time!</li>
            <li> , I feel like I can work more with using multiple shades to create whatever look I am going for without looking like I applied a crazy amount of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I will go back for the other color palettes.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a subtle look and this really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly shocked - but they&#x27;re quite outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Not really, though.&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li> Not really nude colors.</li>
            <li> That may be other people&#x27;s issue.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before buying and some mentioned that it was hard to get enough pigment.</li>
            <li> Also I feel like the colors when applied are not that dark.</li>
            <li> Have to apply heavy or wet for color payoff.</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to coordinate the colors and know what you should put where</li>
            <li> It has a few Mac colors with sparky ones too !</li>
            <li> There are some matte shades but not many.</li>
            <li> You can mix &amp; match as all of the colors go together, letting you give subtle change to your loon.</li>
            <li> the matte and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, broken pallet</li>
            <li> Sucks bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fair skin and this palette is perfect for me! Even comes with a decent brush inside. Gorgeous shimmer colors that are going to look great during the summer.</li>
            <li> Love the pigments in the colors</li>
            <li> good pigmentation , excellent price</li>
            <li> I love this! Especially for the price. Goes great with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I really like most of these colors. I didn&#x27;t realize the darker ones were glittery and that doesn&#x27;t really work for me since I usually use those instead of eyeliner. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I completely love this palette the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the brush because of the brush if the brush was better it would be even greater then it already it is the eye shadows pop up great on your eyes and I love that they are all nude colors</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet!  The neutral shades are really pigmented and go on so smooth.  My only complaint is that there are only 2 matte shades which are the light pink color and white.  I&#x27;d love to have a soft brown to blend with but I just used another shadow from another pallet. For the price, this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I got three of the color variations of these, and this one is my favorite. this is a really great deal for the amount of colors you get! I also bought a primer and that seems to keep these on all day. I really shopped around amazon for a nude eyeshadow palette, and I am very happy that this is the one I ended up with!</li>
            <li> works great, don&#x27;t even need to put that much on my brush for the color to show. It comes with great looking colors and works great, stays on all day. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter bought this and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love these shades! The colors blend together so well, easy to apply, and lasts all day! Definitely the same quality as the more expensive brands. This was my first time trying &amp;#34;nudes&amp;#34; instead of browns and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great colors, great price.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow collection. The range of colors give you plenty of opportunity to experiment without being &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;. You can mix &amp; match as all of the colors go together, letting you give subtle change to your loon. The colors blend well &amp; are long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this little pallete! The colors are so pigmented and very smooth and easy to apply.. Feels like I bought the naked 3 pallete without spending a lot of money! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the colors stays on nicely</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this pallets no fallout great texture, as good as high-end!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment. Excellent quality. Nice color palette. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Loooove this pallet, definitely use primer with these shadows!</li>
            <li> I loved this palette! This reminded me of the naked two palette. Although the shadows weren&#x27;t as pigmented they are still perfect for me. They aren&#x27;t thick and heavy and the color choice is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the tones in this nude set! It lasted all day with no creases or dulling.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much... colors are beautiful, great pigmentantion but not so creamy... but for the price are very good.. i recomended if you want a nude palette for a good price...</li>
            <li> I originally saw this on Groupon so before I purchased it I said let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s on Amazon. Well it was and it was $3 cheaper!!! The colors are great and a lot of fun to mix.</li>
            <li> Great colors, and the palette arrived earlier that it was expected</li>
            <li> I love these shadows! Such pretty colors and they last a long time! For a knock off of a naked palate, I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> Sucks bad. Doesnt even show up</li>
            <li> Really powdery and creases even with a primer. The glittery shades have a lot of fall out too.</li>
            <li> The colors are so beautiful ! It has a few Mac colors with sparky ones too ! It&#x27;s so simple and basic and just perfect for teenage girls just starting to learn how to do makeup like me !</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It&#x27;s my go to for every occasion. It&#x27;s great for a natural and smokey eye look</li>
            <li> Great colors, lasts for decent amount of time. Got compliments. Have to apply heavy or wet for color payoff. Happy even compared to urban decay named palettes.</li>
            <li> I like it.. Love the colors and shapes..</li>
            <li> Awesome palette I definitely recommend this:)</li>
            <li> This is my first palette and I normally don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow so I wanted a subtle look and this really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about getting this LA girls pallet, but I will say that I was pleasantly surprised! It comes with a few matte colors, along with shimmery colors, and I have found that the colors work very well together. It is not at all powdery on the brush, but you may have to build the color up just a bit. Overall, I love this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors very natural. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! I use this more than my naked palette!! Cant get over the price!</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow daughter loves it for back to school thank you</li>
            <li> Super quick ship,  Beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Love this eye shadows!&lt;br /&gt;Hight quality,&lt;br /&gt;perfect brushed,&lt;br /&gt;Have the matte and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, broken pallet</li>
            <li> You always get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a beautiful palette. I really enjoyed the combo of matte and shimmer colors. Has good pigment but doesn&#x27;t stay long without a primer.</li>
            <li> I wish the pigment was stronger but it&#x27;s a nice palette for the price. All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Good colors was not broke. Packaged very well</li>
            <li> Love this pallette hellllllaa. Ima brunette n have hazel eyes Italian olive skin always been into nude colors for makeup n just love these! Deff recommend if your into nude colors browns light pinks..only thing is I wish there were duo examples of the colors together for different looks!!</li>
            <li> Shadows are really great for the price- but must be used with a primer.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It should be noted that, as with most metallic shadows, you really have to put it on your skin to see what it will look like versus what it looks like in the container. I use an eyelid primer so it stays in place all day. It&#x27;s a good one if you&#x27;re looking into more expensive Naked palettes or similar. It does have quite a bit of sparkle to it, more than I usually wear.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift, my friend loved it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product.  I received my package a day before it was due to arrive; this I am pleased about!  I&#x27;ve been looking for some lovely eye shadows with subdued colors but golden hues and this it!  And of course, you can&#x27;t beat the price!  They&#x27;re as smooth as butter - I&#x27;m pleasantly shocked - but they&#x27;re quite outstanding.  I&#x27;ve heard people compare this to one of the Naked Palettes and while I have never had one (so I can&#x27;t compare) I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this for the meantime.</li>
            <li> Perfect color scheme for my fairer skin. I read other reviews before buying and some mentioned that it was hard to get enough pigment. That wasnt the case for me but I have fair skin with no olive undertones. That may be other people&#x27;s issue. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Barely pigmented... Colors barely show</li>
            <li> Beautiful blendable colors. A great assortment of soft, smooth, longlasting eyeshadows.  Quality product, much better than it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> In love with this palette!!üòçüòç such amazing and cute combinations. Very pigmented! Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Personally I like it I suggest using fix it spray to the brush before applying eyeshadow it helps the eye shadow put more color on the eye</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette. The colors are all great neutral shades and they go on smooth and last me all day. I will go back for the other color palettes.</li>
            <li> For the price this product is great! Although I will say the pigmentation isn&#x27;t equal in strength to the color. SO every shade when applied looks lighter, but personally I like that, I feel like I can work more with using multiple shades to create whatever look I am going for without looking like I applied a crazy amount of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> With a good shadow primer this is a perfect dupe for the naked palette! I LOVE it. The colors came out really good. I absolutely love the first one as a highlight! I would buy it again for sure. The biggest plus is the quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this eyeshadow pallet... It has great pigmentation and very beautiful colors and for that price even better üëçüèΩ</li>
            <li> Love this goes on great for my skin type</li>
            <li> Im shocked with how nice these are, the color is good pigmentation is ok</li>
            <li> The plate came fast, and it&#x27;s very nice. The color is perfect. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and the price is good too compare to the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors on this palette. I love the shimmer effect that it has and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The shadow is nice but I&#x27;m not in love with the colors. I have fair, pink skin and the nudes are just too dark and orange for my skin.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I already had another review, but I decided to update.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush it comes with is your average cheap brush. One of the brush sides came off, but I didn&#x27;t use it often. I recommend using your own brush to apply eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;-I dropped this, and the shadow somewhat got messed up. Not really, though.&lt;br /&gt;-Not many matte colors, and the last color towards the end is a purple brown (mostly a dark brown).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for basic makeup, not for professionals.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but when i put them on, i need to put like a lot before i get the color i want because it&#x27;s soo light, and its easy to come off, not even like 2 hours yet, u need to put on more again, but it looks just like the picture but it&#x27;s cheap so ig that explains the materials</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Every girl I&#x27;ve put this one, they have loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Not really nude colors. they are more brick colors. I was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for the price. There are some matte shades but not many. It can be a little hard to coordinate the colors and know what you should put where but you have options! Most of the shades are very shimmery which I love, so if you&#x27;re looking for matte, this is probably not the palette for you. I will be buying this in different shades!</li>
            <li> I love how pigmented the colors are and also the color selection! It does not fade off and easy to blend. It is not an exact dupe for Naked 3 but if you like natural pinks, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Love this palette. It is more pinks than nude. Very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pallet. But one of the colors turned waxy and It may or may not have been from the brush it came with. Also I feel like the colors when applied are not that dark. But overall I really like this pallet and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend: Yes.</li>
