    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Best Poison Oak remedy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>The results are happy with no break outs and no itching.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It has some great qualities to this soap and the soap helped to heal the rash up quicker and stops the itch.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product that I just ordered 5 more bars!</li>
            <li>Really good product.  </li>
            <li>, I good find that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This soap facilitated the most rapid and aggressive spreading of poison oak that I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>What a surprise to find out it works as claimed and more!  </li>
            <li>honestly time and multi-pronged treatment using this soap has been most successful for me.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing...</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s catching on, the price has increased too and it still sells out everywhere faster than it&#x27;s stocked.  </li>
            <li>nice stuff</li>
            <li>Nothing completely stops the itching of poison ivy exposure, but this soap, when used as directed, is the best product I have ever</li>
            <li>I knew I was going to be touching something that had touched poison oak and was almost out of Tecnu.</li>
            <li>This soap may be more \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, but who cares when you leave the emergency room hopped up on prednisone and antihistamines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you read the directions and leave it on for the 5 minutes each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>The more you use it the more it seems to make the itch and the rash go away.  </li>
            <li>What more to say?</li>
            <li>Mostly TIME is what gets rid of these poisons.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap and use it all the time in the summer.</li>
            <li>It works and the sooner you use it to wash the area -the better.</li>
            <li>Now I wash my legs after ever mountain bike ride with this soap just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap for poison ivy!</li>
            <li>Most topical products don&#x27;t provide very good relief for me.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else works as fast or is as pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>The oatmeal in the bars I&#x27;ve had tends to settle to one side of the bar, leaving one side smooth and more herbal and the oatmeal side better for scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Application of special compounds are needed to quickly and effectively remove the poison.  </li>
            <li>but it has been a huge relief getting through a Shingles outbreak and a bout with Chickenpox.  </li>
            <li>The soap worked well and soothed her rash to make her comfortable.</li>
            <li>I looked online for a soap that I remembered using in Scout camp when I was kid, and found Marie&#x27;s Original Poison Ivy/Oak Soap.</li>
            <li>I washed it immediately with Marie&#x27;s Original, and it didn&#x27;t spread.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of the washes, used all of the ointments and Marie&#x27;s original</li>
            <li>Maries Original Poison Oak Soap saved me from itching to death.</li>
            <li>being said we were pleased with the price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Use it in the shower with cool water.  </li>
            <li>If it works for other folks, great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so lucky.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works&amp;#34; or did I just get lucky?  </li>
            <li>It is most important to use this soap as soon as possible after exposure.  </li>
            <li>I found Marie Original Poison Oak Soap to be very beneficial.  </li>
            <li>right when you need it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the shower, this bar of soap has little chucks in it that felt so good on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I really likes it!</li>
            <li>As someone who gets poison ivy at least a couple times during the summer, (or used to) .I would say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this, I had no idea where it came from and</li>
            <li>Works very well on poison ivy and bug bites!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s evidently worked.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I had poison oak or ivy or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid hiker and this is a must along have just in case.</li>
            <li>I probably would never have bothered trying it years ago except the price was right and there wasn&#x27;t much to lose.  </li>
            <li>This really helped thanks a lot it went away in three days and cured it thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>low expectations other than for it to be a pleasant, pure soap.  </li>
            <li>: I have been reacting to poison oak my whole life.</li>
            <li>I am very allergic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I recently spent an entire day in the yard, giving sumac a good chance to really work under my skin.  </li>
            <li>With lots of pets and animals that get it on their fur and transfer it to us, this is an absolute must for our family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Gently patted on, the oatmeal can be soothing too and does seem to help draw away irritants.  </li>
            <li>I really think it helps.</li>
            <li>Dries Ivy up fast and helps it from spreading.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Soap keeps much longer that way and the whole bar doesn&#x27;t get soggy in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>, I have found it very helpful in conjunction with a prescribed steroid cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li>If u use it correctly, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Medical professionals will tell you there is no topical ointment that will effectively eliminate posio ivy, oak or sumac.  </li>
            <li>It can also be instantaneously soothing for minor irritations, mild burns and to calm the itching and inflammation from athlete&#x27;s foot or dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough the rash showed up, but I washed with Marie&#x27;s Original pretty much every time I washed my hands and within 5 days the rash completely dried up.</li>
            <li>If you are highly allergec as I am.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I finally had to go to the hospital for some powerful antihistamines, and it took almost a month to recover.</li>
            <li>My family uses it often because we are very sensitive to poison oak and poison ivy.  </li>
            <li>Now I am finally getting the better of it using conventional means.  </li>
            <li>Poison oak and other types of skin rash/itch sap needs special attention.  </li>
            <li>I used poison ivy scrubs and lotions but it just seems to slowly clear up old spots while new ones develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if you rub it on twice and clear off the area, will make the skin clear of this problem.  </li>
            <li>have a lot of it growing wild in the 9 acres of our property.</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family as well as friends and visitors have tried it for various ailments with very pleasing results.  </li>
            <li>I had to take off one star for the skin damage, it doesn&#x27;t seem too natural if it dries your skin to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li>My husband had poison sumac on his face the other day and was able to basically have the rash gone in about 2 days due to washing with Marie&#x27;s each time the itch returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found letting it dry on my skin after a cool shower, after using Tecnu rub in the shower, to be the most effective treatment.... plus steroids when I get it real bad.</li>
            <li>Note that it won&#x27;t keep poison ivy, sumac or oak symptoms from totally appearing, but if you wash well several times after exposure, it certainly will minimize spreading.  </li>
            <li>Have used this before after getting into poison ivy and it helped stop the itching and helped dry it up very well.</li>
            <li>You really do have to follow the instructions, which require you to let the soap dry on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It actually dries poison rashes enough that the drying process happens much faster.  </li>
            <li>No other poison oak product out there works.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I could find at the local drug store, but nothing really worked and nothing stopped the itching for long.</li>

            <li> I tried everything I could find at the local drug store, but nothing really worked and nothing stopped the itching for long.</li>
            <li> We have used this soap for a few yrs now, as we live in poison oak.  </li>
            <li> It also seemed to expedite the healing process as she did not suffer from the rash as long as before when not using the soap.</li>
            <li> Ointments will help, but they do not complete the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help other people avoid a similar experience.</li>
            <li> The ivy actually spread to other areas of my arms.</li>
            <li> and it appears to help dry up and heal the rash faster.  </li>
            <li> I wash my exposed skin with it every time I come in from working in the hills, and I don&#x27;t get a single outbreak.</li>
            <li> (the pits of my elbows got very dry, cracked, and</li>
            <li> other thing, don&#x27;t leave the bar in the shower or some place where it can&#x27;t dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, even though bar seems small</li>
            <li> I found this soap helped to reduce the itching from poison ivy but did not work as well as Tecnu Extreme.</li>
            <li> Then washed my body again with Tecnu Extreme.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping it would work as well as it does for other reviewers, but in any event, would still recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have used this when the poison ivy was active and it helped soothe and heal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ever be without at least a couple bars at a time in the house - with an extra one or two to pass along to friends as needed!</li>
            <li> After my gardening day I removed all my protective clothing and gloves and bandana and rubbed down neck to toe with Tecnu before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was all up and down my arms.</li>
            <li> but now we run in and grab the bar of Marie&#x27;s and lather up, wait a few minutes and rinse off.</li>
            <li> A fail of painfully epic proportion.  </li>
            <li> Every time it itched, I would wash it again (a washing usually kept me itch-free for about 4-6 hours).</li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator, break off a small piece to use to keep in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> First off, if you expect your oak to go away using this soap, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find it in stores, I didn;t find it in Los Angeles area.</li>
            <li> , I mean Tecnu.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I got a bad case of poison oak almost immediately.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this bad boy.</li>
            <li> so bad my face was swollen</li>
            <li> Not as bad to get a shot or anything</li>
            <li> We got a horrible case of poison ivy and hope that if we ever get into it again this soap will work lout to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>

            <li> I sent this soap as a gift to someone who had contacted Poison Oak.  I really likes it!</li>
            <li> I found this soap helped to reduce the itching from poison ivy but did not work as well as Tecnu Extreme.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Several people working the wood lines on my property can also confirm.  Long lasting, even though bar seems small</li>
            <li> This review is not reflective of this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Jewelweed is said to soothe poison oak or ivy, this soap also has chunks and abrasives in it that will irritate a poison oak/ivy rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: I have been reacting to poison oak my whole life. I am very allergic. I knew I was going to be touching something that had touched poison oak and was almost out of Tecnu. I went to the hardware store where someone told me this soap was \\&quot;better\\&quot; than Tecnu (which they didn&#x27;t have) so I bought some. After my gardening day I removed all my protective clothing and gloves and bandana and rubbed down neck to toe with Tecnu before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the soap only on my face, washing 3 times. Then washed my body again with Tecnu Extreme. Guess what? Poison oak all over my face 10 hours later. I don&#x27;t have it anywhere else though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really angry that someone would tell people this works, or works better than Tecnu. It may help with the itch, but forget it if you&#x27;re trying to remove the plant&#x27;s toxic oil from your skin. I would like to give this soap zero stars. This soap may be more \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, but who cares when you leave the emergency room hopped up on prednisone and antihistamines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help other people avoid a similar experience. For those of you who like to judge reviews, I can&#x27;t imagine how that is \\&quot;not helpful\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product for poison oak. It definitely seemed to help the rash. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing... My family uses it often because we are very sensitive to poison oak and poison ivy.  I&#x27;ve even used it on parts of my face.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Would use this stuff any time.</li>
            <li> I just bought a piece of land in the mountains of Santa Cruz, California, and discovered that it is covered with poison oak. I got a bad case of poison oak almost immediately. I tried everything I could find at the local drug store, but nothing really worked and nothing stopped the itching for long. I finally had to go to the hospital for some powerful antihistamines, and it took almost a month to recover. I looked online for a soap that I remembered using in Scout camp when I was kid, and found Marie&#x27;s Original Poison Ivy/Oak Soap. I wash my exposed skin with it every time I come in from working in the hills, and I don&#x27;t get a single outbreak. I forgot to wash one time, and a rash appeared. I washed it immediately with Marie&#x27;s Original, and it didn&#x27;t spread. Every time it itched, I would wash it again (a washing usually kept me itch-free for about 4-6 hours). The rash was gone by the third day. I am so happy with this product that I just ordered 5 more bars!</li>
            <li> I have used this when the poison ivy was active and it helped soothe and heal.  I have also used when I suspected that I&#x27;ve been in poison ivy after yard work...and haven&#x27;t had an outbreak since I started doing that.  I don&#x27;t know if it dissolves the oil and allows it to get off the skin, or what, but for me it has worked.  As someone who gets poison ivy at least a couple times during the summer, (or used to) .I would say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> WE used it for years .  Hopefully they have not changed the formula.  We will see this summer. I will update then.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap didn&#x27;t work for me. The ivy actually spread to other areas of my arms. I was so hoping it would work as well as it does for other reviewers, but in any event, would still recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> My mother in law sent this to me several years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the washes, used all of the ointments and Marie&#x27;s original is the only cure that has truly worked.  Note that it won&#x27;t keep poison ivy, sumac or oak symptoms from totally appearing, but if you wash well several times after exposure, it certainly will minimize spreading.  I recently spent an entire day in the yard, giving sumac a good chance to really work under my skin.  Sure enough the rash showed up, but I washed with Marie&#x27;s Original pretty much every time I washed my hands and within 5 days the rash completely dried up. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Marie&#x27;s Poison Oak Soap has made our lives easier! Each year someone seems to find a way to get into poison ivy but now we run in and grab the bar of Marie&#x27;s and lather up, wait a few minutes and rinse off. The results are happy with no break outs and no itching. Great product!</li>
            <li> But must be applied every 5 hrs or the itch returns each time. If you are highly allergec as I am.</li>
            <li> We have tried a lot of poison ivy soaps and this one seems to be the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you read the directions and leave it on for the 5 minutes each time you use it.  The more you use it the more it seems to make the itch and the rash go away.  My husband had poison sumac on his face the other day and was able to basically have the rash gone in about 2 days due to washing with Marie&#x27;s each time the itch returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, don&#x27;t leave the bar in the shower or some place where it can&#x27;t dry out between uses.  The oatmeal on the one side will come off and the soap doesn&#x27;t work as well without the ability to open up the rash to get the soap/lather into.</li>
            <li> Nothing completely stops the itching of poison ivy exposure, but this soap, when used as directed, is the best product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a lot of it growing wild in the 9 acres of our property. With lots of pets and animals that get it on their fur and transfer it to us, this is an absolute must for our family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> What more to say? This soap was purchased to help with the poison ivy rash my wife had. The soap worked well and soothed her rash to make her comfortable. It also seemed to expedite the healing process as she did not suffer from the rash as long as before when not using the soap. Thanks... It did help!</li>
            <li> We have not used it yet. Hope to never have to! We got a horrible case of poison ivy and hope that if we ever get into it again this soap will work lout to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;That being said we were pleased with the price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet about to take it with me to Mt St Helens</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing else like this soap!  Everyone in my family as well as friends and visitors have tried it for various ailments with very pleasing results.  Not only has it soothed poison ivy but it has been a huge relief getting through a Shingles outbreak and a bout with Chickenpox.  It can also be instantaneously soothing for minor irritations, mild burns and to calm the itching and inflammation from athlete&#x27;s foot or dandruff.  The oatmeal in the bars I&#x27;ve had tends to settle to one side of the bar, leaving one side smooth and more herbal and the oatmeal side better for scrubbing.  Gently patted on, the oatmeal can be soothing too and does seem to help draw away irritants.  For especially tender or inflamed spots, though, I just flip to the smoother side.  The first time I purchased this, I had no idea where it came from and low expectations other than for it to be a pleasant, pure soap.  What a surprise to find out it works as claimed and more!  I probably would never have bothered trying it years ago except the price was right and there wasn&#x27;t much to lose.  It was actually a clearance item  Imagine that?  Now that it&#x27;s catching on, the price has increased too and it still sells out everywhere faster than it&#x27;s stocked.  I don&#x27;t want to ever be without at least a couple bars at a time in the house - with an extra one or two to pass along to friends as needed!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!  Works very well on poison ivy and bug bites! A must have in the house for summer</li>
            <li> A fail of painfully epic proportion.  This soap facilitated the most rapid and aggressive spreading of poison oak that I have ever experienced.  If it works for other folks, great. I wasn&#x27;t so lucky.  Now I am finally getting the better of it using conventional means.  By that, I mean Tecnu.  Accept no substitutes!</li>
            <li> This stuff works&amp;#34; or did I just get lucky?  I really think it helps. Have used it for years!</li>
            <li> Have used this before after getting into poison ivy and it helped stop the itching and helped dry it up very well. Would definately recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really good product.  I&#x27;ve used it every time I&#x27;ve been exposed to poison oak and it&#x27;s evidently worked.  It&#x27;s also pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Medical professionals will tell you there is no topical ointment that will effectively eliminate posio ivy, oak or sumac.  Ointments will help, but they do not complete the job.  Mostly TIME is what gets rid of these poisons.  Marie&#x27;s soap is like time travel.  Use it in the shower with cool water.  It actually dries poison rashes enough that the drying process happens much faster.  We keep this on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had poison oak since I got this soap. Everytime I think or know I have touched poison Ivy. I&#x27;d come home and wash the area with this soap and haven&#x27;t had any rashes pop up. I wish the soap was bigger but I can&#x27;t complain since I never get poison ivy anymore. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This really helped thanks a lot it went away in three days and cured it thanks a lot! defiantly recommending this friends</li>
            <li> Love this soap and use it all the time in the summer. Dries Ivy up fast and helps it from spreading.</li>
            <li> Great product. Five Stars!!!</li>
            <li> I ran out of another brand of poison ivy soap (couldn&#x27;t find it) and Marie&#x27;s soap arrived just in time this spring for another poison ivy breakout.  Works very well.  I keep it in the refrigerator, break off a small piece to use to keep in the bathroom.  Soap keeps much longer that way and the whole bar doesn&#x27;t get soggy in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> It is most important to use this soap as soon as possible after exposure.  Poison oak and other types of skin rash/itch sap needs special attention.  Simple soap will not cut it.  Application of special compounds are needed to quickly and effectively remove the poison.  Even if you rub it on twice and clear off the area, will make the skin clear of this problem.  If need be, the next day do the same cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have had poison ivy enough to know that I need a prescription for steroid cr&amp;egrave;me to get rid of the rash.  Anything short of that and it just won&#x27;t go away.  However, prescription cr&amp;egrave;mes don&#x27;t take the itch away.  Most topical products don&#x27;t provide very good relief for me.  I found Marie Original Poison Oak Soap to be very beneficial.  It helps soothe the itch and it appears to help dry up and heal the rash faster.  I would give it five stars, but it is not the easiest product to use.  You really do have to follow the instructions, which require you to let the soap dry on your skin.  Other than that, I have found it very helpful in conjunction with a prescribed steroid cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the shower, this bar of soap has little chucks in it that felt so good on my arms.  I bought every, over the counter product, I good find that didn&#x27;t work.  Maries Original Poison Oak Soap saved me from itching to death. I carry one with me gardening, camping, hiking. I even ordered boxes for gifts.</li>
            <li> It works and the sooner you use it to wash the area -the better. This is the first time I had poison oak or ivy or whatever it was so I wasn&#x27;t prepared. I had to buy the cream and that&#x27;s expensive. Now I wash my legs after ever mountain bike ride with this soap just to be sure. The only problem is that it takes about 3 business days to get this soap, so if you are an outdorsy person buy one in advance to have it just in case right when you need it. It&#x27;s hard to find it in stores, I didn;t find it in Los Angeles area.</li>
            <li> The only thing we can find that works!</li>
            <li> First off, if you expect your oak to go away using this soap, you will be disappointed. I found letting it dry on my skin after a cool shower, after using Tecnu rub in the shower, to be the most effective treatment.... plus steroids when I get it real bad. It helps reduce the itching and provides a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feeling, which helps me to fall asleep. I always recommend to friends when they get the dreaded oak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go shell out $50/oz for Zanfel, which works too, but honestly time and multi-pronged treatment using this soap has been most successful for me. I can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness for cases of Poison Ivy.</li>
            <li> Best Poison Oak remedy. Nothing else works as fast or is as pleasant to use. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Truly hope I never have a need for this, but bought it just in case!</li>
            <li> We have used this soap for a few yrs now, as we live in poison oak.  If u use it correctly, it works really well.  We keep it around the house at all times!</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap for poison ivy!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this bad boy. No other poison oak product out there works. This soap is inexpensive and it actually works. I&#x27;m an avid hiker and this is a must along have just in case.</li>
            <li> I got the soap and bathed with it and also left some on my skin. It has some great qualities to this soap and the soap helped to heal the rash up quicker and stops the itch.</li>
            <li> Well it happened I woke up with poison ivy so bad my face was swollen and I needed to see a doctor for steroids. Not as bad to get a shot or anything but it was all up and down my arms. I used poison ivy scrubs and lotions but it just seems to slowly clear up old spots while new ones develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this product and within days it dried my skin up so much I needed to stop using it altogether since it was actually starting to do damage (the pits of my elbows got very dry, cracked, and bled)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to take off one star for the skin damage, it doesn&#x27;t seem too natural if it dries your skin to the point of bleeding. Don&#x27;t let this discourage you it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I gotta admit it helped the itching but did not help get rid of the poison ivy quicker. nice stuff</li>
