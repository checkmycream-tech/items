            <li>It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this polish.</li>
            <li>I love the China Glaze polishes.</li>
            <li>I have a periwinkle colored shirt (more on the purple side) and</li>
            <li>this polish looks more purple.</li>
            <li>I love the China Glaze brand polish, and I love this color...</li>
            <li>With that said, this is a win-win :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Will buy this brand again. :)</li>
            <li>but the china glaze is more better</li>
            <li>and I love china glaze better  </li>
            <li>my favorite color of the year</li>
            <li>Going to by more of it :)</li>
            <li>This color is probably my favorite of my china glaze collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Color selection is so delightful for both urban winter and beachy summer..</li>
            <li>When I am stressed, I have so many options to lift my mood.  </li>
            <li>Love the brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely matte color, no sparkles.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice shade, however it is not the vibrant color that showed up in the photo.</li>
            <li>It came pretty quickly in the mail and its a great polish.</li>
            <li>Light colors, I get even more time</li>
            <li>Wears well, good selection of colors, but this one dries much darker than it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s real fun on both fingers and toes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this polish it goes on real nice &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I ordered two polishes from them and they came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brand, It&#x27;s always true to it&#x27;s color</li>
            <li>They have a beautiful professional finish and fun colors.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about China Glaze.  </li>
            <li>i like the mint green the best</li>
            <li>I have to say though, this shade is also quite nice, and it is a good quality polish.just not what I expected!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best polish on the market, in my humble opinion!</li>
            <li>Variety is the spice of life and this one is a lot of fun!</li>
            <li>I would really love the shade exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>So pretty and feminine and unique!</li>
            <li>It looks like a deep candy coating lavender, good color saturation, two coats was sufficient.</li>
            <li>but it was exactly true to the bottle.</li>
            <li>Color is absolutely beautiful, although it is a little darker than the picture suggests.  </li>
            <li>I like this color, a pretty periwinkle!</li>
            <li>Looks amazing when used with a dotting tool to create polka dots over a white polish.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;nail polish smell\\&quot; dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had a CG transitions polish I liked and wanted a very similar color that stayed the same whether top coated or not</li>
            <li>This color is less bright, with more gray tones than blue.</li>
            <li>It really pops out and gets noticed!  </li>
            <li>but my favorite thing about it is the relatively low odor.  </li>
            <li>Still pretty just not what was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I also have a periwinkle colored shirt that&#x27;s more toward the blue side</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wearing purple it looks more purple, if you&#x27;re wearing blue it looks more blue.</li>
            <li>I was unsure about it at first</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soo pretty not like any other purple puts on a nice thick coat that dries fast great producct</li>
            <li>Its more of an off purple almost grey after it dries.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color but no matter how many coats of it I put on, it has streaks like the liquid is too thin.</li>
            <li>The color just stood out to me and seemed like such a unique color that I knew I didn&#x27;t have in my collection.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw this color because I have been looking for something similar.</li>
            <li>Looks different on the bottle; more of violet color, but same color when dried.&lt;br /&gt;Dupe</li>
            <li>The formula is just okay, a little runny.</li>
            <li>I love China glaze and have ordered a couple of bottles from amazon in the past.</li>
            <li>The lid wouldn&#x27;t properly shut and the polish was very goopy, like it was old.</li>
            <li>However its far from the colour I was hoping it to be.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very dissatisfied with this company and will not be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li>I have never found a color that required more than one THICK</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want it super dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great quality - I only put on two coats, not top coat, and it didn&#x27;t chip for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Secret Periwinkle is such an eye catching color.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely not impossible to apply, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li>quality - with a decent top &amp; base coat it will last a full week without noticeable chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries really fast compared to other polishes.  </li>
            <li>Its super shiny and one thick coat is all I need and the color is even.</li>

            <li> Color lasts with base and top and is quick to dry.</li>
            <li> Long wearing, and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Let dry...</li>
            <li> I ordered secret periwinkle and the first bottle was defective.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of China Glaze because it is harder to chip.  </li>
            <li> I like China glaze polish because it doesn&#x27;t wear off at the tips like other polishes.</li>
            <li> One thick coat that you would never do with another polish... real thick, so that you have full coverage</li>
            <li> China Glaze is NOT your average nail polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, a dark color like this is going to show chips...</li>
            <li> I had to use a white base coat first to get the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> my little sister wanted it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some complain on here (Amazon) about how it&#x27;s too thin, requires several coats, color is not true, yada</li>
            <li> i got this color and the aqua and mint green.  </li>
            <li> It chipped a little the next day but not enough for me to get truly mad about it.</li>

            <li> I ordered this because it is my daughters favorite color. This little bottle has gone a loooong way!! My daughter will do her nails in periwinkle, then she&#x27;ll take it off and do her nails in another color to match whatever she&#x27;s wearing then she comes home and puts this color back on!!</li>
            <li> i love this  color, it&#x27;s soo pretty not like any other purple puts on a nice thick coat that dries fast great producct</li>
            <li> I like this color, a pretty periwinkle! The formula is just okay, a little runny. But it&#x27;s definitely not impossible to apply, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Wears well, good selection of colors, but this one dries much darker than it looks in the bottle. I wish it were lighter, sigh.....But they make good quality polish. I love their color selection....</li>
            <li> I wanted something cool-based in a purple but I didn&#x27;t want it super dark. I&#x27;m very pleased with the way Peri-Wink-Le turned out. It looks like a deep candy coating lavender, good color saturation, two coats was sufficient. Looks amazing when used with a dotting tool to create polka dots over a white polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, dries glossy, formula is totally perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> Secret Periwinkle is such an eye catching color.  It really pops out and gets noticed!  When I wore this nail polish I got a tun of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Great color, it really is periwinkle.  Depending on what you wear with it, it will appear either bluish or purple-ish.  Love it, it&#x27;s real fun on both fingers and toes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is my favorite nail polish, and a favorite of most of my friends too.  I&#x27;ve heard some complain on here (Amazon) about how it&#x27;s too thin, requires several coats, color is not true, yada yada yada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dispute all of that.  China Glaze is NOT your average nail polish.  Apply ONE (1) VERY THICK COAT.  One thick coat that you would never do with another polish... real thick, so that you have full coverage and there&#x27;s no nail showing through.  Let dry... it dries really fast compared to other polishes.  You&#x27;re done!  No second coat ever needed, and I have about 20 different colors... it&#x27;s been the same with every one!  I have never found a color that required more than one THICK coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on beautifully, dries quickly... but my favorite thing about it is the relatively low odor.  The \\&quot;nail polish smell\\&quot; dissipates pretty quickly.  An hour or two after I paint my nails, I can no longer smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, a dark color like this is going to show chips... touch ups are easy and look great.  I often get a week or more from my manicure, just by touching up.  Light colors, I get even more time from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough great things about China Glaze.  It&#x27;s the best polish on the market, in my humble opinion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had personal service done for me like this from a company ... jennifer called me personally to respond to an email I left the company n she personally took care of my concern n I got my product on time wen I needed ... thankx jennifer :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent and prompt service from this merchant. I like China glaze polish because it doesn&#x27;t wear off at the tips like other polishes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this color. It&#x27;s the best color ever. It only gets 3 stars because even with a basecoat and topcoat it seems to last only 2 days before it&#x27;s chipped.</li>
            <li> I had a CG transitions polish I liked and wanted a very similar color that stayed the same whether top coated or not and this is it!</li>
            <li> Received item on time. I love China Glaze nail colors. I saw this on a you tube channel and had to have it. The color just stood out to me and seemed like such a unique color that I knew I didn&#x27;t have in my collection. I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, but I look forward to wearing it. It&#x27;s a very popular color this season. A small bottle.</li>
            <li> I love China glaze and have ordered a couple of bottles from amazon in the past. I give perii-wink-le 3 stars. It came pretty quickly in the mail and its a great polish. However its far from the colour I was hoping it to be. Its more of an off purple almost grey after it dries. Still pretty just not what was hoping for.</li>
            <li> this color isn&#x27;t my favorite but my little sister wanted it so I bought it for her. It goes on nice and smooth. good polish.</li>
            <li> This color was as pictured, which is hard with blues in a picture.  China Glaze is a good polish, so looking forward to warm weather and using this for pedis.</li>
            <li> Great color to wear with jeans.  Variety is the spice of life and this one is a lot of fun!</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous color and one of the best China Glaze nail polishes that I have ever used. I would buy this color again! I get so many compliments when I wear this polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered secret periwinkle and the first bottle was defective. The lid wouldn&#x27;t properly shut and the polish was very goopy, like it was old. Also it had polish marks on the outside of the bottle like it was used. I emailed them and within days they replied and sent me a second bottle. This bottle too isn&#x27;t as I&#x27;d hoped. Yes it will apply buts its not the usual china glaze texture. It&#x27;s very thin like someone added thinner to it. Overall I am very dissatisfied with this company and will not be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I love the China Glaze polishes. They have a beautiful professional finish and fun colors. This color &amp;#34;Peri-Wink-Le&amp;#34; is no exception. It is a very interesting color. I have a periwinkle colored shirt (more on the purple side) and this polish looks more purple. I also have a periwinkle colored shirt that&#x27;s more toward the blue side and this polish matches it too! If you&#x27;re wearing purple it looks more purple, if you&#x27;re wearing blue it looks more blue. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the China Glaze brand polish, and I love this color... With that said, this is a win-win :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. It&#x27;s probably my favorite China Glaze color that I own. It&#x27;s also great quality - I only put on two coats, not top coat, and it didn&#x27;t chip for a few weeks. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Looks different on the bottle; more of violet color, but same color when dried.&lt;br /&gt;Dupe of Lapis of luxury by Essie which I already own.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind having the same though.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> My nail polish is great, new, and of good quality. Beautiful color. Goes on smooth and clean. Will buy this brand again. :)</li>
            <li> I love this color but no matter how many coats of it I put on, it has streaks like the liquid is too thin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I  thought it was a doup for Essie lipis of luxury  but the china glaze is more better and I love china glaze better  my favorite color of the year</li>
            <li> Love this polish it goes on real nice &amp; lasts a long time. The colors are awesome . Going to by more of it :)</li>
            <li> PROS: Color is absolutely beautiful, although it is a little darker than the picture suggests.  Standard China Glaze quality - with a decent top &amp; base coat it will last a full week without noticeable chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Goes on a little runny - wasn&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;m used to seeing in this brand.  I had to use a white base coat first to get the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> This color is probably my favorite of my china glaze collection. So pretty and feminine and unique! I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish and color!  I had been looking for a color for my toes to match my shellac nails and this is the closest.  Vey nice polish and quality!</li>
            <li> i got this color and the aqua and mint green.  the polish goes on very smoothly.  i like the mint green the best</li>
            <li> China Glaze is a well known brand and is extremely good quality in my opinion. Usually $8-$10 in salon stores, for $4 its a seal! I was excited when I saw this color because I have been looking for something similar. Its perfect color for summer, but I&#x27;d definately wear it any time. Its super shiny and one thick coat is all I need and the color is even. No top coat neeed! I&#x27;ve had contact with the seller and they are very nice. I ordered two polishes from them and they came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is greyish and not bright at all-very disappointed.  Put this on the day I received it and took it off 2 hours later. bleh</li>
            <li> This is great polish. Color selection is so delightful for both urban winter and beachy summer.. When I am stressed, I have so many options to lift my mood.  Color lasts with base and top and is quick to dry. Love the brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very different color I like it.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged and shipped fast! I loved this color and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on as soon as I got it! Perfect spring color!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brand, It&#x27;s always true to it&#x27;s color and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;And with this color in the summer, it pairs perfectly with a summer tan, I always get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Great brand. Long wearing, and sturdy.  This is a very nice shade, however it is not the vibrant color that showed up in the photo. This color is less bright, with more gray tones than blue. I would really love the shade exactly as pictured.  I have to say though, this shade is also quite nice, and it is a good quality polish.just not what I expected! I saw this in another review, after ordering, so I wondered. I would still have ordered it though, if I saw the color it actually is. A medium lavender blue\ gray.</li>
            <li> Very nice polish color.  I am a fan of China Glaze because it is harder to chip.  This is another great product from them.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I was unsure about it at first but it was exactly true to the bottle. It chipped a little the next day but not enough for me to get truly mad about it. I would recommend this to anyone needing a medium-dark periwinkle color!</li>
            <li> Perfect light purple color for spring.  It looks beautiful on and doesn&#x27;t chip for a couple of days.  It&#x27;s a lovely matte color, no sparkles.</li>
