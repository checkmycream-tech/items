            <li>I love, love, love this perfume.</li>
            <li>the scent of the body wash it much more floral.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite from halle.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite perfume, and i love that i got it for such an awesome price on amazon.</li>
            <li>Even I love it on her.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this scent, so I love this scent too.</li>
            <li>I liked the orchid idea as seemed to fit into the color of the year for 2014.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this perfume...</li>
            <li>and I really love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfume to wear when I am going out to dinner with my boyfriend because he just love the way this scent smells on me.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the sample</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet candyish smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is very sweet consisting of violet and orchid.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, which I love, because strong perfumes tend to give me headaches.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I bought smelled nice when I first put it on...</li>
            <li>it is perfect for everyday where cause its not too light or too strong.</li>
            <li>makes a great christmas present!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Beckham Signature...very light flowery scent.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this perfume for a special lady two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to wear on special occasions and so have not worn it for an extended period like all day</li>
            <li>Its sweet and flowery and fruity but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li>I recommend this perfume for anybody who likes to smell sweet.</li>
            <li>Its like this: when you walk up to someone and you&#x27;re wearing it, they won&#x27;t notice it at first, but after a minute they&#x27;re like &amp;#34;You smell really good!&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll love it if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, but smells that pack a punch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the scent quickly disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, love it!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, not too heavy, floral, sexy and not too light.</li>
            <li>my new favorite perfume i bought mine where i work which is walgreens.</li>
            <li>Such a better price than what it costs in stores!</li>
            <li>The scent is so sexy yet classy.</li>
            <li>beacause it has a light girly fresh scent, and is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>so I bought a full sized bottle of Pure Orchid.  </li>
            <li>Great smell but not long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>It is soft and not too strong.</li>
            <li>I like this fragrance very much.  </li>
            <li>When this fragrance first came out a couple years ago, my girlfriend noticed it in a store and tried it out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed I get a lot more male attention when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Came fast, good product, packaged well and neat with a little perfume sample</li>
            <li>I put a little more on than normal, and at first it is strong, but after a few minutes it fades to a good level.</li>
            <li>It subtle but its also unforgettable.</li>
            <li>not sure how good a deal I really received now but all in all I like the fragrance and would buy again.</li>
            <li>After testing it in the store, i have since bought halle berry&#x27;s pure orchid purfume twice.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is because it is so light, it tends not to last all day unless you put on more than you normally would.</li>
            <li>I own hundreds of dollars worth of perfume, but this is the one I keep going back to every single day.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday fragrance to add to your current collection.</li>
            <li>so I do not like it as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I got more than i expected.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I received a small bottle as a gift and fell in love with this perfume!</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I had seen a .5 oz on Walmart for $14 or something and then saw this on here for several dollars less and thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Even when I am walking down the street I get so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li>This scent was appreciated by a 20 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and its not too heavy to use everyday.</li>
            <li>When it finally dies down, it&#x27;s a powdery floral scent that is much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>Even at Christmas time, you only get half of the product and you end up paying more.</li>
            <li>I got the gift set for around 10 dollars, and it was right after my other bottle had run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much stronger than the perfume, and I smell it on my skin all day long.</li>

            <li> though it only last a few hours</li>
            <li> I thought of my mom wanting this as soon as she showed me the empty bottle</li>
            <li> A little goes a long  way.  </li>
            <li> so i have to keep a small bottle in my purse so i can reapply it later.</li>
            <li> The perfume last for about 4 hours, so I suggest you walk with a small one in your purse and re-apply during the day.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not light at all....definitely not for anyone under 30.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to try Halle&#x27;s other perfumes!</li>
            <li> Get this perfume, you won&#x27;t be disappointed ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;ONLY NEGATIVE:</li>
            <li> At least not for the wearer.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see it at my local dollar store in a gift box for 25% off after Christmas.</li>
            <li> Some purfumes make me ill.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not smell like the sample perfume!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought it would smell sweeter than it actually does so I do not like it as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have owned that I used the entire bottle of! I own hundreds of dollars worth of perfume, but this is the one I keep going back to every single day. I love, love, love this perfume. It has a light scent, so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, which I love, because strong perfumes tend to give me headaches. Every time I wear it, it makes me think of cotton candy. It has a very sweet candyish smell. The only downfall is because it is so light, it tends not to last all day unless you put on more than you normally would. I put a little more on than normal, and at first it is strong, but after a few minutes it fades to a good level. I was shocked to see it at my local dollar store in a gift box for 25% off after Christmas. I got the gift set for around 10 dollars, and it was right after my other bottle had run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to add that since the second time, I got the gift set, I tried out the body wash, but it smells nothing like the perfume. It is much stronger than the perfume, and I smell it on my skin all day long. I do not like it at all...the scent of the body wash it much more floral.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this one today (not at amazon) after testing it 3 times on different occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has great staying power and not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> def. my new favorite perfume i bought mine where i work which is walgreens. but i had been eyeballing it for forever waiting for it to go on sale. it is perfect for everyday where cause its not too light or too strong. though it only last a few hours so i gotta keep it with me to freshen up. but this is my favorite from halle. def. a mush buy</li>
            <li> I thought of my mom wanting this as soon as she showed me the empty bottle , boy is she gonna be surprise!&lt;br /&gt;This makes a great christmas present!</li>
            <li> Simply excellent according to Linda L Martin of Anaheim CA. One ounce could last up to 6 months. Bite this!!!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume, and i love that i got it for such an awesome price on amazon. i would reccomend this</li>
            <li> And she loves it! When this fragrance first came out a couple years ago, my girlfriend noticed it in a store and tried it out. She wanted it ever since, and I finally decided to order one for her. When it arrived she put it on immediately and it has become one of her favorites out of all the perfume and body spray she owns. Even I love it on her. It even came with a discount for your next purchase from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation, buy it for her, or for all the women no doubt shopping here, buy it for yourself. Either way, you should be happy.</li>
            <li> HALLE  BERRY ORCHID PERFUME THE BEST SMELLS GOOD STAYS ON GOOD SHE IS THE BEST IN PERFUMES BY FAR!!  U MUST SEE AND SMELL THE PERFUME TO SEE WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!! SHIPMENT WAS ON TIME!</li>
            <li> Great smell but not long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is absolutely breathtaking.  I love it! It is a floral but not a fruity scent.  My husband loves the smell as well! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent, so I love this scent too. Smells great and its not too heavy to use everyday.</li>
            <li> This scent was appreciated by a 20 year old granddaughter.  I liked the orchid idea as seemed to fit into the color of the year for 2014.  And was glad that the giftee liked and uses it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product. It is just the thing that I was wanting and am very pleased with what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume. I originally smelled it on a friend and thought it was warm and smelled like a nice berry jam. On me it&#x27;s leave or take.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it! The scent is so sexy yet classy. I recommend buying this perfume for a special lady two thumbs up. 👍👍</li>
            <li> I love love love this perfume... Its not too strong, great smell, great price... will definitely buy again. Great, great!</li>
            <li> After testing it in the store, i have since bought halle berry&#x27;s pure orchid purfume twice. I like it beacause it has a light girly fresh scent, and is good for everyday use. I would describe it as sweetish floral with fruity undertones. The only downside to it is that i noticed that it does not last all day, it always fades away- so i have to keep a small bottle in my purse so i can reapply it later. Other than that, love it!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, not too heavy, floral, sexy and not too light.I purchased this to wear on special occasions and so have not worn it for an extended period like all day yet so I do not know if the scent is long lasting. I purchased this because I had seen a .5 oz on Walmart for $14 or something and then saw this on here for several dollars less and thought it was a good deal. The only problem is that the .5 oz container that was selling for about $14 on Walmart.com is a larger size container than the 1 oz that I received from here...not sure how good a deal I really received now but all in all I like the fragrance and would buy again.</li>

            <li> I love how this smells! My boyfriend says its like catnip to him and I&#x27;ve noticed I get a lot more male attention when I wear it. That wasn&#x27;t what I bought it for, but its nice to get attention. I bought it because I received a small bottle as a gift and fell in love with this perfume! It smells wonderful! Its sweet and flowery and fruity but not overpoweringly so. It subtle but its also unforgettable. Its like this: when you walk up to someone and you&#x27;re wearing it, they won&#x27;t notice it at first, but after a minute they&#x27;re like &amp;#34;You smell really good!&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll love it if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, but smells that pack a punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY NEGATIVE: it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power. At least not for the wearer. It might be that you get used to it, but YOU don&#x27;t get to smell it all day. I can wear it all day and still get complimented on it, but I can no longer smell it. Might just be sed to the smell by then, but still.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I really love the scent. It reminds me of Beckham Signature...very light flowery scent. It is not overpowering and does last all day. Two squirts is enough. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This perfume is awesome!  I love it! It is soft and not too strong. Yet it lasts all day long! Anxious to try Halle&#x27;s other perfumes!</li>
            <li> Came fast, good product, packaged well and neat with a little perfume sample so  I got more than i expected. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very strong. A little goes a long  way.  The fragrance is not light at all....definitely not for anyone under 30.  When it finally dies down, it&#x27;s a powdery floral scent that is much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance very much.  Some purfumes make me ill.  But not this one.  It&#x27;s not to strong.  It can be worn at work or at the gym. It works for me and it can be a great gift to others.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I buy it often. This is a great everyday fragrance to add to your current collection.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfume to wear when I am going out to dinner with my boyfriend because he just love the way this scent smells on me. Also when I wear this perfume to work my co-workers always ask me what am I wearing. Even when I am walking down the street I get so many compliments on this perfume. The perfume last for about 4 hours, so I suggest you walk with a small one in your purse and re-apply during the day. The scent is very sweet consisting of violet and orchid. I recommend this perfume for anybody who likes to smell sweet.</li>
            <li> I got it as a Christmas gift for my mother and  she loved it, I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! Such a better price than what it costs in stores! Get this perfume, you won&#x27;t be disappointed ;)</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells amazing. I could order it again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and it is cheaper to order it online than it is in the stores! Even at Christmas time, you only get half of the product and you end up paying more. I have also bought some to gift to a friend, and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this perfume about a year ago as I walked through a department store.  I fell in love with the sample so I bought a full sized bottle of Pure Orchid.  Unfortunately, it did not smell like the sample perfume!  The sample had a pleasant scent, and staying power!  The bottle I bought smelled nice when I first put it on...but the scent quickly disappeared.  I&#x27;m disappointed with the product.</li>
