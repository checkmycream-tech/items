            <li>This mirror has worked well in our bathroom, but does work best with extra lighting around it.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived without them for many years.  </li>

            <li>I enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, doesn&#x27;t take up my counter space.</li>
            <li>Good hardware for mounting on drywall is included, if there is not a stud exactly where you need the mirror.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing that I have bought for myself as I can do my make-up with the one side and fix the back of my hairdo with the other and it is more awesome with the light</li>
            <li>just needs more focused/brighter light.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has a light.</li>
            <li>I wish the light was a bit brighter, but I really love this mirror, keeps me from bending of the sink when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>It looks very nice mounted on wall near the vanity.</li>

            <li>Easy to mount.</li>
            <li>I have great natural light in my bathroom</li>
            <li>Came promptly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li>nice little inset mirror, but the light isn&#x27;t very bright</li>
            <li>I love my makeup mirror, it works really nice and the light is very helpful.</li>
            <li>This mirror is built very well, and won&#x27;t suffer from those problems since the extension arm is a very strong two-piece affair instead of the scissors arms on most.  </li>
            <li>The clarity and stability are fine...</li>
            <li>I wish I could put a brighter light bulb in it</li>
            <li>I had to stand way too close to it to make it comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This mirror fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>so I get reflected light either from the window or the vanity lights.  </li>
            <li>The light could be brighter</li>
            <li>The make up light is just what my wife wanted...  </li>
            <li>I have to locate the stud and drill into the wood to secure with 2 wood screws.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it but wishes it had a two stage light.</li>
            <li>Wishes light was brighter</li>
            <li>The swivels are made well and the 3 magnification levels are very useful.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality mirror with a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>Light isnt bright enough to truly see?</li>
            <li>the light isn&#x27;t the brightest but adequate for our purposes.  </li>
            <li>makeup goes in the right place!</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t think that it was bright enough.</li>
            <li>Not always bright enough.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li>It gives the right amount of light and magnification for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mirror and fit into my small space perfectly; however, it is VERY heavy and must be attached to a wall stud.</li>
            <li>The mirror arrived surprisingly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love my new lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror mount is very sturdy, and easy to position.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This was an easy swap as the wiring was already in place and the wall mount was very similar, a 30 minute job at most.  </li>
            <li>This is just too powerful for me.  </li>
            <li>The mirror has a nice finish and the adjustments allow effective use by multiple people of different heights.</li>
            <li>The light is strong enough and the magnification options are helpful.</li>
            <li>My wife uses wall mount mirrors a lot, and most of them the mirror head works loose fairly quickly, or the scissors arms get flimsy or fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Makes every aspect of the beautification routine so much easier!</li>
            <li>My biggest concern is the supporting arm is a bit wobbily.  </li>
            <li>Ok, overall the mirror works.</li>
            <li>I ultimately went with the 7x magnification which worked much better for my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>But the overall construction is good, solid product.</li>
            <li>I primarily bought it for the brushed nickel finish (which is very nice) and the small section with 15X magnifcation.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install and is definitely a quality constructed constructed device.</li>
            <li>The arm extends at the right distance to keep it far out of the way of the sink when not in use, the light is just the right amount, and the magnification is terrific.</li>
            <li>I was very please with the product I received.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with the close up needs of being a woman.</li>
            <li>but I like another wall mount mirror that I purchased in my other bathroom better</li>
            <li>The small 15x high-power magnification mirror built into the 7x side is a handy touch.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have preferred to have a full magnified mirror without the the circular magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>This has resulted in much less backache, and a much better application of eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirros.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Nice brushed chrome matches other bathroom fixtures.  </li>
            <li>I can put makeup on without stretching over the sink to see in the mirror and the lighting is just right for proper application.</li>
            <li>Gets extra hot for no reason</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this mirror and the different magnifications it offers.</li>
            <li>However the lighting is a bit dim and</li>
            <li>I was replacing a 12 year old wall mirror that had been sagging for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I have it mounted on the side wall near my vanity, as there is a window in front of my vanity.  </li>
            <li>No trouble has been encountered with the swiveling of the mirror, despite the fact that there are electrical wires encased inside the arms.  </li>
            <li>My husband installed it in a matter of minutes in the space of our old one.</li>
            <li>Second one I&#x27;  had left first one when we moved.</li>
            <li>The light needs to be brighter and the diffuser less opaque and clearer, instead of the yellow tint.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife for our new home as she had another brand in our prior residence.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I moved into a new home last year.</li>
            <li>I needed the magnification and the light, but the led lighting is about like what you&#x27;d get from a led night light (definitely not enough for makeup) and the little extra magnification mirror is too small to be helpful</li>
            <li>the little mirror at the bottom is useful and the lighting is just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>The mirror cracked in 2 weeks right down the middle.</li>
            <li>The small one is SO powerful</li>
            <li>The light is not bright enough and we use the lights mounted above the sink</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone wishing to bring their mirror up to their face, and not bend their bodies down to their mirror.  </li>

            <li> The arm extends at the right distance to keep it far out of the way of the sink when not in use, the light is just the right amount, and the magnification is terrific.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the product I received.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with the close up needs of being a woman.</li>
            <li> but I like another wall mount mirror that I purchased in my other bathroom better</li>
            <li> The small 15x high-power magnification mirror built into the 7x side is a handy touch.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have preferred to have a full magnified mirror without the the circular magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> This has resulted in much less backache, and a much better application of eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirros.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice brushed chrome matches other bathroom fixtures.  </li>
            <li> I can put makeup on without stretching over the sink to see in the mirror and the lighting is just right for proper application.</li>
            <li> Gets extra hot for no reason</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this mirror and the different magnifications it offers.</li>
            <li> However the lighting is a bit dim and</li>
            <li> I was replacing a 12 year old wall mirror that had been sagging for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I have it mounted on the side wall near my vanity, as there is a window in front of my vanity.  </li>
            <li> No trouble has been encountered with the swiveling of the mirror, despite the fact that there are electrical wires encased inside the arms.  </li>
            <li> My husband installed it in a matter of minutes in the space of our old one.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;  had left first one when we moved.</li>
            <li> The light needs to be brighter and the diffuser less opaque and clearer, instead of the yellow tint.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for our new home as she had another brand in our prior residence.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I moved into a new home last year.</li>
            <li> I needed the magnification and the light, but the led lighting is about like what you&#x27;d get from a led night light (definitely not enough for makeup) and the little extra magnification mirror is too small to be helpful</li>
            <li> the little mirror at the bottom is useful and the lighting is just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> The mirror cracked in 2 weeks right down the middle.</li>
            <li> The small one is SO powerful</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough and we use the lights mounted above the sink</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone wishing to bring their mirror up to their face, and not bend their bodies down to their mirror.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the arm doesn&#x27;t extend out as far as other styles, but it does come out enough to be useful, but it would be easier to use if it extended further.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a makeup mirror in my previous house, however, it was not what I needed for the new house.</li>
            <li> The light is for nighttime makeup only and is pretty much worthless for me.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to use the little inset mirror as the magnification is too strong.</li>
            <li> I think if the base had been at least 1-2&amp;#34; bigger that it would be a little more steady, spreading the load over a larger area.  </li>
            <li> The instructions could be a little clearer regarding the placement of the face plate but got it installed correctly on second try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful moving it around on the swivel</li>
            <li> But I wish they had one of these that was regular on one side and on the other split the difference between the 7X and 15 X magnification on the other side, like 10X on the other side or even the 15 X on the other side.  </li>
            <li> Works well, a little heavy and a little dim.</li>
            <li> This one was half the price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Could be a little brighter  </li>
            <li> The little 15X is bothersome.</li>
            <li> This mirror is acceptable but could use a few improvements.  </li>
            <li> I use it about everyday.</li>
            <li> The installation is easy; you mount a base plate to the wall using anchor bolts first, then attach the mirror to the base plate, so you aren&#x27;t juggling a heavy mirror while screwing the mounting plate to the wall; you just put the mirror over the mounting plate after you&#x27;ve fastened it to the wall, and screw on some decorative caps.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too small.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is fine but the lighting is awful.</li>
            <li> The photos and all descriptions lead you to believe it is hard wired.</li>
            <li> It needed to be hard wired.</li>
            <li> When my eyesight started getting worse with age,  I opted for one of these magnifying mirrors (once I tried one in a hotel).  </li>
            <li> is kinda creepy.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry to have purchased this expensive mirror.  </li>
            <li> Also they fail to advise you of the diameter of the base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love my new lighted mirror.  Husband installed in 20 mins.  Nice brushed chrome matches other bathroom fixtures.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Light isnt bright enough to truly see?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect.  Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> The item is well built.  Sturdy with good craftsmanship and features.  It looks very nice mounted on wall near the vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lighted, mountable magnifying mirror for a while. I was considering one at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond that was $130. This one was half the price and exceeded my expectations. Hubs mounted and wired it up and it&#x27;s perfect. I can put makeup on without stretching over the sink to see in the mirror and the lighting is just right for proper application. Makes every aspect of the beautification routine so much easier!</li>
            <li> both my  husband and I use this product and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This mirror is acceptable but could use a few improvements.  I primarily bought it for the brushed nickel finish (which is very nice) and the small section with 15X magnifcation.  However the lighting is a bit dim and the 15X smaller mirror seems to get in the way when working on the eyebrows.  My biggest concern is the supporting arm is a bit wobbily.  Given its price, the mirror is okay but I like another wall mount mirror that I purchased in my other bathroom better (Rucci 10X wall mount).</li>
            <li> My wife uses wall mount mirrors a lot, and most of them the mirror head works loose fairly quickly, or the scissors arms get flimsy or fall apart.  This mirror is built very well, and won&#x27;t suffer from those problems since the extension arm is a very strong two-piece affair instead of the scissors arms on most.  The mirror mount is very sturdy, and easy to position.  The small 15x high-power magnification mirror built into the 7x side is a handy touch.  My only complaint is that the arm doesn&#x27;t extend out as far as other styles, but it does come out enough to be useful, but it would be easier to use if it extended further.  The installation is easy; you mount a base plate to the wall using anchor bolts first, then attach the mirror to the base plate, so you aren&#x27;t juggling a heavy mirror while screwing the mounting plate to the wall; you just put the mirror over the mounting plate after you&#x27;ve fastened it to the wall, and screw on some decorative caps.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the product I received. The lighting is great...could maybe be a tad brighter. But the overall construction is good, solid product.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality mirror with a nice finish.  The swivels are made well and the 3 magnification levels are very useful.  Installation was simple. I highly recommend this mirror</li>
            <li> Works well, a little heavy and a little dim.</li>
            <li> PROS:  Sturdy, good design (overall) good extension, good magnification.  CONS:  Could be a little brighter  This mirror has worked well in our bathroom, but does work best with extra lighting around it.  The clarity and stability are fine... just needs more focused/brighter light.  Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> The mirror cracked in 2 weeks right down the middle. Gets extra hot for no reason</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Easy to install.  Light is plenty bright for me.</li>
            <li> Ok, overall the mirror works. Just didn&#x27;t think that it was bright enough. And it wasn&#x27;t  a big enough mirror.&lt;br /&gt;  Would I get another one? No!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. Easy to install and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> wife loves it, that&#x27;s very important !</li>
            <li> As advertised, easy to install.  I was replacing a 12 year old wall mirror that had been sagging for awhile.  This was an easy swap as the wiring was already in place and the wall mount was very similar, a 30 minute job at most.  The mirror is nice the light isn&#x27;t the brightest but adequate for our purposes.  It comes with a spare bulb but no mounting hardware.</li>
            <li> I recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a good addition to their bathroom. It serves my  purpose which is to make it easier to apply make-up, tweeze, or see problem areas on facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did not choose to give it 5 stars only because it was not quite the quality of the mirror I used at the resort I visited.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!  The instructions could be a little clearer regarding the placement of the face plate but got it installed correctly on second try. The light is strong enough and the magnification options are helpful. Very good product so far!</li>
            <li> My husband has been on me about getting one of these for years. I finally found one that would work for both of us.</li>
            <li> This is very good mirror, its light up the face even, easy to install and use, my wife love it very much !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for our new home as she had another brand in our prior residence. She absolutely loves this mirror.  The arm extends at the right distance to keep it far out of the way of the sink when not in use, the light is just the right amount, and the magnification is terrific. I highly recommend this mirros.</li>
            <li> It is really a great deal. Very easy to install.........It is great ,you can use the mag side or reg side.. It is very nice..</li>
            <li> nice little inset mirror, but the light isn&#x27;t very bright</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this wall mounted mirror.  The arms could be 1 to 2 inches longer, but that would put quite a lot of torque on the mirror.  I have it mounted on the side wall near my vanity, as there is a window in front of my vanity.  No trouble has been encountered with the swiveling of the mirror, despite the fact that there are electrical wires encased inside the arms.  The size is perfect, and the built in magnifier is wonderful!  I would highly recommend this to anyone wishing to bring their mirror up to their face, and not bend their bodies down to their mirror.  This has resulted in much less backache, and a much better application of eye makeup.  Good hardware for mounting on drywall is included, if there is not a stud exactly where you need the mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine but the lighting is awful. I have a stand-up lighted mirror made by Rialto and it is 4x brighter than this mirror. I can actually see my face while putting on make-up.  This one is well under-lit for a make-up mirror. I wish I could put a brighter light bulb in it but it only takes a 15 watt or lower bulb.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived surprisingly quickly.  I do wish it were larger, but it came as advertised and I like that it has 3 different magnifying powers in the mirror.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have several of these and I love them. makeup goes in the right place!</li>
            <li> This is just too powerful for me.  The small one is SO powerful but it&#x27;s just too small.  I had to stand way too close to it to make it comfortable.  I ultimately went with the 7x magnification which worked much better for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;  had left first one when we moved. Works great.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a great lighted wall mirror.  It was easy to mount, and my wife loves it.  I try not to get too close to it, as my face magnified is kinda creepy.</li>
            <li> The mirror is well constructed and easy to mount.  It gives the right amount of light and magnification for applying makeup.  Also it arrived on time</li>
            <li> As described; my wife is very happy with the product; highly recommend supplier and product</li>
            <li> When my eyesight started getting worse with age,  I opted for one of these magnifying mirrors (once I tried one in a hotel).  Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived without them for many years.  They are GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> The mirror has a nice finish and the adjustments allow effective use by multiple people of different heights. I would but it again.</li>
            <li> My neck and back are saved !  I love putting make-up on again !  I also love that it has a light.</li>
            <li> My wife had been lobbying for a mirror that she could attach to the wall and extend.  This mirror fit the bill.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would have preferred to have a full magnified mirror without the the circular magnifying mirror.  It was easy to install and is definitely a quality constructed constructed device.</li>
            <li> I used to use a double sided travel mirror so I thought I&#x27;d go with a permanently installed one.  Easy to install.  I&#x27;d be careful moving it around on the swivel so you don&#x27;t pull it out of the wall, even with drywall mounts.  I think if the base had been at least 1-2&amp;#34; bigger that it would be a little more steady, spreading the load over a larger area.  The light is for nighttime makeup only and is pretty much worthless for me.  That&#x27;s why it gets 3 stars.I just move it around so I get reflected light either from the window or the vanity lights.  The light needs to be brighter and the diffuser less opaque and clearer, instead of the yellow tint.  That&#x27;s why it gets 3 stars.  I would recommend just getting a double sided wall mounted unlighted mirror</li>
            <li> Great mirror and easy install. The light could be brighter but I&#x27;m not relying solely on it as the mirror is installed next to the bathroom vanity. I would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> This mirror is everything I ever wanted. the little mirror at the bottom is useful and the lighting is just what i was looking for. one of the best purchases i have made from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this mirror and the different magnifications it offers. The light is perfect for makeup.</li>
            <li> Works well.  But I wish they had one of these that was regular on one side and on the other split the difference between the 7X and 15 X magnification on the other side, like 10X on the other side or even the 15 X on the other side.  The little 15X is bothersome.</li>
            <li> perfect just as described</li>
            <li> When I receive it, the box specifications make no mention that it&#x27;s a lighted mirror.  I almost retuned it without opening the box thinking I made a mistake when ordering.  It light!  It&#x27;s great!  Easy to mount and flexible for many heights!</li>
            <li> I wish the light was a bit brighter, but I really love this mirror, keeps me from bending of the sink when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> The make up light is just what my wife wanted...  All the features are excellent. Easy to mount.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry to have purchased this expensive mirror.  I needed the magnification and the light, but the led lighting is about like what you&#x27;d get from a led night light (definitely not enough for makeup) and the little extra magnification mirror is too small to be helpful but still so big it interrupts vision in the bigger mirror.  All in all, a big zero.</li>
            <li> I love my makeup mirror, it works really nice and the light is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy mirror.  My husband installed it in a matter of minutes in the space of our old one. I needed a stronger power.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> We have a similar mirror in our upstairs bathroom, which my wife used. One day she asked why couldn&#x27;t she have one downstairs too. So I got her this one with the lighted face as the downstair bath doesn&#x27;t have any windows. She has been using this and is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it about everyday. Lights up great, and the magnifying makes it easy to put on eye liner just right! Really helps with the close up needs of being a woman. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I moved into a new home last year. I had been using a makeup mirror in my previous house, however, it was not what I needed for the new house. So, my daughter in-law told me about the Jerdon 8.5\\&quot; Wall Mounted Mirror. I have great natural light in my bathroom so the surround lighting in the makeup mirror is just what I needed.  I am unable to use the little inset mirror as the magnification is too strong. Maybe it will work better for those who have not had cataract surgery. I think that is why it doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I like the way I can turn it in just about every direction and tilt in every direction. Very nice feature! I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> The lighting and magnifying are great. It seems durable and well made. It has been great to use. I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, doesn&#x27;t take up my counter space. I can now see to put my makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who where&#x27;s glasses, this is a must.</li>
            <li> Screws would not hold the weight. I have to locate the stud and drill into the wood to secure with 2 wood screws.</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE this mirror!!!!! This is the best thing that I have bought for myself as I can do my make-up with the one side and fix the back of my hairdo with the other and it is more awesome with the light</li>
            <li> Sturdy construction. Who knew that three mirrors would come in handy?</li>
            <li> Good product,  great deal</li>
            <li> The quality, magnification and lighting of this product was very good. Came promptly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it but wishes it had a two stage light. Not always bright enough.</li>
            <li> My husband is in a wheelchair so mounted this so we both can use it (make up and shaving). The mirrors are nice with 2 magnifications.  The light is not bright enough and we use the lights mounted above the sink</li>
            <li> Wife likes it; Wishes light was brighter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror and fit into my small space perfectly; however, it is VERY heavy and must be attached to a wall stud.</li>
            <li> Good product, light could be brighter.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this appliance and this is a second one for a winter home. Works great and does exactly what is needed.</li>
            <li> The photos and all descriptions lead you to believe it is hard wired. Nowhere is it mentioned or shown to have a cord or plug. It comes with a plug that I did not need. It needed to be hard wired. Also they fail to advise you of the diameter of the base.</li>
            <li> Finally I can put on makeup correctly</li>
