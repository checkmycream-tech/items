    <ol>
            <li>and this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best product line for curly hair ever</li>
            <li>Otherwise great!</li>
            <li>definitely a great hydrator!!!</li>
            <li>This is, without a doubt, the best hair cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I was not at all impressed as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>The curls are so beautiful and no frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair was not miraculously beautiful and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>The No Poo also had a great smell.</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li>Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a good no-lather cleanser</li>
            <li>This is a great product but make sure to read the labels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Deva Curl products are amazing for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>All Devachan products are amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just not that amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice alternative to shampoo.</li>
            <li>For me, it seems to work fairly well - haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in how it works compared to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Deva Curl products.  </li>
            <li>Although it may be better for your hair (no phosphates), I&#x27;m not so sure it helps my hair curl.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I went no poo for about 6 months and my hair never felt better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Curl and Care products, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week, and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it more often.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how bouncy it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, so all the reviews I read were hyping up this product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more then pleased with the lack of sulfur in the shampoo</li>
            <li>The top has to be removed from the bottle in order to expend the product instead through the top as it was devised for.</li>
            <li>Seems to me they could come up with something a lot more efficient.</li>
            <li>Great line, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>it looks wonderful and during the weekends when I need my hair to look silky and amazing a quick standard shampoo and blow dry has PERFECT results.</li>
            <li>I even tried going &amp;#34;poo free&amp;#34; using the baking soda recipe for washing my hair, but it never felt very clean.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the low-poo cleanser to be a better fit.</li>
            <li>You hair has to be pretty clean already (1-2 day hair, mine goes til 4-5 days) for this to be effective, since this works best if you only wash your scalp/hair once.</li>
            <li>My hair is about a 2C/3A, incredibly porous, very dry, and I never thought I&#x27;d be able to get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li>Helped to make my hair manageable and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean or curl it any better.</li>
            <li>I have 3b curls that are fine and of light to medium density</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great for my curly, frizzy hair, and my color seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>No-Poo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on my curly hair which is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for the product itself, I pretty much love it.</li>
            <li>Not sure what hair this would work best for.</li>
            <li>need to use alot to feel youre getting your hair saturated and clean.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much body and shine now that I don&#x27;t need any products to make it look full and healthy.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on the fence because of the price, I think that investing in the conditioner and one styling product (LOVE their gels) would be a better way to spend your money, but if you&#x27;re at all in the same boat</li>
            <li>Luckily, the seller was understanding and issued a quick refund.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with regular shampoo and conditioning more often.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product, exclusively, for nearly 10 years and love it.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived with a faulty cap that wouldn&#x27;t allow the shampoo to come out, but Amazon made it right by refunding as they couldn&#x27;t accept a return of an opened cosmetic product.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels more conditioned than it used to when I was using other sulfate and junk free conditioners.</li>
            <li>Makes it manageable and healthy, and just a tiny bit of product does the trick!</li>
            <li>Ive used nothing else consistently for 15 years.</li>
            <li>So overall, feel free to give it a try, but keep in mind that it might not be the real deal.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the DevaCurl No-poo.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I switched to this product about 6 months ago, thanks to my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the citrus scent</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to with the DevaCurl products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans the hair very well and helps to save my color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for months now, and I love the whole system I use (this, the conditioner, and generally one of the gels, occasionally the cream).</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t understand why it looks so different from the original.  </li>
            <li>The no poo and conditioner left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Now that I know I can buy it on Amazon for less than the manufacture I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li>Like the other posters, I have to say I&#x27;m not 100% sure this is the actual real product.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair that is easily weighed down with conventional hair products.</li>
            <li>No matter how little or how much I used, my hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very straight, very thin naturally light colored hair that&#x27;s dyed natural black.</li>
            <li>These work so well on naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The absolute only problem I have with this product is its name.</li>
            <li>I have been using Deva products for nearly 5 years.</li>
            <li>I went to a Deva Curl professional &amp; she talked me out of shaving my head.</li>
            <li>After reading that DevaCare No-Poo doesn&#x27;t contain the agents that strip hair of its natural oils, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>You definitely have to rotate it with LoPoo or something else after the first couple of months, though, or else your hair always looks greasy (and my tends toward dry as a whole.)  </li>
            <li>There was no difference before or after washing -- my hair still felt heavy, looked greasy, and didn&#x27;t even smell clean.</li>
            <li>Ive only used this twice so far and my hair has been softer and curlier than ever!</li>
            <li>shampoo does not leave any residue behind and brings curly hair to life :)</li>
            <li>I felt like I wasn&#x27;t using enough, but if you use too much it weighs your hair down and it doesn&#x27;t curl.</li>

            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I still use this one though if my hair is particularly dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry and course.</li>
            <li> My hair is still porous and dry, but I dye it often, so I guess that&#x27;s just how things are going to be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry scalp and even after I go 3 days without washing, dry scalp isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I was told to purchase this product, as I have color treated, dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I can use on my daughter&#x27;s tight curls along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil and Shea Butter, by Organix, does a better job, and is less expensive!</li>
            <li> I was -frustrated after 25 years of not being able to control my hair, despite trying everything else under the sun, oil treatments, protein, no-poo, ACV, and on and on-</li>
            <li> I might switch to the other one in summer because that&#x27;s when I want to feel a bit cooler after my showers, but for now I&#x27;ll stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to health issues I was losing my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to the lack of suds we are so use to in other products</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from my local salon, but saw it on Amazon for a lower price and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and can not wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair that is really thick and wavy and gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd and ineffective combination.</li>
            <li> Less hair falls out when I&#x27;m shampooing it.</li>
            <li> so perhaps this just does not clean that well.</li>
            <li> When I use both the shampoo and conditioner together it is too heavy, even if I use less.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little heavy on thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it not as heavy.</li>
            <li> While it leaves my hair heavy and a bit oily to the touch</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes very little lather, just what I need.</li>
            <li> Even if I used this twice it leaves my scalp dirty, yet leaves my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously, guys, your team can come up with something that doesn&#x27;t evoke thoughts of feces when you read the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit I have a hard time washing my hair with a product that does not suds up!</li>
            <li> I never really liked my curls until I began using this product!  </li>
            <li> I have lots of wavy, but rather thin, hair</li>
            <li> Tired of being scammed........</li>
            <li> Maybe I have the wrong type of hair for this product (thick and wavy), but this product was a fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for what it is</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Much prefer the DevaCurl No-poo. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this is the best product I have ever used. Now that I know I can buy it on Amazon for less than the manufacture I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li> This is a good no-lather cleanser but it&#x27;s a little heavy on thinner hair. I have lots of wavy, but rather thin, hair and I&#x27;ve found the low-poo cleanser to be a better fit. I still use this one though if my hair is particularly dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I continue to use it.  I am disapointed with the scent. I prefer my shampoos or \\&quot;no poos\\&quot; to have a prettier fragrance.  It does get the job done I suppose.  It&#x27;s not harsh on my curly hair which is good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but make sure to read the labels. The creamier bottle helps to keep a brassy color in your hair.</li>
            <li> need to use alot to feel youre getting your hair saturated and clean. like the feel of my hair when used but probable cannot afford to keep buying</li>
            <li> I love all the Deva Curl products.  Have tried shampoo (No Poo), conditioner, and gel.  These work so well on naturally curly hair.  Makes it manageable and healthy, and just a tiny bit of product does the trick!</li>
            <li> Although it may be better for your hair (no phosphates), I&#x27;m not so sure it helps my hair curl.  Argan Oil and Shea Butter, by Organix, does a better job, and is less expensive!</li>
            <li> I like the concept of no-poo but don&#x27;t care for this product.  No matter how little or how much I used, my hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product about 6 months ago, thanks to my hairdresser.  I love the scent, it&#x27;s great for my curly, frizzy hair, and my color seems to last longer.</li>

            <li> I have 3b curls that are fine and of light to medium density and this doesn&#x27;t clean well. I use mixed chicks leave-in so perhaps this just does not clean that well. Even if I used this twice it leaves my scalp dirty, yet leaves my hair dry. It&#x27;s an odd and ineffective combination. Not only that, but my hair lasts fewer days between washes. You hair has to be pretty clean already (1-2 day hair, mine goes til 4-5 days) for this to be effective, since this works best if you only wash your scalp/hair once.</li>
            <li> Best product line for curly hair ever</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to shampoo. Helped to make my hair manageable and easy to comb. The No Poo also had a great smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I can use on my daughter&#x27;s tight curls along with the conditioner. The curls are so beautiful and no frizzy.  Must use their microfiber towel also!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased another bottle since this one. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean or curl it any better.</li>
            <li> does well with my curly hair and I really like the citrus scent</li>
            <li> Product is different in consistency and smell.  Does not perform the same and the results have not been favorable on my hair.  Believe this is a counterfeit product or tampered product that is in a DevaCare bottle.  Tired of being scammed........</li>
            <li> Deva Curl products are amazing for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does not leave any residue behind and brings curly hair to life :)</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and can not wash my hair everyday.This shampoo makes very little lather, just what I need. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry and course.</li>
            <li> The absolute only problem I have with this product is its name. Seriously, guys, your team can come up with something that doesn&#x27;t evoke thoughts of feces when you read the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCare No-Poo is fantastic. I&#x27;ve used both the Curl and Care products, and this one is my favorite. Mainly because the tingly minty-ness is less in the DevaCare version. I might switch to the other one in summer because that&#x27;s when I want to feel a bit cooler after my showers, but for now I&#x27;ll stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the product itself, I pretty much love it. I don&#x27;t think it is absolutely essential for a routine, but I do like having it around. After using it, my hair feels more conditioned than it used to when I was using other sulfate and junk free conditioners. It&#x27;s pretty impressive. I use it about once a week, and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it more often. You really don&#x27;t need to with the DevaCurl products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for months now, and I love the whole system I use (this, the conditioner, and generally one of the gels, occasionally the cream). My hair is about a 2C/3A, incredibly porous, very dry, and I never thought I&#x27;d be able to get rid of the frizz. With my routine with DC products, I finally have conquered the frizz. My hair is still porous and dry, but I dye it often, so I guess that&#x27;s just how things are going to be. Speaking of dying my hair, I color it red and this product does not seem to cause fading. The Care line is marketed for dyed hair according to the salon I initially bought the products from, so it lives up to its name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence because of the price, I think that investing in the conditioner and one styling product (LOVE their gels) would be a better way to spend your money, but if you&#x27;re at all in the same boat I was -frustrated after 25 years of not being able to control my hair, despite trying everything else under the sun, oil treatments, protein, no-poo, ACV, and on and on- I cannotrecommend this entire line enough.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did nothing for my hair. There was no difference before or after washing -- my hair still felt heavy, looked greasy, and didn&#x27;t even smell clean. Maybe I have the wrong type of hair for this product (thick and wavy), but this product was a fail. Luckily, the seller was understanding and issued a quick refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the conditioner. I have mixed hair that is really thick and wavy and gets frizzy. The no poo and conditioner left my hair feeling clean. I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry scalp and even after I go 3 days without washing, dry scalp isn&#x27;t an issue. Less hair falls out when I&#x27;m shampooing it. Will definitely continue to use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; cleanser has eliminated my scalp issues - who knew, I was allergic to shampoo!</li>
            <li> Cleans the hair very well and helps to save my color.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone with curly or wavy hair. Does not strip hair of moisture. Might take some getting used to as it does not lather. Great line, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have straightish frizzyish hair and this shampoo along with the conditioner helps a lot.  You definitely have to rotate it with LoPoo or something else after the first couple of months, though, or else your hair always looks greasy (and my tends toward dry as a whole.)  Otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I was told to purchase this product, as I have color treated, dry curly hair. I admit I have a hard time washing my hair with a product that does not suds up! I felt like I wasn&#x27;t using enough, but if you use too much it weighs your hair down and it doesn&#x27;t curl. Overall I would not buy it again. When I use both the shampoo and conditioner together it is too heavy, even if I use less. Not sure what hair this would work best for. I am mixing the shampoo with regular shampoo so I get some suds. Makes it not as heavy.</li>
            <li> All Devachan products are amazing. Ive used nothing else consistently for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this twice so far and my hair has been softer and curlier than ever! I love the smell and how bouncy it makes my hair. definitely a great hydrator!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> I never really liked my curls until I began using this product!  The book - Curly-Girl explains it all.  If you have curly hair, this product is a must!</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva products for nearly 5 years. Due to health issues I was losing my hair. I went to a Deva Curl professional &amp; she talked me out of shaving my head. Under her expertise &amp; the Deva products my hair has come back, reached my shoulders &amp; my heart. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair that is easily weighed down with conventional hair products. Everything I tried seemed to flatten my hair or leave it oily.  I even tried going &amp;#34;poo free&amp;#34; using the baking soda recipe for washing my hair, but it never felt very clean.  After reading that DevaCare No-Poo doesn&#x27;t contain the agents that strip hair of its natural oils, I decided to try it.  This is, without a doubt, the best hair cleanser I have ever used.  My hair has so much body and shine now that I don&#x27;t need any products to make it look full and healthy.  It is my only hair product now.</li>
            <li> Ok, so all the reviews I read were hyping up this product but it&#x27;s just not that amazing. My curly hair was not miraculously beautiful and frizz-free. I had better luck with regular shampoo and conditioning more often. It&#x27;s too expensive for what it is and I was not at all impressed as I thought I would be. Overall, you don&#x27;t need it. You can do the job with regular</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, exclusively, for nearly 10 years and love it. It takes some getting use to the lack of suds we are so use to in other products but I&#x27;m more then pleased with the lack of sulfur in the shampoo that is so drying to curly hair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is the inept bottle it is distributed in. The top has to be removed from the bottle in order to expend the product instead through the top as it was devised for. Seems to me they could come up with something a lot more efficient.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very straight, very thin naturally light colored hair that&#x27;s dyed natural black. I wash my hair daily throughout the work week with this. While it leaves my hair heavy and a bit oily to the touch it looks wonderful and during the weekends when I need my hair to look silky and amazing a quick standard shampoo and blow dry has PERFECT results.</li>
            <li> I have curly, wavy, somewhat frizzy hair.  This shampoo cleans without drying out my hair, and calms the frizz.  The bottle arrived with a faulty cap that wouldn&#x27;t allow the shampoo to come out, but Amazon made it right by refunding as they couldn&#x27;t accept a return of an opened cosmetic product.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Like the other posters, I have to say I&#x27;m not 100% sure this is the actual real product.  I usually buy this from my local salon, but saw it on Amazon for a lower price and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The color and scent are off.  For me, it seems to work fairly well - haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in how it works compared to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  However, I don&#x27;t understand why it looks so different from the original.  So overall, feel free to give it a try, but keep in mind that it might not be the real deal.</li>
