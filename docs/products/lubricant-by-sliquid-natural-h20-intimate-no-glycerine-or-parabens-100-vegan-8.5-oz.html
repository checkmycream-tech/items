    <ol>
            <li>Best non-toxic lubricant on the market.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great for its intended purpose for both husband and wife.</li>
            <li>Its great</li>
            <li>Product is good, works great no irritation at all</li>
            <li>Did not, itself, cause irritation, however not having good lube might.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good price and very good clean product!  </li>
            <li>I love this lube!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely my favorite one I have tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, a really enjoyable lube.</li>
            <li>What is not to love.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and is what you would expect from Sliquid, but it dries up much faster than the thicker liquid meant for anal penetration.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Still a great product, but might be better suited to solo sessions, due to the need to reapply more often.</li>
            <li>This is paraben and glycerine free.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic feel.</li>
            <li>but Smoov is a better value right now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of friendly materials and works well.  </li>
            <li>Can dry fairly quickly but really does the best job.  </li>
            <li>The complete naturalness of it makes it ideal from the pov of my lovers, and it has a completely neutral taste, so oral sex isn&#x27;t discouraged</li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural and amazing.</li>
            <li>Great lubricant if you are sensitive to a lot of additives and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quick but very useful.</li>
            <li>When I opened the envelope the top had clearly been damaged in shipping and the envelope was full of lube.  </li>
            <li>Essentially it feels very much like real lubrication from a real woman&#x27;s yoni or from my own pre-cum, except there can be quite a bit more of it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it because it is glycerin free and thus a real life saver for sensitive women!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does have a tendency to coagulate if not mixed with your own wetness or spit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for those who get yeast infections from glycerin based products.</li>
            <li>Great for those  prone to infections by certain chemicals in other lubricants.</li>
            <li>This feels ridiculously natural on the skin but also evaporates away fairly fast requiring more frequent application.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So, you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>That was not such a big deal until I inspected the damaged cap a bit and saw that it had a pubic hair somehow threaded through the crack and out the top hold of the cap where the lube is supposed to come</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>works and no nasty side effects like you can get from less natural products.</li>
            <li>dry really quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really into that, but sliquid makes a different product with more hold specifically for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>It does dry up quickly if not in contact with other natural sources of lubrication, which does not make it ideal for anal play.  </li>
            <li>This product is all natural and doesn&#x27;t stain your linen - will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low...</li>
            <li>how is it that a NEW product that is intended for internal use does NOT have a safety seal and somehow has a hair inside the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This works, but does not last long.</li>
            <li> Does not last long, leaves a strange residue, not particularly lubricious.</li>
            <li> Just add a bit of water to enhance the lube when it starts to dry out.</li>
            <li> Both are US based companies and both dry without tacky.  </li>
            <li> its all natural and water based just to thick my only gripe</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Does what it says and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Works well, if you&#x27;re going for a long time you can just add a little water to slick things up again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t too sticky or messy and I came across this product.</li>
            <li> its alight it a bit to thick for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have some of the bad chemicals found in other lubes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel artificial or synthetic at all.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt leave and stickiness and doesnt taste bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so disgusting that I will not be doing business with this supplier</li>
            <li> No smell or nasty residue.  </li>

            <li> Product is good, works great no irritation at all but I use a lot. I never tried to add water as suggested!</li>
            <li> Best non-toxic lubricant on the market. I have searched high and low... this is one we&#x27;re sticking with and I highly recommend it! Simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> Good price and very good clean product!  A little goes a long way!  So, you don&#x27;t need much.  No scent, which I like.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else.  Can dry fairly quickly but really does the best job.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t have some of the bad chemicals found in other lubes.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Got this after recommendation from physical therapist. This is paraben and glycerine free. I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is all natural and amazing. Just add a bit of water to enhance the lube when it starts to dry out.</li>

            <li> Umm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this a padded envelope.  When I opened the envelope the top had clearly been damaged in shipping and the envelope was full of lube.  That was not such a big deal until I inspected the damaged cap a bit and saw that it had a pubic hair somehow threaded through the crack and out the top hold of the cap where the lube is supposed to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how is it that a NEW product that is intended for internal use does NOT have a safety seal and somehow has a hair inside the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so disgusting that I will not be doing business with this supplier any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part:  It&#x27;s been over a week and no one responds to my emails for a return/refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay the heck away from these guys.</li>
            <li> Great for its intended purpose for both husband and wife.</li>
            <li> its alight it a bit to thick for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;It was affordable&lt;br /&gt;It dry really quickly so it gets 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;I like KY Ultra jelly  so to me its like night and day&lt;br /&gt;I like that its all natural and water based just to thick my only gripe</li>
            <li> This works, but does not last long. Should keep in mind to regularly re-apply.</li>
            <li> Does not last long, leaves a strange residue, not particularly lubricious. Did not, itself, cause irritation, however not having good lube might.</li>

            <li> What is not to love.  It&#x27;s made of friendly materials and works well.  It&#x27;s very natural feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t get too sticky since it is water based.  It does dry up quickly if not in contact with other natural sources of lubrication, which does not make it ideal for anal play.  I&#x27;m not really into that, but sliquid makes a different product with more hold specifically for that purpose.</li>

            <li> Good stuff. Dries pretty quick but very useful. No smell or nasty residue.  Washes off easily. Does it&#x27;s job though.</li>
