            <li>I have lots of fine, short hair and this styling mousse does it for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>&amp; I live it.  </li>
            <li>my new hair stylist recommended that I get this</li>
            <li>This product must have been on the shelf too long because it didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>This product beats all others for helping naturally curly hair stay styled.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert, in the country, so the only way to get it was to order from the manufacture!</li>

            <li> Have used this styling product for years. The bottle I ordered this time is not as foaming as previous bottles. Very disappointed in product. Don&#x27;t know if they changed product  but not the same.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased, as was not informed that this is their old formula and can, and no longer available--But this is what I wanted, but I got the new formula, and even different kind of can and don&#x27;t like it--basically this is false advertising!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 4 yrs. &amp; I live it.  I have thin fine hair, it gives me a &amp;#34; natural&amp;#34; manage ability. I live in the desert, in the country, so the only way to get it was to order from the manufacture! I love it!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product I have used for my curly hair. It came quickly in the mail also</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a stronger hold but I like it.</li>
            <li> This product must have been on the shelf too long because it didn&#x27;t smell right. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years partly because it smells so good. There is just a hint of the tropical scent but mostly smells like window cleaner. I haven&#x27;t tried the second container yet, but hope it smells better!</li>
            <li> This mousse balances hold and softness, without drying. I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different mousses and spent a lot of money trying to find the right product for my hair, but always come back to Eufora. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair like others and no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Eufora line of hair products for several years. I get good results with the whipped formation. I can use it for a styled look or more natural. Never too stiff or sticky.</li>

            <li> This product adds fullness for fine hair and helps reduce frizz. I have tried lots of styling formulas and this is the best!</li>
            <li> This product beats all others for helping naturally curly hair stay styled.  Next day you just spritz with spray and volia you look great again. Happy to find on Amazon. I trudged to beauty product outlets and no ones carries it. Thumb&#x27;s up Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the product and what it does to my natural curls. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it seems to be the only Eufora product that isn&#x27;t Amazon prime. I&#x27;m a procrastinator and usually wait until the last few days of my current bottle running out to order it. 2 day shipping would be ideal with a hair product.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this mousse but I need a product that offers a firmer hold; I was introduced to this brand by a hairdresser I went to only to style my hair for a wedding. Of course, it works well for her. I did notice that she sprinkles a styling powder into the mousse before she used it in my hair. I&#x27;d prefer to buy a firmer hold product requiring less fuss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  I like it because it is very light but still works well.</li>
            <li> This styling solution is just what it says it is.  It actually seems to make your hair thicker and with more body.  I will buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Great product but pricey</li>
            <li> This stuff comes out like a mouse but INSTANTLY turns to a liquid.  Hard to distribute through hair :(</li>
            <li> I have used the best of the best and am now sold on this product.  I have great volume and hold accompanied by soft comb through flexibility and bounciness.</li>
            <li> my new hair stylist recommended that I get this and I&#x27;m super glad I did. I have long, wavy, and frizzy hair normally, but after drying my hair and putting some of this fabulous stuff in it, it looked amazing! its light weight and it actually conditions your hair as well as keep it held through the day. really great product!</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair to retain style throughout  the day.</li>
