            <li> I own a tanning salon and have tried several spray tan solutions.  Nothing compares to Norvell One.  With this product, mistakes are few and the results are great each and every time.  NO ONE has ever turned an undesireable color.  With Norvell One, The longesst the product stays on is three hours, and the client can shower.  Color develops within a few hours and looks natural.  I have many repeat customers, much more than I did using other solutions.  Well worth it....</li>
            <li> Norvell is the best tanning product out there! You will be brown not orange!</li>
            <li> Color is amazing! I like that you don&#x27;t need to keep it on for very long and I spray myself once a week</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning solution ever. It gives a very natural looking tan and you only have to leave it on 3 hours. I highly recommend this solution over all others.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. I like that u can pick your level of darkness. 1 hour for a light tan or you can leave it on for up to 3 hours for a longer lasting golden brown tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Anything about this product but I love it. I have done several tans with it and love the way it looks and wears. Will Definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> As long as you rinse off within the suggested time frame, this gives great color!!  I love how quickly it works!</li>
            <li> Loved the color and the convenience of only having to wear it for 3 hours before showering.&lt;br /&gt;But fades uneven in 2 days and very hard to get off</li>
            <li> This is too lite of a color for me. The tan only looked good right after the client was sprayed then you never noticed it. Ordered another Norvell product in hopes that it will have better results.</li>
            <li> This gave decent color and is definitely quick producing. It is sticky and took a bit longer to dry, but again, the color is nice. It didn&#x27;t last as long as some others, but it produces the desired effect. My daughters wanted it for prom. It fit the purpose. The color is a nice brownish-tan, not at all orange. It did wear off well, no peeling or patchiness, not even around the elbows or knees. It did take about 25 minutes before it fully dried without being tacky on the fingertips. Putting them in front of a floor fan helped.</li>
            <li> I have 4 different Norvell Solutions and this Rapid ONE is the best color yet i have purchased!! My clients absoutly love it! i HIGHLY recommend this to all you spray tan techs!!</li>
            <li> Was hardly noticable. Left it on three plus hours and it still wasn&#x27;t like it was advertoded to work. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> As a professional, I have tried many many different solutions, this one is the most natural and the best color</li>
            <li> the color is gorgeous with a tiny bit of shimmer - just a dusting... clients love the color straight after the airbrush and 3 hours later they are delighted with the absolute absence of orange and the fact that they can shower in half the time!</li>

            <li> great color with no harsh smell and long lasting!  Very convenient for my clients to have the 1 hour option.</li>
            <li> BEST color. Long lasting. Doesn&#x27;t smell awful. I leave it on for 3 hours and it turns my skin a beautiful golden brown -- not orange. I LOVE it</li>
            <li> This was my 1st time using a Norvell product. The color was great but it faded drastically in 24 hours. By 3 days it was completely gone. I had to give free tans to 2 clients because the qere not satisfied.  I&#x27;ll stick to Total Eclipse by celestial bronze.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this tan and you don&#x27;t have to wait long to wash off. 3 hours, rinse, and the morning after beautiful tan!! Great product</li>
            <li> great color, not tacky drys fast. Great looking natural tan in 3 hours! LOVE IT so much and so do my clients!</li>
            <li> I bought this and I have been spray tanning for a long time and have always used the Norvell products but now I am hooked on this one.  I like that I can get the same results in 3 hours along with a darker tan that lasts longer!  No more waiting, stickiness and going to bed uncomfortable!  I will be ordering again soon!  I highly recommend.  I should say it goes a long way so don&#x27;t overspray and don&#x27;t leave on for longer than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Super great product. Super fast shipping</li>
