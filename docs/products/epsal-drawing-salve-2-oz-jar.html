            <li>This stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a great drawing salve with many uses.</li>
            <li>I learned of this product MANY years ago!  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find it!</li>
            <li>Since receiving the epsal, I can say that my homemade version worked WAY better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially effective on large pimples that are swollen below the surface.</li>
            <li>Unbeknownst to me, the tip of the rose thorn was still under my skin.</li>
            <li>Good to know :)</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and the only thing we&#x27;ve ever used for drawing out slivers etc.</li>
            <li>I was further impressed because it was supposed to be so many days to ship</li>
            <li>glad i found it.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m ordering more for me and some for all grandchildren.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Many factors could play into that.  </li>
            <li>i have used this product before and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I find the salve is more convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It drew out two cysts and made my life a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I would and have told other people about the wonderful relief that comes from using Epsal Drawing Salve.</li>
            <li>Again, VERY WELL PLEASED by Amazon.com again!</li>
            <li>and I get a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I actually taught my mother something.</li>
            <li>just like I remember it, quick and easy to use, just rub it on a splinter and wait for the results.</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be available anymore since it was so long ago; I was thrilled to be able to locate it online, since it was no longer available in the pharmacy where I originally purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most potent one can find as far as drawing salves are concerned.</li>
            <li>Very effective, yet gentle on sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rub it in, apply it thickly for best sucess.</li>
            <li>I used this product only once and had good results the drawing salve seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I don&#x27;t like buying things that don&#x27;t list ingredients, but really wanted to try this on a boil, and on my daughter who needs the magnesium...</li>
            <li>Not a bad product though.</li>
            <li>I cannot find over the counter any product that works as well as Epsal for its quick drawing power.  </li>
            <li>This cream works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work nearly as quickly.  </li>
            <li>The seller got it to us quickly.</li>
            <li>Very effective for all slivers, foreign objects stuck in skin and the like.  </li>
            <li>but, while I was waiting for replies, and waiting for it to come in the mail, I made an ointment of my own (because it was taking a while, and I had a boil) out of Epsom salts, a tiny bit of some lotion I had laying around, and lecithin.</li>
            <li>I will try it again in the future for other things but for now I&#x27;m not that impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li>I remember the black tar drawing salve my mom used on me many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>Recently I had another boil which prompted me to order more as I was almost out.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what the name says &amp;#34;draws&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li>YOUR MARRIED TO A TIM ALLEN</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my old jar of drawing salve, but it sort of works to clean out a pimple or something like that.</li>
            <li>Before using the salve, I was training myself to keep the afflicted finger out of harm&#x27;s way, which wasn&#x27;t easy since it was the middle finger on my dominant hand and was still getting zapped about 6 times per day.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>and we received it much quicker than stated.</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 3 days now and can absolutely tell the difference.</li>
            <li>This ointment really works.  </li>
            <li>Really helps  with pimples proved it to to them</li>
            <li>A time honored product which gets modern results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>Healing was fast and seemingly miraculous.  </li>
            <li>My mixture just seemed to heal wounds much faster.</li>
            <li>I turned to my main source rather than shop all over creation.  </li>
            <li>I applied some more overnight with the same band aid and when I woke up, the hair was totally at the surface!</li>
            <li>Here are the emails starting with the most recent reply from Karan at epsal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular ingredient that you are wondering about , I might me&lt;br /&gt;able</li>
            <li>particular ingredient that you are wondering about , I might me&lt;br /&gt;able</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There is almost no pain when I accidentally bump my finger or use my hands the way I normally would.</li>
            <li>I use it all most everyday all the scraps and cuts he comes home with .I</li>
            <li>I know I can make my own by diluting Epson salts into a thick cream</li>
            <li>Use to pull out splinters or to help clear up acne.</li>
            <li>Really worked to remove a 3 week deep sliver in finger!</li>
            <li>After I had my daughter, I frequently had boils.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of my grandmother and her natural treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for poking around live flesh with a hot needle, especially with no way in!</li>
            <li>I received the product yesterday and can already tell a major difference this morning.  </li>
            <li>Whilst weeding near my rosebushes, a grabbed a branch instead of the pesky weed next to it.</li>
            <li>I had read on several sites that using this drawing salve would help eliminate a boil that developed under the arm.  </li>
            <li>but this Epsal ointment was very effective by drying out a boil like sore that seemed to fill with water and was painful.</li>
            <li>It may very well work for other applications, but not for under arm boils.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It may very well work for other applications, but not for under arm boils.  </li>
            <li> clean put on a little ( takes very little , just use tip of pinkie ) and cover.</li>
            <li> In fact I didn&#x27;t notice until days later when I made an utterly mundane movement and the pain in my finger nearly brought me to my knees.</li>
            <li> I of course examined the area to find my little nemesis with new skin already covering the entry wound.</li>
            <li> So I graciously turned down the generous offers of friends and family members who volunteered to perform the &amp;#34;operation&amp;#34; and headed over to Google to research the matter and Amazon to check reviews.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t want to give me the ingredients, so I sent a list of as many bad things as I could think of that I don&#x27;t want to be in it, and they wrote me back.</li>
            <li> It works to draw out and dry up acne and acne rashes.</li>
            <li> They never surface, but rather dry up.</li>
            <li> I used a whole bottle for a small infected cut and I had to break down and by polysporin .</li>
            <li> That said, this is something I will keep on hand as it does work and a tiny little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Will just buy a black drawing salve next time.</li>
            <li> None of the other ingredients that you listed are in the Epsal Ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason, the more I added, the waterier the lotion base became, which is why I ended up adding lecithin to thicken it.</li>
            <li> Once the sore was hard and dry you could rub it off.</li>
            <li> That little jar has lasted me all this time.  </li>
            <li> Well, I applied a little Epsal and put a band aid over it in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> After three days of keeping this ointment packed on the site, it only got worse.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a few persistent skin problems and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Will heal in very little time.</li>
            <li> I apply it sparingly, rub it in, and it usually works overnight.</li>
            <li> I know it works well from past orders.</li>
            <li> My husband applied the Epsal twice a day to the cyst for approximately three months, the cyst drained and it is gone.  </li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> YOU WONT GO WRONG ON THIS ONE .WISH</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great and so was service.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as it said it would will never buy again.</li>
            <li> does not work for any drawing or clearing up for me</li>
            <li> This salve does its job almost always.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li> We stumbled onto this product years ago. It is an excellent drawing salve. If you have an ingrown hair or get a splinter, this will help to draw it out.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> We used to buy this in the stores but couldn&#x27;t locate it anywhere. I found it on Amazon.com and bought 5 jars to hand out to the members of our growing family. It works wonderfully and the only thing we&#x27;ve ever used for drawing out slivers etc. I was further impressed because it was supposed to be so many days to ship and we received it much quicker than stated. Again, VERY WELL PLEASED by Amazon.com again!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for a cyst.  I received the product yesterday and can already tell a major difference this morning.  Awesome</li>
            <li> Really worked to remove a 3 week deep sliver in finger!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  I have had sucess with this product for years.  Don&#x27;t rub it in, apply it thickly for best sucess.</li>
            <li> I know I can make my own by diluting Epson salts into a thick cream but this Epsal ointment was very effective by drying out a boil like sore that seemed to fill with water and was painful. Once the sore was hard and dry you could rub it off.</li>
            <li> just like I remember it, quick and easy to use, just rub it on a splinter and wait for the results.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product MANY years ago!  That little jar has lasted me all this time.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be available anymore since it was so long ago; I was thrilled to be able to locate it online, since it was no longer available in the pharmacy where I originally purchased it.  It works as described and has helped time and time again!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most potent one can find as far as drawing salves are concerned. Will just buy a black drawing salve next time.</li>
            <li> I have used Epsal Drawing Salve for over 40 years.  After I had my daughter, I frequently had boils.  Epsal Drawing Salve has been a life saver.  Recently I had another boil which prompted me to order more as I was almost out.  Works on paper cuts as well.  I would and have told other people about the wonderful relief that comes from using Epsal Drawing Salve.</li>
            <li> I have been using Epsal Ointment since my teens, and I&#x27;m almost 40. It works to draw out and dry up acne and acne rashes. It&#x27;s especially effective on large pimples that are swollen below the surface. They never surface, but rather dry up. I apply it sparingly, rub it in, and it usually works overnight. My highest recommendation!!</li>
            <li> It drew out two cysts and made my life a lot more comfortable. Again, shopping here at Amazon makes it easier to find things that sometimes all the looking by car will never find.</li>
            <li> I used this product only once and had good results the drawing salve seems to work as advertised. I will use again as needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to draw out a pimple. Put it on day and night for two weeks and it did absolutely nothing. I remember the black tar drawing salve my mom used on me many, many years ago. I wish they still made that stuff because it worked!  I don&#x27;t recommend Epsal ointment at all.</li>
            <li> The doctor suggested my husband have a cyst removed from his face.  My husband applied the Epsal twice a day to the cyst for approximately three months, the cyst drained and it is gone.  We didn&#x27;t know if the Epsal would work on a cyst but it did and left no scar.  We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great drawing salve with many uses. Use to pull out splinters or to help clear up acne.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Whilst weeding near my rosebushes, a grabbed a branch instead of the pesky weed next to it. The thorn pierced my Kevlar gloves, a let out a well earned expletive and continued on. Unbeknownst to me, the tip of the rose thorn was still under my skin. In fact I didn&#x27;t notice until days later when I made an utterly mundane movement and the pain in my finger nearly brought me to my knees. I of course examined the area to find my little nemesis with new skin already covering the entry wound. I&#x27;m not much for poking around live flesh with a hot needle, especially with no way in! So I graciously turned down the generous offers of friends and family members who volunteered to perform the &amp;#34;operation&amp;#34; and headed over to Google to research the matter and Amazon to check reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 3 days now and can absolutely tell the difference. There is almost no pain when I accidentally bump my finger or use my hands the way I normally would. Before using the salve, I was training myself to keep the afflicted finger out of harm&#x27;s way, which wasn&#x27;t easy since it was the middle finger on my dominant hand and was still getting zapped about 6 times per day. At any rate, 3 days into using the salve.  The offending thorn seems to getting smaller and skin around the site appears to be returning to nie</li>
            <li> This ointment really works.  It does exactly what the name says &amp;#34;draws&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li> my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; when nothing else seems to be working! glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I know it works well from past orders.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years for boils and feverblisters .IF YOUR MARRIED TO A TIM ALLEN THE TOOL MAN. Like I am you can&#x27;t be without it. I use it all most everyday all the scraps and cuts he comes home with .I clean put on a little ( takes very little , just use tip of pinkie ) and cover. Will heal in very little time. One bottle has lasted me about 6 years. UNTIL GRANDKIDS  now I&#x27;m ordering more for me and some for all grandchildren. Really helps  with pimples proved it to to them NOW I&#x27;m out.  BEST OF  All PRICE LAST TIME WAS 14.00 PLUS TAX  SO I CAN GET TWO FOR ONE.  YOU WONT GO WRONG ON THIS ONE .WISH I COULD GET PAID TO SELL IT I COULD GET RFITCH. BUT O WELL BUY YOU NEED THIS ONE</li>
            <li> A time honored product which gets modern results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. It reminds me of my grandmother and her natural treatments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and it&#x27;s a staple in my medicine cabinet.  I had lent it to my mother who had no knowledge of it&#x27;s usefulness.  She asked me where I got it so that she could get some too.  I turned to my main source rather than shop all over creation.  You can get just about anything you want on Amazon.  Now she has one in her cabinet and I get a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I actually taught my mother something.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I used it on an ingrown hair I had on my chest for months that wouldn&#x27;t come out. It was in really deep, I couldn&#x27;t even see it. Well, I applied a little Epsal and put a band aid over it in the afternoon. I applied some more overnight with the same band aid and when I woke up, the hair was totally at the surface! Highly recommend for ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> Best drawing ointment I found.</li>
            <li> You should have this in your medical supplies.  Will order again.  My family come over and ask to use it all the time.  Great for sores, boils, pimples, acne etc</li>
            <li> False advertising. Does none of what it claims</li>
            <li> This stuff draws all sorts of impurities from skin.  It is Epsom Salts in a salve.  We have bought about two dozen jars over the last five years.</li>
            <li> Works great! Had a place on my leg for several weeks. Did not know what it was but when I rubbed it with my towel after bathing, it would bleed. I used the ointment three nights and covered with Band-Aid. It went away, and is all healed up. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my old jar of drawing salve, but it sort of works to clean out a pimple or something like that.</li>
            <li> I cannot find over the counter any product that works as well as Epsal for its quick drawing power.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> I debated between 4 stars or 5 stars.  I used something similar to this twenty years ago and it seemed like a miracle cream.  Healing was fast and seemingly miraculous.  Because I am not a pharmacist, I have no idea if this is the same formula.  This cream works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work nearly as quickly.  Many factors could play into that.  That said, this is something I will keep on hand as it does work and a tiny little bit goes a long way.  I was glad to find it!</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I don&#x27;t like buying things that don&#x27;t list ingredients, but really wanted to try this on a boil, and on my daughter who needs the magnesium... So I emailed the company. They didn&#x27;t want to give me the ingredients, so I sent a list of as many bad things as I could think of that I don&#x27;t want to be in it, and they wrote me back. The emails are listed below, in case you want to know what&#x27;s NOT in it!! Good to know :) but, while I was waiting for replies, and waiting for it to come in the mail, I made an ointment of my own (because it was taking a while, and I had a boil) out of Epsom salts, a tiny bit of some lotion I had laying around, and lecithin. Since receiving the epsal, I can say that my homemade version worked WAY better! But, I will still use the epsal up and try on some different things, and report back if my opinion changes. Not a bad product though. I like it. My mixture just seemed to heal wounds much faster. I did use LOTS of Epsom salts in it and that may be why. For some reason, the more I added, the waterier the lotion base became, which is why I ended up adding lecithin to thicken it. Here are the emails starting with the most recent reply from Karan at epsal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one that I know of is a de-oiled petrolatum.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for you or not.  None of the other ingredients that you listed are in the Epsal Ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Wed, Jun 10, 2015 at 12:52 AM, Epsal Ointment &amp;#60;epsalointment@gmail.com&amp;#62; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;Will check on this and let you know soon.&lt;br /&gt;Karan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Tue, Jun 9, 2015 at 7:35 PM, I wrote:&lt;br /&gt;If you can tell me if any of these ingredients are used, that will be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera (all species) (SEVERE ALLERGY)&lt;br /&gt;Synthetic  fragrances and Parfum&lt;br /&gt;Acrylamide&lt;br /&gt;Dioxane&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil: liquid paraffin, paraffin wax, petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Padimate-O: (also known as octyl dimethyl)&lt;br /&gt;Parabens: methyl, propyl, butyl, and ethyl paraben&lt;br /&gt;Phenol carbolic acid&lt;br /&gt;Toluene&lt;br /&gt;Triclosan&lt;br /&gt;Phthalates&lt;br /&gt;Formaldehyde, DMDM hydantoin&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;benzophenone&lt;br /&gt;PABA&lt;br /&gt;avobenzone&lt;br /&gt;homosalate&lt;br /&gt;ethoxycinnmate&lt;br /&gt;PEG: polyethylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;DEA(diethanolamine)&lt;br /&gt;MEA (monoethanolamine)&lt;br /&gt;TEA&lt;br /&gt;BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole)&lt;br /&gt;BHT&lt;br /&gt;Siloxanes (Cyclomethicone and ingredients ending in “siloxane”&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone&lt;br /&gt;Octyl Methoxycinnamate&lt;br /&gt;OxybenzoOctyl methoxycinnamatene&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Metals: Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Arsenic, Nickel,&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum&lt;br /&gt;Talc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Jun 9, 2015, at 9:26 AM, Epsal Ointment &amp;#60;epsalointment@gmail.com&amp;#62; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not share the formula  of our ointment.

            <li> Would not recommend , it did not help heal or draw anything out . I used a whole bottle for a small infected cut and I had to break down and by polysporin .</li>
            <li> Very effective for all slivers, foreign objects stuck in skin and the like.  Relief over night.</li>
            <li> i have used this product before and was glad to find it on Amazon. This product works well for me with pimples and ingrown hairs. The seller got it to us quickly.</li>
            <li> I find the salve is more convenient to use. After it is applied, it continues to work as I go about my daily work, and I am not restricted to having to soak the injury in a solution of epsom salts and water.</li>
            <li> Very effective, yet gentle on sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Great product. Hopefully I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I had read on several sites that using this drawing salve would help eliminate a boil that developed under the arm.  After three days of keeping this ointment packed on the site, it only got worse.  It may very well work for other applications, but not for under arm boils.  I will try it again in the future for other things but for now I&#x27;m not that impressed with the product.  The delivery was good, the packaging was good, but that&#x27;s the best I can report for now.</li>
            <li> it brought a boil to a head overnight</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful drawing agent for wounds, splinters, etc.</li>
            <li> I used it on a few persistent skin problems and it did nothing.  I used it on a pimple with the same result.</li>
