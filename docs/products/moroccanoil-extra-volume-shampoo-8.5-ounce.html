            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty oil and my friends suggested me try this one.</li>
            <li>It really somehow volumized my hair!</li>
            <li>After trying many productsI this shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair color fade.</li>
            <li>Love it for occasional use!</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and fine and needs extra volume.  </li>
            <li>After using the Moroccan Oil for a long time, I tried the shampoo and love the way it works.  </li>
            <li>It does give extra volume to my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color safe and leaves hair clean, soft, shiny, but not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>But then maybe I&#x27;m looking for something that doesn&#x27;t really exist...</li>
            <li>I ended up returning this product because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be real.  </li>
            <li>It gives a gentle hydrating volume to my hair.</li>

            <li>The shampoo gives shine as well as the much needed volume.</li>
            <li>It really does give your hair volume.</li>
            <li>I also bought the oil and it has given my hair much body</li>
            <li>Gentle and cleaning yet doesn&#x27;t strip your hair but seems to nourish and condition.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>Could be its not the real thing either.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars is that it makes minor tangles in my hair, which I don&#x27;t have with the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Does not lather as much as I would have liked; expected the shampoo to lather better, especially considering it comes in a rather small amount of 8.5 oz in bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all other Moroccanoil products &amp; really liked them &amp; tried the extra volume.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very dry after rinsing this shampoo out but after using Moroccan moisture repair conditioner &amp; oil, smooth again.</li>
            <li>( I have very fine,very soft)</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily hair in general, but these products do not give me a lot of build up.</li>
            <li>The last, but not the least: it smells so good :D.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Even after conditioning, the shampoo has tangled my hair so much I can barely brush my hair after the shower.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money...trust me!</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find locally, so I was pleased to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have baby-fine hair and these products don&#x27;t weigh it down and make my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I have trouble finding a product that gives me volume for longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I do find, however, that this formula is slightly less moisturizing than the original.  </li>
            <li>old),</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the products</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use to much as it can make fine hair look limp.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair and the shampoo makes it fuller.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but works very well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, after I my hairdresser suggested I try their shampoo I decided to spend a little more and choose this instead of my usual redken.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and it is terrific.</li>

            <li> I have thick, straight hair in blunt cut</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume and the fragrance is barely noticeable, which I like, however it wasn&#x27;t the miracle volumizer I thought it would be and is slightly drying.  </li>
            <li> clicked on wrong one, wanted regular, and after using it really really wanted regular - this one needs the conditioner, which regular</li>
            <li> Price is a bit expensive comparing to others but is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so unruly and dry</li>
            <li> I have loose wavy hair</li>
            <li> This does add some fullness to my hair but not what I expected....</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no smell?</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the moisture shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day, alternating with color preserving shampoo.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> and I wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I could just be hard to please.</li>
            <li> My hair will look dull and with no shine or so ever.</li>
            <li> It is as thick as molasses and is SO hard to lather into my hair.</li>
            <li> I had expected it to give my hair volume, but it was so bad that I decided to stop using it and throw it away.</li>
            <li> - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with either formula.  </li>
            <li> one I am not impressed with.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is really awful, as soon as I put on it convert my hair into a one nod, so heavy and tanggle, it just feel as a mass.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one, but I wasn&#x27;t going to take the chance.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s cleaning my hair evenly. :(</li>
            <li> This has GOT to be the WORST shampoo</li>

            <li> I love all Moroccanoil products! I have loose wavy hair and I wash it everyday. The Extra Volume Shampoo from Moroccanoil is the only one that makes my hair smooth, shiny and healthy, without making it too dry or too oily (perfect balance). The last, but not the least: it smells so good :D.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom. she loves it. ended up purchasing the big 33.8oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I love, love, love the Morrocan Oil Treatment.  This does add some fullness to my hair but not what I expected....But then maybe I&#x27;m looking for something that doesn&#x27;t really exist...I could just be hard to please.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. My hair is thinning as I am aging (58 yrs. old), but this shampoo give me volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair and the shampoo makes it fuller.  It&#x27;s the best shampoo I have every used.</li>
            <li> Does not lather as much as I would have liked; expected the shampoo to lather better, especially considering it comes in a rather small amount of 8.5 oz in bottle</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil shampoo is a great product all around.  It&#x27;s color safe and leaves hair clean, soft, shiny, but not weighted down.  My hair is very straight and fine and needs extra volume.  While this is a great shampoo and the best volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, I prefer the original formula.  I don&#x27;t notice a tremendous difference in volume, though this formula helps.  I do find, however, that this formula is slightly less moisturizing than the original.  The reason for the 4 stars is that it makes minor tangles in my hair, which I don&#x27;t have with the original formula.  Bottom  line - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with either formula.  I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this product because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be real.  I purchase MoroccanOil reguarly from salons; this bottle looked differently, and the product did not have the same smell or color.  Maybe I just got a bad one, but I wasn&#x27;t going to take the chance.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair more volume and seems to hold better than other volume shampoos.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives volume, but is far less moisturizing than the regular shampoo.  I use this in combination with the moisture shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a product after hearing such great reviews. I am a big fan or the moroccon oil and I use it daily for frizzy hair, split ends or to simply moisturize my hair and it works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, after I my hairdresser suggested I try their shampoo I decided to spend a little more and choose this instead of my usual redken.&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived on time, but boy, I truly believe this it COUNTERFEIT. My hair has never been so unruly and dry( I have very fine,very soft) I had expected it to give my hair volume, but it was so bad that I decided to stop using it and throw it away. What a waste of money! I would not suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the fullness and condition this leaves my hair.  My hair is extremely dry, so this shampoo works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and seems to work well with my hair...nice fragrance...</li>
            <li> Good product. As described.</li>
            <li> great product - really takes care of my hair</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I have ever used!  It gives a gentle hydrating volume to my hair. The smell is so clean, I have now come to love all of the products that I have bought from this company Highly recommend! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume and the fragrance is barely noticeable, which I like, however it wasn&#x27;t the miracle volumizer I thought it would be and is slightly drying.  I have fine hair, so I have trouble finding a product that gives me volume for longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This adds oomph to my hair and I can go 3 days before washing it again.  I use it with the Extra Volume Conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and it is terrific. I have used for over a year will add volume and I would not change.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty oil and my friends suggested me try this one.It really works!!! i will be a repeat buyer,really ~</li>
            <li> After using the Moroccan Oil for a long time, I tried the shampoo and love the way it works.  I have sensitive skin and the products do not cause any problems.</li>
            <li> Ree Drummond, the Pioneer Woman commented on this product on her blog, said it made her hair feel incredible. She was RIGHT.. my hair has never felt better, its soft, silky and no frizzy&#x27;s. I can pass my come through my hair without tangles (my hair is about 5 inches beyond my shoulders) I love this stuff! I will buy this again and again!!</li>
            <li> It really somehow volumized my hair!</li>
            <li> My mother uses Morrocan Oil for her thinning hair. The shampoo gives shine as well as the much needed volume. It works great.</li>
            <li> This gives me a good boost and I love the smell.  Use it every other day, alternating with color preserving shampoo. Great product.</li>
            <li> This was not morroccanoil it smelled and felt more like hand soap.</li>
            <li> It really does give your hair volume. But the best thing about this shampoo is it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of your hair. After trying many productsI this shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair color fade.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and have been using it for years.  It smells amazing  and my hair feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.. I will not repurchase. Addendum: I have been using this more consistently and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. My hair is so healthy and shiny now. It is sulfate free, so its the best for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for about a year. It is good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love my Moroccan Oil products, but my gosh!!! This has GOT to be the WORST shampoo I have EVER used. It is as thick as molasses and is SO hard to lather into my hair. Even after conditioning, the shampoo has tangled my hair so much I can barely brush my hair after the shower. Has absolutely no smell? I love good smelling shampoo...where is the smell? DO NOT waste your money...trust me!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to Moroccanoil and I am a true convert. I buy it at my salon but I also buy it on Amazon and found no differnce in quality. I have baby-fine hair and these products don&#x27;t weigh it down and make my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I always use moroccanoil products and love the way they make my hair feel.  Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo!!! (see my review for the conditioner...same comments apply!)&lt;br /&gt;The volume, silky feel and shine it gives your hair is amazing!! Am hooked for life! :)</li>
            <li> I love the volume this shampoo gives. I also bought the oil and it has given my hair much body and it seems to be growing faster! Recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is great at achieving smooth silky shine. As a person with long thin fine hair I found I could not use this every time to shampoo as it makes my hair unmanageable.  Love it for occasional use!</li>
            <li> clicked on wrong one, wanted regular, and after using it really really wanted regular - this one needs the conditioner, which regular does not</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, silky and has way more volume BUT I had to give it 4 stars because the shampoo does not lather well. I have shoulder length hair and it takes alot of shampoo (even after adding water it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy) and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s cleaning my hair evenly. :(</li>
            <li> It is fantastic. It has increased my hair thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I also referred it to some women who completed chemo &amp; they were very pleased with results. Their hair returned with more volume ,</li>
            <li> This product is great for cleansing your hair - it goes especially well with the conditioner. I can always tell the difference from the cheap-o products. Go to your local salon and try it out if you&#x27;re unsure! But I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> always use it - this is not a new product for me - good product- will continue to purchase and to use</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and it&#x27; say much better price than than the salon.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products. The Volume Color Safe Shampoo and Conditioner really do my fine and flat hair justice. I have pretty oily hair in general, but these products do not give me a lot of build up. I use them to maintain my bright red hair color, and it does the trick in spades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all other Moroccanoil products &amp; really liked them &amp; tried the extra volume. Hair feels very dry after rinsing this shampoo out but after using Moroccan moisture repair conditioner &amp; oil, smooth again. After blow drying my hair, I liked the fullness of my hair. I have thick, straight hair in blunt cut so it was a fuller body than when using the reg Moroccan. I will alternate the two shampoos. I will buy this again..quickly shipped too !</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for fine hair. Adds a lot of volume and smells good. Wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo EVER for fine, oily hair. Coming from someone who craves volume and is seldom to find it, this shampoo has been the best blessing to ever enter my shower. Stock up, its a great price!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really awful, as soon as I put on it convert my hair into a one nod, so heavy and tanggle, it just feel as a mass. My hair will look dull and with no shine or so ever. It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smeel either . I have no idea how it can have good reviews, unless mine is counterfeit. , who knows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but works very well on my fine hair.  It is difficult to find locally, so I was pleased to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have tried in all my many years especially for fine hair. Gentle and cleaning yet doesn&#x27;t strip your hair but seems to nourish and condition.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo.  You don&#x27;t need much.  A little goes along way.  Makes my hair very soft and manageable. Also like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works well, keeps hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair healthy and gives volume . All Moroccanoil products are great! Price is a bit expensive comparing to others but is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Great price compared to area salons and beauty supply stores.  My wife is pleased with the product.  I am pleased with the price!</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this product to me because she really liked it. now it is my primary shampoo along with the conditioner</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair product line with a fresh &amp; clean scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold don Moroccanoil products and this one did not disappoint me.  It does give extra volume to my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo..using it for a long time and I am always satisfied. Prevents static, gives shine and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I ordered extra column but received damaged hair shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this product. and felt it gave me more volume.  Generally I&#x27;ve found their products good.</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo would be like the regular morocon oil shampoo but this &amp;#34;extra volume&amp;#34; one I am not impressed with.  Could be its not the real thing either.</li>
            <li> Works great in adding moisture to hair. Be careful not to use to much as it can make fine hair look limp.</li>
            <li> Works great on fine hair</li>
