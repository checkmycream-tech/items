            <li>But bringing Root Vanish by Kazumi was perfect!</li>
            <li>was a perfect match!</li>
            <li>The absolutely best product to cover gray roots in between hair color appointments.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave hair feeling sticky - excellent product.</li>
            <li>everything from the packaging of these product to the color application is just perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best I have found..</li>
            <li>this is the BEST product EVER!!!</li>
            <li>I am truly happy with a root covering product.</li>
            <li>However, for putting the product on your roots, it&#x27;s not so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely plush brush that would be great for painting a picture.  </li>
            <li>so all you do is click button and magic appears!</li>
            <li>There are&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper ones that do the job better!</li>
            <li>The gel blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>and this is really the best one.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this product, because I read about it in a popular magazine.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>So, I took some nice scissors and cut off most of the applicator brush.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the way Root Vanish blends with my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>I love the application &amp; the color</li>
            <li>LOVE root vanish.  </li>
            <li>I often need to use a Q-tip to move the dye from the bottom to the top.</li>
            <li>I was worried the color wouldn&#x27;t match the different tones in my hair, but it blended perfectly.</li>
            <li>I use the trick others posted about brushing on a mirror before applying to my roots which gives me much more control over the project.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Medium Brown would have been much better</li>
            <li>If I was on top of it, I should be going in for color every 2 weeks but don&#x27;t have the time or patience.</li>
            <li>Bumble and bumbles colored hair shampoo does a much better job of covering roots&lt;</li>
            <li>Bumble &amp; Bumble make a much better product.</li>
            <li>I wish it was permanent with how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>Root vanish is easy to use and</li>
            <li>Easy to apply because of the applicator and stays put.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Now with Root Vanish I can cover them up easily, with no risk of also leaving dye on my scalp for everyone to see.</li>
            <li>You can easily control this product, it doesn&#x27;t get on your hands or smear on your skin -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this is just a defective one, but for almost $50 it should dispense easily.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good and not very messy</li>
            <li>Root Vanish looks very natural, and the dark brown matches my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>This does a good job of covering the grey at your roots.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see the company do some serious repackaging of a great gray coverup.</li>
            <li>Really!!</li>
            <li>100% recommended!I have dark brown hair and worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>I have to reapply more frequently that I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It it easy to apply and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Because so many of the other reviews were so enthusiastic, I&#x27;ve ordered one in dark brown to see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>My hair is 80% gray and it grows very fast.</li>
            <li>Covers the grey very well and I like how easy it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time EVER</li>
            <li>This is okay for an emergency gray or root cover, but for the price of $48., it should last longer than a couple days.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to go back to using waterproof mascara until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this several times now and it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>LOVE that there is finally a solution for greys in between coloring!</li>
            <li>It works great and is pricey, but last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have brought on Amazon that I wanted to return.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different root cover-ups...</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased, and it will definitely save me some trips to the salon.</li>
            <li>It seems easy enough since it just snaps off.  </li>
            <li>With this product I can easily buy an extra week in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li>I was never even able to try it as it was a dry tube...</li>
            <li>I have the world&#x27;s most stubborn grays -- right at my hairline on my forehead, so they are the first to emerge a few weeks after a salon visit.</li>
            <li>I like the product because it&#x27;s a gel and goes on sheer and light, yet it covers the gray.  </li>
            <li>My suggestion to the company would be to replace the brush with a much shorter one.  </li>
            <li>The product does come out, but it doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair very well</li>
            <li>The dye comes out of the bottom of the brush, and you really need to work it to get the dye to the tip.</li>
            <li>It matches my hair color really well</li>
            <li>Does not cover (the whole purpose of the product).</li>
            <li>The brush on the Root Vanish works very well in hiding the gray at the hairline.</li>
            <li>Color Wow to those mascara-like instant touch up tools but ended up never using them more than a couple of times because I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair looked and felt throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;ll find that you inadvertently press the bottom when you snap the top on and when you sit the tube down on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I am very active, so it will be interesting to see how the color performs during perspiration.</li>
            <li>Basically, it wastes a lot and then isn&#x27;t very precise.  </li>
            <li>I WILL try another though since it comes highly recommended</li>
            <li>I need more practice with it, but I think this will help hide my grey regrowth until my next salon visit.</li>
            <li>If I had not used so much of it, the first time and only time, I would have returned it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>The product easily wipes off and isn&#x27;t even that dark when it touches the skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like other cheap brands.</li>
            <li>hair looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I love that I can style my hair after, as usual.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the dark brown and it is too light (too orange-red).</li>
            <li>I am a dark blonde with lighter blonde highlights, so I bought both the Blonde and Light Brown products and mix and match both colors easily.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s wasting the product, which is a problem for the obvious reason, but also a problem because you can&#x27;t see how much is in there</li>
            <li>I wear my hair pulled back in a bun during the summer, and the gray becomes very noticeable at the hairline.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown/auburn hair and the Dark Brown matches nicely.  </li>
            <li>For just roots, the brush is a little too large and the rest of the hair around the roots get colored too.???</li>

            <li> For just roots, the brush is a little too large and the rest of the hair around the roots get colored too.???</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it does not seem to stay on too long.  </li>
            <li> I tried the light brown which was essentially useless.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, I felt like I had to consciously NOT touch my hair because of the residue that would come off.  </li>
            <li> While it is possible to remove accidents while it is still wet, imagine fumbling around your hair with a Q-tip trying to get rid of the dye.</li>
            <li> Does not cover grey well.</li>
            <li> I tried again a second time, this time on a wet hair and used blow dry after, still got the same result, dark stain on my temple and scalp where the color were applied and the gray were still visible, the color just simple did not stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other products on the market for $5.99 that last a week.</li>
            <li> And the colored hair is hardened after coloring, which obviously stands out among other hairs.</li>
            <li> I also blow dry my hair to set the product and have had no issues with the color running or flaking off.</li>
            <li> The brush is almost an inch long and wide</li>
            <li> The entire process takes just as long as dying it the usual way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until the tube is empty, but I will not purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I spent $48 for a product that did not work.</li>
            <li> You scratch your scalp 3 hours later and wonder why your finger nails are black!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with dark brown/ black hair.</li>
            <li> My other problem with the applicator is that the bottom of the bottle is where you press to squirt the color into the brush.  </li>
            <li> it got a 5 stars reviews by other users.</li>
            <li> I started with using it every other day</li>
            <li> which is an issue I&#x27;ve had with other products like this.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried have mascara type applicator brushes that take forever to even attempt to cover my gray.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no product in the tube!  </li>
            <li> I can use a color stick in other areas of my hair, but not at the hairline.</li>
            <li> It also makes the hair stiff even if you blow it dry like the directions say.  </li>
            <li> Application is not as easy/smooth as I thought because it is hard to control the amount of color fluid that goes into brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen other products that claim to do the same thing but either do not cover the gray or they flake off.</li>
            <li> I cover up with a permanent dark brown.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately after trying twice, the color did not stay.</li>
            <li> The color blends well with my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and the brown color matches.</li>
            <li> I bought this in dark brown and followed the instruction on the box, I applied it on my dry hair and used a blow dry to set the color, it left a stain on my temple and my scalp where i applied the color, even though the stain on the scalp can be removed but unfortunately the color did not stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> Extreme waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I did buy again, I&#x27;d get the black.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave you hair stiff like other gray coverage products do.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a dried up tube?  </li>
            <li> it was a waste of money for</li>
            <li> Messy product.  </li>
            <li> I have a few stubborn gray hairs that frame my face.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted $48.</li>
            <li> I would advise you not to waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Worse; when you are finished with brushing it on and taking off the marks on your skin, you have to blow dry your roots and it takes a loooooooooong time.</li>
            <li> I usually get color about every 18-20 days...</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> This product helps me with grey hair and a weird hair disorder called tricatelamania.</li>
            <li> Item went on sticky and made my hair brittle and hard.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get any of the solution on the brush to put it on your hair.  </li>
            <li> And I usually go 5-7 days between.  YAY!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes in a black velvet case, which makes it impossible to find in the bottom of my bag!</li>
            <li> it just turns them a ugly red color.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the color is a little too dark.  </li>
            <li> I hate it:</li>
            <li> This is s very bad product.  </li>

            <li> Works well to cover those gray roots!</li>
            <li> I went on a 3 week vacation to Europe. I usually get color about every 18-20 days...yes that gray creeps in quicker than I like to think. But bringing Root Vanish by Kazumi was perfect! I love the application &amp; the color was a perfect match! Med Brown was my color. Also it&#x27;s all in one so all you do is click button and magic appears! Really!!</li>
            <li> Eh.....over priced shoe polish.</li>
            <li> I tried the light brown which was essentially useless.  I couldn&#x27;t see it on my hair and I also couldn&#x27;t see it on a white paper towel.  Maybe I received a dried up tube?  Because so many of the other reviews were so enthusiastic, I&#x27;ve ordered one in dark brown to see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> This is the first time EVER I am truly happy with a root covering product.</li>
            <li> Covers the grey very well and I like how easy it is easy to use. It stays on between washes well. I wish it was permanent with how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li> The absolutely best product to cover gray roots in between hair color appointments.  It does not leave hair feeling sticky - excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown/auburn hair and the Dark Brown matches nicely.  I like the product because it&#x27;s a gel and goes on sheer and light, yet it covers the gray.  It doesn&#x27;t wipe off on your hands or sunglasses, etc after it dries.  The biggest problem is the applicator.  It&#x27;s a lovely plush brush that would be great for painting a picture.  However, for putting the product on your roots, it&#x27;s not so good.  The brush is almost an inch long and wide so you have to pump a lot of product out into the brush to get it to the ends so you can put it on your roots.  I like to touch up my roots as soon as they start showing at a quarter of an inch. But with this applicator you have to use a lot of product to get it to the ends of the brush.  Basically, it wastes a lot and then isn&#x27;t very precise.  So, I took some nice scissors and cut off most of the applicator brush.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s better.  My suggestion to the company would be to replace the brush with a much shorter one.  It seems easy enough since it just snaps off.  My other problem with the applicator is that the bottom of the bottle is where you press to squirt the color into the brush.  However, you&#x27;ll find that you inadvertently press the bottom when you snap the top on and when you sit the tube down on the counter.  Again, it&#x27;s wasting the product, which is a problem for the obvious reason, but also a problem because you can&#x27;t see how much is in there to begin with, therefore, you&#x27;ll never know when you&#x27;re about to run out.  I would love to see the company do some serious repackaging of a great gray coverup.</li>
            <li> This is okay for an emergency gray or root cover, but for the price of $48., it should last longer than a couple days. I will continue to use it until the tube is empty, but I will not purchase again.  There&#x27;s other products on the market for $5.99 that last a week.</li>
            <li> Root vanish is easy to use and hair looks very natural.The gel blends in nicely. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like other cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product for root touch ups in between my color. I bought this in dark brown and followed the instruction on the box, I applied it on my dry hair and used a blow dry to set the color, it left a stain on my temple and my scalp where i applied the color, even though the stain on the scalp can be removed but unfortunately the color did not stick to the hair. I tried again a second time, this time on a wet hair and used blow dry after, still got the same result, dark stain on my temple and scalp where the color were applied and the gray were still visible, the color just simple did not stick to the hair. The reason I gave 1 star is because of the price. I spent $48 for a product that did not work. And No, I would not recommend this to anyone. I am actually surprise it got a 5 stars reviews by other users. I guess I will have to go back to using waterproof mascara until I find something better.</li>
            <li> LOVE root vanish.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of root cover up and this is really the best one.  Easy to apply because of the applicator and stays put.  Only complaint is the price, but its really worth it.</li>
            <li> For just roots, the brush is a little too large and the rest of the hair around the roots get colored too.???</li>
            <li> I have tried Rita Hazan&#x27;s spray to Color Wow to those mascara-like instant touch up tools but ended up never using them more than a couple of times because I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair looked and felt throughout the day.  Not to mention, I felt like I had to consciously NOT touch my hair because of the residue that would come off.  My friend recommended me ROOT VANISH and all of those issues are gone!  I love that I can style my hair after, as usual.  I started with using it every other day and I think my grays and roots are getting darker with use so I don&#x27;t even need to touch up that often.  I&#x27;m pushing back my (costly) coloring appointment for another three weeks.  Woohoo.</li>
            <li> The product does come out, but it doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair very well and you can definitely still see the roots. The dye comes out of the bottom of the brush, and you really need to work it to get the dye to the tip. The tip is what you&#x27;ll use to get to your roots, otherwise, the dye will be on the part of your hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be touched up. I often need to use a Q-tip to move the dye from the bottom to the top. Even still, my gray is still REALLY obvious after a lot of work. I&#x27;ve tried this several times now and it doesn&#x27;t get better. I won&#x27;t be ordering again - it was a waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have silvery-white gray hair, with a wiry texture. I cover up with a permanent dark brown. I ordered the dark brown and it is too light (too orange-red). If I did buy again, I&#x27;d get the black.</li>
            <li> everything from the packaging of these product to the color application is just perfect. 100% recommended!I have dark brown hair and worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> I need more practice with it, but I think this will help hide my grey regrowth until my next salon visit.</li>
            <li> Messy product.  Flakes everywhere.  My sweat made it run all over my face, too.  I would never buy it, again.  If I had not used so much of it, the first time and only time, I would have returned it.  Also, the way the package is made, you have to rip it open, in order to read the instructions; therefore, I ruined the packaging immediately.  I had purchased this product, because I read about it in a popular magazine.  Shame on me.</li>
            <li> This product helps me with grey hair and a weird hair disorder called tricatelamania. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. This is the best I have found..</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the way Root Vanish blends with my natural hair color. I was worried the color wouldn&#x27;t match the different tones in my hair, but it blended perfectly. I use the trick others posted about brushing on a mirror before applying to my roots which gives me much more control over the project. I also blow dry my hair to set the product and have had no issues with the color running or flaking off. LOVE that there is finally a solution for greys in between coloring!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It matches my hair color really well, it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on between shampoos.  And I usually go 5-7 days between.  YAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dreaming for a product like this forever, and it&#x27;s finally here! I have the world&#x27;s most stubborn grays -- right at my hairline on my forehead, so they are the first to emerge a few weeks after a salon visit. Now with Root Vanish I can cover them up easily, with no risk of also leaving dye on my scalp for everyone to see. The product easily wipes off and isn&#x27;t even that dark when it touches the skin. I have no idea how the color penetrates the grays, but they do! I am a dark blonde with lighter blonde highlights, so I bought both the Blonde and Light Brown products and mix and match both colors easily. My only complaint is that it comes in a black velvet case, which makes it impossible to find in the bottom of my bag!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with dark brown/ black hair. I have a few stubborn gray hairs that frame my face. I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately after trying twice, the color did not stay.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  It takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s good and not very messy like I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It works great and is pricey, but last a long time.</li>
            <li> This does a good job of covering the grey at your roots.  It it easy to apply and looks very natural.  The color blends well with my dark brown hair.  My only issue is that it does not seem to stay on too long.  I have to reapply more frequently that I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the color is a little too dark.  Medium Brown would have been much better but you do not carry medium brown.  I do like that is doesn&#x27;t leave you hair stiff like other gray coverage products do.</li>
            <li> My hair is 80% gray and it grows very fast. If I was on top of it, I should be going in for color every 2 weeks but don&#x27;t have the time or patience. With this product I can easily buy an extra week in between salon appointments. I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen other products that claim to do the same thing but either do not cover the gray or they flake off. You can easily control this product, it doesn&#x27;t get on your hands or smear on your skin - which is an issue I&#x27;ve had with other products like this. Also, the brush is nice and thick. Other products I&#x27;ve tried have mascara type applicator brushes that take forever to even attempt to cover my gray.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and the brown color matches. The bottle comes with a neat packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Why I hate it: You can&#x27;t avoid brushing your scalp when brushing color onto your hair. I looked like I had melanoma all over. While it is possible to remove accidents while it is still wet, imagine fumbling around your hair with a Q-tip trying to get rid of the dye. The entire process takes just as long as dying it the usual way. Worse; when you are finished with brushing it on and taking off the marks on your skin, you have to blow dry your roots and it takes a loooooooooong time. You scratch your scalp 3 hours later and wonder why your finger nails are black! Then you wash your hair and it will be all gone.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I totally wasted $48. I used it two times and know I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no product in the tube!  I was never even able to try it as it was a dry tube...</li>
            <li> Very messy. Time consuming to apply. Stains my hands, it was an effort to get it off. I&#x27;m sticking with the color spray powder.</li>
            <li> Item went on sticky and made my hair brittle and hard.  Had to wash it off!  There are&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper ones that do the job better!</li>
            <li> This is s very bad product.  It is hard to get any of the solution on the brush to put it on your hair.  When you finally get the product on the roots it just turns them a ugly red color.  It also makes the hair stiff even if you blow it dry like the directions say.  I would advise you not to waste your money.  Bumble and bumbles colored hair shampoo does a much better job of covering roots&lt;br /&gt;The company will not take it back and give you a refund either. This is the first product I have brought on Amazon that I wanted to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this is just a defective one, but for almost $50 it should dispense easily. I WILL try another though since it comes highly recommended</li>
            <li> Does not cover grey well.</li>
            <li> Extreme waste of money. Not easy to apply. Gets everywhere. Clumps. Does not cover (the whole purpose of the product). Shall I go on? Bumble &amp; Bumble make a much better product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different root cover-ups... Powders, sprays, gels, and this is the BEST product EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair pulled back in a bun during the summer, and the gray becomes very noticeable at the hairline. The brush on the Root Vanish works very well in hiding the gray at the hairline. I can use a color stick in other areas of my hair, but not at the hairline. Root Vanish looks very natural, and the dark brown matches my hair perfectly. I am very active, so it will be interesting to see how the color performs during perspiration. So far, I am very pleased, and it will definitely save me some trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product after reading lots of reviews. Application is not as easy/smooth as I thought because it is hard to control the amount of color fluid that goes into brush. And the colored hair is hardened after coloring, which obviously stands out among other hairs. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
