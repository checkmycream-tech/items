            <li>Bought it for a costume party and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>This wig is perfect , it is just like real hair</li>
            <li>I liked it but the sculp hair is damaged</li>
            <li>Honestly you could just sit there and it&#x27;d just tangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of like how you straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>so you have to kind of expect that.</li>
            <li>I did not use any kind of conditioners or spray on detanglers.</li>
            <li>I did not use any kind of conditioners or spray on detanglers.</li>
            <li>It came in a nice box ...</li>
            <li>It does tangle very easily though but can be combed with the comb included.</li>
            <li>Just know that it tangles very easily and is not something you&#x27;ll want if you like to play with your hair.</li>

            <li>Love love looooove it!</li>
            <li>This wig is soooo cute and nice for $ 17.00.</li>
            <li>When it first came in, it looked very beautiful and felt smooth but after having it for about two days, the wig began tangling.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and it is very full.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good packaging.  </li>
            <li>The quality is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>im sure blondes make more money.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t like those cheap plastic wigs at all!</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t just a out of the package looks like magic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do love the color and the look and feel of the hair itself.</li>
            <li>As many others have said, the hair comes out from the top of the wig.</li>
            <li>I started from the top.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels this way</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and want to try the straightened version of it, thinking you&#x27;ll be able to play with it more, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>It needed more layers and this way always works well with wigs.</li>
            <li>and you can tell even more after you straighten it.</li>
            <li>this one is a good choice.it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with.</li>

            <li>Such a great wig for the money!</li>
            <li>is better than I would have thought.</li>
            <li>Good to play for fun from time to time.</li>
            <li>I was able to put it up in a ponytail, and the wig had *</li>
            <li>I will say that it does look cute.</li>
            <li>I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>I am on my way for couple more wig like this one.</li>
            <li>However, the character I am cosplaying has wavy hair most of the time and after looking at it I prefer it that way.</li>
            <li>, Iv&#x27;e been getting so many complements from wearing this wig.</li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with it, because it still kept getting tangled so easily, and it just didn&#x27;t look like it was &amp;#34;done.&amp;#34; I had nothing more to lose at that point, so I went ahead and straightened the wig.</li>

            <li>Of course this one comes up first because it&#x27;s got a lot of reviews, seemingly good reviews, etc.</li>
            <li>When it first comes out of the box, the hair is fairly evenly separated on both sides of the bangs.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not a bad thing if you want to braid it or do some kind of updo.</li>
            <li>I would buy another one in an instant and very good quality and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a wig with shorter bangs (would be perfect to trim straight across for a straight bang look)</li>

            <li>I have not yet added any kind of detangler or smoothing hair stuff to it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to have to.</li>

            <li>so I was able to get it with the free 2 day shipping.  </li>
            <li>but it was here on time, packaged neat with everything included, great quality, color as expected, easy to work with and nice fitting.  </li>
            <li>Overall for the price though, it was a good purchase!</li>
            <li>It does shed and tangle easily</li>
            <li>Got this for my cousin who is in love with wearing wigs the hair is good and soft</li>
            <li>Just need for a party costume but is actually a pretty nice wig.</li>
            <li>Firstly, know you will have to spend some time working on this wig to make it your own.</li>
            <li>I did it the popular way, by boiling a pot of water, taking a cup and scooping the boiling water onto the wig&#x27;s hair until it was covered in the hot water and</li>

            <li>I was impressed at how soft the hair was, how realistic it felt and looked.</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m pretty pleased :)</li>
            <li>This wig is very beautiful and I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>Trimmed it to fit my style.</li>
            <li>I had to kind of take the hair piece by piece and comb it straight and continue to do that.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so light that it feels TOO light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t bend the hair when drying it otherwise</li>

            <li>adjustable to fit your head just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Before buying this item, keep in mind that it is cheap, so you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I believe someone else experienced a similar problem.</li>
            <li>But the tangling is 90% better than it was, and it looks soooo much better and straight.</li>
            <li>But the tangling is 90% better than it was, and it looks soooo much better and straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously not the best that money could buy but it shipped fast and it fits well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly real-looking, not too shiny, and relatively soft.</li>
            <li>In the main picture for the straight brown wig it appears that they were kind of able to do that, but I have not been able to get it to look that way.</li>
            <li>Eh, this wig is okay, takes a lot of work to get it to sit right.</li>
            <li>super quick and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>Beautiful wig, worth what I paid, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how the cap part was made.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be realistic, NOT some kind of costume wig.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care what you want.&amp;#34; And the bangs are significantly rougher and stiffer than the rest of the wig which is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was almost perfect, very few tangles that I had to release.</li>
            <li>and the hair was still nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>a pretty good wig, very straight hair and looks pretty spot on to the photo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product would be perfect if the bangs weren&#x27;t so dang hard to keep in place.</li>
            <li>But as long as you keep the handy comb with you there are no problems!</li>
            <li>after literally about 20 minutes of just simply pulling my fingers through the hair and combing it, I think I have it all good to go.</li>
            <li>I would love to know how they got it that straight.</li>
            <li>I would love to know how they got it that straight.</li>
            <li>but it did come with a cool comb, and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet,</li>
            <li>tangles pretty easily</li>
            <li>pretty easily.</li>
            <li>pretty easily but not too bad&lt;br /&gt;-The comb that came with it</li>
            <li>but I was happy to see that it already is layered, and is not flat and straight at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Bangs are important to me, and important that they really form to your face.</li>
            <li>the end of the day, if you can&#x27;t afford a nicer wig but want a realistic looking one, this one is ok.</li>
            <li>I do wish the bangs were longer (if they were chin-length it would look a lot more flattering to anyone&#x27;s face) but that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.</li>

            <li>The wig is very lightweight, soft, and seems good quality.</li>
            <li>I trimmed the bangs because they were too long to look good on me, but that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cool roller comb works great, but still takes a little effort.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a hair net, but I suggest getting your own because the one they give you is pretty basic and stretches so easily that it&#x27;s pretty much good for just one use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure a wig shouldn&#x27;t shed as much as mine did.</li>
            <li>Get tangled easily and way too much fall out.</li>
            <li>so I could trim the bangs exactly how I wanted!</li>
            <li>* convinced it was real hair on film, even though I knew I was wearing a wig!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the most natural-looking wigs I&#x27;ve tried, and I got an entire box full of them!</li>
            <li>I like ordering cheap wigs because I get to experiment with styling without worrying about messing up too much.</li>
            <li>All in all tho, worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for a wig worth the price.</li>
            <li>I noticed from trying to play with the bangs that when I&#x27;d comb the bangs or part the bangs, part of the rest of the hair that are near the bangs would get caught with the bangs and then switch sides since it all comes from a point at the top.</li>
            <li>At this point I gave up and accepted that it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that it would look and feel like freshly straightened hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had hopes that it would look and feel like freshly straightened hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It came nicely packaged, along with a wig brush and some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I have ordered this particular wig in both straight and curly and absolutely love both.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>is just right.</li>
            <li>This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was nice and VERY realistic, especially if you&#x27;re of Asian heritage because that looks like the kind of hair the wig was based off from.</li>
            <li>only issue I have with it, is that it seems to tangle very easily.</li>
            <li>Little issue with the bangs but overall the wig is great!</li>
            <li>straight and for the most part soft</li>
            <li>The hair is really soft and you can style it easily.</li>
            <li>The option to adjust to fit is clearly a bonus!</li>
            <li>This wig does not look good parted down the middle, and I did expect that since the bangs come from the top of the head.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>it gets pretty unmanageable.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my first wig purchase</li>
            <li>I just simply wanted to be able to see out my damn eyes</li>
            <li>It felt and looked exactly like freshly straightened real hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to move my star rating because I was still underwhelmed when I first got the wig.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not going to move my star rating because I was still underwhelmed when I first got the wig.</li>
            <li>but I may have to borrow it very soon!  </li>
            <li>I already left a review but had to again because I love this wig SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer, and used this wig for a Tomb Raider fan film.</li>
            <li>The hair; top hat piece is made for a big head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not at all as dark as it is in the picture and is more of a light brown.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that part of the reviews were actually wrong, since a lot of people say this tangles easily.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t perfectly part the bangs down the middle due to the fact that they all come out from the top of the head.</li>
            <li>Lovely and thick, cut it to shorten but otherwise lovely color and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it one star for their mistake is that in truth after the initially shock/disappointment I really loved the wig.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly pretty and realistic looking for the price!  </li>
            <li>I am not 100% positive if this wig is heat resistant.</li>
            <li>now when im alone at home (always), i can walk around with this sexy long hair</li>
            <li>I went back to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; parting it down the middle, again attempting to perfect it.</li>
            <li>After playing with it a bit, it pretty much reverted back to what it originally was.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of such a cheap wig</li>
            <li>The texture and appearance are so real</li>
            <li>and it will shine and smell like real hair.</li>
            <li>, my friends thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li>I ordered the straight brown one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t an issue for you, I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li>haired one, which means it won&#x27;t have as much body.</li>
            <li>And on the plus side, you really can&#x27;t see much of the foundation of the wig itself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much practical use for this wig</li>
            <li>But I really went into detail with everything that I did so</li>
            <li>all the hair was straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MANDATORY that if you buy the straight wig you have to straighten its hair this way.</li>

            <li>I think it&#x27;s fantastic, and will definitely buy from this store again.</li>
            <li>Maybe because i got the brown straight one??</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t tangle so much</li>
            <li>I ended up trimming mine quite a bit, but not too much of a hassle to do.</li>
            <li>The hair for the back part of the wig is a nice length, but I like my front/sides to be shorter than the back.</li>

            <li>I suggest getting a wig comb or brush, because it tends to tangle easily and frizz by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>My expectations were pretty low considering how cheap this wig is, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I feel the need to wear a hat while walking around just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t start slipping off my head!</li>
            <li>Everyone talks this thing up so much, saying that it&#x27;s such high quality and feels/looks like a more expensive wig - basically saying it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I have to pat it down, the top has a scalp looking color that shows where the hairline is.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that it tangles.</li>
            <li>was not at all expecting it to look realistic...</li>
            <li>If you want a realistic wig, you have to get styling.</li>
            <li>I actually think if they were a big longer it would be better, then maybe they would go to the side easier.</li>
            <li>My expectations were too high mainly from these amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m not a professional wig wearer, I don&#x27;t have a collection of real/fake wigs, and I&#x27;m not even familiar with how wigs work.</li>
            <li>It tangled the first 5mins and it was not dark brown.</li>
            <li>The nice smooth quality does not last very long and the hair tends to look very messy very fast.</li>
            <li>Now if they would make some long ones with a different top style I might buy another one.</li>
            <li>Better for costume wear rather than everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the wig is fine.</li>
            <li>a psychopath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please note its super long and gets hella tangle-y.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much wanted them all far to the left and out of my face.</li>
            <li>I have straighten the hair and it makes it look like it is brand new.</li>
            <li>Very soft and feminine...</li>
            <li>Can easily be fixed with a hat!</li>
            <li>I took it out of the package and before even taking it out of the netting it comes in, I was both impressed and disappointed.</li>
            <li>And wow, I could not believe the difference!</li>
            <li>And wow, I could not believe the difference!</li>
            <li>I only bought it for Halloween, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned, but it is much higher quality than I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how natural this wig looks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this wig, and some of my friends even said they forget it&#x27;s not my natural hair!</li>
            <li>Its good for its price,however do not expect the quality to be fantastic,  you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ordered a black and received a light brown.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to flip the front part and play with it, while the back part stays down.</li>

            <li>With real hair you can at least easily separate your bangs and part it.</li>
            <li>I then combed it straight again and let it air dry STRAIGHT.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve naturally brown hair</li>
            <li>At least the curled version would look cute and done.</li>
            <li>At least the curled version would look cute and done.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me much,so overall</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old to go with her Rapunzel Costume.  </li>
            <li>Seem so natural.</li>
            <li>color and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Very there is only one telling part of the wig</li>
            <li>Cut, thin, whatever you want for it to frame your face nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to make a nice braid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 4 only because it tangles so easily and its pretty hard to maintain once it gets all messed up, so I suggest having some products that&#x27;s meant for taming wig hair.</li>
            <li>I mean, you can brush it, but make sure to wash it once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds</li>
            <li>My first recommendation is NOT to mess with the bangs too much after you put it on.</li>
            <li>but it get a little tangled pretty fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>but I pretty much know nothing other than basic logic when it comes to wigs.</li>
            <li>one con: it tangles so easily, you can barely turn your head without a small birds nest.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a thick wig and is the thinnest wig I have personally tried on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too long to flip around really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too long to flip around really.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll dry that way with the bend and it won&#x27;t be straight.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll dry that way with the bend and it won&#x27;t be straight.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the broad from that movie &amp;#34;The Ring&amp;#34; or Cousin It.</li>
            <li>a decent style before I styled it, long so I could work on layers</li>
            <li>after trying to part the bangs down the middle, I then went with what I originally wanted to do, which was move all the bangs to the left side.</li>
            <li>All I did was wet the wig with cold water, combed the wig to make sure everything was detangled and straight, then poured the hot water over it.</li>

            <li>It is very windy here and it onlt makes the detangling even harder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough or naggy like a lot of synthetic wigs are.</li>
            <li>The wig is naturally really wavy, NOT straight like I was expecting it.</li>
            <li>had to straighten it myself at a low temperature until it was completely straightened.</li>
            <li>the bangs are kind of weird to part</li>
            <li>This hair is too soft and slightly frizzy (though it really doesn&#x27;t look that frizzy) to not add anything to it.</li>
            <li>This hair is too soft and slightly frizzy (though it really doesn&#x27;t look that frizzy) to not add anything to it.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, less than $20 for a realistic wig is not going to get you very far, and I should have known that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It washed just fine, and I used it for a few months before finally being done with it, not because it was run down or anything, more because I got tired of long hair</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look fake, soft, combs out easily and color</li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious, and as I read in another review, I was expecting something a little cheaper for the price.</li>

            <li> Bought it for a costume party and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect , it is just like real hair</li>
            <li> I liked it but the sculp hair is damaged</li>
            <li> Honestly you could just sit there and it&#x27;d just tangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of like how you straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> so you have to kind of expect that.</li>
            <li> I did not use any kind of conditioners or spray on detanglers.</li>

            <li> It does tangle very easily though but can be combed with the comb included.</li>
            <li> Just know that it tangles very easily and is not something you&#x27;ll want if you like to play with your hair.</li>

            <li> Love love looooove it!</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo cute and nice for $ 17.00.</li>
            <li> When it first came in, it looked very beautiful and felt smooth but after having it for about two days, the wig began tangling.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and it is very full.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in good packaging.  </li>
            <li> The quality is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> im sure blondes make more money.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t like those cheap plastic wigs at all!</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t just a out of the package looks like magic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do love the color and the look and feel of the hair itself.</li>
            <li> As many others have said, the hair comes out from the top of the wig.</li>
            <li> I started from the top.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels this way</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and want to try the straightened version of it, thinking you&#x27;ll be able to play with it more, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> It needed more layers and this way always works well with wigs.</li>
            <li> and you can tell even more after you straighten it.</li>
            <li> this one is a good choice.it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with.</li>

            <li> Such a great wig for the money!</li>
            <li> is better than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> Good to play for fun from time to time.</li>
            <li> I was able to put it up in a ponytail, and the wig had *</li>
            <li> I will say that it does look cute.</li>
            <li> I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> I am on my way for couple more wig like this one.</li>
            <li> However, the character I am cosplaying has wavy hair most of the time and after looking at it I prefer it that way.</li>
            <li> , Iv&#x27;e been getting so many complements from wearing this wig.</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with it, because it still kept getting tangled so easily, and it just didn&#x27;t look like it was &amp;#34;done.&amp;#34; I had nothing more to lose at that point, so I went ahead and straightened the wig.</li>

            <li> Of course this one comes up first because it&#x27;s got a lot of reviews, seemingly good reviews, etc.</li>
            <li> When it first comes out of the box, the hair is fairly evenly separated on both sides of the bangs.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not a bad thing if you want to braid it or do some kind of updo.</li>
            <li> I would buy another one in an instant and very good quality and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wig with shorter bangs (would be perfect to trim straight across for a straight bang look)</li>

            <li> so I was able to get it with the free 2 day shipping.  </li>
            <li> but it was here on time, packaged neat with everything included, great quality, color as expected, easy to work with and nice fitting.  </li>
            <li> Overall for the price though, it was a good purchase!</li>
            <li> It does shed and tangle easily</li>
            <li> Got this for my cousin who is in love with wearing wigs the hair is good and soft</li>
            <li> Just need for a party costume but is actually a pretty nice wig.</li>
            <li> Firstly, know you will have to spend some time working on this wig to make it your own.</li>
            <li> I did it the popular way, by boiling a pot of water, taking a cup and scooping the boiling water onto the wig&#x27;s hair until it was covered in the hot water and</li>
            <li> I did it the popular way, by boiling a pot of water, taking a cup and scooping the boiling water onto the wig&#x27;s hair until it was covered in the hot water and</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how soft the hair was, how realistic it felt and looked.</li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m pretty pleased :)</li>
            <li> This wig is very beautiful and I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Trimmed it to fit my style.</li>
            <li> I had to kind of take the hair piece by piece and comb it straight and continue to do that.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s so light that it feels TOO light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t bend the hair when drying it otherwise</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t bend the hair when drying it otherwise</li>
            <li> adjustable to fit your head just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Before buying this item, keep in mind that it is cheap, so you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I believe someone else experienced a similar problem.</li>
            <li> But the tangling is 90% better than it was, and it looks soooo much better and straight.</li>
            <li> But the tangling is 90% better than it was, and it looks soooo much better and straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not the best that money could buy but it shipped fast and it fits well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly real-looking, not too shiny, and relatively soft.</li>
            <li> In the main picture for the straight brown wig it appears that they were kind of able to do that, but I have not been able to get it to look that way.</li>
            <li> Eh, this wig is okay, takes a lot of work to get it to sit right.</li>
            <li> super quick and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, worth what I paid, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how the cap part was made.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be realistic, NOT some kind of costume wig.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care what you want.&amp;#34; And the bangs are significantly rougher and stiffer than the rest of the wig which is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was almost perfect, very few tangles that I had to release.</li>
            <li> and the hair was still nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> a pretty good wig, very straight hair and looks pretty spot on to the photo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product would be perfect if the bangs weren&#x27;t so dang hard to keep in place.</li>
            <li> But as long as you keep the handy comb with you there are no problems!</li>
            <li> after literally about 20 minutes of just simply pulling my fingers through the hair and combing it, I think I have it all good to go.</li>
            <li> I would love to know how they got it that straight.</li>
            <li> I would love to know how they got it that straight.</li>
            <li> but it did come with a cool comb, and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet,</li>
            <li> tangles pretty easily</li>
            <li> pretty easily.</li>
            <li> pretty easily but not too bad&lt;br /&gt;-The comb that came with it</li>
            <li> but I was happy to see that it already is layered, and is not flat and straight at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Bangs are important to me, and important that they really form to your face.</li>
            <li> the end of the day, if you can&#x27;t afford a nicer wig but want a realistic looking one, this one is ok.</li>
            <li> I do wish the bangs were longer (if they were chin-length it would look a lot more flattering to anyone&#x27;s face) but that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.</li>

            <li> The wig is very lightweight, soft, and seems good quality.</li>
            <li> I trimmed the bangs because they were too long to look good on me, but that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cool roller comb works great, but still takes a little effort.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a hair net, but I suggest getting your own because the one they give you is pretty basic and stretches so easily that it&#x27;s pretty much good for just one use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure a wig shouldn&#x27;t shed as much as mine did.</li>
            <li> Get tangled easily and way too much fall out.</li>
            <li> so I could trim the bangs exactly how I wanted!</li>
            <li> * convinced it was real hair on film, even though I knew I was wearing a wig!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the most natural-looking wigs I&#x27;ve tried, and I got an entire box full of them!</li>
            <li> I like ordering cheap wigs because I get to experiment with styling without worrying about messing up too much.</li>
            <li> All in all tho, worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for a wig worth the price.</li>
            <li> I noticed from trying to play with the bangs that when I&#x27;d comb the bangs or part the bangs, part of the rest of the hair that are near the bangs would get caught with the bangs and then switch sides since it all comes from a point at the top.</li>
            <li> At this point I gave up and accepted that it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that it would look and feel like freshly straightened hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had hopes that it would look and feel like freshly straightened hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came nicely packaged, along with a wig brush and some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I have ordered this particular wig in both straight and curly and absolutely love both.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> is just right.</li>
            <li> This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was nice and VERY realistic, especially if you&#x27;re of Asian heritage because that looks like the kind of hair the wig was based off from.</li>
            <li> only issue I have with it, is that it seems to tangle very easily.</li>
            <li> Little issue with the bangs but overall the wig is great!</li>
            <li> straight and for the most part soft</li>
            <li> The hair is really soft and you can style it easily.</li>
            <li> The option to adjust to fit is clearly a bonus!</li>
            <li> This wig does not look good parted down the middle, and I did expect that since the bangs come from the top of the head.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> it gets pretty unmanageable.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my first wig purchase</li>
            <li> I just simply wanted to be able to see out my damn eyes</li>
            <li> It felt and looked exactly like freshly straightened real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to move my star rating because I was still underwhelmed when I first got the wig.</li>
            <li> It felt and looked exactly like freshly straightened real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to move my star rating because I was still underwhelmed when I first got the wig.</li>
            <li> but I may have to borrow it very soon!  </li>
            <li> I already left a review but had to again because I love this wig SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer, and used this wig for a Tomb Raider fan film.</li>
            <li> The hair; top hat piece is made for a big head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not at all as dark as it is in the picture and is more of a light brown.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that part of the reviews were actually wrong, since a lot of people say this tangles easily.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t perfectly part the bangs down the middle due to the fact that they all come out from the top of the head.</li>
            <li> Lovely and thick, cut it to shorten but otherwise lovely color and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it one star for their mistake is that in truth after the initially shock/disappointment I really loved the wig.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly pretty and realistic looking for the price!  </li>
            <li> I am not 100% positive if this wig is heat resistant.</li>
            <li> now when im alone at home (always), i can walk around with this sexy long hair</li>
            <li> I went back to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; parting it down the middle, again attempting to perfect it.</li>
            <li> After playing with it a bit, it pretty much reverted back to what it originally was.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of such a cheap wig</li>
            <li> The texture and appearance are so real</li>
            <li> and it will shine and smell like real hair.</li>
            <li> , my friends thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> I ordered the straight brown one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t an issue for you, I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> haired one, which means it won&#x27;t have as much body.</li>
            <li> And on the plus side, you really can&#x27;t see much of the foundation of the wig itself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much practical use for this wig</li>
            <li> But I really went into detail with everything that I did so</li>
            <li> all the hair was straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MANDATORY that if you buy the straight wig you have to straighten its hair this way.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s fantastic, and will definitely buy from this store again.</li>
            <li> Maybe because i got the brown straight one??</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t tangle so much</li>
            <li> I ended up trimming mine quite a bit, but not too much of a hassle to do.</li>
            <li> The hair for the back part of the wig is a nice length, but I like my front/sides to be shorter than the back.</li>
            <li> The hair for the back part of the wig is a nice length, but I like my front/sides to be shorter than the back.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting a wig comb or brush, because it tends to tangle easily and frizz by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> My expectations were pretty low considering how cheap this wig is, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to wear a hat while walking around just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t start slipping off my head!</li>
            <li> Everyone talks this thing up so much, saying that it&#x27;s such high quality and feels/looks like a more expensive wig - basically saying it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I have to pat it down, the top has a scalp looking color that shows where the hairline is.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that it tangles.</li>
            <li> was not at all expecting it to look realistic...</li>
            <li> If you want a realistic wig, you have to get styling.</li>
            <li> I actually think if they were a big longer it would be better, then maybe they would go to the side easier.</li>
            <li> My expectations were too high mainly from these amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m not a professional wig wearer, I don&#x27;t have a collection of real/fake wigs, and I&#x27;m not even familiar with how wigs work.</li>
            <li> It tangled the first 5mins and it was not dark brown.</li>
            <li> The nice smooth quality does not last very long and the hair tends to look very messy very fast.</li>
            <li> Now if they would make some long ones with a different top style I might buy another one.</li>
            <li> Better for costume wear rather than everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the wig is fine.</li>
            <li> a psychopath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please note its super long and gets hella tangle-y.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much wanted them all far to the left and out of my face.</li>
            <li> I have straighten the hair and it makes it look like it is brand new.</li>
            <li> Very soft and feminine...</li>
            <li> Can easily be fixed with a hat!</li>
            <li> I took it out of the package and before even taking it out of the netting it comes in, I was both impressed and disappointed.</li>
            <li> And wow, I could not believe the difference!</li>
            <li> And wow, I could not believe the difference!</li>
            <li> I only bought it for Halloween, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned, but it is much higher quality than I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how natural this wig looks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this wig, and some of my friends even said they forget it&#x27;s not my natural hair!</li>
            <li> Its good for its price,however do not expect the quality to be fantastic,  you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered a black and received a light brown.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to flip the front part and play with it, while the back part stays down.</li>

            <li> With real hair you can at least easily separate your bangs and part it.</li>
            <li> I then combed it straight again and let it air dry STRAIGHT.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a realistic looking straight wig with long hair, I now say buy this.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve naturally brown hair</li>
            <li> At least the curled version would look cute and done.</li>
            <li> At least the curled version would look cute and done.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t really bother me much,so overall</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old to go with her Rapunzel Costume.  </li>
            <li> Seem so natural.</li>
            <li> color and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very there is only one telling part of the wig</li>
            <li> Cut, thin, whatever you want for it to frame your face nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to make a nice braid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 only because it tangles so easily and its pretty hard to maintain once it gets all messed up, so I suggest having some products that&#x27;s meant for taming wig hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, you can brush it, but make sure to wash it once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds</li>
            <li> My first recommendation is NOT to mess with the bangs too much after you put it on.</li>
            <li> but it get a little tangled pretty fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> but I pretty much know nothing other than basic logic when it comes to wigs.</li>
            <li> one con: it tangles so easily, you can barely turn your head without a small birds nest.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a thick wig and is the thinnest wig I have personally tried on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too long to flip around really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too long to flip around really.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll dry that way with the bend and it won&#x27;t be straight.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll dry that way with the bend and it won&#x27;t be straight.  </li>
            <li> I felt like the broad from that movie &amp;#34;The Ring&amp;#34; or Cousin It.</li>
            <li> a decent style before I styled it, long so I could work on layers</li>
            <li> after trying to part the bangs down the middle, I then went with what I originally wanted to do, which was move all the bangs to the left side.</li>
            <li> All I did was wet the wig with cold water, combed the wig to make sure everything was detangled and straight, then poured the hot water over it.</li>
            <li> All I did was wet the wig with cold water, combed the wig to make sure everything was detangled and straight, then poured the hot water over it.</li>
            <li> It is very windy here and it onlt makes the detangling even harder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough or naggy like a lot of synthetic wigs are.</li>
            <li> The wig is naturally really wavy, NOT straight like I was expecting it.</li>
            <li> had to straighten it myself at a low temperature until it was completely straightened.</li>
            <li> the bangs are kind of weird to part</li>
            <li> This hair is too soft and slightly frizzy (though it really doesn&#x27;t look that frizzy) to not add anything to it.</li>
            <li> This hair is too soft and slightly frizzy (though it really doesn&#x27;t look that frizzy) to not add anything to it.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, less than $20 for a realistic wig is not going to get you very far, and I should have known that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It washed just fine, and I used it for a few months before finally being done with it, not because it was run down or anything, more because I got tired of long hair</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look fake, soft, combs out easily and color</li>
            <li> It feels very luxurious, and as I read in another review, I was expecting something a little cheaper for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser, Grandmother-in-law and several other people were amazed I got it for less than $20, and everyone thought it was real!</li>
            <li> I was immediately put off, and began swimming my face out of the bangs and naturally attempted to part the bangs down the middle.</li>
            <li> Pretty, very well made, but the hairs are so long and difficult to keep un-tangled.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I repeated this process dozens of times and kept getting knots.</li>
            <li> This is where I noticed the odd part of the wig that is near the scalp.</li>
            <li> This straight version is pretty much just flat and boring, but yet not flat because it&#x27;s actually a bit wavy - definitely not like in the picture.</li>

            <li> The hair net also with pins kept slipping off.</li>

            <li> I like having my front/sides about down to the center of my boobs, and the back part (when pulled forward) stretching to above my belly button.</li>
            <li> Because after you put it on you will realize the bangs are very very long.</li>
            <li> This wig, as others have stated, is VERY long.</li>
            <li> The bangs are also rather thick, which is nice in theory because you can&#x27;t see the wig part underneith - but that also makes it really difficult to part the bangs evenly like I</li>
            <li> I started running my fingers through the hair, the &amp;#34;pre-comb&amp;#34; thing we ladies do, and there were a few snags but it didn&#x27;t seem anything major.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people that aren&#x27;t gonna wear it every single day</li>
            <li> It is still pretty thin</li>
            <li> It is still pretty thin</li>
            <li> it goes down just below my mid section.</li>

            <li> The wig was so long that I actually had to then trim a few inches off from the bottom.</li>
            <li> The hair fibers themselves are very thin which could be why it feels so soft and realistic.</li>
            <li> think a lot of the tangling problems are due to the fact that the wig is so long.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of the tangling problems are due to the fact that the wig is so long.</li>
            <li> and it says the cap is for small-average but the wig kept slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> I got this wig the day before it was expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, however I definitely expected better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything just comes out from this center part of the wig.</li>
            <li> Considering the price I would&#x27;nt have expected it to be any other quality than what I got...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve openly admitted to knowing very little about wigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve openly admitted to knowing very little about wigs.</li>
            <li> as faked as other wigs I ordered&lt;br /&gt;-Had</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers and pictures show, the hair looks and feels like it&#x27;s burnt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rough towards the scalp</li>
            <li> However that may be impossible since all the hair comes from the top center of the wig which makes it hard to cut or trim.</li>
            <li> However that may be impossible since all the hair comes from the top center of the wig which makes it hard to cut or trim.</li>
            <li> The bangs are not right either.</li>
            <li> I think I have an average head and its lumpy on the inside</li>
            <li> Thick and actually heavy.&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> /&gt;After taking it out of the netting, I allowed the hair to flow down and sort of held the wig up to get an idea of it.</li>
            <li> Made it about down to my chin before I caught a knot.</li>
            <li> Now instead of it going down to my butt</li>
            <li> Now instead of it going down to my butt</li>
            <li> so the braid hangs down over one shoulder.</li>
            <li> Will be buying the other styles!</li>
            <li> While yes it still got slightly tangled, it&#x27;s synthetic</li>
            <li> While yes it still got slightly tangled, it&#x27;s synthetic</li>
            <li> I received the package after a day and a half shipping.</li>
            <li> but I was eexpecting the black one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had my hopes too high.</li>
            <li> I got this wig as a secondary to a curly long haired wig I had that I didn&#x27;t want to take the time to straighten and then curl again XD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy long, like lower back long -</li>
            <li> Not in a super bad way</li>
            <li> but a little oilsheen will stop that from being so bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then started to play around with the hair a little.</li>
            <li> I have recently started wearing wigs because my natural hair is impossible.</li>
            <li> have been wearing it as an everyday wig and it&#x27;s holding up</li>
            <li> But it gets so tangled after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have trouble curling it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that enough, you have to think of the logistics behind that.</li>
            <li> Flipping it around, pushing it behind my shoulder and back.</li>
            <li> It went down past my nose.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap runs small, so I had to leave it unhooked, and it was still a bit tight.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I could tell it was going to be much thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get really ugly looking tangled, but a lot of smaller tangles that means I can&#x27;t just run my fingers through the hair after wearing it for even a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bangs are a little wonky</li>
            <li> and I was given an eerie 70s middle part feeling.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely fake looking a big waste of money because when i try to brush it the hair just falls out and gets all over everything when i move!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to make a ponytail</li>
            <li> It was quite confusing.</li>
            <li> All these reviews talk about how thick it is.</li>
            <li> I wanted a thick wig.</li>
            <li> But these bangs are so thick it&#x27;s like it tells you, &amp;#34;No bitch</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for that thick feel, this wig isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS BEYOND FRUSTRATING and because there is no easily noticable from area of the wig</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily look bad if you&#x27;re not paying attention to it, but it&#x27;s just weird and is probably part of why it&#x27;s so hard to separate the hair on this wig.</li>
            <li> I did it the ghetto but sure-fire way, by putting it on my head, putting my head upside down, gathering all the hair in a ponytail and cutting it that way.</li>

            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s kinda thin.</li>
            <li> I had hairs going all different direction, it was annoying, being the perfectionist that I am.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I decided to cut it how I wanted it in order to save this poor thing.</li>
            <li> I decided to cut it how I wanted it in order to save this poor thing.</li>
            <li> I washed in cold water with shampoo, condition then air dried.</li>
            <li> not the ugly one chloe, one of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> u gotta brush the side real hard or it will look trashy</li>
            <li> SO FRUSTRATING!</li>

            <li> Tangles like crazy, so that limits my wearing of it because I&#x27;m tired of brushing it out.</li>
            <li> The wig is also very thin on hair</li>
            <li> but I should have held on to it for that purpose just to practice restyling and cutting</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to tell which pieces of hair should go on which side.</li>
            <li> I realized that was going to be impossible.</li>
            <li> I purchased a &amp;#34;Disney&amp;#34; (Could have been knock off) from the Spirit Superstore to go with her costume for $24.99 that was thin, tangled and a HORRIBLE quality!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong one!!!</li>
            <li> either way it&#x27;s a terrible looking wig and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone i know.</li>
            <li> This was horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, never ordering from this person again.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE QUALITY TANGLE IN ONE DAY</li>

            <li> I have recently started wearing wigs because my natural hair is impossible. I have ordered this particular wig in both straight and curly and absolutely love both. The option to adjust to fit is clearly a bonus! The texture and appearance are so real no one noticed it being a wig. I love this product and brand!</li>
            <li> Just need for a party costume but is actually a pretty nice wig. The quality is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Considering the price I would&#x27;nt have expected it to be any other quality than what I got... It was shedding a lot. There is no closure on the wig at all and it says the cap is for small-average but the wig kept slipping off my head. The hair net also with pins kept slipping off. I&#x27;m no wig expert but I&#x27;m pretty sure a wig shouldn&#x27;t shed as much as mine did. Very disappointed. Will be getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong one!!!</li>
            <li> Lovely and thick, cut it to shorten but otherwise lovely color and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Came super quick and the packaging is adorable. Comes with wig cap and comb&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing it as an everyday wig and it&#x27;s holding up fine!&lt;br /&gt;Only one con: it tangles so easily, you can barely turn your head without a small birds nest. But as long as you keep the handy comb with you there are no problems! Spitz it with some detangling spray and it will shine and smell like real hair. Looks amazing with hats! Will be buying the other styles!</li>
            <li> Very nice wig for the price,Not too shiny so it doesn&#x27;t look fake, soft, combs out easily and color is just right. Now if they would make some long ones with a different top style I might buy another one. Cap fits well too.</li>
            <li> I got this wig as a secondary to a curly long haired wig I had that I didn&#x27;t want to take the time to straighten and then curl again XD&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty good wig, very straight hair and looks pretty spot on to the photo.&lt;br /&gt;It tangles pretty easily but a little oilsheen will stop that from being so bad.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a little wonky but you can trim and reset them with some steam heat generally.&lt;br /&gt;There are loads of tutorials on trimming and maintaining your synthetic wigs on youtube so I suggest you check those out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washed just fine, and I used it for a few months before finally being done with it, not because it was run down or anything, more because I got tired of long hair hah.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even think to cut it but I should have held on to it for that purpose just to practice restyling and cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m pretty pleased :)</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect , it is just like real hair 😍😍 You never feel like it&#x27;s wig , my friends thought it was my real hair 😂❤️</li>
            <li> This wig is very beautiful and I wear it everyday. But it gets so tangled after a few hours.I am constantly running my fingers through it. And it sheds when I am getting the tangles out. I have straighten the hair and it makes it look like it is brand new. I have trouble curling it so I don not think it curls well. The hair is also way to long. It about 24&amp;#34;. I am going to cut it. The main problem is that it tangles. It is very windy here and it onlt makes the detangling even harder. Other than that, the wig is fine. Its not the best but it will do not mind combing it out every night. And I recommend using the comb that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Tangle all the time can&#x27;t brush it. Wear it one time it looks like a rat nest</li>
            <li> I liked it but the sculp hair is damaged I guess .&lt;br /&gt;IS it suppose  to be like that,?</li>
            <li> I got this wig the day before it was expected and I was so excited! Great shipping. Its really soft and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like fake cheap costume wigs. It does tangle very easily though but can be combed with the comb included. I like wearing it with a beanie and I&#x27;ll go out in public while wearing it. the bangs are kind of weird to part but I still love the wig!</li>
            <li> I cant believe this thing only cost $20!  Ive had short hair forever, so decided to wig it up for s***s and giggles. was not at all expecting it to look realistic...but it totes does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so now when im alone at home (always), i can walk around with this sexy long hair like im a goddamn kardashian.  not the ugly one chloe, one of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sometimes i like to do laundry in it, or just watch tv in it, methodically combing it like a psychopath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please note its super long and gets hella tangle-y.  but it cost $20 so get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, your cat may or may not be terrified of you in it, and that alone is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;big thank you to the asians who made this, as always you excel at everything you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but can you please make a blonde one? i might pick up webcam modeling now and im sure blondes make more money.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, worth what I paid, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how the cap part was made. When I put it on it made my head look misshapen even after I tightened the straps. Can easily be fixed with a hat! All in all tho, worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for a wig worth the price.</li>
            <li> I chose three stars because you are getting what you are paying for. The nice smooth quality does not last very long and the hair tends to look very messy very fast. Its good for its price,however do not expect the quality to be fantastic,  you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig is BEAUTIFUL! The hair is so long so I could trim the bangs exactly how I wanted! My hair dresser, Grandmother-in-law and several other people were amazed I got it for less than $20, and everyone thought it was real! Isn&#x27;t like those cheap plastic wigs at all!</li>
            <li> Okay. Here is the thing about this wig. I ordered the straight brown one. Firstly, know you will have to spend some time working on this wig to make it your own. If you want a realistic wig, you have to get styling. Cut, thin, whatever you want for it to frame your face nicely. It isn&#x27;t just a out of the package looks like magic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some pros and cons to this wig:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Color matched what I ordered&lt;br /&gt;-Was straight and for the most part soft&lt;br /&gt;-Not as faked as other wigs I ordered&lt;br /&gt;-Had a decent style before I styled it, long so I could work on layers&lt;br /&gt;-Not TOO shiny&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;-Came with wig cap just incase you needed one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Tangles pretty easily. Honestly you could just sit there and it&#x27;d just tangle.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s kinda thin. Not in a super bad way but if I didn&#x27;t style it, this wouldn&#x27;t work out well.&lt;br /&gt;-After a couple days of use it gets pretty unmanageable. I mean, you can brush it, but make sure to wash it once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds pretty easily but not too bad&lt;br /&gt;-The comb that came with it SUCKED. Good thing it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent wig, especially for the price. I like ordering cheap wigs because I get to experiment with styling without worrying about messing up too much. I am not 100% positive if this wig is heat resistant. I never curled it but at a low temperature I straightened it and it didn&#x27;t horrifically melt off like some horror movie and it did straighten. So I really don&#x27;t know. Either way, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because of the tangle problem. If that isn&#x27;t an issue for you, I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of such a cheap wig but I love it! I got it for work because my hair is shaved and this does the job. Trimmed it to fit my style.</li>
            <li> My expectations were too high mainly from these amazon reviews. I&#x27;ve naturally brown hair but I dye it blonde, and instead of repeatedly dying my hair when I feel like a change, I thought &amp;#34;oh hey a wig would be fun!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not a professional wig wearer, I don&#x27;t have a collection of real/fake wigs, and I&#x27;m not even familiar with how wigs work. This wasn&#x27;t my first wig purchase but I pretty much know nothing other than basic logic when it comes to wigs. So anyway, I was online and decided to start looking at potential wigs to buy. Of course this one comes up first because it&#x27;s got a lot of reviews, seemingly good reviews, etc. Everyone talks this thing up so much, saying that it&#x27;s such high quality and feels/looks like a more expensive wig - basically saying it&#x27;s a good bargain. I disagree. It&#x27;s priced accordingly in my opinion. This is supposed to be realistic, NOT some kind of costume wig. With that in mind, less than $20 for a realistic wig is not going to get you very far, and I should have known that. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, however I definitely expected better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now into my experience with the wig. I took it out of the package and before even taking it out of the netting it comes in, I was both impressed and disappointed. I was impressed at how soft the hair was, how realistic it felt and looked. I really do love the color and the look and feel of the hair itself. I was disappointed because I could tell it was going to be much thinner than expected. All these reviews talk about how thick it is. I wanted a thick wig. This is NOT a thick wig and is the thinnest wig I have personally tried on. The hair fibers themselves are very thin which could be why it feels so soft and realistic. And yes I know I purchased the &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; haired one, which means it won&#x27;t have as much body. I&#x27;m taking that into consideration here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking it out of the netting, I allowed the hair to flow down and sort of held the wig up to get an idea of it. It is layered already. I was worried I would have to layer it myself but I was happy to see that it already is layered, and is not flat and straight at the bottom. I ran my fingers through the hair to see how tangled it was. It was almost perfect, very few tangles that I had to release. I was happy to see that part of the reviews were actually wrong, since a lot of people say this tangles easily. But I will soon change my mind and agree with all the reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I then... attempted, to put the wig onto my head. It was quite confusing. As many others have said, the hair comes out from the top of the wig. There is no part. Everything just comes out from this center part of the wig. When it first comes out of the box, the hair is fairly evenly separated on both sides of the bangs. My first recommendation is NOT to mess with the bangs too much after you put it on. You should know how you want your bangs before playing with it. Because after you put it on you will realize the bangs are very very long. I felt like the broad from that movie &amp;#34;The Ring&amp;#34; or Cousin It. It went down past my nose. I was immediately put off, and began swimming my face out of the bangs and naturally attempted to part the bangs down the middle. I realized that was going to be impossible. You can&#x27;t perfectly part the bangs down the middle due to the fact that they all come out from the top of the head. The bangs are also rather thick, which is nice in theory because you can&#x27;t see the wig part underneith - but that also makes it really difficult to part the bangs evenly like I oh so wanted to. But I tried anyway, I swallowed my pride and gave up trying to make them perfect. I looked at the mirror and I was given an eerie 70s middle part feeling. This wig does not look good parted down the middle, and I did expect that since the bangs come from the top of the head. I can&#x27;t say that enough, you have to think of the logistics behind that. With real hair you can at least easily separate your bangs and part it. But these bangs are so thick it&#x27;s like it tells you, &amp;#34;No bitch I&#x27;m not parting for you and I don&#x27;t care what you want.&amp;#34; And the bangs are significantly rougher and stiffer than the rest of the wig which is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after trying to part the bangs down the middle, I then went with what I originally wanted to do, which was move all the bangs to the left side.I pretty much wanted them all far to the left and out of my face. Bangs are important to me, and important that they really form to your face. These will not do that. In the main picture for the straight brown wig it appears that they were kind of able to do that, but I have not been able to get it to look that way. And even in the picture it is not the way I want it to be. I don&#x27;t want to have emo looking hair with my bangs in my face. I wanted them further to the side. I actually think if they were a big longer it would be better, then maybe they would go to the side easier. This is where I noticed the odd part of the wig that is near the scalp. Like other reviewers and pictures show, the hair looks and feels like it&#x27;s burnt. It&#x27;s really strange. It&#x27;s very rough towards the scalp and you can see it when you try and separate the bangs. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily look bad if you&#x27;re not paying attention to it, but it&#x27;s just weird and is probably part of why it&#x27;s so hard to separate the hair on this wig. And on the plus side, you really can&#x27;t see much of the foundation of the wig itself. Even when &amp;#34;parted&amp;#34; you almost can&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving up on the side bang I went back to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; parting it down the middle, again attempting to perfect it. But it wasn&#x27;t happening. I just simply wanted to be able to see out my damn eyes so I kept it parted. I then moved onto the rest of the wig. I noticed from trying to play with the bangs that when I&#x27;d comb the bangs or part the bangs, part of the rest of the hair that are near the bangs would get caught with the bangs and then switch sides since it all comes from a point at the top. THIS WAS BEYOND FRUSTRATING and because there is no easily noticable from area of the wig it&#x27;s very difficult to tell which pieces of hair should go on which side. I had hairs going all different direction, it was annoying, being the perfectionist that I am. But I was glad the hair didn&#x27;t seem to be too tangled still! I started running my fingers through the hair, the &amp;#34;pre-comb&amp;#34; thing we ladies do, and there were a few snags but it didn&#x27;t seem anything major. and the hair was still nice and soft and smooth. It&#x27;s not rough or naggy like a lot of synthetic wigs are. I then grabbed the comb it came with. Weirdest comb ever but it makes sense for a wig. I started from the top. Made it about down to my chin before I caught a knot. Long story short, I repeated this process dozens of times and kept getting knots. SO FRUSTRATING! I didn&#x27;t understand how this was happening. It felt like the hair was infused together and I had to rip it apart just to get the comb to go through without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY after literally about 20 minutes of just simply pulling my fingers through the hair and combing it, I think I have it all good to go. I had to kind of take the hair piece by piece and comb it straight and continue to do that. Kind of like how you straighten your hair. The wig is naturally really wavy, NOT straight like I was expecting it. But then again it was bunched up inside of the box so you have to kind of expect that. Unfortunately I had my hopes too high. Anyway, after combing it that way it did start to get straighter. At this point I started to think maybe there was hope. I then started to play around with the hair a little. Flipping it around, pushing it behind my shoulder and back. I like to play with my hair. I can&#x27;t just leave my hair alone. After playing with it a bit, it pretty much reverted back to what it originally was. It was a bit frizzy and knotted allover like before. At this point I gave up and accepted that it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with. This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon. I have not yet added any kind of detangler or smoothing hair stuff to it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to have to. This hair is too soft and slightly frizzy (though it really doesn&#x27;t look that frizzy) to not add anything to it. Plus it&#x27;s so light that it feels TOO light. I have to add something to give it some weight/thickness. I love the way it feels this way but unfortunately it just gets too tangly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of the tangling problems are due to the fact that the wig is so long. It really is a long wig. If you&#x27;re like me and want to try the straightened version of it, thinking you&#x27;ll be able to play with it more, don&#x27;t do it. I regret not buying the curled version. At least the curled version would look cute and done. This straight version is pretty much just flat and boring, but yet not flat because it&#x27;s actually a bit wavy - definitely not like in the picture. I would love to know how they got it that straight. I had hopes that it would look and feel like freshly straightened hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, if you can&#x27;t afford a nicer wig but want a realistic looking one, this one is ok. Just know that it tangles very easily and is not something you&#x27;ll want if you like to play with your hair. It&#x27;s too long to flip around really. I&#x27;m thinking of trying to cut it the way that I want. However that may be impossible since all the hair comes from the top center of the wig which makes it hard to cut or trim. The hair for the back part of the wig is a nice length, but I like my front/sides to be shorter than the back. I like having my front/sides about down to the center of my boobs, and the back part (when pulled forward) stretching to above my belly button. I like being able to flip the front part and play with it, while the back part stays down. I don&#x27;t have much practical use for this wig so maybe I&#x27;ll give it a shot and try trimming it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll go well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my review from wearing it about an hour now. I&#x27;ve openly admitted to knowing very little about wigs. Maybe I did something wrong. But I really went into detail with everything that I did so you can take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I decided to cut it how I wanted it in order to save this poor thing. I did it the ghetto but sure-fire way, by putting it on my head, putting my head upside down, gathering all the hair in a ponytail and cutting it that way. It needed more layers and this way always works well with wigs. I ended up giving myself layers all the way up to my shoulder, and I loved it. The wig was so long that I actually had to then trim a few inches off from the bottom. Now instead of it going down to my butt it goes down just below my mid section. I still wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with it, because it still kept getting tangled so easily, and it just didn&#x27;t look like it was &amp;#34;done.&amp;#34; I had nothing more to lose at that point, so I went ahead and straightened the wig. I did it the popular way, by boiling a pot of water, taking a cup and scooping the boiling water onto the wig&#x27;s hair until it was covered in the hot water and all the hair was straight. I tried to do the bangs as well but that didn&#x27;t come out as well &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t have something to hold the wig and I didn&#x27;t wanna burn my hands. And wow, I could not believe the difference! It&#x27;s MANDATORY that if you buy the straight wig you have to straighten its hair this way. I did not use any kind of conditioners or spray on detanglers. All I did was wet the wig with cold water, combed the wig to make sure everything was detangled and straight, then poured the hot water over it. I then combed it straight again and let it air dry STRAIGHT. It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t bend the hair when drying it otherwise it&#x27;ll dry that way with the bend and it won&#x27;t be straight.  Like night and day! It felt and looked exactly like freshly straightened real hair. While yes it still got slightly tangled, it&#x27;s synthetic so that is going to happen no matter what. But the tangling is 90% better than it was, and it looks soooo much better and straight. If you&#x27;re looking for a realistic looking straight wig with long hair, I now say buy this. I&#x27;m not going to move my star rating because I was still underwhelmed when I first got the wig. But if you end up not liking it, don&#x27;t worry, you can do what I did and have it look beautiful. I&#x27;d give it a 4 stars after it is straightened. I do wish the bangs were longer (if they were chin-length it would look a lot more flattering to anyone&#x27;s face) but that&#x27;s more of a personal preference. I also wish the wig was thicker. It is still pretty thin and you can tell even more after you straighten it. If you&#x27;re looking for a wig with shorter bangs (would be perfect to trim straight across for a straight bang look) this one is a good choice.it was not going to be a wig that I could have fun and play with. This is the point I am at right now, reviewing this wig on Amazon. I have not yet added any kind of detangler or smoothing hair stuff to it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to have to.

            <li> Such a great wig for the money! Bought it for a costume party and it looked amazing. The hair is really soft and you can style it easily.</li>
            <li> Beautiful item fits great nice real texture and or the price im buying a curly one too!!</li>
            <li> Its good for the price. it tangles and sheds but it did come with a cool comb, and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet, so I think its good.</li>
            <li> absolutely beautiful &amp; great quality!  I would buy another one in an instant and very good quality and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> is better than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality wig. Thick and actually heavy.&lt;br /&gt;is adjustable to fit your head just right.&lt;br /&gt;It came nicely packaged, along with a wig brush and some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;my issue with it was IT WASN&#x27;T STRAIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;I had to straighten it myself at a low temperature until it was completely straightened. It was an extra hassle and I was worried because I never straightened a wig before, but it came out well.&lt;br /&gt;after that, it looked great.</li>
            <li> Good to play for fun from time to time. But you get what you paid. Not like nature hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig, especially for the price. And it&#x27;s a Prime item so I was able to get it with the free 2 day shipping.  It feels very luxurious, and as I read in another review, I was expecting something a little cheaper for the price. I only bought it for Halloween, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned, but it is much higher quality than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it, is that it seems to tangle very easily. The cool roller comb works great, but still takes a little effort. It doesn&#x27;t get really ugly looking tangled, but a lot of smaller tangles that means I can&#x27;t just run my fingers through the hair after wearing it for even a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me much,so overall I think it&#x27;s fantastic, and will definitely buy from this store again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old to go with her Rapunzel Costume.  I didn&#x27;t want blonde because she has a darker skin tone and I didn&#x27;t care for the blonde on her.  I purchased a &amp;#34;Disney&amp;#34; (Could have been knock off) from the Spirit Superstore to go with her costume for $24.99 that was thin, tangled and a HORRIBLE quality!  After quite a bit of research I ran across this wig.  I am soooo glad I did!!  I only gave it 4 start because the bang is a bit shorter than they appear on the mannequin...but it was here on time, packaged neat with everything included, great quality, color as expected, easy to work with and nice fitting.  All of this for $16.98?  GREAT DEAL!!  She may have it for Halloween...but I may have to borrow it very soon!  I WILL be buying from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture at all it&#x27;s extremely fake looking a big waste of money because when i try to brush it the hair just falls out and gets all over everything when i move! Maybe because i got the brown straight one?? either way it&#x27;s a terrible looking wig and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone i know.</li>
            <li> Eh, this wig is okay, takes a lot of work to get it to sit right. It tangles a lot and sheds a ton! The bangs are not right either. But i guess you get what you pay for! Better for costume wear rather than everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I already left a review but had to again because I love this wig SO MUCH! I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer, and used this wig for a Tomb Raider fan film. I was so nervous about how to quality would be, or if I would even be able to put it in a ponytail, but I can!! I was able to put it up in a ponytail, and the wig had *ME* convinced it was real hair on film, even though I knew I was wearing a wig!! Here&#x27;s a screen capture so everyone can see what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> Pretty, very well made, but the hairs are so long and difficult to keep un-tangled. A lot of work.</li>
            <li> I received the package after a day and a half shipping. The package came with a hair net, comb and the hair. The hair; top hat piece is made for a big head I think I have an average head and its lumpy on the inside so the outside is bumpy I have to pat it down, the top has a scalp looking color that shows where the hairline is.</li>
            <li> This was horrible. Get tangled easily and way too much fall out. I wore it once and never took it back out. I might even cut it so minimize tangling.</li>
            <li> Before buying this item, keep in mind that it is cheap, so you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for. When it first came in, it looked very beautiful and felt smooth but after having it for about two days, the wig began tangling. It&#x27;s also not at all as dark as it is in the picture and is more of a light brown. The wig is also very thin on hair so if you&#x27;re looking for that thick feel, this wig isn&#x27;t for you. I will say that it does look cute. If you&#x27;re looking for a wig to wear temporarily(maybe a one time thing), I would recommend you purchase this wig, otherwise, don&#x27;t spend money on it.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Great job. Seem so natural. I could not ask for more. Thank you, Thank you. I am on my way for couple more wig like this one.</li>
            <li> I took away 3 stars because I received a wavy wig. I believe someone else experienced a similar problem. However, the character I am cosplaying has wavy hair most of the time and after looking at it I prefer it that way. The wig is very lightweight, soft, and seems good quality. The wig cap is not visible at all which is good.The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it one star for their mistake is that in truth after the initially shock/disappointment I really loved the wig.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with a costume.  Surprisingly pretty and realistic looking for the price!  It arrived quickly and in good packaging.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig but it get a little tangled pretty fast but you have to realize its a wig not your hair, Iv&#x27;e been getting so many complements from wearing this wig. Its un-believeable</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig to wear to work so that I could dye my hair an &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; color and I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s obviously not the best that money could buy but it shipped fast and it fits well. It does shed and tangle easily but with proper care it should last awhile. I would recommend this for people that aren&#x27;t gonna wear it every single day</li>
            <li> I ordered a black and received a light brown.  It did look gud on me but I was eexpecting the black one. It&#x27;s kinda hard to make a ponytail u gotta brush the side real hard or it will look trashy</li>
            <li> It came in a nice box ... That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it one star. It tangled the first 5mins and it was not dark brown. Horrible, never ordering from this person again.</li>
            <li> this product would be perfect if the bangs weren&#x27;t so dang hard to keep in place. other wise i  would recommend it</li>
            <li> Love love looooove it! Very soft and feminine... Very there is only one telling part of the wig and that is the front part... But in all very worth buying!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this item. It feels nice and it is very full.</li>
            <li> Great quality wig. Little issue with the bangs but overall the wig is great!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE QUALITY TANGLE IN ONE DAY</li>
            <li> My expectations were pretty low considering how cheap this wig is, but I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s fairly real-looking, not too shiny, and relatively soft. Tangles like crazy, so that limits my wearing of it because I&#x27;m tired of brushing it out. It&#x27;s crazy long, like lower back long - that&#x27;s not a bad thing if you want to braid it or do some kind of updo. You&#x27;ll have plenty of hair to work with! I like to pull the hair to one side and braid it so the braid hangs down over one shoulder. It&#x27;s thick enough to make a nice braid. I trimmed the bangs because they were too long to look good on me, but that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t tangle so much I&#x27;d give it a 5.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how natural this wig looks! It&#x27;s one of the most natural-looking wigs I&#x27;ve tried, and I got an entire box full of them! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this wig, and some of my friends even said they forget it&#x27;s not my natural hair! This wig, as others have stated, is VERY long. I ended up trimming mine quite a bit, but not too much of a hassle to do. Also, the cap runs small, so I had to leave it unhooked, and it was still a bit tight. I feel the need to wear a hat while walking around just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t start slipping off my head! Overall for the price though, it was a good purchase! I suggest getting a wig comb or brush, because it tends to tangle easily and frizz by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> Got this for my cousin who is in love with wearing wigs the hair is good and soft she wears it all the time</li>
            <li> It was nice and VERY realistic, especially if you&#x27;re of Asian heritage because that looks like the kind of hair the wig was based off from. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 only because it tangles so easily and its pretty hard to maintain once it gets all messed up, so I suggest having some products that&#x27;s meant for taming wig hair. It also comes with a hair net, but I suggest getting your own because the one they give you is pretty basic and stretches so easily that it&#x27;s pretty much good for just one use.</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo cute and nice for $ 17.00. I washed in cold water with shampoo, condition then air dried. Love, love, love it!!!</li>
