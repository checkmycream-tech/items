            <li> This product is amazing! In my early fifties &amp; wanted to fad the spots on my face. I saw results in two weeks. I also noticed my hands are now slightly lighter than my arms. I now wear latex gloves to wash my face with this product.</li>
            <li> Worked at first but stopped working after a while.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 3 days I can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
            <li> It came right on time and was so happy. it&#x27;s only been fore days so can&#x27;t say if it works, however I will say one bar is gone after only fore days so you&#x27;ll need to buy like 200 bars for a few months supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still currently using it and it has change my skin completely. It looks radiant! happy customer</li>
            <li> I saw results within a week of using the soap</li>
            <li> For many years living in India I got brown skin tone when I moved to usa my skin got little lighter ,so I did some research and came to this soap I tried this after 2 weeks my skin got pale it does work it take your skin back to the color you  were born with .now no matter how many hours I stay in the sun my skin doesn&#x27;t get darker. Great soap I will buy more in future</li>
            <li> Brightened my skin a little but I will say it leaves my skin feeling soft and it has a slight orange smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> Received order earlier than expected. Perfect packaging and I&#x27;m happy with the product. I have purchased from this seller in the past and would purchase again. Thank You!</li>
            <li> My order came really fast! Faster than expected to be honest and on top of that the product seems to do exactly what it states. It&#x27;s a little harsh so I would stop all exfoliating when using this and it can be on the drying(and burning!) side if left on too long or you don&#x27;t follow it up with a good lotion and sunscreen for protection when going outside. All in all if you&#x27;re looking for something to lighten pigmintation and scars this is a super great product to try.</li>
            <li> I love this face soap. I think it helps on my dark spots. I will continue using this.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this, but when I tryed it on my body but it made my skin xtremely dry and darker....plz DoNT BUY</li>
            <li> Great seller, product was delivered within 2 days after I place the order. It&#x27;s too soon to see if it actually fading the acne scars and blemishes. But the soap is gentle, I did not experience any type of discomfort while using it, it does leave your skin a bit dry but I guess that&#x27;s because of the acid. I have been using a water base lotion to help with the dryness. Overall I am very please with this Seller.</li>
            <li> works well good soap. love it</li>
            <li> Great soap that will last awhile.  It kind of melts, but I have it on a soap holder that drains well and soap is dry.  Gentle and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> The soap is too small</li>
            <li> Product works&#x27; very good just make sure that you use the lotion I am using this Product to even my skin tone from blotches from pimples I recommend wearing  sunscreen because without it you get really dark or wear long sleeves.</li>
            <li> Works well but the size is very small.</li>
            <li> It works really good, for those who don&#x27;t want to be super light,  use it once a day that&#x27;s works for me  if not use it twice a day. Also good for acne treatment</li>
