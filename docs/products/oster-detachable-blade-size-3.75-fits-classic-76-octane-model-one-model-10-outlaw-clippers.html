            <li> I bought this blade to try instead of the plastic comb attachments.  I gives a much cleaner, even cut with much less effort.  It does appear to look a little tighter than a #4 comb.&lt;br /&gt;Note the picture shows the better agion model but the p/n is for the standard model.  I am using this on a Forfex brand clipper and it works fine, but it is a bit snug in the fit.</li>
            <li> This size 3 3/4 AgION Clipper Blade cuts hair to 1/2\\&quot; (13mm) and fits my [[ASIN:B003U8BPY4 Oster Professional Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76]] perfectly and attaches with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the longest length clipper in the AgION group. I use this at the uppermost portion of my head and then I transition to the top with the 1/2\\&quot; comb from the [[ASIN:B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set]] mounted onto my [[ASIN:B0018C0LP8 Agion 000]] blade, which came with my clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These AgION blades are great, and they provide a quick, clean cut. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this durably built, high-quality blade. I&#x27;m sure that with proper maintenance it should last a long time. It is highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For the first 5 years that cut my own hair I used a pair of $15 clippers from wal-mart.  The blades quickly became dull and I had to to make many passes to get the job done.  A few years ago I switched to the Oster 76 and have not looked back.  The Blades for this clipper are all metal and very sharp.  After two years the blades still cut hair as effortlessly as they did when I bought them.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Came Quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect replacement for the Oster Blade!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair forever and I purchased these blades hoping for a good product .&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m happy to be a satisfied customer .</li>
            <li> Great for a buzz, not long nor short, my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classic Oster Universal comb set will NOT fit on this. Pitty.</li>
            <li> For those who prefer not to use comb attachments on their clippers, this series is top-notch in the Oster arsenal of blades. The new AgIon blades run much cooler, and are soooo much easier to clean than the older series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No combs required for ~ #4 cuts ( a little shorter)&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleanup&lt;br /&gt;Easier to lubricate on the fly&lt;br /&gt;Quick-change out system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None. But if you aren&#x27;t an experienced barber, you&#x27;ll want to be tentative about your \\&quot;side to top\\&quot; approach.&lt;br /&gt;OK, ONE con... you can&#x27;t add standard combs to this blade (but that&#x27;s the point of buying the longer one, so...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change out on these blades is super easy. They slide in, and snap down; couldn&#x27;t be any simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if there are any other clipper units that this will fit, so please note that I&#x27;m reviewing this item from the perspective of an Oster Classic 76 owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It looks very good, but I did not have time to try it. The package is different comparing with other blades, I like it, hopefully, it will last long.</li>
            <li> Oster blades are very high quality.  If you own an Oster clipper you will know the quality of Oster clippers. These blades match that high quality.</li>
            <li> Blade cuts with precision and easy to clean money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Pulled the hair had to return.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and was as described!</li>
            <li> Having the axial blade is  sooooo much more comfortable than using a guard on a small blade.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time... But it looks like it was a refurbished blade. There were nicks throughout the blade and pieces of hair in the packaging</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Great product and price...plus it arrived in a timely manner...BIG THANX!</li>
            <li> The blade is pictured and advertised as an &amp;#34;Agion Collection&amp;#34; blade.  What was sent to me was a standard series blade!</li>
            <li> These are excellent blades. They seem like they will last forever. I would definitely recommend them. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> The best investment for the do it yourself guy. I use 3 3/4 on top and 000,up to the 2  on the sides perfect the first time</li>
            <li> The product that I got came in a torn package and was obviously used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great blades, use on my oster 76 for dog grooming. Works great on matted dogs.</li>
            <li> It is not good it bull the hair and I need change or refund , it il has deferent color and it feels deferent than the other attachment that I bought :(</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time in a row that the item I purchased was not the item I recieved in the mail. I have purchased 3 Oster 76 blades with the agion antibacterial coating, and all 3 times Amazon sent me the regular Oster blade. The Agion blades are more expensive than the regular blades. I contacted Amazon and they have sent me a replacement, but I bet it is the wrong blade once again. I will write an update to this review when I recieve the new blade. If Amazon can not fix this issue they have lost a long time, loyal customer![[ASIN:B00141E4RE Oster Professional 76918-206 Replacement Blade with AgIon Antimicrobial Coating for Classic 76/Star-Teq/Power-Teq Clippers, Size #3-3/4,  1/2\\&quot; (13.0mm)]]</li>
