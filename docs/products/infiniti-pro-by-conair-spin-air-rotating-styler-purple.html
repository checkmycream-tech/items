    <ol>
            <li>got this product for christmas, it is awesome!</li>
            <li>This thing is the best hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Once it does, its awesome.</li>
            <li>It still works, just not at its best capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then this would truly be perfect.</li>
            <li>great product !  </li>
            <li>I just love it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very pleased!</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this styler!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>my hair is nice and straight and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>I told her thank you so much &amp; that I have my awesome new hairdryer to thank for good hair.</li>
            <li>I saw the commercial on this product and thought it would be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>This does an OK job, but I still have to use my straightener.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would do a much better job than it does.  </li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love mine</li>
            <li>and it makes it seem that I have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the cap around the top of the spindle catches my hair and rips out a strand or two every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>also have a hair dryer brush tool - wonderful for some haircuts and styles some times but not a total</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>boar hair bristles are better for your hair.</li>
            <li>the haircut I got two weeks ago look the best it has since I left the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to go out with a good hairstyle on the first day you use this.</li>
            <li>I loved this for the first five times I used it.</li>
            <li>I even took it with me on the cruise because it keeps giving me that nice full looking hair even when I travel.  </li>
            <li>I am a true believer!</li>
            <li>Then the buttons to make it spin stopped working easily.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, I could sure use a smaller brush like it</li>
            <li>and it still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that is fine but lots of it.</li>
            <li>have a stand that holds my hairdryer - which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like all the hot air brushes I&#x27;ve tried aren&#x27;t as good at making long-lasting curls as hot irons are.</li>
            <li>Found a lot of YouTube videos with how different people use this tool and from there I kind of figured out my own way of using as well.  </li>
            <li>This morning at the gym when I was getting ready for work this gal walks by and says you have beautiful hair which surprised me because I&#x27;ve never heard that in my life.</li>
            <li>recommend this product as a special help to those having difficulty drying and styling their hair!&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
            <li>drying alone doesnt do anything - my hair is too frizzy and I cant easily hold the brush and the blow dryer in the right position to get that perfect straight with slight curl at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is good, but i didn&#x27;t mention that it&#x27;s working only in 110 voltage.</li>
            <li>In theory its great but doesn&#x27;t get warm enough to actually style the hair.  </li>
            <li>but that turned out not to be true at all.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly too.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft so if you have more fine hair it slips through the bristles very fast.  </li>
            <li>The Infiniti is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to play with and do a bunch of twists and turns to my hair, but I have a feeling it takes lots of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>I received my Infiniti Pro last week and love it.  </li>
            <li>I find that not only does it give me volume on top</li>
            <li>things considered, I love having \\&quot;big girl hair\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Another perk is that the Infiniti is much cheaper as well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>is a laborious and often resulted in sore arms trying to heat, curl, and pull my hair straight over and over and over.  </li>
            <li>but it also curls under the ends of my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>takes a while to do your whole</li>
            <li>Really give curl and body to your hair.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed all the fantastic shine yet, but I have only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Dont forget to set the section of hair if you want curl to stay - blow dry on hair then switch to COOL until hair cools</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I thought it would be such a gimmick</li>
            <li>Hope it won&#x27;t cost much to send back.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I even bought a second one as a backup just in case they stop selling it!  </li>
            <li>Surprised how well it works.  </li>
            <li>It gives you so much volume where the Instyler burns your hands and your hair, making it look flat and brittle.</li>
            <li>so product works really well with long hair.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to not let it wind up too fast or faf!</li>
            <li>Now everyday my hair is full of body and it looks like my hairdresser Heidi styled it for me.</li>
            <li>Major con -</li>
            <li>You dont have to blow dry your hair separately first, as is necessary with straightening irons.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Works well on most of my hair, especially the back which usaully frizzes out when I use a regular round brush.  </li>
            <li>bought the Instyler recently because the Infiniti does take a while to get the job done, but it was complete garbage.</li>
            <li>When you first get it, it really needs to be broken in.</li>
            <li>it took some getting used to at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get a routine down.</li>
            <li>size ceramic flat irons are too heavy, hot and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the large brush and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to juggle a round brush and a dryer.  </li>
            <li>I typically towel dry first, put my makeup on then use the Infiniti Pro.</li>

            <li> I typically towel dry first, put my makeup on then use the Infiniti Pro.</li>
            <li> the handle is huge and fat the wire very stiff and the blow dryer part is very very minimal.</li>
            <li> It does not do well on bangs as it dries them stick straight and flat instead of with a little curve and bounce.  </li>
            <li> I tried other spin brushes but they nearly pulled my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this especially if you are uncoordinated like me trying to use a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have long hair but the brush is still too big.</li>
            <li> i actually style my hair now instead of letting it air dry or pulling it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to dry and shape thiny hair</li>
            <li> I have hair that is grey and shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a round brush and my old blow dryer and this monster sitting off to the side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have very thick hair to maybe partially dry your roots first with a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> i have thick poker straight hair that takes forever to blow dry, but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all with the spin-brush.</li>
            <li> But it help my hair to dry faster and start my styling process.</li>
            <li> - my hair looks \\&quot;done\\&quot; but not flat ironed like every other girl&#x27;s my age!</li>
            <li> wish they would make one with a little smaller size brush.</li>
            <li> Once I let my hair dry naturally a little bit</li>
            <li> The brush itself needs to be worn down a little bit because in the beginning it does pull your hair.</li>
            <li> The infiniti also does little damage to your hair compared to an iron.</li>
            <li> The item is Big ! and bulky!  very hard to use alone.</li>
            <li> maybe if you had someone do your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Straightening Irons make my hair too limp and eradicate any hope of volume or movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am disabled and my shoulders and arms are very weak.</li>
            <li> they got out a version with a smaller barrel or another product with a base and interchangeable barrels</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> HATE it.  </li>
            <li> Horrible item.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fun to play with and do a bunch of twists and turns to my hair, but I have a feeling it takes lots of practice to get it right.

            <li> Everything is good, but i didn&#x27;t mention that it&#x27;s working only in 110 voltage. No chance to use it in Europe, please keep it in mind!</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler.  HATE it.  Wish I had never purchased it.  Would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> got this product for christmas, it is awesome! i have thick poker straight hair that takes forever to blow dry, but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all with the spin-brush. i actually style my hair now instead of letting it air dry or pulling it into a pony tail. it took some getting used to at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get a routine down. my hair is nice and straight and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Horrible item.  In theory its great but doesn&#x27;t get warm enough to actually style the hair.  The bristles are soft so if you have more fine hair it slips through the bristles very fast.  I tried using it for several weeks and gave up.  It sits in a drawer now.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial on this product and thought it would be perfect for me.  I have hair that is grey and shoulder length.  This does an OK job, but I still have to use my straightener.  Thought it would do a much better job than it does.  I have to say I am a little disappointed.</li>

            <li> This thing is the best hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used. When you first get it, it really needs to be broken in. The brush itself needs to be worn down a little bit because in the beginning it does pull your hair. Once it does, its awesome. It makes my hair look like I just stepped out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Instyler recently because the Infiniti does take a while to get the job done, but it was complete garbage. The Infiniti is totally worth the wait. It gives you so much volume where the Instyler burns your hands and your hair, making it look flat and brittle.

            <li> The item is Big ! and bulky!  very hard to use alone. maybe if you had someone do your hair everyday. the handle is huge and fat the wire very stiff and the blow dryer part is very very minimal. I tried to use it for about an hour giving it every chance I could BUT... I ended up with a round brush and my old blow dryer and this monster sitting off to the side. Now it&#x27;s going back into the box. Hope it won&#x27;t cost much to send back.</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first five times I used it. Then the buttons to make it spin stopped working easily. Seems there is a short in it. I have to shake it and wiggle the buttons to get it to work.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for one of these for Xmas and she called from the gym while she was using it to rave about the thing.  Whatever.  Guess it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I CAN NOT USE IT AS THE PLUG IS FOR US ELECTRICITY AND CANNOT BE USED IN EUROPE.OF COURSE THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THIS IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> i love this product. it took me a while to get use to using it because i dont use blow dryers. But it help my hair to dry faster and start my styling process. i still have to use a curling iron or straightener because my hair gets frizzy when i use a blow dryer but thats okay i can deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this styler!  I have very curly hair and to straighten my hair is a laborious and often resulted in sore arms trying to heat, curl, and pull my hair straight over and over and over.  This product not only cut my straightening time by 30% but the result was that my hair was silkier.  I have already recommended it to my mom and friends...I am a true believer!</li>
            <li> I received my Infiniti Pro last week and love it.  I have medium length hair and this is a good product.  No need to use a blow dryer to style with this rotating styler.  It&#x27;s dual voltage too so can use it here in Australia with a plug converter and back in the States when visiting too.</li>
            <li> smooths and can give you different styles! I just love it!!!  Be careful to not let it wind up too fast or faf!</li>
            <li> I love mine I have very fine hair and it makes it seem that I have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.  So I brought a second one.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the same results as I did with my blowout from the salon.  When I first saw this product I thought it would be such a gimmick but that turned out not to be true at all.  Once I let my hair dry naturally a little bit I use this rotating styler. I find that not only does it give me volume on top but it also curls under the ends of my hair very well.  I have hair that just goes below the shoulder so product works really well with long hair.  Found a lot of YouTube videos with how different people use this tool and from there I kind of figured out my own way of using as well.  I even took it with me on the cruise because it keeps giving me that nice full looking hair even when I travel.  I&#x27;ve had this for well over a year and it is never overheated I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it and it still going strong.  I like it so much that I even bought a second one as a backup just in case they stop selling it!  For me this product works</li>
            <li> Straightening Irons make my hair too limp and eradicate any hope of volume or movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow drying alone doesnt do anything - my hair is too frizzy and I cant easily hold the brush and the blow dryer in the right position to get that perfect straight with slight curl at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend putting product in your hair before using it (while hair is still wet/damp). I use Fekkai Thickening Mousse and a tiny bit of BioSilk Serum.&lt;br /&gt;- You dont have to blow dry your hair separately first, as is necessary with straightening irons.&lt;br /&gt;- Dont forget to set the section of hair if you want curl to stay - blow dry on hair then switch to COOL until hair cools down.&lt;br /&gt;- Major con - the cap around the top of the spindle catches my hair and rips out a strand or two every time I use it.  I had to put electrical tape around the cap where it meets the spindle.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesnt blow the fuse in my house like my darn hair dryer does.&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to do your whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I love having \\&quot;big girl hair\\&quot; - my hair looks \\&quot;done\\&quot; but not flat ironed like every other girl&#x27;s my age!</li>
            <li> Works well on most of my hair, especially the back which usaully frizzes out when I use a regular round brush.  Straightens and dries at the same time.  It does not do well on bangs as it dries them stick straight and flat instead of with a little curve and bounce.  Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long hair but the brush is still too big. The idea is great, I could sure use a smaller brush like it</li>
            <li> Great product. Really give curl and body to your hair. Wish it had a smaller barrel, that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. I recently cut my hair and now its too short for the brush to work correctly. It still works, just not at its best capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they got out a version with a smaller barrel or another product with a base and interchangeable barrels then this would truly be perfect.</li>
            <li> This morning at the gym when I was getting ready for work this gal walks by and says you have beautiful hair which surprised me because I&#x27;ve never heard that in my life. I told her thank you so much &amp; that I have my awesome new hairdryer to thank for good hair. After showing it to her she said she was going to go home and order one on Amazon. I have shoulder length hair that is fine but lots of it. I also have side bangs which can be unruly at times and this has ended that problem. I typically towel dry first, put my makeup on then use the Infiniti Pro. I&#x27;d say if you have very thick hair to maybe partially dry your roots first with a regular hair dryer. I highly recommend this especially if you are uncoordinated like me trying to use a round brush and hair dryer. Now everyday my hair is full of body and it looks like my hairdresser Heidi styled it for me. LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> great product !  wish they would make one with a little smaller size brush. Let me know if that hapens</li>
            <li> Surprised how well it works.  I tried other spin brushes but they nearly pulled my hair out.  Glad I gave this a chance.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to dry and shape thiny hair I have returned the product at the same day as received</li>
            <li> I am disabled and my shoulders and arms are very weak. Therefore doing the hairstyling tool regime is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I have a stand that holds my hairdryer - which is fantastic. But it doesn&#x27;t totally fill the need.&lt;br /&gt;Full size ceramic flat irons are too heavy, hot and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a hair dryer brush tool - wonderful for some haircuts and styles some times but not a total fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Infiniti Pro by Conair! Love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to prop my arms up to use it, but then I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;The boar hair bristles are better for your hair. Haven&#x27;t noticed all the fantastic shine yet, but I have only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;Made the haircut I got two weeks ago look the best it has since I left the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a special help to those having difficulty drying and styling their hair!&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
