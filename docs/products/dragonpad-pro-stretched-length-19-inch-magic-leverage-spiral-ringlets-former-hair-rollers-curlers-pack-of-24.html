            <li>that will give you great pointers on how to install them easily and without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>It took a couple tubes to get the hang of it, but once I did, they went on easily!  </li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars, but the hook is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>All in all they are a feat product and make cute curls</li>
            <li>These Curl Formers save u lot of monies for the most coveted curly hair styles.</li>
            <li>yet I could not get one spiral to work without pulling most of my hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure about these hair curlers as of yet, maybe I&#x27;m not  that experience with using them yet, but I find that they pull my hair, I can see hair in them when I take them out, and they are stiffer than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>more so than just using a curling iron?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also own the original Curlformers too, which I purchased months ago</li>
            <li>The curls at the end are super cute!</li>
            <li>These curlers are fairly easy to use and make really cute curls in longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Some of them were warped when i used them on my hair but for the most part they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thats great for natural ethnic haired ladies that want to curl/smooth the hair without the heat. .</li>
            <li>Easy to install</li>
            <li>Vakind Pro curlformers were easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with installation as they went in fine and came out without pulling or loss of hair.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this is that I have 4B hair, and I can wash my hair and install them right away on wet/damp hair and within 3-4 hours my hair is dry and silky.  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful though if your hair is a little shorter.</li>
            <li>Awesome little rollers.  </li>
            <li>but it was smooth process.</li>
            <li>I used them on my 3 year old and she loved them, she didn&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing a YouTube review by Naptural85 where she did a side by side comparison with  the original Curlformers.  </li>
            <li>First, there weren&#x27;t as many in the package as the label said there were.  </li>
            <li>and I can have curls for a party or special occasions.</li>
            <li>I got true spiral curls with</li>
            <li>an have them look like they&#x27;re supposed to in a style, other than that I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Some gals may find them hard to use, but hang in there; practice makes perfect and it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered some more today!</li>
            <li>curlformers was excellent 19 inch/24 in a pack for approximately $15.</li>
            <li>Still, these styling curl forms were worth the price.</li>
            <li>Sturdy product and fun to use.</li>
            <li>But overall, I honestly just resort to using the curling iron for that most days, since these take a while to dry.  </li>
            <li>These curler are easy to use and a fun  natural looking change for women who have straight hair.</li>
            <li>You absolutely cannot sleep in them!</li>
            <li>, then i final got the hang of it and love it</li>
            <li>My teen granddaughter is thrilled with her new curls.</li>
            <li>We have used these in the past and loved them</li>
            <li>The hair needs to be wet and combed very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It last for a few days and is a great way to stretch hair without using heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Since my hair dries wavy naturally, a few spirals that I comb through to relax them add a nice &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look to my waves.  </li>
            <li>I liked these curlers but my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to use them yet</li>
            <li>I purchased some others from a local beauty supply, however these are just as good and over half the price.</li>
            <li>It comes apart inside the curlers pretty frequently.</li>
            <li>They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers).</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Be sure you are buying the right size, I mean if you hair is 10&amp;#34; don&#x27;t buy 19&amp;#34; spirals.</li>
            <li>Obviously, when these came in the mail, I went right upstairs and took a spray bottle to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li>later, I pulled them out and applied a little more hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I was truly surprised by the outcome.</li>
            <li>The only problem with the original Curlformers pack is that their were not all the same size, and my daughter who has longer hair than myself did not have enough to complete setting her</li>
            <li>Second, they work just as well as the Curlformers brand, except I&#x27;ve already have one break---and it actually broke the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and curling it is hard, but with this and mousse</li>
            <li>If you use these make sure your hair is at least 70% dry.</li>
            <li>I have the other ones from the beauty supply store and these are exactly the same.</li>

            <li> Complete waste.</li>
            <li> Because they cost less and work just as well as curlformers, I might buy them again, all depends on how long the rest of them last.</li>
            <li> Recommend them to everyone instead of the pink sponge rollers we were used to.</li>
            <li> like to let my hair air dry with just a few of these sprinkled around my head.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little harder,  </li>
            <li> I have a slight edge as I am a cosmetologist and am used to working with these types of tools.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that I will be pulling her hair too much</li>
            <li> Only one item was broken but I ordered 2 pkgs so no issue there ..</li>
            <li> but I wish they weren&#x27;t so stiff</li>
            <li> Her hair is past her shoulders.  </li>
            <li> A few hours (and no heat!)</li>
            <li> I found that twisting the hair near the roots makes it less painful to get these on.  </li>
            <li> Worked well on my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> product is not for thick hair nor a person that has alot of hair.</li>
            <li> down side: they are uncomfortable to wear, and I wonder if pulling the hair through the sleeves with that knitting hook is just as damaging, if not</li>
            <li> Well, her hair has grown since then and they were too short :(  </li>
            <li> I bought these because I got tired of burning my hair and fingers on curling wands</li>
            <li> but they are uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> so you might want to just leave them in for 2 hours and don&#x27;t use big pieces of hair because it will get stuck and hurt very bad!</li>
            <li> They reminded me of curlformers without the expensive price.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I used them on my 3 year old and she loved them, she didn&#x27;t complain at all. I was afraid that I will be pulling her hair too much but it was smooth process.</li>
            <li> We have used these in the past and loved them so I bought some for my daughters 8th b-day.  Well, her hair has grown since then and they were too short :(  Her hair is past her shoulders.  I don&#x27;t think they make them any longer.  They are wonderful though if your hair is a little shorter.</li>
            <li> These curlers are fairly easy to use and make really cute curls in longer hair.  They do take a bit of practice and some drying time.  I&#x27;m sure if you can sleep in them they would be a great time saver.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I got tired of burning my hair and fingers on curling wands and I saw YouTube reviews and I loved them but they are uncomfortable to sleep in so you might want to just leave them in for 2 hours and don&#x27;t use big pieces of hair because it will get stuck and hurt very bad! All in all they are a feat product and make cute curls but I wish they weren&#x27;t so stiff so I could sleep a bit better!</li>
            <li> I purchased in lieu of the more expensive version... Easy to install we&#x27;re as pictured ... Only one item was broken but I ordered 2 pkgs so no issue there ..</li>
            <li> I liked these curlers but my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to use them yet an have them look like they&#x27;re supposed to in a style, other than that I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These ringlet formers are fantastic!!!  Product as promised.  Shipping within time limit.  Some gals may find them hard to use, but hang in there; practice makes perfect and it is worth it.  I have a slight edge as I am a cosmetologist and am used to working with these types of tools.  I would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> These Curl Formers save u lot of monies for the most coveted curly hair styles. that u can do yourself . whenever u want.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers a lot! They reminded me of curlformers without the expensive price. Worked well on my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product. The curlers are sub-standard, and are not the size advertised. They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers). As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily. However, the most urgent issue is that these products are being sold illegally. Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a YouTube review by Naptural85 where she did a side by side comparison with  the original Curlformers.  The price for the Vakind Pro  curlformers was excellent 19 inch/24 in a pack for approximately $15. I also own the original Curlformers too, which I purchased months ago it contained 40 in a pack for $70. The only problem with the original Curlformers pack is that their were not all the same size, and my daughter who has longer hair than myself did not have enough to complete setting her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vakind Pro curlformers were easy to use.  I had no problem with smell, like I heard others complain.  I had no problem with installation as they went in fine and came out without pulling or loss of hair.  The best thing about this is that I have 4B hair, and I can wash my hair and install them right away on wet/damp hair and within 3-4 hours my hair is dry and silky.  It last for a few days and is a great way to stretch hair without using heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter can use this product too, and 3 packs of 24 provided enough coverage for her too.  We are both very pleased with this product and would recommended it.</li>
            <li> First, there weren&#x27;t as many in the package as the label said there were.  So I already had issues before I even used them.  Second, they work just as well as the Curlformers brand, except I&#x27;ve already have one break---and it actually broke the first time I used it.  Because they cost less and work just as well as curlformers, I might buy them again, all depends on how long the rest of them last.</li>
            <li> I have the other ones from the beauty supply store and these are exactly the same. They worked perfectly once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I know these are knock-off&#x27;s but when you put your hair in the ringlet former does not bounce back.  YOu have to move it around in order for it to eventually spring back</li>
            <li> I would rather buy these  vs the curlformers. They work great. Some of them were warped when i used them on my hair but for the most part they are easy to use. they curl your hair without heat. Thats great for natural ethnic haired ladies that want to curl/smooth the hair without the heat. . Keep in mind. they are not comfy to sleep in. I did, and I made it through the night. But I wont do it again. EVER</li>
            <li> This product is very good and I would highly recommend it. It has become a regular part of our hair routine. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have curly 3b/3c hair. I watched almost every tutorial video yet I could not get one spiral to work without pulling most of my hair out. Complete waste. The spiral need to be a lot wider for the to even work.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these rollers. I purchased some others from a local beauty supply, however these are just as good and over half the price. I actually ordered some more today!</li>
            <li> Awesome little rollers.  Had to watch a u tube video to figure out how to use them as they do not come with instructions.  Easy to use.  Work great on my girls!  Recommend them to everyone instead of the pink sponge rollers we were used to.</li>
            <li> product is not for thick hair nor a person that has alot of hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use. They don&#x27;t comr with directions,but there are tons of videos on YouTube. that will give you great pointers on how to install them easily and without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure about these hair curlers as of yet, maybe I&#x27;m not  that experience with using them yet, but I find that they pull my hair, I can see hair in them when I take them out, and they are stiffer than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Easy to use and curls came out perfect.  Prior to owning them, I paid $200 to have my daughters hair done to get this look!</li>
            <li> This product works well at curling hair. I got true spiral curls with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side: they are uncomfortable to wear, and I wonder if pulling the hair through the sleeves with that knitting hook is just as damaging, if not more so than just using a curling iron?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to let my hair air dry with just a few of these sprinkled around my head. Since my hair dries wavy naturally, a few spirals that I comb through to relax them add a nice &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look to my waves.  But overall, I honestly just resort to using the curling iron for that most days, since these take a while to dry.  Still, these styling curl forms were worth the price.</li>
            <li> These curler are easy to use and a fun  natural looking change for women who have straight hair. Their great!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! Create the cutest curl. I used under the dryer I was a lil nervous because I didn&#x27;t want them to melt on my clients hair lol but everything went well!!!</li>
            <li> Works good on 4c hair. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it even though it did not come with instructions. I watched enough youtube vids to know how to use them. Sturdy product and fun to use. Would recommend</li>
            <li> If you use these make sure your hair is at least 70% dry. You absolutely cannot sleep in them! These are not for the tender headed, when taking these out becareful of breaking your hair. The curls at the end are super cute!</li>
            <li> My teen granddaughter is thrilled with her new curls. Just what she wanted. Perfect shiny curls! I was truly surprised by the outcome.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as curl formers in my opinion. The plastic is a little harder,  but they work just as well. For 1/3 of the cost.</li>
            <li> Obviously, when these came in the mail, I went right upstairs and took a spray bottle to my hair.  I HAD to try them.  I put in some hairspray and proceeded to thread my hair into the colored tubes.  It took a couple tubes to get the hang of it, but once I did, they went on easily!  A few hours (and no heat!) later, I pulled them out and applied a little more hairspray.  the curls were big and bouncy and stayed all day!</li>
            <li> it took me a while watched a couple of videos on you tube, then i final got the hang of it and love it</li>
            <li> I wanted the curlformers, but didn&#x27;t want to pay for the name, so I ordered these.  They work well.  The hair needs to be wet and combed very smooth.  I found that twisting the hair near the roots makes it less painful to get these on.  I would have given 5 stars, but the hook is very cheaply made.  It comes apart inside the curlers pretty frequently.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. My hair is fine and curling it is hard, but with this and mousse and I can have curls for a party or special occasions. Be sure you are buying the right size, I mean if you hair is 10&amp;#34; don&#x27;t buy 19&amp;#34; spirals.</li>
