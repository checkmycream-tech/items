            <li>They are the best on the market.</li>
            <li>They are pricey, but this dual pack was the best deal I found.</li>
            <li>It is best to use it before eyes start feeling scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Very good eye drops.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is very good.</li>
            <li>Good suggestion Doc!</li>
            <li>It works great for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>Great and cheaper than Systane.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This brand was recommended by my eye doctor as a good option since &amp;#34;hypo tears&amp;#34; is no longer made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to make these calculations before committing to the purchase.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Item as described, price good and delivery expedited..</li>
            <li>In my opinion, these are some of the best eye drops available.  </li>
            <li>I received the good  </li>
            <li>Good to get it</li>
            <li>Good shipping, good product.</li>
            <li>Optive was my favorite of the drops I was given, and this box of 2 15ml bottles is a great value compared to getting these drops at the eye clinic</li>
            <li>but this one worked the absolute best.</li>
            <li>and I liked it a lot, did the job</li>
            <li>and this is a clear liquid solution that works well and lasts for hours - somewhat pricey (although Amazon had the best price)</li>
            <li>Box of two lasts many months and saves you the trip to the drug store.</li>
            <li>more* drops to relieve the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eyes also felt drier and more irritated after using the product than before.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from my dr. and liked it, so bought more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought 4 more bottles</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>If you got a sample, you need to understand that your Dr. might recommend the brands on hand, the ones where the sales reps gave his/her office free lunch and samples!</li>
            <li>refreshing...</li>
            <li>I tried probably 5 different brands and these were the best for me.</li>
            <li>the latter of which works best for me.</li>
            <li>All eyes are different though, so try to find what works best for you!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR DRY EYES.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOR HELPING PREVENT DRY EYE.</li>
            <li>Best eye drops for my dry eyes</li>
            <li>The best lubricant for dry eye</li>
            <li>It was so easy to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy to take with me in my purse and use away from home.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and a fine product</li>
            <li>It is perfect if you have cronic dried eye.</li>
            <li>Smooth eye drops, recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily when my eyes tear up while reading in bed at night.</li>
            <li>(free samples notwithstanding).</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re pretty easy to find</li>
            <li>He also recommended putting very warm wet compresses on my eyes for five minutes twice a day and taking flaxseed oil capsules twice a day.  </li>
            <li>They work well and quickly.</li>
            <li>yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my husband has mild cat allergies.</li>
            <li>, I certainly hope that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>If you are older or have a shakey hand, avoid this product, as some of it will land on your cheek, and you will run through it very quickly.    </li>
            <li>Optive provides an excellent eye drop for tired eyes caused by staring at a computer screen, the glare of the sun, allergies, and a lifetime of reading.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used Systane as well, and both products work, but this one wins because they are cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is one effective lubricant that I take several times a day</li>
            <li>but the solution is better than some other brands which feel more dense.</li>
            <li>When I do not forget to carry one with me during the day they do reduce considerably the burning sensation which they are intended to relieve, I feel confident in supporting my physicians recommendation.</li>
            <li>the best brand hands down for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>To my surprise I felt a horribly familiar burning sensation, dryness, and light sensitivity which began after the third use.</li>
            <li>use these many times daily, and they do the job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you are looking for</li>
            <li>I think this has all made a positive impact.</li>
            <li>For this product, Quality probably is fine, but it is definitely \\&quot;QNS\\&quot;  - quantity not sufficient!</li>
            <li>/months at a time - these eye drops work well and were competitively priced and very convenient to order.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday I started on the preservative free individual packets as a run  up to Lazik.  </li>
            <li>(or you can get 1/2 oz for $4.75 + $4.99 shipping) - these prices don&#x27;t make much sense.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my eyes feel drier very soon after using this.  </li>
            <li>It was very soothing</li>
            <li>It works really well with any contacts.  </li>
            <li>these drops work very well, better than the three other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I guess these work for other people but irritate my eyes more after instilling.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as many drops compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>suspect the effect makes eyes actually drier rather than more moist -- if not careful, someone may think they need *</li>
            <li>I found that I get a better price at the local big box store than on the internet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>everything fine  quality as expected</li>
            <li>(2) some packages contain 2 bottles while others have only one, (3) there is a wide discrepancy in the cost of shipping - for Prime members, there are some hefty shipping rates on many of these eye products.</li>
            <li>I like it better, but it also is starting to sting, so I will probably switch to the more expensive preservative-free version that Optive makes in hopes that will solve the problem.</li>
            <li>With eye drops I&#x27;d rather the bottle be clear</li>
            <li>so I can see that the solution is clear inside and not contaminated.</li>
            <li>Compared to the average prescription drug of which we elderly are such great consumers, it is a small price indeed.</li>
            <li>that was near expiration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be helping keep my eyes and contacts from drying out during the day.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for my Chronic Dry Eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really seems to help with dry eyes.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND REFRESH OPTIVE LUBRICANT FOR DRY EYE IRRITATION.</li>
            <li>He likes them enough to continue to do so daily even though he struggles a LOT with things coming near his eyes!</li>
            <li>,i have to take opiates for chronic pain issues and this really helps compared to other ones I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Thirty years ago my attempt to wear hard contacts ended after months of struggle with my eyes hypersensitive to light and constantly irritated.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally us them however my eyes do not dry as often as hers.</li>
            <li>I purchased these drops after having used Refresh Optive Sensitive (single use vials) to recover from LASIK surgery.  </li>
            <li>This particular offer can be distilled down to 1 oz of Refresh Optive for $16.69 plus $1.02 shipping.</li>

            <li> After cataract surgery I was having a big problem with dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Briefly, this was one of two products similar in nature and price which were recommended by my eye doctor for eyes producing insufficient tears due to the aging process.</li>
            <li> I have switched to a different brand on his approved list with no problems whatever, with a different active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my eye doctor for painful itchy eyes and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> No more ½ inch thick glasses with huge price tags.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time without irritation.</li>
            <li> if you use optive- don&#x27;t forget to leave on on your desk for long work days.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with other brands such as Blink or Systane -</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes I would recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry eyes b/c</li>
            <li> My Mother&#x27;s eye doctor has recommended this product for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> An optometrist labeled it dry eye and suggested Optive.  </li>
            <li> My son must use antihistamine eye drops that dry his eyes.  </li>
            <li> have occassional dry eye</li>
            <li> My eye surgeon told me to get these drops after cataract surgery, for when my eys got dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> John began using Optive around the time he had his two cataract and glaucoma surgeries so that he would not be plagued with dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> That was about 8 to 10 years ago and he has had zero problems with dry eyes and his pressure went from about 20 to 14.  </li>
            <li> My eye doctor recommended I use this product four times a day to relieve dry eye.  </li>
            <li> I use them a lot, because I have dry eyes and wear contacts.</li>
            <li> Just a suggestion, if you do suffer from dry eyes, drink plenty of water during the day and take Fish Oil - it all helps</li>
            <li> Relief for my dry eyes</li>
            <li> l have extremely dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have severely dry eyes and these eye drops</li>
            <li> I had LASIK in 2010 and have had dry eyes ever since.</li>

            <li> Some users found Refresh Optive Lubricant milder than other brands, so I bought it here and have used it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Judy, on the other hand, has had none of that, yet.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes I would recommend you try this product. It works great for me. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR DRY EYES. I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL BRANDS AND FOR ME THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOR HELPING PREVENT DRY EYE. MY WIFE AND I USE THIS ABOUT 4 TIMES A DAY. HIGHLY RECOMMEND REFRESH OPTIVE LUBRICANT FOR DRY EYE IRRITATION.</li>
            <li> The orticle is like the description. It is perfect if you have cronic dried eye. I can suggest it.</li>
            <li> This is the only lubricant that  works for me.  I suffer from dry eyes b/c my eyes remained partially open during sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I like it.</li>
            <li> eye drops recommended by my docor....they arrived earlier than announced, and seem&lt;br /&gt;to do as intended.</li>
            <li> Very good eye drops. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> My Mother&#x27;s eye doctor has recommended this product for dry eyes.  It can be difficult to find at various local sources.  It was so easy to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had irritated eyes for years blaming allergies.  An optometrist labeled it dry eye and suggested Optive.  Life has improved!</li>
            <li> My son must use antihistamine eye drops that dry his eyes.  These drops relieve the dryness without interfering with the antihistamine properties of his medicated drops.</li>
            <li> I have a bad problem with dry eyes and these drops work well and also were recommended by my ophthalmologist.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my eye doctor as a good option since &amp;#34;hypo tears&amp;#34; is no longer made.  I wear daily use contact lenses 24x7 for weeks/months at a time - these eye drops work well and were competitively priced and very convenient to order.  Box of two lasts many months and saves you the trip to the drug store.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry eyes.  They become dry and painful almost immediately after using.</li>
            <li> Briefly, this was one of two products similar in nature and price which were recommended by my eye doctor for eyes producing insufficient tears due to the aging process. When I do not forget to carry one with me during the day they do reduce considerably the burning sensation which they are intended to relieve, I feel confident in supporting my physicians recommendation. I should note that I cannot testify as to whether the less expensive products also available over the counter will or will not do as well for other sets of eyes. When it comes to the eyes, I am prepared to pay the price to follow my doctor&#x27;s advice. Compared to the average prescription drug of which we elderly are such great consumers, it is a small price indeed.</li>
            <li> Thirty years ago my attempt to wear hard contacts ended after months of struggle with my eyes hypersensitive to light and constantly irritated.  I was using drops by Allergan, who manufactures these (not sure if same active ingredient)  and it never occurred to me to suspect the drops as a source of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I started on the preservative free individual packets as a run  up to Lazik.  To my surprise I felt a horribly familiar burning sensation, dryness, and light sensitivity which began after the third use. Without contact lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the effect makes eyes actually drier rather than more moist -- if not careful, someone may think they need *more* drops to relieve the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently less than 2% of users get this side effect. I will tell my eye doctor, however.  I have switched to a different brand on his approved list with no problems whatever, with a different active ingredient.  When I was at the store comparing active ingredients this brand was the only one using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these drops after having used Refresh Optive Sensitive (single use vials) to recover from LASIK surgery.  Unfortunately the preservative in the non-sensitive type did not work out for me, eyes would develop mucus soon after using and blur my vision.  Eyes also felt drier and more irritated after using the product than before.</li>
            <li> I have problem eyes, constant conjunctivitis, allergies, etc.  I got a free sample of this from my dr. and liked it, so bought more.  It seems to be helping with my eye problems, and I am very thankful because I was pretty miserable for a few months and would like to prevent that from happening again</li>
            <li> everything fine  quality as expected</li>
            <li> have occassional dry eye and this is a clear liquid solution that works well and lasts for hours - somewhat pricey (although Amazon had the best price) but the solution is better than some other brands which feel more dense.</li>
            <li> Things to watch for when buying eye drops: (1) 15 ml is approx. 1/2 fluid oz, (2) some packages contain 2 bottles while others have only one, (3) there is a wide discrepancy in the cost of shipping - for Prime members, there are some hefty shipping rates on many of these eye products. It&#x27;s good to make these calculations before committing to the purchase. This particular offer can be distilled down to 1 oz of Refresh Optive for $16.69 plus $1.02 shipping. (or you can get 1/2 oz for $4.75 + $4.99 shipping) - these prices don&#x27;t make much sense. Look for an Amazon Prime eyedrop instead.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Product works</li>
            <li> My eye surgeon told me to get these drops after cataract surgery, for when my eys got dry and itchy. They work well and quickly. Good suggestion Doc!</li>
            <li> My wife uses these drops since her implants on both eyes. They were recommended by the doctor and she has been using them every since. I occasionally us them however my eyes do not dry as often as hers. These are the best eye drops on the market and one that we fully trust. They are long lasting when used as directed. The lubrication formula helps penetrate the surface thus keeping the eyes moist for hours. I found that I get a better price at the local big box store than on the internet. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Have used it for a long time without irritation.</li>
            <li> Best eye drops for my dry eyes</li>
            <li> Since my cataract surgery I have used this product exclusively on at the advice of my eye surgeon.I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Item as described, price good and delivery expedited..Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smooth eye drops, recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my ophthalmologist.  It works just as advertised.  Dry eyes are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I had lasik done a couple of months ago and these were the drops the doctor gave me to use.  I&#x27;ve since bought 4 more bottles and they work as intended.</li>
            <li> This works very well for my Chronic Dry Eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I use these many times daily, and they do the job!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> This is just an overpriced version of your drug store house brand, in an ampule that is hard to squeeze. If you are older or have a shakey hand, avoid this product, as some of it will land on your cheek, and you will run through it very quickly.    It is a POOR selection for the typical senior with a limited budget who has other other health issues. If you got a sample, you need to understand that your Dr. might recommend the brands on hand, the ones where the sales reps gave his/her office free lunch and samples! For this product, Quality probably is fine, but it is definitely \\&quot;QNS\\&quot;  - quantity not sufficient!</li>
            <li> Sometimes my eyes feel drier very soon after using this.  Not sure why...  That doesn&#x27;t happen with TheraTears or the regular solution by Refresh.  I find TheraTears works best for me.  I use drops throughout the day, before bed, and upon waking.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are some of the best eye drops available.  Really relieves tired, itching eye strain.</li>
            <li> Optive provides an excellent eye drop for tired eyes caused by staring at a computer screen, the glare of the sun, allergies, and a lifetime of reading.</li>
            <li> My optometrist told me a couple years ago I should start using artificial tears to treat &amp;#34;dry eye,&amp;#34; and she recommended Systane drops. I use them primarily when my eyes tear up while reading in bed at night. I tried three kinds under that brand: Balance, Ultra and Gel. The drops caused such stinging in my eyes that I began to dread using them. I searched the Web and learned the pain is often caused by the preservatives used to extend the shelf life of these products. Some users found Refresh Optive Lubricant milder than other brands, so I bought it here and have used it for a couple weeks. I like it better, but it also is starting to sting, so I will probably switch to the more expensive preservative-free version that Optive makes in hopes that will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I received the good  that was near expiration.&lt;br /&gt;It was expiring on 1/2016.</li>
            <li> This works great.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months, since my eye Doctor suggested it.  The Amazon price is very good.</li>
            <li> the best brand hands down for my dry eyes. they LAST longer</li>
            <li> These eye drops are so great!  Can only use this brand as have allergies and this brand does not make them worse.  Especially like the 2 bottles as opposed to the little individual plastic ones that are nearly impossible for older, arthritic hands to hold!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that works for me and I have extreme dry eyes.  (I was diagnosed by my doctor which you should be seen).  DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
            <li> Optive is the lubricant each of us reaches for when it is bed time.  John began using Optive around the time he had his two cataract and glaucoma surgeries so that he would not be plagued with dry eyes.  That was about 8 to 10 years ago and he has had zero problems with dry eyes and his pressure went from about 20 to 14.  No more ½ inch thick glasses with huge price tags.  Just readers on sale from Amazon.  Judy, on the other hand, has had none of that, yet.  To maintain her almost perfect readings, she, too, uses Optive and has not missed a beat.</li>
            <li> Use it a few times a day. Really seems to help with dry eyes. Was recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> THE BEST, CHEAPER BRANDS, JUST DON&#x27;T DO IT, WORKS BEST, TOGETHER WITH REFRESH P.M.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is just what my doctor order and cheaper than at the pharmacy.  Easy to take with me in my purse and use away from home.</li>
            <li> Great and cheaper than Systane. Got these because they can be used with contacts. I have used Systane as well, and both products work, but this one wins because they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> this works very well for dry eye because it has an oil base to it,i have to take opiates for chronic pain issues and this really helps compared to other ones I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Good to get it</li>
            <li> Best eye drops I have ever used. I was given a sample by the doctor. I ordered them thru Amazon to save some money.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor recommended I use this product four times a day to relieve dry eye.  So far it seems to be helping keep my eyes and contacts from drying out during the day.  He also recommended putting very warm wet compresses on my eyes for five minutes twice a day and taking flaxseed oil capsules twice a day.  I think this has all made a positive impact.</li>
            <li> these drops work very well, better than the three other brands I have tried. The only drawback is not the product, but the packaging. The bottle is green and not transparent. With eye drops I&#x27;d rather the bottle be clear so I can see that the solution is clear inside and not contaminated.</li>
            <li> I had lasik in December, and was given several samples of drops to use a few times daily to ease the recovery process. My doctor mentioned as well that continual use of drops helps lessen regression-- as my prescription was terrible and brought back to 20/20, I certainly hope that&#x27;s true! Optive was my favorite of the drops I was given, and this box of 2 15ml bottles is a great value compared to getting these drops at the eye clinic (free samples notwithstanding). I&#x27;ve been using them a few times in the evenings, when I start to notice my eyes are dry and my corneas are blurring up. Instant and lasting relief, and two months out from the procedure no regression yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my husband has mild cat allergies. Since we got our tabby, he&#x27;s started to use the drops once or twice an evening to help relieve his symptoms. He likes them enough to continue to do so daily even though he struggles a LOT with things coming near his eyes!</li>
            <li> There is really not much to say. If you are on this page you probably already know these drops. They are the best on the market. My doctor said so. I use them a lot, because I have dry eyes and wear contacts. They are pricey, but this dual pack was the best deal I found. Just a suggestion, if you do suffer from dry eyes, drink plenty of water during the day and take Fish Oil - it all helps</li>
            <li> refreshing...It&#x27;s exactly what you are looking for if you use optive- don&#x27;t forget to leave on on your desk for long work days.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my eye doctor for painful itchy eyes and it works amazingly well.  It is best to use it before eyes start feeling scratchy.  I put in a drop when I wake up and another in late afternoon.  Now I can use computer and Kindle all day without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping, as described, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good shipping, good product. Happy with my purchase. One bottle for home and one for my handbag.</li>
            <li> Relief for my dry eyes</li>
            <li> l have extremely dry eyes.  This is one effective lubricant that I take several times a day</li>
            <li> Well packaged and a fine product</li>
            <li> After cataract surgery I was having a big problem with dry eyes. My ophthalmologist gave me a tiny bottle of this to try and I couldn&#x27;t believe how helpful this product was. I had used other lubricating eye drops but this one worked the absolute best.</li>
            <li> The best lubricant for dry eye</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Opthalmology</li>
            <li> My eye doctor gave me a sample of this when treated for eye lid problems.  It was very soothing and I liked it a lot, did the job</li>
            <li> I have severely dry eyes and these eye drops don&#x27;t work for me. I was under the impression that these are preservative-free as I was recommended these by my ophthalmologist but I guess the non-sensitive ones have some preservatives. I guess these work for other people but irritate my eyes more after instilling. I won&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> You should buy this product.  It works really well with any contacts.  I have semi hard contacts as well as soft.</li>
            <li> A life-saver. I had LASIK in 2010 and have had dry eyes ever since. I tried probably 5 different brands and these were the best for me. I like that they&#x27;re pretty easy to find and I don&#x27;t have to use as many drops compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this product may work well for some people. Unfortunately, I have to echo the negative reviews on here. This product makes my eyes sting, makes them feel sticky, and ultimately worsens my dryness symptoms. I have no problem with other brands such as Blink or Systane - the latter of which works best for me. All eyes are different though, so try to find what works best for you!</li>
