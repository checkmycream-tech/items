    <ol>
            <li> OMG, what actually is supposed to do?</li>
            <li> Using it for a while.. But yet to see results after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a week mustache and as a result my family shunned me and I had no friends, no job and was homeless. I was at the end of my rope and contemplating the unthinkable - shaving my mustache, so I went to the pharmacy with the last $40 I to my name in my pocket.  I went over to the shave section to purchase a razor and some shave soap when I saw this product.  I asked the lady behind the counter if customers were satisfied, she didn&#x27;t know she didn&#x27;t think anyone had ever bought it before. Reluctantly I spent my coin on this product, I&#x27;d rather be broke knowing I had tried everything possible than mustashless and rich.  I wen&#x27;t under the bridge to claim my sleeping spot before sunset and applied the black cream. I followed the instructions perfectly for a full 3 weeks with nothing but disappointment.  I threw the bottle against the side of the bridge curled up in a ball and cried myself to sleep. The next morning with a razor in hand I trembled as i approached my unshaven lip - a region of a my face that had never been adulterated by a razor before.  I applied the cold blade, the sensation of the cold blade felt unfamiliar  and dirty. I filled my lungs and with a deep exhaled as I let gravity take it&#x27;s toll, an intense tingle made my lip quiver and I released the razor, however the razor did not fall, instead it was tangled garden of vines growing from under my nose!  I WAS NOW A MAN!  Needless to say my life has changed dramatically since growing a mustache. Within a month I&#x27;d had more money and girlfriends than I knew what to do with.  I took a walk down to that bridge one cold evening just to remember what I came from... and would&#x27;t you know it? right there on the bridge where I had tossed that bottle of mustache growing cream was an enormous hairy mustache, there must have been a dozen homeless people settled in for night lavishly embraced by it&#x27;s warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this product without reservation.  I can seewhy others have reviewed it poorly, if you only use it for the 3 weeks specified you won&#x27;t get results, you must wait 3 weeks 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Works I used it for 3 weeks and just know started to grow hair back on a bald spot I had on my beard u just have to be patient and use it twice a day three times a week</li>
            <li> Still in the process....Its looking ok so far but cannot give it a 5 yet until I see full results</li>
            <li> do not buy this product. It does not help u grow facial hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> Slow but I see growth</li>
            <li> Terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It is was little slow but it&#x27;s along way..</li>
            <li> I thought it was fat that causes dryness beard like dandruff but I see in the other reviews is that he grows hair on his face. I do not think I&#x27;ll keep putting me serve baby oil ...</li>
            <li> first off this product take 3 weeks to get inn and it only works to cover in on spoty ares it does no miracles.</li>

            <li> i love the item thanks</li>
            <li> I used this once daily for about 2 weeks and I saw no results. I shaved beard and tested how long my facial hair grew without using this product and it grew at the same exact rare without me using it. I feel like I wasted my money on a junk item. Its a tiny jar (size of half of a thumb) . Lasts only about 3 weeks and does absolutely nothing. Also it leaves a grubby, disgusting, gewy, slimy, smelly, layer of black wax on face. After I wash it off it still resides. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> It was So Freakin Small, that i thought it be half the size of my hand.</li>
