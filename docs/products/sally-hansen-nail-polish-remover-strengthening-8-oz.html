            <li> It&#x27;s kinda scary how strong it is...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry the skin out.</li>
            <li> No issues with this product, it worked as expected, and was able to power through some tough nail polish, though did take a little effort with a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Not much one can say about polish remover.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t let it sit long enough before trying to remove it, but it left some sparkles behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands</li>
            <li> Helps strengthen weak and sensitive nails.</li>
            <li> I found I had to work a little harder to remove&lt;br /&gt;the polish, but it may be because it does not say it contains acetone.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is with getting off sparkly nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish remover, but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Got the job done in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but a few times but am hoping it will help to strengthen my nails like it said.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works on my nails.it&#x27;s not to harsh</li>
            <li> Not drying or weak on your hands or nails.</li>
            <li> and I just needed some that wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sally Hansen products.  </li>
            <li> And a bottle lasts an awful long time.</li>
            <li> Beside some nail polish remover smells so bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll make everyone sick.</li>
