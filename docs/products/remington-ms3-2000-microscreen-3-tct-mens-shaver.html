    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I just got this razor today and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>--my best experience ever in this department.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple weeks, and I have to say that it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Incredible shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco brand looked bulky and the Remington 3 looked perfect and the price was great.      </li>
            <li>It is functional as a mustache/beard trimmer also and is great for maintaining a shaped goatee.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for maintaining a beard/mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great Shaver</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable shaver.</li>
            <li>The shave I received from it has always been quite good.  </li>
            <li>Either way, for the money, it should be a good value.  </li>
            <li>Good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, and I haven&#x27;t had good luck with them.  </li>
            <li>My advice---find a Remington foil shaver on sale and you will get a good value for your money</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer is great if you don&#x27;t mind not being able to see where you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the cutters tend to let hair fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a Wahl customer (mostly still made in Sterling, IL!).</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It does come in handy, though, if you skipped out on shaving for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how much I liked the shave from this shaver...</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>Also, use it at your own risk if your wife is sleeping nearby---she won&#x27;t be once you start shaving--</li>
            <li>The trimmer on this product is wonderful, but that is the only good thing about it.  </li>
            <li>On the good side there is the shave itself which is close and comfortable and</li>
            <li>It gave an OK shave and without the razor burn.  </li>
            <li>However, I wanted to upgrade, so after a month I traded it in for a Remington Microscreen 3 and was even more pleased by the performance of this model.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Or return it for repair, which is more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used electrics now for more than 40 years and understand their limitations, but this one did not measure up.</li>
            <li>I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen, but if it does i&#x27;ll sure enjoy this razor in the meantime!</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems a bit flimsy, but does a better job than my Norelco ever did.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with having to buy two more shavers.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it does a very applaudable job on my beard.  </li>
            <li>I use baby powder before I shave because Remington says that this will smooth the skin and the razor will cut better.  </li>
            <li>And the &#x27;lights&#x27; don&#x27;t give very good info about how much charge really remains (so I can no longer travel without the charger... nor rely on it in my car!).&lt;BR</li>
            <li>and they said to make sure you clean it well.  </li>
            <li>The Remington was easy to use because of its contour compared to the Braun.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;4-Good ergonomics when shaving--comfy in your hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its hard for me to argue with the best, most comfortable electric shave I have ever received.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 months it builds up to the point that it prevents the locking tab from engaging, meaning you&#x27;ll have the trimmer in the way 100% of the time - and all the washing/shaking in the world won&#x27;t dislodge it; its disassembly time.  </li>
            <li>because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Norelco 3 head, Panasonic wet/dry screen, cheap disposable razors, Gillette Atra, Braun Electric,  and on, and on.  </li>
            <li>Follow the &amp;quot;Getting a Close, Comfortable Shave&amp;quot;  instructions that come with the razor and you too will get a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;2-Very comfortable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington for over 20 years, but this one&#x27;s not as good or as durable as the old 2000 (or 3000</li>
            <li>originally bought Remington shavers because they were made in USA</li>
            <li>This was my first foil shaver, and I will admit price was the motivating factor (I use a blade when quality matters more than speed and comfort).</li>
            <li>I personally feel thay you cannot own a better shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>Instead of just rinsing under running water, you have to use a brush to get the blades clean.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;3-Hard to clean,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite a bit easier to clean...</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t useful for even a weekend trip anymore without the charger and an outlet available.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommended this product to anyone who wants to use it for more than just a trimmer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1-Very noisy and messy-whisker dust is in the sink after every shave---don&#x27;t even think about shaving on the way to work unless you don&#x27;t mind a lap full of whisker dust.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor for Christmas after recommending it to my fiance, and I must say, it does a whole lot better than my rotary Norelco ever did.  </li>
            <li>However, a full charge of 16 hours will last for a good week.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>BATTERY - in less than a year, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one good shave...</li>
            <li>They will tear up your face if not replaced quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since used it over 1 year and found the screens weaken quickly.  </li>
            <li>the charging is quick.  </li>
            <li>I have used all of the other brands of Electric Razors and the Remington MS3-2000 is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This means you burn through the battery charge real fast</li>
            <li>this razor is for you as it gives a nice close shave (close enough to draw blood that is).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that more people don&#x27;t like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviewers, however, when they say that &#x27;the trimmer isn&#x27;t much good&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This really means to use the brush and get in there to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I was in Walgreens this evening and saw what appears to be this exact shaver for $....  </li>
            <li>It is currently back at the manufacturer for battery replacement (I assume), where it has been for three weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that was truly a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll complain later &#x3D;)       </li>
            <li>The electric razor wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to tackle wiskers longer than a couple days growth, so maintaining my goatee was easy.  </li>
            <li>It consistantly misses whiskers and if they get more than two days long I had to use the trimmer to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>This shaver covers a large surface area, meaning you will get a faster shave.</li>
            <li>Every two to three months a screen will wear out a large hole and bite like a pirana.  </li>
            <li>Considering that it is the cheaper model, it certainly is value for money.</li>
            <li>Its fast ,close ,and thusfar painless.</li>
            <li>But come on, don&#x27;t they have real people test the thing before they put them on the market.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing.</li>
            <li>Despite the latter&#x27;s pivot head it wasnt as comfortable to shave the chin and neck areas.</li>
            <li>It cut fast and real close.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about this razor is that it makes a whole lot of noise while running.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not too much trouble to just run your shaver under warm water after each shave.</li>
            <li>Almost too close in that if you miss a whisker a time or two, it becomes too long to penetrate the &#x27;fine&#x27; razor screen.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the FAST motor speed.  </li>
            <li>Run it down to the end to get an idea of how many shaves you will get per charge.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these, having enjoyed my previous, although simpler Remington shaver.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had an extra screen - and peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this razor gives a very close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>...this baby is working just great .While ive only had it a few weeks ,its used daily to shave face and my bald head !</li>
            <li>Although i do have to catch a few strays with a disposable and ive yet to see how long the blades last i am happy with this thing and highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li>So I just decide to try out a new razor.</li>
            <li>Smooth as my forehead everytime with very minimal, if any, rash.</li>
            <li>and I could find no other reasonable alternatives.</li>
            <li>I believe this is one of the major factors that this razor provides a really smooth/quick shave.  </li>
            <li>But this was the first electric razor that actually made me bleed.  </li>
            <li>The problem with each one has been the stoooooooopid pop-up trimmer, which must have a 1/2 cent piece of plastic to hold it down, because sure enough it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and be ready to drop another 30 dollers in a month or two as you will be replaceing the blades verry shortly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the Remington MS3-2000</li>
            <li>The Remington really needs to be cleaned after each shave and its not as simple as running the head under the water.</li>
            <li>The Remington had much smoother controls, especially the mechanism of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>get a fast shave that gets about the same result as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I also took off my full grown beard of 6 months and carved it down to a goatee with a mustache (fumanchoo).  </li>
            <li>Wash and dry your face first...</li>
            <li>I needed a new electric for everyday quick morning shaves since I tend to have a five o clock shadow at 2pm.</li>
            <li>The rear foil in particular would develope a massive hole every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>I lost my cord and decided I needed a new shaver, since stores and internet that I have seen, don&#x27;t seem to sell the recharger cord only.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a 2.5 but just barely.</li>
            <li>Both models gave close shaves on the first day itself, however, the Remington was smoother and less noisy.</li>
            <li>and I figured at least I was supporting American jobs, but since most or all of them are now made in China, there&#x27;s no more impetus for me to do so.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a male over 15 with a heavy beard, forget this and find something actually does the job right.</li>
            <li>I can cover my whole face and head in 10 minutes  or less.</li>
            <li>if I recall @ Walgreens, but that also includes new, sharp replacement blades for the shaver.  </li>

            <li> It cut fast and real close.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this razor is that it makes a whole lot of noise while running.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not too much trouble to just run your shaver under warm water after each shave.</li>
            <li> Almost too close in that if you miss a whisker a time or two, it becomes too long to penetrate the &#x27;fine&#x27; razor screen.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the FAST motor speed.  </li>
            <li> Run it down to the end to get an idea of how many shaves you will get per charge.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, having enjoyed my previous, although simpler Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had an extra screen - and peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor gives a very close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ...this baby is working just great .While ive only had it a few weeks ,its used daily to shave face and my bald head !</li>
            <li> Although i do have to catch a few strays with a disposable and ive yet to see how long the blades last i am happy with this thing and highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li> So I just decide to try out a new razor.</li>
            <li> Smooth as my forehead everytime with very minimal, if any, rash.</li>
            <li> and I could find no other reasonable alternatives.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the major factors that this razor provides a really smooth/quick shave.  </li>
            <li> But this was the first electric razor that actually made me bleed.  </li>
            <li> The problem with each one has been the stoooooooopid pop-up trimmer, which must have a 1/2 cent piece of plastic to hold it down, because sure enough it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and be ready to drop another 30 dollers in a month or two as you will be replaceing the blades verry shortly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the Remington MS3-2000</li>
            <li> The Remington really needs to be cleaned after each shave and its not as simple as running the head under the water.</li>
            <li> The Remington had much smoother controls, especially the mechanism of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> get a fast shave that gets about the same result as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I also took off my full grown beard of 6 months and carved it down to a goatee with a mustache (fumanchoo).  </li>
            <li> Wash and dry your face first...</li>
            <li> I needed a new electric for everyday quick morning shaves since I tend to have a five o clock shadow at 2pm.</li>
            <li> The rear foil in particular would develope a massive hole every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> I lost my cord and decided I needed a new shaver, since stores and internet that I have seen, don&#x27;t seem to sell the recharger cord only.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a 2.5 but just barely.</li>
            <li> Both models gave close shaves on the first day itself, however, the Remington was smoother and less noisy.</li>
            <li> and I figured at least I was supporting American jobs, but since most or all of them are now made in China, there&#x27;s no more impetus for me to do so.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a male over 15 with a heavy beard, forget this and find something actually does the job right.</li>
            <li> I can cover my whole face and head in 10 minutes  or less.</li>
            <li> if I recall @ Walgreens, but that also includes new, sharp replacement blades for the shaver.  </li>
            <li> While I was sceptical at first due to the price tag and my past experiences with electric shavers this thing has really cut my daily routine time in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a decent everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using another Remington model for the past 5 years or so and it has performed very well for me.  </li>
            <li> the Remington flat missed.&lt;P</li>
            <li> I have a really thick beard and have used a REAL razor for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a bit under a year - no real problem with the blades, and the trimmer is decent as well, but if you use it, stubble will fall down into the locking mechanism that holds the trimmer down when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it rarely leaves any facial hair behind (even in the neck area which has always been a trouble spot for me).</li>
            <li> Trouble is, it doesn&#x27;t lock anymore--and it had no rough treatment.  </li>
            <li> Same problem with the trimmer as everyone else:  trimmer won&#x27;t stay down.  </li>
            <li> ; it pops up; then you push it back down until it locks.  </li>
            <li> Just to get the hair down reasonably low it takes forever.</li>
            <li> As others have said, I might as well just use a regular razor as it would be quicker and probably with less razor burn.</li>
            <li> The foils are not particularly durable.</li>
            <li> It was hard to lock in retracted position and kept popping up unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> If the battery were dead, I couldn&#x27;t just plug the razor in the wall and use it; I would have to wait several hours for it to charge up.  </li>
            <li> Due to the possition of the switch it would pop up while I was shaving and scratch my face.</li>
            <li> Just flip that baby up and those long hairs will be no more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The problem with the trimmer not locking down started happening to it within 3 months of use.  </li>
            <li> it does not lock down whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Either shave with it like that, or hold it down with your thumb, there&#x27;s your choices.  </li>
            <li> But now after just 2 months, the pop up trimmer won&#x27;t stay down.  </li>
            <li> and you scratch up your face all the time unless you hold it down with your thumb.  </li>
            <li> but for less money.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they can be found for less on the web.</li>
            <li> After a short time (weeks in one case, months in another, just outside of warranty in this one), the pop-up trimmer hold-down fails so the trimmer stays in the popped-up position.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated the shaver as 5-star, except the trimmer is not exceptional, but only &amp;quot;adequate.&amp;quot;</li>

            <li> Thats what your face will feel like after useing this guy. If you dont mind alot of pain this razor is for you as it gives a nice close shave (close enough to draw blood that is). Oh yeah, and be ready to drop another 30 dollers in a month or two as you will be replaceing the blades verry shortly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my MS3-2000 for almost 2 years now.  The shave I received from it has always been quite good.  &lt;br /&gt;The problem with the trimmer not locking down started happening to it within 3 months of use.  I called customer service and they said to make sure you clean it well.  This really means to use the brush and get in there to clean it.  &lt;br /&gt;This resolved the trimmer not locking until about 3 months ago. Then it took brute force to make it lock down.&lt;br /&gt;Now it does not lock down whatsoever.  I just bought a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was in Walgreens this evening and saw what appears to be this exact shaver for $....  Either way, for the money, it should be a good value.  This shaver has the same 3 TCT \\&quot;technology\\&quot; and ALL THE SAME FEATURES but for less money.  I have been using another Remington model for the past 5 years or so and it has performed very well for me.  I lost my cord and decided I needed a new shaver, since stores and internet that I have seen, don&#x27;t seem to sell the recharger cord only.  My only complaint is that the microscreens tear if knocked around (by a small child or what ever).  They will tear up your face if not replaced quickly.  They are quite expensive to replace (Around $... if I recall @ Walgreens, but that also includes new, sharp replacement blades for the shaver.  Who knows?  Maybe they can be found for less on the web.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a bit under a year - no real problem with the blades, and the trimmer is decent as well, but if you use it, stubble will fall down into the locking mechanism that holds the trimmer down when not in use.  Within 3 months it builds up to the point that it prevents the locking tab from engaging, meaning you&#x27;ll have the trimmer in the way 100% of the time - and all the washing/shaking in the world won&#x27;t dislodge it; its disassembly time.  6 small screws and a couple of pieces that are pretty nasty to hold in place while reassembling.</li>
            <li> I have a really thick beard and have used a REAL razor for 10 years.  I was getting a close shave, but that was a problem for my skin.  I would get razor burn on my neck if the shave was too close.  I decided to give electric razors a try back in June.  I started with the Remington Microscreen I because it was cheap.  It gave an OK shave and without the razor burn.  I also took off my full grown beard of 6 months and carved it down to a goatee with a mustache (fumanchoo).  The electric razor wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to tackle wiskers longer than a couple days growth, so maintaining my goatee was easy.  However, I wanted to upgrade, so after a month I traded it in for a Remington Microscreen 3 and was even more pleased by the performance of this model.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This razor cuts closer than the Microscreen I because it has 3 blades as opposed to it&#x27;s predecessor&#x27;s 1 blade.  And, like the Microscreen I, it does not cause razor burn.  It is functional as a mustache/beard trimmer also and is great for maintaining a shaped goatee.  I use baby powder before I shave because Remington says that this will smooth the skin and the razor will cut better.  However, it is possible to shave with this without prepping the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The downs are that it is a bit noisy and that it can only shave with the rechargeable battery...when the battery dies you have to recharge for 5 minutes to finish shaving rather than just plugging it in.  However, a full charge of 16 hours will last for a good week.&lt;br /&gt;The ups are that it shaves close without leaving razor burn.  It&#x27;s also great for maintaining a beard/mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Remington Microscreen 3 to a friend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and to the point. This shaver covers a large surface area, meaning you will get a faster shave. Furthermore, it rarely leaves any facial hair behind (even in the neck area which has always been a trouble spot for me). I agree with some of the other reviewers, however, when they say that &#x27;the trimmer isn&#x27;t much good&#x27;. - atleast for sideburn maintenance. It does come in handy, though, if you skipped out on shaving for a day or two. Just flip that baby up and those long hairs will be no more. I personally feel thay you cannot own a better shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> I must be a glutton for punishment!  I&#x27;ve had this razor for over three years.  Every two to three months a screen will wear out a large hole and bite like a pirana.  When I contacted Remington customer service I got a song and dance like they just didn&#x27;t understand and it must be something I&#x27;m doing or not doing.  Now the battery has worn to the point that it won&#x27;t last for one entire shave and I&#x27;m going shopping for anything but a Remington.</li>
            <li> ...this baby is working just great .While ive only had it a few weeks ,its used daily to shave face and my bald head ! Its fast ,close ,and thusfar painless. While I was sceptical at first due to the price tag and my past experiences with electric shavers this thing has really cut my daily routine time in half. I can cover my whole face and head in 10 minutes  or less. Although i do have to catch a few strays with a disposable and ive yet to see how long the blades last i am happy with this thing and highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> If I had the amount of time it takes to shave with this shaver I&#x27;d use a blade. It consistantly misses whiskers and if they get more than two days long I had to use the trimmer to get rid of them. I replaced it after about 6 months with a Norelco and it took off whiskers the Remington flat missed.&lt;P&gt;Cleaning the shaver is not as simple as it should be. Instead of just rinsing under running water, you have to use a brush to get the blades clean. It had to be cleaned after each shave (as Remington recommends) or the blades clogged up. I don&#x27;t know how the blades keep from clogging up during a shave.&lt;P&gt;The pop up trimmer is great if you don&#x27;t mind not being able to see where you&#x27;re using it. Due to the possition of the switch it would pop up while I was shaving and scratch my face. I got used to switch position after awhile. But come on, don&#x27;t they have real people test the thing before they put them on the market. I would rate the trimmer useless&lt;P&gt;If you have a wimpy beard, or want to shave your legs, this might be an alright shaver. If you&#x27;re a male over 15 with a heavy beard, forget this and find something actually does the job right.</li>
            <li> I have an MS3-1000.  Same problem with the trimmer as everyone else:  trimmer won&#x27;t stay down.  I&#x27;m buying a new razor.  Otherwise, it works well (except that with the trimmer all the way up, you can&#x27;t shave with it.)</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how much I liked the shave from this shaver... I&#x27;ve returned two of them for exchange, and just gave up on my third one.  The problem with each one has been the stoooooooopid pop-up trimmer, which must have a 1/2 cent piece of plastic to hold it down, because sure enough it doesn&#x27;t.  After a short time (weeks in one case, months in another, just outside of warranty in this one), the pop-up trimmer hold-down fails so the trimmer stays in the popped-up position.  Either shave with it like that, or hold it down with your thumb, there&#x27;s your choices.  Or return it for repair, which is more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought Remington shavers because they were made in USA and I figured at least I was supporting American jobs, but since most or all of them are now made in China, there&#x27;s no more impetus for me to do so.  I&#x27;m now a Wahl customer (mostly still made in Sterling, IL!).</li>
            <li> Good, close shave.  Almost too close in that if you miss a whisker a time or two, it becomes too long to penetrate the &#x27;fine&#x27; razor screen.  I use my standard &#x27;safety&#x27; razor (twin blade) once a week to overcome this problem.  And the shaver does not shave as close as the twin-blade &#x27;manual&#x27; razor (I have never found one that did).&lt;BR&gt;BATTERY - in less than a year, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one good shave... so it isn&#x27;t useful for even a weekend trip anymore without the charger and an outlet available.  And the &#x27;lights&#x27; don&#x27;t give very good info about how much charge really remains (so I can no longer travel without the charger... nor rely on it in my car!).&lt;BR&gt;It is currently back at the manufacturer for battery replacement (I assume), where it has been for three weeks or more.  You cannot change the battery yourself as it appears to be hard-wired into the shaver.&lt;BR&gt;I would not buy this &#x27;series&#x27; again.  I would only buy Remington again if it was a different battery setup and I could find no other reasonable alternatives.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my legs (women&#x27;s razors are just rubbish at this) and it&#x27;s awful.  It takes me twice as long to use this electric razor as it would with a wet blade and the results are very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I particularly like the FAST motor speed.  I believe this is one of the major factors that this razor provides a really smooth/quick shave.  I would have rated the shaver as 5-star, except the trimmer is not exceptional, but only &amp;quot;adequate.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this product is wonderful, but that is the only good thing about it.  This Remington does not shave close at all!  I don&#x27;t recommended this product to anyone who wants to use it for more than just a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, and I haven&#x27;t had good luck with them.  But this was the first electric razor that actually made me bleed.  Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for less than 6 months.  The sideburn cutter is spring loaded.  You press a button &amp;amp; it pops up; then you push it back down until it locks.  Trouble is, it doesn&#x27;t lock anymore--and it had no rough treatment.  I&#x27;ve used Remington for over 20 years, but this one&#x27;s not as good or as durable as the old 2000 (or 3000, I forget the last model number).</li>
            <li> Remington is no longer made in the USA and it shows.  The 1st time I used it the screen ripped and it cut a gash in my face.  Luckily I had an extra screen - and peroxide.  I wrote to Remington who never replied.  I&#x27;ve since used it over 1 year and found the screens weaken quickly.  Also shortly after purchase the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t retract.  On the good side there is the shave itself which is close and comfortable and the charging is quick.  However since the screen tore again (I saw it this time before shaving) I&#x27;ve decided to go for the Braun equivalent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done all the shavers possible...Norelco 3 head, Panasonic wet/dry screen, cheap disposable razors, Gillette Atra, Braun Electric,  and on, and on.  NEVER HAD ANY LUCK...rash, nicks, cuts, etc.  I have sensitive skin and the Remington MS3-2000 hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  Take the time and read the directions...don&#x27;t force it...let the shaver do the work and you&#x27;ll get a great, smooth shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  It was fully charged when I bought it, too.  Incredible shaver.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Maybe a 2.5 but just barely. I needed a new electric for everyday quick morning shaves since I tend to have a five o clock shadow at 2pm. As others have said, I might as well just use a regular razor as it would be quicker and probably with less razor burn. Just to get the hair down reasonably low it takes forever. I don&#x27;t expect an ultra close shave with electric but geez. On top of that, the cutters tend to let hair fly everywhere. Its back to Norelco for me as it least I don&#x27;t have to clean the thing every bloody day. The Remington really needs to be cleaned after each shave and its not as simple as running the head under the water. I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a decent everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, having enjoyed my previous, although simpler Remington shaver. I was disappointed in the Microscreen 3 TCT. I found it impossible to achieve a close shave without scrubbing at my face. The latch for the popup trimmer also was problematic. It was hard to lock in retracted position and kept popping up unexpectedly. I have used electrics now for more than 40 years and understand their limitations, but this one did not measure up.</li>
            <li> I had this razor for a year and just threw it away.  From the start, the beard trimmer would pop-up unexpectantly.  After six months, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t lock back in at all. If the battery were dead, I couldn&#x27;t just plug the razor in the wall and use it; I would have to wait several hours for it to charge up.  It had difficulty cutting just two days of stubble.  The foils are not particularly durable. The rear foil in particular would develope a massive hole every 2-3 months.  This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that was truly a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to compare the Remington MS3 2000 with the Braun 6520 Flex Integral Ultra head to head (literally!). The Remington was easy to use because of its contour compared to the Braun. Despite the latter&#x27;s pivot head it wasnt as comfortable to shave the chin and neck areas. The Remington had much smoother controls, especially the mechanism of the trimmer. Both models gave close shaves on the first day itself, however, the Remington was smoother and less noisy. Considering that it is the cheaper model, it certainly is value for money. In addition, it can be washed which is an advantage.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable shaver. It does shave as close as a razor. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just got this razor today and it is wonderful. I previously had a Panasonic model that just broke after 2 1/2 years of not replacing the blade or screens (screen finally broke).       So I just decide to try out a new razor. The Norelco brand looked bulky and the Remington 3 looked perfect and the price was great.      I tried it for the first time and it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s definitely a closer shave than the Panasonic. For all of those people out there who don&#x27;t know how to shave with an electric, follow your instructions! Wash and dry your face first...always helps. And it&#x27;s not too much trouble to just run your shaver under warm water after each shave. I mean come on, you can&#x27;t be that lazy can you???       I would have given this razor a 5 star but i have read some similar reviews about this locking mechanism for the sideburn trimmer. I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen, but if it does i&#x27;ll sure enjoy this razor in the meantime! I&#x27;ll complain later &#x3D;)       Great Shaver</li>
            <li> At first I loved this shaver.  It cut fast and real close.  Nice.  But now after just 2 months, the pop up trimmer won&#x27;t stay down.  This means you burn through the battery charge real fast and you scratch up your face all the time unless you hold it down with your thumb.  Time to go back to a Norelco...</li>
            <li> I have used all of the other brands of Electric Razors and the Remington MS3-2000 is the best by far. I have very sensitive skin and this razor gives a very close shave without the irritation. Follow the &amp;quot;Getting a Close, Comfortable Shave&amp;quot;  instructions that come with the razor and you too will get a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> Got this on sale for 30 bucks to replace a dying rotary electric.  This was my first foil shaver, and I will admit price was the motivating factor (I use a blade when quality matters more than speed and comfort). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After three months of use, here is what I think: &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1-Better shave quality than any rotary electric I&#x27;ve ever used. &lt;br /&gt;2-Very comfortable--my best experience ever in this department. &lt;br /&gt;3-Good battery charge capacity, I get 11 or 12 shaves per charge. &lt;br /&gt;4-Good ergonomics when shaving--comfy in your hand and easy to maneuver. &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1-Very noisy and messy-whisker dust is in the sink after every shave---don&#x27;t even think about shaving on the way to work unless you don&#x27;t mind a lap full of whisker dust.  Also, use it at your own risk if your wife is sleeping nearby---she won&#x27;t be once you start shaving--noisiest electric I&#x27;ve ever heard. &lt;br /&gt;2-Battery charge indicator is worthless.  Run it down to the end to get an idea of how many shaves you will get per charge. &lt;br /&gt;3-Hard to clean, and I believe the design of the shaver contributes to the trimmer problems of others.  Cleaning away from the trimmer probably prevents the mechanism from getting clogged, although cleaning away from the trimmer is counter-intuitive when its in your hands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its hard for me to argue with the best, most comfortable electric shave I have ever received.  My advice---find a Remington foil shaver on sale and you will get a good value for your money---that is what I will do again next time.</li>
            <li> I received this razor for Christmas after recommending it to my fiance, and I must say, it does a whole lot better than my rotary Norelco ever did.  The trimmer seems a bit flimsy, but does a better job than my Norelco ever did.  It&#x27;s also quite a bit easier to clean...a simple wash of the screens under running water does the trick.  What I don&#x27;t like about this razor is that it makes a whole lot of noise while running.  It&#x27;s enough to bother you when doing your sideburns, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the razor while anyone is sleeping, as it will likely wake them up.  Overall, it does a very applaudable job on my beard.  Smooth as my forehead everytime with very minimal, if any, rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that more people don&#x27;t like this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple weeks, and I have to say that it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I get a fast shave that gets about the same result as a blade.  I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t have a really thick beard, but this thing makes my face smoother than it&#x27;s ever been with any other electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought two Remington razors just over 2 years ago, one for me and one for my dad. They were different models, but were both over $100.      Sadly, they both died within the past month. It can&#x27;t be a coincidence. I can&#x27;t get them to work even while plugged in. Now I&#x27;m stuck with having to buy two more shavers. I assure you it won&#x27;t be a Remington.</li>
