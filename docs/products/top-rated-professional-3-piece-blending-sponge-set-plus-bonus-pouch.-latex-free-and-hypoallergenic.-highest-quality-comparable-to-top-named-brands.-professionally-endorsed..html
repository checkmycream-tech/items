            <li>Love the 3 sponges - all good, workable sizes.  </li>
            <li>so it kind of just molded there :</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of newbie on doing makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice touch and handy to keep them in.</li>
            <li>Come in a nice case.</li>
            <li>It closes nicely and is made well.</li>
            <li>My opinion of this product is my own, and my daughter&#x27;s, and has not been influenced in any way by the discount that I received on this purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own pouch to hold all the sponges.</li>
            <li>received this set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also comes in a  nice multipurpose pouch for storage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount but the opinions expressed here are my own</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t liked it, I think I tried using it three times.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.d, and work soap into the area.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say these songs are not the case.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin look nice everywhere</li>
            <li>However, when I was offered these sponges at a discount in return for my honest review, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again.</li>
            <li>I planned on purchasing the original, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I chose the Be You, Beautifully blenders because I got more bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>But this does a quick and great job for my morning makeup process before work.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a cute case!</li>
            <li>My makeup now goes on smooth and flawlessly...and the sponges feel so good against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Images depict Be You, Beautifully sponges after first wash.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so good at blending my make up, however, I can say that their material feels like really good quality and the case in which they come is very well</li>
            <li>Using these in general have made my makeup look airbrushed and perfect.</li>
            <li>They work great but in my opinion do not apply make up as smooth as the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>great sponges, does exactly what it says it would do</li>
            <li>really really do like the Beauty blenders from be you beautifully.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy these, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these makeup sponges!</li>

            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I love more...</li>
            <li>Love using these to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare but the Better</li>
            <li>Ok I have the BB egg.</li>
            <li>The sizes are perfect too, and will definitely handle all the makeup challenges she could face.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a variety of different make ups and applications.</li>
            <li>I must say I love this travel bag</li>
            <li>I really love that it comes with</li>
            <li>It was just MAGIC.</li>
            <li>Each size is perfect for the different areas of your face and blend the makeup professionally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely sponges.</li>
            <li>but I do need to use more product.</li>
            <li>In fact I think I get much better coverage using these sponges</li>
            <li>I love that I can store these sponges together</li>
            <li>Even if you aren&#x27;t a beauty nut like me, if you apply makeup anytime....get these! :)</li>
            <li>I love this Blending Sponge Set by Be You.</li>
            <li>These do seem to spread my foundation out more evenly, but I for some reason still prefer just using my hands.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dampen the sponge before applying makeup, or you will end up with a blotchy effect.</li>
            <li>They allow me to a save my fingertips from getting makeup all over amd are more hygienic.</li>
            <li>Love the three sizes of the spoges.  </li>
            <li>I love these sponges.</li>
            <li>I feel like this sponge soak more water compared to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s latex free!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The sponges are as described and I am enjoying using them.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Wasting good foundation wasn&#x27;t worth keeping these sponges &amp; cute case.</li>
            <li>so I have no complaints :)</li>
            <li>and I am glad I listened to the reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li>This also comes in a lovely pouch which is a multipurpose pouch.</li>
            <li>The three different sizes are perfect for a heavier application or to blend already applied makeup.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that they come wrapped in side of the carrying case.</li>
            <li>I love them make up is alot better now and easier</li>
            <li>Love ❤</li>
            <li>I seriously love this.</li>
            <li>The three sizes is very useful!</li>
            <li>While my first impression of these were not that good, I still am giving this review 5 stars...</li>
            <li>and they were so soft and wrapped beautifully</li>
            <li>Beautiful sponges for professional looking makeup application.</li>
            <li>Very nice set of high quality sponges.</li>
            <li>Candy was super nice</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a quality product at a great price!!</li>
            <li>very nice upgrade from the normal drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li>I have had better results applying foundation with my hands or using cheap drugstore sponges than using these.</li>
            <li>love putting makeup on with these  so smooth</li>
            <li>Professional coverage at a great price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, They are also SOO easy to clean!</li>
            <li>/..The other 2 I had no issues with and they blended flawlessly..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as easy for me to manipulate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easily washed with a bit of hand soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li>These sponges are of highest quality and a far more superior than a BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFULLY is just as good (if not, BETTER)</li>
            <li>You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge is a totally different texture compared to the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>It was an off brand on that I THOUGHT worked fine.</li>
            <li>but you could probably skip that step and be fine.  </li>
            <li>I found that doing this makes a huge difference in the way my makeup goes on.</li>
            <li>I ordered these sponges before I actually needed them because of the great deal.  </li>
            <li>This set IS worth the money, you will love it.</li>
            <li>This would definitely make a great gift for makeup lovers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Latex free, hypoallergenic, and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they worked fantastic at blending my concealer all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They really help with contouring and the shape fits nicely in your hand when you&#x27;re applying your make-up.  </li>
            <li>They shipped fast and were nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>The texture and absorbancy is amazing and they clean really well.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves these beauty blenders and would recommend to anyone looking for some great high quality and a set with a carrier.</li>
            <li>Often times when I used my Beauty Blender I had to reapply my CC under eye makeup and concealer multiple times to get good coverage since the sponge absorbed most of the makeup even with stippling.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>Just still figuring using what to clean them.</li>
            <li>so you can clean them</li>
            <li>They give you on how to clean</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I found these to be much denser that the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>so I Believe it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>but wow I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It is a gift in itself, with a fine mesh section so that any moisture on your sponges can evaporate, keeping them fresh.</li>
            <li>Plus, easy to clean and they are really holding up!</li>
            <li>, I loved the 3 different sizes!..</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Overall a greatbuy and a good alternative to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I LOVE trying new beauty products, it is like a hobby to me that I really enjoy</li>
            <li>am now be very proud owner of 3 blending brushes, and every single one of them is soft.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to get the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>main difference I see is that, the beauty blender is softer and way lighter, this sponge is more dense and a bit heavier.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>Great little kit with storage to keep sponges clean and vented.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and easy to use and wash.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and blend really well.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, great for the porpuse of blending, three different sizes.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in a nice round case to keep them stored and protected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just recently started using blending sponges, and I kind of just took the sales person&#x27;s word for it when I was at the makeup</li>
            <li>They clean easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them ripping or tearing.</li>
            <li>so my foundation would not be all absorbed by the sponge</li>
            <li>I feel that not only is Be You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge a better buy since you get three different sizes, but the longevity of these sponges will surpass my fairly new Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that when the blenders are nice and clean and dry they have a nice little storage space without them becoming moldy.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>For some reason, I get a more dewy finish when I am using this sponge, this is maybe due to the fact that it absorbs more water than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Much better value and wuality than the other more costly sponge I tried.</li>
            <li>I got them and used them right away.</li>
            <li>texture is great - not too rough but strong enough to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the how to clean and suggested uses guide they came with.</li>
            <li>I recieved this cool set of blenders for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;After testing these blenders, I have to say that they really do give you an airbrush finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off is the cute little case the sponges come in.</li>
            <li>I used them as directed, and while it&#x27;s great that they don&#x27;t absorb any product, they are very firm and just push the makeup around on your face instead of blending it.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing these as gifts for Mothers Day and certainly for Christmas for all my friends!</li>
            <li>I cracked open the perfectly packaged set a few days ago</li>
            <li>They come with lovely packaging, storage container and instructions, feel wonderfully soft and work very well in my inexpert hands.</li>
            <li>Worth more than the beauty blender because you get 3 different sizes of the sponges and a case for it as well.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>So as I do anytime I recieve new brushes or sponges I clean them..</li>
            <li>I love that this set comes with 3 different sizes to use for contouring.</li>
            <li>Hear me out ;) ...&lt;</li>
            <li>She was hopeful that I recieved a fluke by mistake because she said she was checking multiple sponges in their warehouse after my incident to make sure there aren&#x27;t others like this...</li>
            <li>Thanks again Candy!</li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>and I love the different sizes it comes with</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time sifting through the Amazon offerings and reviews and finally decided on these by Be You, Beautifully</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
            <li>I love the smaller sponge for concealer application.</li>
            <li>love that the cleaning of the sponges is so perfectly simple.</li>
            <li>I love these blenders and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>But I just had to return them because they absorbed too much product.</li>
            <li>For $3 more, you got three in various sizes.  </li>
            <li>So I went back to applying my liquid foundation with my fingertips and it works much better.</li>
            <li>Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft.</li>
            <li>They will swell to almost double their original size!</li>
            <li>Went back to my original fav sponges I found on Amazon!</li>
            <li>They apply makeup very evenly and love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>It pretty much doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Just remember to wash a few times before the first use to receive better results!</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant at first</li>
            <li>The very first thing that I did after trying these for the first time was throw my old blender away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy, I just use a mild shampoo to clean it, when dried it goes back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>got back to very quickly....</li>
            <li>Furthermore, this sponge feels much more durable and of higher quality then the Beauty Blender which feels like a rough kitchen sponge.  </li>
            <li>It comes with the little case to put the sponges in and the case closes easily and securely with a magnet.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that the little role that holds the sponges is super adorable.</li>
            <li>The 3 sizes are great for your full dace foundation, and to use for concealer in smaller hard to reach parts around your eye and nose.</li>
            <li>had already used the large blender so</li>
            <li>Since i&#x27;ve already used the large one, I can&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;ll never repurchase a wanna-be again.</li>
            <li>I use the large one for my foundation because it will get the job done quicker, lol.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Use the pointy tip of the teardrop to apply concealer or eye shadow around more hard to reach areas such as around your eyes or nose.&lt;br /&gt;You may dampen your blending sponge to give a nice even spread and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought the real beauty blender..</li>
            <li>/&gt;They really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really like these makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>However, the total extent of my makeup routine was a shear foundation lightly applied with my fingers</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
            <li>Purchase the real deal.</li>
            <li>Or the real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very squishy and they really do blend my concealer flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you look at the product as a whole</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li>Then you just rinse it with clean water, and squeezing the sponge at the same time to get out all of the stuff that went into the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>Then you just rinse it with clean water, and squeezing the sponge at the same time to get out all of the stuff that went into the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>and before I even sent pics in our convo she was already refunding me and sending me a new set!..</li>
            <li>I had the beauty blender previously and these are way better than those.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love the tiny sponge, because it does not pull my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had tried another brand of these new sponges and am not going to lie, am very committed to my high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves these Professional Blending Sponges!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the sponges.</li>
            <li>, I got this cute little box in the mail today and it happened to have my blending sponges.</li>
            <li>me tell you a few reasons: the classic teardrop shape is always better than any design, it also expands when you soak it in the water (like the beauty blender)</li>
            <li>To begin, this item came in a great little pouch that is small enough to fit in to my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>This sponge seamlessly glided onto my skin and buffed out my makeup rather then absorbing it as my Beauty Blender did.  </li>
            <li>My foundation looks natural no matter how much highlighting and contouring I do.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was how extremely soft and squishy these were compared to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a much better deal than the other high end blender that is sold in major stores.</li>
            <li>really like that it has a tiny baby blender, because I can get into my eye area or my brow bone area without any problems of it being too large for that area and not blending</li>
            <li>I use the little one, which I absolutely positively completely and utterly in love, under my eye.</li>
            <li>The sponges themselves are very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>three sponges in our Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft and made from the highest quality materials which are guaranteed to never break, rip, or tear like some of the other cheaper brands you see on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The micro yellow one ripped the first time I washed it and the two black ones retain so much water then doesn&#x27;t bounce back very quick.</li>
            <li>WOW, I think I need to learn some new tricks.</li>
            <li>: make sure you dry them with a towel to get rid of all the water completely if using wet because if they have any access water inside, they might leave a streak,</li>
            <li>, eyeshadow applied with a cheap brush and a little lipstick.</li>
            <li>The little sponge is very useful for the under eye and nose area.</li>
            <li>And, unlike my old blender, these do not soak up a ton of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sponges are nowhere near the quality of beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I used baby soap that I already have since I have two young kids</li>
            <li>Your makeup will look so natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luxuriously Soft and Comparable to Beautyblender:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL</li>
            <li>Well when I went to clean the larger blender it did not bounce back to its shape (I even waited till the next day)</li>
            <li>They are, also, very cute which is totally irrelevant, of course.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the cheap foundation sponges from the local drugstore, but decided to treat myself to these because I realized how silly it is that I spend so much money on high quality makeup...</li>
            <li>I was completely and utterly amazed!</li>
            <li>First, the three different sizes were not very useful.</li>
            <li>It is hard to describe how nice they feel to the touch, but you can just feel the quality, they are firm... but soft and squishy at the same time.</li>

            <li> so it kind of just molded there :</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of newbie on doing makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice touch and handy to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Come in a nice case.</li>
            <li> It closes nicely and is made well.</li>
            <li> My opinion of this product is my own, and my daughter&#x27;s, and has not been influenced in any way by the discount that I received on this purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own pouch to hold all the sponges.</li>
            <li> received this set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also comes in a  nice multipurpose pouch for storage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount but the opinions expressed here are my own</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t liked it, I think I tried using it three times.</li>
            <li> received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.d, and work soap into the area.</li>
            <li> received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say these songs are not the case.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin look nice everywhere</li>
            <li> However, when I was offered these sponges at a discount in return for my honest review, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again.</li>
            <li> I planned on purchasing the original, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I chose the Be You, Beautifully blenders because I got more bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> But this does a quick and great job for my morning makeup process before work.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a cute case!</li>
            <li> My makeup now goes on smooth and flawlessly...and the sponges feel so good against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Images depict Be You, Beautifully sponges after first wash.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so good at blending my make up, however, I can say that their material feels like really good quality and the case in which they come is very well</li>
            <li> Using these in general have made my makeup look airbrushed and perfect.</li>
            <li> They work great but in my opinion do not apply make up as smooth as the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> great sponges, does exactly what it says it would do</li>
            <li> really really do like the Beauty blenders from be you beautifully.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy these, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I love more...</li>
            <li> Love using these to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare but the Better</li>
            <li> Ok I have the BB egg.</li>
            <li> The sizes are perfect too, and will definitely handle all the makeup challenges she could face.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a variety of different make ups and applications.</li>

            <li> I love this Blending Sponge Set by Be You.</li>
            <li> These do seem to spread my foundation out more evenly, but I for some reason still prefer just using my hands.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dampen the sponge before applying makeup, or you will end up with a blotchy effect.</li>
            <li> They allow me to a save my fingertips from getting makeup all over amd are more hygienic.</li>
            <li> Love the three sizes of the spoges.  </li>
            <li> I love these sponges.</li>
            <li> I feel like this sponge soak more water compared to the beauty blender.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Wasting good foundation wasn&#x27;t worth keeping these sponges &amp; cute case.</li>
            <li> so I have no complaints :)</li>
            <li> and I am glad I listened to the reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li> This also comes in a lovely pouch which is a multipurpose pouch.</li>
            <li> The three different sizes are perfect for a heavier application or to blend already applied makeup.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that they come wrapped in side of the carrying case.</li>
            <li> I love them make up is alot better now and easier</li>
            <li> Love ❤</li>
            <li> I seriously love this.</li>
            <li> The three sizes is very useful!</li>
            <li> While my first impression of these were not that good, I still am giving this review 5 stars...</li>
            <li> and they were so soft and wrapped beautifully</li>
            <li> Beautiful sponges for professional looking makeup application.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of high quality sponges.</li>
            <li> Candy was super nice</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a quality product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> very nice upgrade from the normal drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li> I have had better results applying foundation with my hands or using cheap drugstore sponges than using these.</li>
            <li> love putting makeup on with these  so smooth</li>
            <li> Professional coverage at a great price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, They are also SOO easy to clean!</li>
            <li> /..The other 2 I had no issues with and they blended flawlessly..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as easy for me to manipulate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easily washed with a bit of hand soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li> These sponges are of highest quality and a far more superior than a BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFULLY is just as good (if not, BETTER)</li>
            <li> You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge is a totally different texture compared to the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> It was an off brand on that I THOUGHT worked fine.</li>
            <li> but you could probably skip that step and be fine.  </li>
            <li> I found that doing this makes a huge difference in the way my makeup goes on.</li>
            <li> I ordered these sponges before I actually needed them because of the great deal.  </li>
            <li> This set IS worth the money, you will love it.</li>
            <li> This would definitely make a great gift for makeup lovers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Latex free, hypoallergenic, and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they worked fantastic at blending my concealer all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They really help with contouring and the shape fits nicely in your hand when you&#x27;re applying your make-up.  </li>
            <li> They shipped fast and were nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> The texture and absorbancy is amazing and they clean really well.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves these beauty blenders and would recommend to anyone looking for some great high quality and a set with a carrier.</li>
            <li> Often times when I used my Beauty Blender I had to reapply my CC under eye makeup and concealer multiple times to get good coverage since the sponge absorbed most of the makeup even with stippling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> Just still figuring using what to clean them.</li>
            <li> so you can clean them</li>
            <li> They give you on how to clean</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I found these to be much denser that the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> so I Believe it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> but wow I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It is a gift in itself, with a fine mesh section so that any moisture on your sponges can evaporate, keeping them fresh.</li>
            <li> Plus, easy to clean and they are really holding up!</li>
            <li> , I loved the 3 different sizes!..</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> Overall a greatbuy and a good alternative to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I LOVE trying new beauty products, it is like a hobby to me that I really enjoy</li>
            <li> am now be very proud owner of 3 blending brushes, and every single one of them is soft.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to get the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> main difference I see is that, the beauty blender is softer and way lighter, this sponge is more dense and a bit heavier.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Great little kit with storage to keep sponges clean and vented.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and easy to use and wash.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and blend really well.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, great for the porpuse of blending, three different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love that they come in a nice round case to keep them stored and protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just recently started using blending sponges, and I kind of just took the sales person&#x27;s word for it when I was at the makeup</li>
            <li> They clean easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them ripping or tearing.</li>
            <li> so my foundation would not be all absorbed by the sponge</li>
            <li> I feel that not only is Be You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge a better buy since you get three different sizes, but the longevity of these sponges will surpass my fairly new Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that when the blenders are nice and clean and dry they have a nice little storage space without them becoming moldy.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> For some reason, I get a more dewy finish when I am using this sponge, this is maybe due to the fact that it absorbs more water than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Much better value and wuality than the other more costly sponge I tried.</li>
            <li> I got them and used them right away.</li>
            <li> texture is great - not too rough but strong enough to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the how to clean and suggested uses guide they came with.</li>
            <li> I recieved this cool set of blenders for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;After testing these blenders, I have to say that they really do give you an airbrush finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it off is the cute little case the sponges come in.</li>
            <li> I used them as directed, and while it&#x27;s great that they don&#x27;t absorb any product, they are very firm and just push the makeup around on your face instead of blending it.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing these as gifts for Mothers Day and certainly for Christmas for all my friends!</li>
            <li> I cracked open the perfectly packaged set a few days ago</li>
            <li> They come with lovely packaging, storage container and instructions, feel wonderfully soft and work very well in my inexpert hands.</li>
            <li> Worth more than the beauty blender because you get 3 different sizes of the sponges and a case for it as well.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> So as I do anytime I recieve new brushes or sponges I clean them..</li>
            <li> I love that this set comes with 3 different sizes to use for contouring.</li>
            <li> Hear me out ;) ...&lt;</li>
            <li> She was hopeful that I recieved a fluke by mistake because she said she was checking multiple sponges in their warehouse after my incident to make sure there aren&#x27;t others like this...</li>
            <li> Thanks again Candy!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> and I love the different sizes it comes with</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time sifting through the Amazon offerings and reviews and finally decided on these by Be You, Beautifully</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller sponge for concealer application.</li>
            <li> love that the cleaning of the sponges is so perfectly simple.</li>
            <li> I love these blenders and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> But I just had to return them because they absorbed too much product.</li>
            <li> For $3 more, you got three in various sizes.  </li>
            <li> So I went back to applying my liquid foundation with my fingertips and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft.</li>
            <li> They will swell to almost double their original size!</li>
            <li> Went back to my original fav sponges I found on Amazon!</li>
            <li> They apply makeup very evenly and love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> It pretty much doubled in size.</li>
            <li> Just remember to wash a few times before the first use to receive better results!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant at first</li>
            <li> The very first thing that I did after trying these for the first time was throw my old blender away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy, I just use a mild shampoo to clean it, when dried it goes back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> got back to very quickly....</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this sponge feels much more durable and of higher quality then the Beauty Blender which feels like a rough kitchen sponge.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the little case to put the sponges in and the case closes easily and securely with a magnet.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that the little role that holds the sponges is super adorable.</li>
            <li> The 3 sizes are great for your full dace foundation, and to use for concealer in smaller hard to reach parts around your eye and nose.</li>
            <li> had already used the large blender so</li>
            <li> Since i&#x27;ve already used the large one, I can&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;ll never repurchase a wanna-be again.</li>
            <li> I use the large one for my foundation because it will get the job done quicker, lol.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Use the pointy tip of the teardrop to apply concealer or eye shadow around more hard to reach areas such as around your eyes or nose.&lt;br /&gt;You may dampen your blending sponge to give a nice even spread and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought the real beauty blender..</li>
            <li> /&gt;They really make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really like these makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> However, the total extent of my makeup routine was a shear foundation lightly applied with my fingers</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
            <li> Purchase the real deal.</li>
            <li> Or the real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very squishy and they really do blend my concealer flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you look at the product as a whole</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li> Then you just rinse it with clean water, and squeezing the sponge at the same time to get out all of the stuff that went into the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Then you just rinse it with clean water, and squeezing the sponge at the same time to get out all of the stuff that went into the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> and before I even sent pics in our convo she was already refunding me and sending me a new set!..</li>
            <li> I had the beauty blender previously and these are way better than those.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love the tiny sponge, because it does not pull my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried another brand of these new sponges and am not going to lie, am very committed to my high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves these Professional Blending Sponges!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the sponges.</li>
            <li> , I got this cute little box in the mail today and it happened to have my blending sponges.</li>
            <li> me tell you a few reasons: the classic teardrop shape is always better than any design, it also expands when you soak it in the water (like the beauty blender)</li>
            <li> To begin, this item came in a great little pouch that is small enough to fit in to my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This sponge seamlessly glided onto my skin and buffed out my makeup rather then absorbing it as my Beauty Blender did.  </li>
            <li> My foundation looks natural no matter how much highlighting and contouring I do.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was how extremely soft and squishy these were compared to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a much better deal than the other high end blender that is sold in major stores.</li>
            <li> really like that it has a tiny baby blender, because I can get into my eye area or my brow bone area without any problems of it being too large for that area and not blending</li>
            <li> I use the little one, which I absolutely positively completely and utterly in love, under my eye.</li>
            <li> The sponges themselves are very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> three sponges in our Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft and made from the highest quality materials which are guaranteed to never break, rip, or tear like some of the other cheaper brands you see on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The micro yellow one ripped the first time I washed it and the two black ones retain so much water then doesn&#x27;t bounce back very quick.</li>
            <li> WOW, I think I need to learn some new tricks.</li>
            <li> : make sure you dry them with a towel to get rid of all the water completely if using wet because if they have any access water inside, they might leave a streak,</li>
            <li> , eyeshadow applied with a cheap brush and a little lipstick.</li>
            <li> The little sponge is very useful for the under eye and nose area.</li>
            <li> And, unlike my old blender, these do not soak up a ton of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sponges are nowhere near the quality of beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I used baby soap that I already have since I have two young kids</li>
            <li> Your makeup will look so natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luxuriously Soft and Comparable to Beautyblender:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL</li>
            <li> Well when I went to clean the larger blender it did not bounce back to its shape (I even waited till the next day)</li>
            <li> They are, also, very cute which is totally irrelevant, of course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the cheap foundation sponges from the local drugstore, but decided to treat myself to these because I realized how silly it is that I spend so much money on high quality makeup...</li>
            <li> I was completely and utterly amazed!</li>
            <li> First, the three different sizes were not very useful.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe how nice they feel to the touch, but you can just feel the quality, they are firm... but soft and squishy at the same time.</li>
            <li> love contouring my face, but it&#x27;s really hard to do that with the round flat sponges.</li>
            <li> The large one, I use to apply my foundation with, medium for cream contour and the small one for highlighting/concealer.</li>
            <li> I use the large for foundation, medium for contouring and highlighting and the small for concealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 3 sizes in the set- large, medium and small.</li>
            <li> I have used the large for my liquid foundation and the small one for my concealer.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago and had high hopes that they would be a cheaper Beauty Blender alternative, but they did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I found this sponge to be very similar to a soft memory foam and visibly with less pores then the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> the last thing that I want is anything to mess with the natural elasticity of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quality sponges, seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The other pictures are of the large blender dry and the other when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that it would be really odd at first for me to apply my makeup with these</li>
            <li> The one that I had used was really hard and kind of pulled on my skin which I actually thought defeated the purpose of using a beauty sponge, but now I know that it was not me doing something wrong</li>
            <li> Then a few months ago I went with a friend to a department store to watch as she had her makeup done by a M.A.C. professional.</li>
            <li> This is excellent because these sponges just lying around free to get dirty in my makeup bag, makes for unintended streaks on my face and for a nasty sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge is difficult to wash and takes a long time to get clean.</li>
            <li> only reason I am rating this a 3 Stars is that I wish the smallest sponge was just a little bigger...</li>
            <li> I use them dry sometimes when in a hurry</li>
            <li> so your sponge can dry and breathe inside.</li>
            <li> so your sponge can dry and breathe inside.  </li>
            <li> Even with proper cleaning my Beauty Blender started to flake and tear after only a few months of owning it.</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re so small you don&#x27;t have to soak it like you would normally have to do with other sponges.</li>
            <li> is a little harder to use because its so small, I just don&#x27;t see myself using that one as much.</li>
            <li> I completely plan on carrying this role with my delicate makeup in my purse.</li>
            <li> It is a mesh type case so it won&#x27;t trap in moisture and is closed by a magnetic flap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is suggested to get these wet before use and squeeze, not wring, out any excess water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attaching a picture to show the size and also a second picture with the little one damp!</li>
            <li> Also although this sponge is made by a small woman owned business (I received numerous emails from this company btw)</li>
            <li> I did wet the sponge a little bit</li>
            <li> For someone who is average at makeup application, the book walks you through what you need to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find I&#x27;m using less foundation and concealer than before.</li>
            <li> It is not on the box, not on the sponges, not on the magnetic black holder.</li>
            <li> I do use organic makeup so it stains the black blender</li>
            <li> They come in a neat little mesh case that has a magnetic flap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always put my concealer and foundation on with my finger because I felt like sponges wasted the product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t waste any of the makeup at all.</li>
            <li> My makeup no longer feels heavy and caked on.</li>
            <li> so your makeup isn&#x27;t wasted like with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> like I usually do.</li>
            <li> These sponges are very firm and soak up a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I have been having a horrible issue with foundation making my fine lines stand out to the point that I gave up wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is a hard, non-porous, rubber ball attempting to bounce makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> they are so hard even if you but them in water ,,,, if you tried beauty blender before you wont like these at all</li>
            <li> Use the large base of the Sponge to apply liquid primers, concealers, foundations, blushes or eye shadows.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a way to step your makeup game up</li>
            <li> Come to find out, I was told to buy the wrong sponge.</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t get as close to your eye without stabbing yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And then just pressing need the dirty area and work out all of the product from the sponge.</li>
            <li> And then just pressing need the dirty area and work out all of the product from the sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> And that was after watching maybe 15 YouTube videos because I still did not quite understand why my blending was as horrible as it was.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The name says it all and it&#x27;s the truth! These sponges are of highest quality and a far more superior than a BeautyBlender. The large one, I use to apply my foundation with, medium for cream contour and the small one for highlighting/concealer. Save your money and buy these, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these makeup sponges! They are easy to use and blend really well. I love that this set comes with 3 different sizes to use for contouring. A great product!</li>
            <li> Love the 3 sponges - all good, workable sizes.  Quality sponges, seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> These are the best!! I now can apply my makeup in every crook and cranny. Good quality sponge that blends the make up well, easy to clean and comes in an awesome carrying bag!</li>
            <li> These blenders are wonderful.  I am so glad I bought them. They apply makeup very evenly and love the different sizes. I use them dry sometimes when in a hurry and they work great that way too. I use the large for foundation, medium for contouring and highlighting and the small for concealer. Tip: make sure you dry them with a towel to get rid of all the water completely if using wet because if they have any access water inside, they might leave a streak,however if used and cleaned probably, they work great.</li>
            <li> I was not that impress by this product.. I wish I would have bought the real beauty blender.. But am still learning how to use what I have at the moment..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the need to use the sponges as I bought them with the brushes set and it&#x27;s so good at blending my make up, however, I can say that their material feels like really good quality and the case in which they come is very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is above expectations and all concerns or questions I had were taken care off immediately. Really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> love this product. works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I love more...these sponges or the pouch that comes with it! There are three sponges of various sizes for different parts of your face. The pouch is an excellent idea/size for travel and storage purposes.</li>
            <li> While my first impression of these were not that good, I still am giving this review 5 stars...Hear me out ;) ...&lt;br /&gt;I recieved my set and they were so soft and wrapped beautifully, I loved the 3 different sizes!.. So as I do anytime I recieve new brushes or sponges I clean them.. Well when I went to clean the larger blender it did not bounce back to its shape (I even waited till the next day) so it kind of just molded there :/..The other 2 I had no issues with and they blended flawlessly.. So I reached out to the owner and Candy got back to very quickly....So here is why I gave this 5 stars... Candy was super nice and before I even sent pics in our convo she was already refunding me and sending me a new set!.. Awesome right?!.. She was hopeful that I recieved a fluke by mistake because she said she was checking multiple sponges in their warehouse after my incident to make sure there aren&#x27;t others like this... I recieved my 2nd set the very next day and tried them out and NO issue at all, they blend beautifully and the larger one worked great! Thanks again Candy!</li>
            <li> The very first thing that I did after trying these for the first time was throw my old blender away. It was an off brand on that I THOUGHT worked fine. These sponges by Be You, Beautifully blow all others I have tried away. I love that they come in a nice round case to keep them stored and protected. It is a mesh type case so it won&#x27;t trap in moisture and is closed by a magnetic flap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 sizes in the set- large, medium and small. I have used the large for my liquid foundation and the small one for my concealer. I&#x27;m keeping the medium sized one for a backup. The first thing that I noticed was how extremely soft and squishy these were compared to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is suggested to get these wet before use and squeeze, not wring, out any excess water. They will swell to almost double their original size! I found that doing this makes a huge difference in the way my makeup goes on. It is much smoother and more evenly distributed. Using these in general have made my makeup look airbrushed and perfect. And, unlike my old blender, these do not soak up a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already used the large blender so, it is slightly bigger and has some product on it. The other pictures are of the large blender dry and the other when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a way to step your makeup game up then you must try these! It is a much better deal than the other high end blender that is sold in major stores. Everything from Be You, Beautifully has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided this product for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Love using these to apply my foundation. Definitely salon quality</li>
            <li> I have never tried the beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare but the Better Than BeautyBlender works great.</li>
            <li> Really amazing! I&#x27;m kind of newbie on doing makeup. But this does a quick and great job for my morning makeup process before work. You can touch and feel the good material. Just still figuring using what to clean them. Really happy for my purchase!^^</li>
            <li> Ok I have the BB egg. I tried this and I LOVED it! It does have a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; feel to it but I like it. I like the way it spreads the foundation on my face. The little sponge is very useful for the under eye and nose area. It works great applying powder also.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge color allows you to see where the makeup is on the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great - not too rough but strong enough to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are washable and reusable. They even come with cleaning instructions so you can clean them properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user guide is great. For someone who is average at makeup application, the book walks you through what you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is awesome for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered these sponges before I actually needed them because of the great deal.  I cracked open the perfectly packaged set a few days ago and I felt like I had set aside a diamond to use a rock.  These sponges are amazing.  I had the beauty blender previously and these are way better than those.  The texture and absorbancy is amazing and they clean really well.  I like the carrying case too.  It&#x27;s a nice touch and handy to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Good quality. They are very soft, great for the porpuse of blending, three different sizes. Come in a nice case.</li>
            <li> Great little kit with storage to keep sponges clean and vented. Perfect so ze for detailing.</li>
            <li> This is not comparable to Beauty Blenders. It looks like a Beauty Blender, but do not be fooled. This is a hard, non-porous, rubber ball attempting to bounce makeup on my face. It&#x27;s horrible. Since i&#x27;ve already used the large one, I can&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;ll never repurchase a wanna-be again. My mistake and I&#x27;ve learned.</li>
            <li> I love putting on my make up with Be You Beautifully Blending sponges.  I&#x27;ve always used the cheap foundation sponges from the local drugstore, but decided to treat myself to these because I realized how silly it is that I spend so much money on high quality makeup...yet was not purchasing premium quality brushes and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really make a difference.  My makeup now goes on smooth and flawlessly...and the sponges feel so good against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am rating this a 3 Stars is that I wish the smallest sponge was just a little bigger...I have really big fingers and it&#x27;s not as easy for me to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m probably being way too picky.  I love this product and would definitely recommend it to others.  I plan on purchasing these as gifts for Mothers Day and certainly for Christmas for all my friends!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves these Professional Blending Sponges!  The set is amazing, everything about it!  The three sponges are the perfect size and texture. It is hard to describe how nice they feel to the touch, but you can just feel the quality, they are firm... but soft and squishy at the same time. The sizes are perfect too, and will definitely handle all the makeup challenges she could face. To top it off is the cute little case the sponges come in. It is a gift in itself, with a fine mesh section so that any moisture on your sponges can evaporate, keeping them fresh. It closes nicely and is made well. My opinion of this product is my own, and my daughter&#x27;s, and has not been influenced in any way by the discount that I received on this purchase. This set IS worth the money, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Simple comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge is a totally different texture compared to the Beauty Blender.  I found this sponge to be very similar to a soft memory foam and visibly with less pores then the Beauty Blender.  This sponge seamlessly glided onto my skin and buffed out my makeup rather then absorbing it as my Beauty Blender did.  Often times when I used my Beauty Blender I had to reapply my CC under eye makeup and concealer multiple times to get good coverage since the sponge absorbed most of the makeup even with stippling.  Furthermore, this sponge feels much more durable and of higher quality then the Beauty Blender which feels like a rough kitchen sponge.  Even with proper cleaning my Beauty Blender started to flake and tear after only a few months of owning it. I feel that not only is Be You, Beautifully&#x27;s sponge a better buy since you get three different sizes, but the longevity of these sponges will surpass my fairly new Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Images depict Be You, Beautifully sponges after first wash.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes.  Very high quality and easy to use and wash.  Perfect for a variety of different make ups and applications.</li>
            <li> The sponges are nowhere near the quality of beauty blender. The micro yellow one ripped the first time I washed it and the two black ones retain so much water then doesn&#x27;t bounce back very quick. The mesh bag is awesome though it&#x27;s the best for drying you beauty blenders on the go I must say I love this travel bag</li>
            <li> So my daughter has been bugging me to buy a beauty blender and always raves about them. I purchased this and watched some YouTube videos to learn how to apply foundation with it. I have been having a horrible issue with foundation making my fine lines stand out to the point that I gave up wearing it. I tried the blending sponge and let me tell you I am hooked. It made my fine lines disappear!!</li>
            <li> These work so beautifully. very nice upgrade from the normal drugstore sponges. Did not even know that I needed these!</li>
            <li> I really love that it comes with it&#x27;s own pouch to hold all the sponges. I like the 3 different sizes too! They&#x27;re great quality sponges and blended my makeup well. I&#x27;m attaching a picture to show the size and also a second picture with the little one damp! It pretty much doubled in size. It&#x27;s so cute! I actually wish there was an option to get all 3 of them in the lighter color. That&#x27;s just a preference though, nothing that affects the quality or function of the product. This would definitely make a great gift for makeup lovers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> They work great but in my opinion do not apply make up as smooth as the original beauty blender. Still a great buy and I love the different sizes it comes with</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I really like these makeup sponges. That said, let me add that I have NO prior experience with makeup sponges. I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to makeup. I&#x27;m 72 and I&#x27;ve always worn makeup when outside the house since I was a teenager. However, the total extent of my makeup routine was a shear foundation lightly applied with my fingers, eyeshadow applied with a cheap brush and a little lipstick. Then a few months ago I went with a friend to a department store to watch as she had her makeup done by a M.A.C. professional. I was completely and utterly amazed! It was just MAGIC. I went WOW, I think I need to learn some new tricks. Anyway, I began watching makeup videos on YouTube by the hour and decided to get some sponges and brushes for starters. I spent a lot of time sifting through the Amazon offerings and reviews and finally decided on these by Be You, Beautifully and I&#x27;m not sorry. They come with lovely packaging, storage container and instructions, feel wonderfully soft and work very well in my inexpert hands. They are, also, very cute which is totally irrelevant, of course. ☺️</li>
            <li> These are quality sponges. It comes in 3 sizes. Each size is perfect for the different areas of your face and blend the makeup professionally.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes in a  nice multipurpose pouch for storage. Its got net mesh so your sponge can dry and breathe inside. Latex free, hypoallergenic, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount but the opinions expressed here are my own and I have not been compensated for them.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges! My foundation looks natural no matter how much highlighting and contouring I do. The sponges offer even coverage and fits perfectly in the contours of your face. Just remember to wash a few times before the first use to receive better results!</li>
            <li> Lovely sponges. Just what I wanted. Applies makeup flawlessly. Altough the sponge itself is sense it does not soak up the foundation. I love the smaller sponge for concealer application. Overall a greatbuy and a good alternative to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just recently started using blending sponges, and I kind of just took the sales person&#x27;s word for it when I was at the makeup store.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t liked it, I think I tried using it three times. And that was after watching maybe 15 YouTube videos because I still did not quite understand why my blending was as horrible as it was. Come to find out, I was told to buy the wrong sponge. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love contouring my face, but it&#x27;s really hard to do that with the round flat sponges. Because it doesn&#x27;t get as close to your eye without stabbing yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, I got this cute little box in the mail today and it happened to have my blending sponges. And I have to say that the little role that holds the sponges is super adorable. I completely plan on carrying this role with my delicate makeup in my purse. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now be very proud owner of 3 blending brushes, and every single one of them is soft. The one that I had used was really hard and kind of pulled on my skin which I actually thought defeated the purpose of using a beauty sponge, but now I know that it was not me doing something wrong it was because the salesperson was, well? I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the three blending brushes! I use the large one for my foundation because it will get the job done quicker, lol.&lt;br /&gt; The medium one is perfect for contouring because why would you need a huge sponge to blend in your contour?&lt;br /&gt;And I use the little one, which I absolutely positively completely and utterly in love, under my eye. I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love the tiny sponge, because it does not pull my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I get up in my age the last thing that I want is anything to mess with the natural elasticity of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the cleaning of the sponges is so perfectly simple. Because they&#x27;re so small you don&#x27;t have to soak it like you would normally have to do with other sponges. All you have to do is add a dab of water onto the sponge that is stained, and work soap into the area. And then just pressing need the dirty area and work out all of the product from the sponge. Then you just rinse it with clean water, and squeezing the sponge at the same time to get out all of the stuff that went into the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these  beauty blending sponges are latex free, you can reuse them a million times without them breaking, or cracking, because they are very professionally made, with a perfect density, the most perfect design ever, and just all around quality!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.d, and work soap into the area.

            <li> Great price for three sponges along with a case. However, I don&#x27;t like that it absorbs my product. Too porous compared to another sponge I use. Still does the job but I do need to use more product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and I love that it comes in a cute case! The three sizes is very useful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always put my concealer and foundation on with my finger because I felt like sponges wasted the product. I can honestly say these songs are not the case. They don&#x27;t waste any of the makeup at all. In fact I think I get much better coverage using these sponges and I find I&#x27;m using less foundation and concealer than before. My makeup no longer feels heavy and caked on. These sponges are great. They clean easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with them ripping or tearing. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own.</li>
            <li> I love this set because it made my wife so happy. She has been looking for some sponges and she absolutely loves these beauty blenders and would recommend to anyone looking for some great high quality and a set with a carrier. it is very nice.</li>
            <li> I love it, make up glides beautifully and evenly and the packaging and holder is a plus! Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE trying new beauty products, it is like a hobby to me that I really enjoy so I was so excited to purchase these at an awesome promotional price. To start off the packaging of this sponge set is phenomenal! It comes with the little case to put the sponges in and the case closes easily and securely with a magnet. I love that I can store these sponges together and I won&#x27;t lose or misplace them! The sponges themselves are very soft and squishy. I was a little nervous that it would be really odd at first for me to apply my makeup with these but it was easy to get the hang of it pretty quickly. I felt like my makeup looked smoother, I loved applying my foundation with this instead of using my fingers like I usually do. I did wet the sponge a little bit so my foundation would not be all absorbed by the sponge but you could probably skip that step and be fine.  The only downside I would say at all is the littlest sponge is a little harder to use because its so small, I just don&#x27;t see myself using that one as much. Anyway, They are also SOO easy to clean! I used baby soap that I already have since I have two young kids and it worked great. They give you on how to clean it included so no worries!! I HIGHLY recommend these! Even if you aren&#x27;t a beauty nut like me, if you apply makeup anytime....get these! :)</li>
            <li> Best Sponge Ever! My foundation is easy to apply and my face is flawless. I will order again and suggest to friends.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all , there is no comparison between these and the beauty blender they are so hard even if you but them in water ,,,, if you tried beauty blender before you wont like these at all</li>
            <li> Works perfect, saves money!</li>
            <li> I love this Blending Sponge Set by Be You. Words cannot describe how amazing it works! It smoothes out the foundation with no problem at all. Your makeup will look so natural. It smoothes out the foundation with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luxuriously Soft and Comparable to Beautyblender:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL three sponges in our Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft and made from the highest quality materials which are guaranteed to never break, rip, or tear like some of the other cheaper brands you see on Amazon. We have hundreds of happy customers that are converts from Beautyblender that say the Blending Sponge Set by Be You! BEAUTIFULLY is just as good (if not, BETTER) than Beautyblender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> These do seem to spread my foundation out more evenly, but I for some reason still prefer just using my hands.</li>
            <li> great makeup set. i purchased as a gift for younger family members and they are learning makeup applications with this!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order these because of the price but wow I&#x27;m so glad I did! I definitely wanted a quality product when it comes to my foundation because if you have a low end blender then your makeup will show it. This product is amazing, it blends my foundation and concealer perfectly! I have been using these for over 2 months now and none has cracked or ripped at all. The 3 sizes are great for your full dace foundation, and to use for concealer in smaller hard to reach parts around your eye and nose. Make sure you dampen the sponge before applying makeup, or you will end up with a blotchy effect. I love these blenders and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love these applicators!  They allow me to a save my fingertips from getting makeup all over amd are more hygienic. They are easily washed with a bit of hand soap or shampoo. They come in a neat little mesh case that has a magnetic flap.</li>
            <li> I got them and used them right away. They made my make up look flawless. Great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, will love using this</li>
            <li> Love the three sizes of the spoges.  Each one I use depanding on my covrage of area.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges. I myself owns a beauty blender, and I have tried and tested numerous sponges that claims to be the blender &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;... This sponge however, can be the dupe for the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you a few reasons: the classic teardrop shape is always better than any design, it also expands when you soak it in the water (like the beauty blender), it blends beautifully, it can be used on either water or oil based foundations, it can also be used for setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference I see is that, the beauty blender is softer and way lighter, this sponge is more dense and a bit heavier. I feel like this sponge soak more water compared to the beauty blender. For some reason, I get a more dewy finish when I am using this sponge, this is maybe due to the fact that it absorbs more water than the beauty blender. Also, the tip of this sponge is sharper compared to the beauty blender. However, it still blends beautifully over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, I just use a mild shampoo to clean it, when dried it goes back to it&#x27;s original shape. In my two weeks of using it, I never saw any signs of tear. I love that it&#x27;s latex free! Best of all? You get three blending sponges for the price of one beauty blender, plus you get a travelling case! I purchase this using a promo code for review.</li>
            <li> I love it. The quality is really good.</li>
            <li> These are NOTHING like beauty blenders. These sponges are very firm and soak up a lot of product. Purchase the real deal. Or the real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> Everything went well with my order. The sponges are as described and I am enjoying using them. They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sponges for professional looking makeup application.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago and had high hopes that they would be a cheaper Beauty Blender alternative, but they did not work for me. First, the three different sizes were not very useful. The smallest one is really tiny. I have no idea what you would use it for and the medium one is not really necessary either. Most importantly, I found these to be much denser that the Beauty Blender. I used them as directed, and while it&#x27;s great that they don&#x27;t absorb any product, they are very firm and just push the makeup around on your face instead of blending it. I have had better results applying foundation with my hands or using cheap drugstore sponges than using these.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant at first but I LOVE these!!! They are great, even coverage when applying and non-greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> They work so great!! I love them</li>
            <li> I tried to like them because I loved the sponge sizes and loved the cute case! But I just had to return them because they absorbed too much product. Wasting good foundation wasn&#x27;t worth keeping these sponges &amp; cute case. Went back to my original fav sponges I found on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Worth more than the beauty blender because you get 3 different sizes of the sponges and a case for it as well. It works just like the beauty blender so I have no complaints :)</li>
            <li> great sponges, does exactly what it says it would do</li>
            <li> love putting makeup on with these  so smooth</li>
            <li> After hearing about the Beauty Blender, I purchased a knock off and did not get the results I had read about. Back to square one.  I planned on purchasing the original, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I chose the Be You, Beautifully blenders because I got more bang for my buck.  For $3 more, you got three in various sizes.  I love these blenders; they are the perfect firmness and do an amazing job.  I use all three and I am glad I listened to the reviews and took a chance.  I also purchased their brushes and I am glad I did, they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of 3 blending egg sponges so I can apply my liquid foundation.more evenly and also based upon the rave reviews here. I used the sponge as directed and squeezed out the water and blotted it and then applied my liquid makeup and &amp;#34;bounced&amp;#34; the egg over my skin as directed. It does make my skin look nice everywhere but around my nose and mouth. I used a smaller sponge for those areas and I still can not get an even application. So I went back to applying my liquid foundation with my fingertips and it works much better. The sponge is difficult to wash and takes a long time to get clean. Also although this sponge is made by a small woman owned business (I received numerous emails from this company btw) I have yet to see where these sponges are made. Isn&#x27;t there a law that states you must put the country of origin of where the product was made? It is not on the box, not on the sponges, not on the magnetic black holder.</li>
            <li> Makeup applicators like brushes and now this blending sponge by Be you, Beautiful is one the best ones i have. The quality of this blending sponge is great. It comes in 3 sizes. Use the large base of the Sponge to apply liquid primers, concealers, foundations, blushes or eye shadows. Use the pointy tip of the teardrop to apply concealer or eye shadow around more hard to reach areas such as around your eyes or nose.&lt;br /&gt;You may dampen your blending sponge to give a nice even spread and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 sizes can be used for different parts of your face. This also comes in a lovely pouch which is a multipurpose pouch. Its got net mesh so your sponge can dry and breathe inside.  Blending Sponge Set are latex free, hypoallergenic, and luxuriously soft. I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I recieved this cool set of blenders for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;After testing these blenders, I have to say that they really do give you an airbrush finish.&lt;br /&gt;They are very squishy and they really do blend my concealer flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has a tiny baby blender, because I can get into my eye area or my brow bone area without any problems of it being too large for that area and not blending properly.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a beautiful case with a mesh so that when the blenders are nice and clean and dry they have a nice little storage space without them becoming moldy.&lt;br /&gt;In the collage pic below I used two of the blenders and they worked fantastic at blending my concealer all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use a lot of concealer because I also use it as a foundation as well and then I will add my powder later.&lt;br /&gt;I really really do like the Beauty blenders from be you beautifully. I also like the case they  come with because I can travel with it without any fuss of them getting lost or getting moldy.</li>
            <li> I had tried another brand of these new sponges and am not going to lie, am very committed to my high quality brushes. However, when I was offered these sponges at a discount in return for my honest review, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again. To begin, this item came in a great little pouch that is small enough to fit in to my makeup bag. This is excellent because these sponges just lying around free to get dirty in my makeup bag, makes for unintended streaks on my face and for a nasty sponge. The package prevents that. The three different sizes are perfect for a heavier application or to blend already applied makeup. The big one, I used for my mineral powder foundation. The smallest I used for my eye makeup as a blender and the medium was perfect for blending my concealer under the eyes and around my nose. I highly recommend the sponges. I also appreciated the how to clean and suggested uses guide they came with. Much better value and wuality than the other more costly sponge I tried. What&#x27;s even better is that they come wrapped in side of the carrying case.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of high quality sponges.</li>
            <li> I love them make up is alot better now and easier</li>
            <li> Love ❤ them wish they were way bigger though</li>
            <li> Professional coverage at a great price. Plus, easy to clean and they are really holding up!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this. I also have the core chic brush collection (which I adore) these are the perfect sizes not porous so your makeup isn&#x27;t wasted like with the beauty blender. I do use organic makeup so it stains the black blender but I wash it prescribed by the phamplet it comes with so I Believe it&#x27;s clean. That&#x27;s just a personal note. I can always try a different soap. If you look at the product as a whole it&#x27;s the best blender out there and you can&#x27;t beat the price!! Thanks so much for a quality product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! They really help with contouring and the shape fits nicely in your hand when you&#x27;re applying your make-up.  These don&#x27;t just soak up all your liquid makeups, either.  I highly recommend them!  They shipped fast and were nicely packaged.  I would buy these again.</li>
