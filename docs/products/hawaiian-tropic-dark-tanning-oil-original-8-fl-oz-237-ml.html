            <li>Arrived quickly and a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the most popular brand ever.</li>
            <li>this is also the best tanning oil I have ever used as far as getting a darker sun tan.</li>
            <li>, this stuff has some pretty great oils in it, my question is...could this be used as a moisturizer for your hair?..</li>
            <li>Works better than any skin cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I get more of a tan when I put this on as opposed to when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>love this stuff and have used this since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>The reason I mention this is because I have used so many different lotions and oils that I have a pretty good idea of what tanning oil is the best</li>
            <li>Very nice dark tan, easy to apply, great tanning oil.</li>
            <li>I have used this product since I was a teenager because it is a wonderful body moisturizer for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>But I tan easily.  </li>
            <li>oily though so not for skin that breaks out easily</li>
            <li>enjoy enjoy enjoy :-)</li>
            <li>Hawaiian tropic dark tanning oil is the best tanning oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is especially good for legs but too heavy for the face.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will get a fantastic tan.</li>
            <li>It gave her a nice tan, didn&#x27;t burn and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Consistently get great tanning results and find it simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Happy with product but did not realise that postage from the UK to New Zealand was going to be more than the actual purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no magic tanning formula...just very good for your skin and will produce a fantastic tan if you know how to tan....</li>
            <li>you need a tanning oil for more active/sporty use, I recommend this because it stays on very well</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized (I have super dry skin) and the tan is amazing and even:)</li>
            <li>It also gives you a slight brown color as if you have been often in the sun, and smells great.</li>
            <li>It is the freshest most natural smelling product you can put on your body.  </li>
            <li>I have older skin which dries out easily.</li>
            <li>Good product when ever  I am in doubt about other tanning products.</li>
            <li>You put a bit in your hand, rub it around until it is warm and apply to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I would warn you to put sunscreen under the oil on areas such as your face that tend to burn more.</li>
            <li>This is oil, you&#x27;re pretty much baking yourself in the sun.</li>
            <li>I tan easily and get a fair tan line in an hour, but my tan looks dry and uneven after I get out of the sun.</li>
            <li>Great since my other lotions were confiscated at Honolulu Security - packed in wrong luggage - very glad I have this one.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY it did, I think I have something like Baby skin now everywhere</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s very oily and doesn&#x27;t stay on like</li>
            <li>thanks a bunch in advance..</li>
            <li>This oil works wonders if you want to tan REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>This product makes a a huge difference in how dry my skin is in the winter.  </li>
            <li>stuff is classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with a naturally tanning skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this suntan lotion many times in the past, but now that I&#x27;m older, I quit using it several years ago.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally the color of coffee with milk.  </li>
            <li>But my brothers and I started swimming at an extremely young age and we have always been water dogs.</li>
            <li>I literally have to have this every summer or my summer just isn&#x27;t complete.</li>
            <li>Then I got this great idea, because of old age, my skin was drying out and flaking like mad, so I remembered that this lotion always kept my skin soft and never dry, back in my younger years, so I purchased it to try and see if it would work in my older age.</li>
            <li>Recommended tanning oil for those already with tans, or for a general body lotion.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re getting older, and have dry, flaky skin, try it, I think you&#x27;ll find it does wonders for your skin, but don&#x27;t buy it with any sunscreens</li>

            <li> Not only do you get a darker tan, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t take as long to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it works so well, be sure to use sunblock especially on delicate areas.</li>

            <li> Ok, I know that is technically a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> BUT like pp mentioned, be careful.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, especially since I could have gotten it from wal Mart for seven dollars</li>
            <li> A little but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other tanning oil does when you go in and out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used Hawaiian Tropic Dark Tanning Oil for years and would not consider changing.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a little bit too oily though, as the liquid comes out very abruptly.</li>
            <li> Deep dark tan!!!!</li>
            <li> Do that, or you will have an oil slick in the water.  </li>
            <li> Thick...</li>

So if you&#x27;re getting older, and have dry, flaky skin, try it, I think you&#x27;ll find it does wonders for your skin, but don&#x27;t buy it with any sunscreens,I think that&#x27;s why it works so well, SPF&#x3D;zero. It also gives you a slight brown color as if you have been often in the sun, and smells great.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally the color of coffee with milk.  I don&#x27;t need to lie in the sun or go to tanning salons.  I have used this product since I was a teenager because it is a wonderful body moisturizer for very dry skin.  It is an oil, it contains cocoa butter.  You put a bit in your hand, rub it around until it is warm and apply to dry skin.  Then take a towel and remove the excess. It is especially good for legs but too heavy for the face.  I even put some in my hair an hour before I shampoo it.  It is the freshest most natural smelling product you can put on your body.  Enjoy.</li>

I&#x27;m just trying to save you the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is classic. I remember this every summer and the smell of it just takes me back. I literally have to have this every summer or my summer just isn&#x27;t complete. Reminds me of Pina Coladas and the family pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the most popular brand ever. All the ladies that came over to swim used this. Yes, it&#x27;s very oily and doesn&#x27;t stay on like other tanning oil does when you go in and out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT this is also the best tanning oil I have ever used as far as getting a darker sun tan. Not only do you get a darker tan, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t take as long to work. I can lay out one afternoon and get a nice tan using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it works so well, be sure to use sunblock especially on delicate areas. For me the shoulders, face, and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a sports tanning oil that you put on and go in and out of the pool. This is the kind you put on then lay out by the pool reading and you&#x27;ll get a great tan. This is for lounging and relaxing. The smell even relaxes you, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that if you want the darkest tan possible in the shortest amount of time possible, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a tanning oil for more active/sporty use, I recommend this because it stays on very well and I reviewed it, too. Doesn&#x27;t tan as well but stays on during beach and pool activities like diving, pool games, etc:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ET77B6 Banana Boat Deep Tanning Oil, SPF 0, 8-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is the best sunscreen I have ever used in my life which I would recommend to anybody. Stays on ALL day even with strenuous activities like wake boarding and diving.

            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the way this stuff smells, if they made a perfume like this I&#x27;d be first in line to buy it! It definitely moisturizes well and I feel like I get more of a tan when I put this on as opposed to when I don&#x27;t. BUT like pp mentioned, be careful. This is oil, you&#x27;re pretty much baking yourself in the sun.</li>
            <li> Ok, I know that is technically a bad thing.  But I tan easily.  Smells yummy and works great.  Thick...so maybe it is blocking some of the Sun&#x27;s rays...who knows?  We have an outside shower to use before going in pool.  Do that, or you will have an oil slick in the water.  So for the Beach this is great for people who tan without burning on their own.</li>
            <li> Great since my other lotions were confiscated at Honolulu Security - packed in wrong luggage - very glad I have this one.</li>
            <li> Just as always, a superior product and smells great too! Recommended tanning oil for those already with tans, or for a general body lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil! I only every use this brand. Great value great price!! A little but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using  Hawaiian tropic tanning oil for over 35 years.  It&#x27;s no magic tanning formula...just very good for your skin and will produce a fantastic tan if you know how to tan....Formula for laying in the sun.  Lay 10 minutes on each side for a week. Put on Oil each time&lt;br /&gt;Lay 20 minutes each side the following week.  Daily if you can.  Best sun....10AM  and after 3pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get a fantastic tan.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used to buy this stuff at Target. They don&#x27;t sell it there anymore so we have to go through Amazon now. It gave her a nice tan, didn&#x27;t burn and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Hawaiian tropic dark tanning oil is the best tanning oil I have ever used.  It gives you a great tan and leaves a very nice coconut scent.  Deep dark tan!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil...works perfect with the nice brown tan,just have no protection so be careful for how long you stay on the sun...enjoy enjoy enjoy :-)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time. But when ever I do, I know i will tan good. I need to have some and i couldnt find any around town of the orginal. Good product when ever  I am in doubt about other tanning products. I always go back to old realiable, Hawaiian tropic dark tanning oil ORGINAL-GOOD STUUF</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great and promotes better tan...oily though so not for skin that breaks out easily</li>
            <li> Very nice dark tan, easy to apply, great tanning oil. Sometimes a little bit too oily though, as the liquid comes out very abruptly.</li>
            <li> I have older skin which dries out easily. Always used the product for tanning and after tanning when I was younger and have recently started using it before going to bed on my face.  It&#x27;s very dry here and the winter air creates havoc with my skin.  This product makes a a huge difference in how dry my skin is in the winter.  And it smells delicious to go to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and it is AMAZING! I tan easily and get a fair tan line in an hour, but my tan looks dry and uneven after I get out of the sun. I started using this and 1. I can get a great tan in 30 minutes, and 2. It keeps my skin moisturized (I have super dry skin) and the tan is amazing and even:)</li>
            <li> I have a question. .I love this stuff and have used this since I was a teenager. .anyhow, this stuff has some pretty great oils in it, my question is...could this be used as a moisturizer for your hair?..has anyone ever done this?.please let me know..thanks a bunch in advance..patty.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed. Waste of money, especially since I could have gotten it from wal Mart for seven dollars</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and a great product.</li>
            <li> Happy with product but did not realise that postage from the UK to New Zealand was going to be more than the actual purchase. Oh well you learn by your mistakes. But as I said really happy with the product</li>
            <li> This oil works wonders if you want to tan REALLY fast. I would warn you to put sunscreen under the oil on areas such as your face that tend to burn more.</li>
