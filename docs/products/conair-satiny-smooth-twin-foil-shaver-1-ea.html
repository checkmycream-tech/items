            <li>Just the perfect size and does the job!</li>
            <li>The best product for a women who don&#x27;t want to share trimmers with a guy.  </li>
            <li>I used this one time and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she says it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li>Had bought an electric Conair before and loved it, just looked like that one.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>this was good</li>
            <li>Recharging cord would have been a nice feature to have instead of batteries.</li>
            <li>The product runs on two AAA batteries which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>what kind of  batteries I put in it.</li>
            <li>Love that you just put in batteries</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>her word stands! :)</li>
            <li>She love this</li>
            <li>Plus its safe for preteens to use.</li>
            <li>And using on DRY hair is important for best results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>For battery operated, works fine.  </li>
            <li>and I was so thankful to find this one at such a great price</li>
            <li>and she say it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>Shaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>Does not cut smooth or close at all.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of having a battery-operated razor for travel or camping, especially a smaller product that fits easily into a pouch, and I thought this would be a good solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Aldi during a special.  </li>
            <li>but, when I went to use it again I had to go over the area 5 times and still it did not work right</li>
            <li>its a nice simple shaver, batterey operated, which is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Rubbish from the first use , it doesn&#x27;t worth even one dollar.</li>
            <li>When I got the shaver I used it right way, it cut the first time</li>
            <li>You are better of buying a regular shaver.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m wishing I&#x27;d found the reviews here first.</li>
            <li>It did a fairly good job the first time, definitely not as smooth as a razor, but I figured in a pinch</li>
            <li>I wasnt aware that this was battery operated.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to hold, batteries last a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t cut my skin.  </li>
            <li>So its good if you need to trim down but not to completely shave with it.</li>
            <li>Nice little shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>Having a cordless shaver is a real blessing and easier to pack and transport.</li>
            <li>They used to be a reputable company that stood behind what it made many years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, so hair is getting finer anyway.  </li>
            <li>i love my little shaver!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you want to spend less than thirty minutes shaving AND want smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I need to hold it lightly instead of pushing down hard, and 2) one has to use a paint brush approach to go over each area more than once.  </li>
            <li>right (to heavy).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for touch ups, but definitely doesn&#x27;t do the job properly, leaves a lot of hair behind untouched.</li>
            <li>I did every stroke from light to heavy, back and forth, in circles, all to little or no effect.  </li>

            <li> Dollar store razors work much faster and better, even if they leave my legs bloody.  </li>
            <li> Really, if you need to shave your legs every other day at least, this product is a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Apparently that is a common problem with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair should be ashamed of selling such a shoddy product.</li>
            <li> Goes bad after the 4th shave i tried to wash it and clean it</li>
            <li> For a little bit of money, Conair is filling landfills with waste.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair unit that had to be charged and it would never fit on the charger</li>
            <li> Pressing too hard and not going up and down does not allow foil/blades to capture and cut the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric and battery operated razors, and none of them were anywhere near as bad as this one was.</li>
            <li> Not even the pop-up trimmer did its job, and after coming here, I&#x27;m seeing that this is an all too common problem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut hair, but at least my skin is intact.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product, I think they sent me an old Shaver or used razor blades, I will never buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> It kept me from having to deal with stubble rubbing against my jeans and irritating my skin, and it&#x27;s not like some turtle I find on a hiking trail</li>
            <li> A disappointment.</li>
            <li> but it the blades are just bad.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> This Conair is the WORST razor I have ever used.</li>

            <li> i love my little shaver!</li>
            <li> My daughter has wanted one of these and I was so thankful to find this one at such a great price and it arrived before Christmas.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Did not even use it. Made a mistake when I ordered it, did not read that it was battery. Had bought an electric Conair before and loved it, just looked like that one.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver for the price.  It even has a pop-up trimmer.  Runs on 2-AAA batteries.  Recharging cord would have been a nice feature to have instead of batteries.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect size and does the job! Having a cordless shaver is a real blessing and easier to pack and transport.</li>

            <li> Love that you just put in batteries and they last a long time.  Razor works well.  I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I found this at a local Ross store. I like the idea of having a battery-operated razor for travel or camping, especially a smaller product that fits easily into a pouch, and I thought this would be a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m wishing I&#x27;d found the reviews here first. It did a fairly good job the first time, definitely not as smooth as a razor, but I figured in a pinch it was satisfactory. It kept me from having to deal with stubble rubbing against my jeans and irritating my skin, and it&#x27;s not like some turtle I find on a hiking trail is going to care what my legs look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried it... it stopped working entirely. The motor ran, but it didn&#x27;t cut the hair for anything. Not even the pop-up trimmer did its job, and after coming here, I&#x27;m seeing that this is an all too common problem. Shame on me for not checking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction pamphlet says you can send it in for a repair or replacement, but I don&#x27;t see the use based on what others have said. I feel like I&#x27;d be throwing away more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair should be ashamed of selling such a shoddy product. They used to be a reputable company that stood behind what it made many years ago. I guess that&#x27;s not the case anymore.</li>
            <li> For battery operated, works fine.  I think those who said it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t cut hair&amp;#34; are not used to using elec razors.  I find that 1) I need to hold it lightly instead of pushing down hard, and 2) one has to use a paint brush approach to go over each area more than once.  Pressing too hard and not going up and down does not allow foil/blades to capture and cut the hair.  I&#x27;m older, so hair is getting finer anyway.  But I find any stubble I DO have is softer than when cut with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not meant to use in the shower.  And using on DRY hair is important for best results.  So use BEFORE going in shower, not after.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and it worked great. Now it does not cut hair. Apparently that is a common problem with this product. They made a one-use product and disguised it as a reusable item. For a little bit of money, Conair is filling landfills with waste. Shame!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Aldi during a special.  The product runs on two AAA batteries which is nice.  But that is where the positives end.  It simply does not cut hair.  I went over and over the same area on my leg, and it never cut the hair.  Didn&#x27;t shave my underarm hair at all.  And I do not have a lot of hair to cut.  Worthless.  If I can find my receipt I will return.  Otherwise, off to the landfill.  Conair should be ashamed making such junk!</li>
            <li> As described. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> I wasnt aware that this was battery operated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It pulled my hair</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this product. It&#x27;s ok for touch ups, but definitely doesn&#x27;t do the job properly, leaves a lot of hair behind untouched. If you plan on buying this for regular use and to replace using a razor, you should definitely go with another product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it runs on batteries, but it doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough power to shave with. A disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love it. I had a Conair unit that had to be charged and it would never fit on the charger right (to heavy).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want to spend less than thirty minutes shaving AND want smooth legs. Dollar store razors work much faster and better, even if they leave my legs bloody.  My hands are tingly still from using this on my legs and I still have stubble.  What isn&#x27;t stubbly is peach fuzz.  I did every stroke from light to heavy, back and forth, in circles, all to little or no effect.  Really, if you need to shave your legs every other day at least, this product is a waste of time and money.  I&#x27;ll try using it in the shower, but don&#x27;t think that will work, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives?  Easy to clean, easy to hold, batteries last a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t cut my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut hair, but at least my skin is intact.</li>
            <li> Rubbish from the first use , it doesn&#x27;t worth even one dollar. it doesn&#x27;t shave . I will not recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she says it is a great product. I&#x27;ve not used it myself, BUT ... her word stands! :)</li>
            <li> The best product for a women who don&#x27;t want to share trimmers with a guy.  She love this and she say it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> Shaves my legs smooth. Easy to use. Good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the garbage, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work no matter what kind of  batteries I put in it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Wife wanted a replacement that was battery operated. She uses it daily. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> Does not cut smooth or close at all.  My brought it back to me from college complaining.</li>
            <li> this was good but I dont recommend it be the only thing you use and definitely not on legs. I used it to trim my bikini line, my legs and underarms but also used shave cream and a razor to get it a close shave. So its good if you need to trim down but not to completely shave with it.</li>
            <li> Works like a gem. Plus its safe for preteens to use. So they do not cut themselves.</li>
