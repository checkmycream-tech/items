            <li>Most are pretty good, the angle of the brush is very nice to use but one of them which is in flat head is off...</li>
            <li>are her favorite by far!!!!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are very nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the kit.</li>
            <li>Cant say enough good things about these Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived very quickly and were well packaged.</li>
            <li>, it makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t absorbed deep into the bristles which is great for saving products!</li>
            <li>I also use the round top kabuki for my powder foundation which also gives a flawless look.  </li>
            <li>Also, is very easy to clean them, just with a mild soap.</li>
            <li>This Brushes are amazing so soft and they are very precise,they will make a great brush kit for start or someone that wants to add to their brushes collection!!!</li>
            <li>they make blending smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>I got them fairly quick and was absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This little kit is awesome!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product especially for cream and liquid, not the best for powders, the brush is just way too compacted that it&#x27;s hard to make sure the makeup (ex. blush (powder)) is apply evenly on the brush.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to Sigma for making such a great synthetic kit</li>
            <li>It blends so smooth and so evenly on to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used brushes from MAC and Sephora as well as cheap brands like e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of set of brushes after seeing multiple YouTube videos saying that they were great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>My foundation went on so smooth</li>
            <li>it makes product placement so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use these brushes everyday and they work great!</li>
            <li>I bought them with the intention of using them to apply my foundation, however, my foundation does not go on smooth with these brushes and goes on easier with a sponge.</li>
            <li>This brush set is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smooth and seems to stay put longer.  </li>
            <li>I like the round kabuki to get in the crevices of my face, and the tapered kabuki is best for applying concealer or highlighting.</li>
            <li>Blends liquid foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li>but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot...</li>
            <li>My wife not only happy with the quality of the product but also with the service of the company that sells them.  </li>
            <li>I already use them and they are so soft and gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>I actually got it before the estimated shipping time which is great because I was so excited in trying the brushes already.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get them.</li>
            <li>love this brush there so soft and really good fast delivery</li>
            <li>What I love also is how little amount of product I need to apply  to have a great coverage.</li>
            <li>When I heard about sigma, I thought wow, these are actually affordable and everyone reviews them as awesome.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of brushes but these Sigma brushes are by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so dense and soft, they are amazing.</li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found good quality brushes that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>I finally caved in and told her that she could get a good quality brush kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for the whole face - you will not need any other brush!</li>
            <li>I think that they are so great due to the density of the pack of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I love the new synthetic Kabuki Kit that just came in my mail !</li>
            <li>Holds product really well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Being a huge fan of the MAC brushes, I have to say that these brushes are FAR better</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and dense which makes spreading foundation very easy.</li>
            <li>my super most fav is the flat top one (forget what its called), but i use it for foundation, concealers and blending.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li>They are so smooth on my face and because of it being so dense, it does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it better if there was a cheaper set with just the other 3 brushes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh like other brushes out there and its a perfect blush brush size.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the angled kabuki and the flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li>I love my new brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently just switched out all my MAC brushes to Sigma brushes &amp; I am definitely pleased!</li>
            <li>The first day of use, it looked like her foundation was airbrushed!</li>
            <li>At first arrival they looked and felt soft and good and high quality.</li>
            <li>I have no shedding and love the soft feel of the brushes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and I love that I have the four to choose from so I can put on my foundation, blush, contour, etc.</li>
            <li>Worth the imvesment.</li>
            <li>Spend the money, its worth it.</li>
            <li>thanks so much :)</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, the quality of the brush is what means the most to me</li>
            <li>The handles have a nice weight to them and they are attached very solidly to the metal ferrule part.</li>
            <li>So far im in love</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many Sigma brushes in the past and again I was thrilled with their products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with my purchase, and the short shipping time!</li>
            <li>Great product just not satisfied with how I received it</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>They are so soft apply so easily.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product, made especially for liquid.</li>
            <li>They are soft, dense, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I applied my highlighter on top of my cheeks with the Tapered Kabuki-F86, it feels soft like a babies blanket and pats on the highlighter really well.</li>
            <li>I love how soft these brushes are yet very dense</li>
            <li>First off this kit is a great price, second its sigma brushes and not some knockoff brand and third shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>kit was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;;)</li>
            <li>Thanks sigma!</li>
            <li>I was hesistant about purchasing these items initially, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Overall, love the kit and would repurchase if needed</li>
            <li>I will definitely use them on my clients once I become a makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li>They are very dense and worth the price.</li>
            <li>If trying to buy you should just buy one because they all basically do the same thing the pointy one is perfect for getting into small spaces and coverage over the eye.</li>
            <li>Love them and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I got this set because I love how they had different shaped kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>First off the brushes were delivered way before the estimated delivery date.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of their stuffs.</li>
            <li>so i cant give any first hand knowledge</li>
            <li>I already have the essential kit (fabulous!)</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the brushes!</li>
            <li>These are of great quality and feel great if you don&#x27;t wash them often enough they can start to feel scratchy and since they are thick take some time to dry.</li>
            <li>The flat top Kabuki brush is very dense and soft, very well made and is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Right away my daughter cleaned the brushes with a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>Both she and I love MAC products; however, I didn&#x27;t want to make such a large investment.</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki has been a stable in my foundation routine.  </li>
            <li>I use the pointed kabuki and flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Sigma also makes great brushes and have a few of there brushes and they are quality brushes they are soft and also have had no shedding on them.</li>
            <li>Have used Mac and their brushes shed too much and a lot more $$$ I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Fast international shipping as always, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>All brushes are super soft!  </li>
            <li>I am super excited to finally have real brushes</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki really buffs in your foundation.</li>
            <li>Wanted them for a long time, love the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>These Sigma brushes are the best, and my other brushes were not cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; with my brushes when applying foundation and I&#x27;ve had 0 hairs fall out, so I&#x27;m happy with the quality overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are as good if not better</li>
            <li>The brush fibers are very dense and full, yet soft.  </li>
            <li>All the brushes are super soft and feel lightweight agains the skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they the softest brushes I have ever felt, but they are the easiest to clean, the most versatile, and I see a big difference in the way the makeup is applied.</li>
            <li>(would recommend cleaning them with a standard brush cleaner that many manufacturers make or you could use baby shampoo to cleanse them and then apply a small amount of mild hair conditioner, let soak for 5 - 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water to help keep them soft which I&#x27;ve found works very well).</li>
            <li>Received the brushes very quickly after ordering and they were exactly what I expected and exactly what others have raved about.</li>
            <li>Each brush gives me a different shape to work with, which I love, because I can get every nook and cranny on my face without putting on too much foundation and have it look so natural!</li>
            <li>Next i used the Round Kabuki-F82 to contour my face and as well it works great.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare these to them.  </li>
            <li>This was a very affordable price for really well made brushes.</li>
            <li>It blends your foundation better than expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping time.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I took off a star because I find that the F86 isn&#x27;t really needed in the kit.  </li>
            <li>What I really like is that you can also use cream / liquid blushes without problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much foundation to my brushes.</li>
            <li>and they really get into the corners of your face.</li>
            <li>It leaves that much bristles.</li>
            <li>have washed two of them, and they held up very well, no lost hairs.</li>
            <li>so you can really buff in your makeup.</li>
            <li>There are reasonably priced, and do wonders for my makeup application.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are made very well and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are all very dense it picks up my foundation and cream blushes well</li>
            <li>I am a BAREMINERALS addict, these things have saved me so much money, I had no clue how much powder I was wasting inside my brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite is definitely the round top kabuki.</li>
            <li>I got them in the mail, they were packaged in this cute box with pamphlets on the different kits that Sigma offers and a guide on the brushes and their uses.</li>
            <li>I have been told for so long that for flawless makeup you must use \\&quot;good\\&quot; brushes, I could never seem to get my self to spend so much money on a makeup brush, I finally broke down and bought a Sigma set.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a difference it makes to have the right brush.  </li>
            <li>They are kind of difficult to clean but definately worth the struggle.</li>
            <li>and I was willing to spend a little more money on these</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, which is actually pretty low considering the quality!</li>
            <li>I may break down and buy more brushes from them.</li>
            <li>I am excited to have these as a new addition to my makeup collection and would definitely recommend them to others!</li>
            <li>and I think they are terrific, so soft so accurate</li>
            <li>I read and watched reviews, and was expecting decent quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, well made, do not shed and my makeup goes on so smoothly and with such precision</li>
            <li>The handles are very durable and the fibers of the brushes are very soft</li>
            <li>These are very, very soft, and very dense.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, yet handle product application really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I use the F84 for blush although it is a little dense and tends to work better with cream blushes vs just powder ones for me.  </li>
            <li>These brushes spread my foundation so nicely and don&#x27;t pick up hardly any product.</li>
            <li>and they distribute the makeup more evently then any other brushes!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and dense that it really does give you an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft you&#x27;d think they were real animal fur</li>
            <li>Got the brushes much sooner than estimated.&lt;br /&gt;They seem really soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and they really blend makeup well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are so soft and blend really well..</li>
            <li>But when I received them, the brushes were noticeably smaller than the regular mr bunny essential collection kit, but after actually using them on my face and applying foundation with these, they gave such a flawless finish that I don&#x27;t even care about the brushes being smaller than what I thought.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me 5-10 minutes to have a really great air brushed look with a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I have several other high-end brands brushes, I can easily say that this set is now , to me, better then my other sets.</li>
            <li>Now, I seriously can&#x27;t live without them.  </li>
            <li>after cleaning them every 3 days they hold up like if they r brand new..</li>
            <li>I ordered this product expecting to get something brand new and received something that was opened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Sigma Brushes</li>
            <li>sure many women would agree with me when I say that you can pretty much use any brush and make it work for you; I have tons of brushes that are less expensive and with blending etc</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and dense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of sigma brushes and had initially brought the flat top and the round top one separately.</li>
            <li>They are so dense and soft!</li>
            <li>these brushes are amazingly soft and no shedding!</li>
            <li>The flattop kabuki is by far my fav!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of professional brushes and I am never turning back.</li>
            <li>They are soft and are made with quality.  </li>
            <li>soooo soft</li>
            <li>It seamlessly blends the foundation into my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is by far by go to brushes to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>They are soft yet dense.</li>
            <li>I have never had my foundation or creme blush go on so seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>so far a brush a year has fallen apart..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine doing my makeup anymore with my old brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes but honestly I only use one &amp; don&#x27;t really need the others.</li>
            <li>i felt them and they felt so soft.....</li>
            <li>Professional quality</li>
            <li>The look of my foundation completely changed the moment I started using these brushes.</li>
            <li>These Sigma brushes are so soft to my skin.</li>
            <li>they are extremely soft..</li>
            <li>My daughter loves them, they are soft and affordable.</li>
            <li>they are soft and so far haven&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Soft and dense.</li>
            <li>These are so soft, the cover every area.</li>
            <li>i throw my old brushs for this</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the entire kit so that I could have more brushes to use and not need to wash brushes everyday.</li>
            <li>Wash nicely and don&#x27;t leave hairs behind.  </li>
            <li>Not too much or too little, Just right.</li>
            <li>However I found the round top brush hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I also clean mine weekly with a little bit of dish soap and olive oil.  </li>
            <li>far as shipping goes, I was really nervous that I would get these brushes super late because they shipped it out 2 days after I had ordered them.</li>
            <li>Once she sees and tries one of these brushes, there&#x27;s no way she should have to wait that long to enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure after you wash them to dry them out gently on a towel and dry them upside down</li>
            <li>they feel solid and high quality.</li>
            <li>These are quality brushes and they are so reasonably priced compared to other high end makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>I will slowly add more of these brushes to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that they accidently sent me two of the same brushes &amp; they sent me the missing brush right away, and let me keep the duplicate brush!</li>
            <li>This allows the brush fibers to be very soft but overall they work as a unit to deposit color and product where it needs to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are pretty soft and tightly bound</li>
            <li>It is so soft and dense at the same time.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and are the essential face kit!!!!</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft, and it took me only 5 minutes to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>apparently my wife ordered this on my account</li>
            <li>I have never owned or felt such soft yet sturdy cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li>I dip my brushes in a tiny amount of foundation and it applies to my face easily and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>(sorry MAC), no shedding and solid, love these!</li>
            <li>Not sure why I waited so long on buying these but will definitely be a loyal Sigma brush user!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t got to use the other two brushes as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I thought they were going to be a little larger, but I am  surprised at how much I can cover with such precision!</li>
            <li>They are durable, made sooooo well.. and easy to wash and dry, i have not one complaint.</li>

            <li> I did want to get her good quality brushes for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Most are pretty good, the angle of the brush is very nice to use but one of them which is in flat head is off...</li>
            <li> are her favorite by far!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the kit.</li>
            <li> Cant say enough good things about these Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived very quickly and were well packaged.</li>
            <li> , it makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t absorbed deep into the bristles which is great for saving products!</li>

            <li> This little kit is awesome!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product especially for cream and liquid, not the best for powders, the brush is just way too compacted that it&#x27;s hard to make sure the makeup (ex. blush (powder)) is apply evenly on the brush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Sigma for making such a great synthetic kit</li>
            <li> It blends so smooth and so evenly on to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used brushes from MAC and Sephora as well as cheap brands like e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of set of brushes after seeing multiple YouTube videos saying that they were great.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> My foundation went on so smooth</li>
            <li> it makes product placement so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday and they work great!</li>
            <li> I bought them with the intention of using them to apply my foundation, however, my foundation does not go on smooth with these brushes and goes on easier with a sponge.</li>
            <li> This brush set is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smooth and seems to stay put longer.  </li>
            <li> I like the round kabuki to get in the crevices of my face, and the tapered kabuki is best for applying concealer or highlighting.</li>
            <li> Blends liquid foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot...</li>
            <li> My wife not only happy with the quality of the product but also with the service of the company that sells them.  </li>
            <li> I already use them and they are so soft and gives good coverage.</li>
            <li> I actually got it before the estimated shipping time which is great because I was so excited in trying the brushes already.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get them.</li>
            <li> love this brush there so soft and really good fast delivery</li>
            <li> What I love also is how little amount of product I need to apply  to have a great coverage.</li>
            <li> When I heard about sigma, I thought wow, these are actually affordable and everyone reviews them as awesome.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of brushes but these Sigma brushes are by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so dense and soft, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found good quality brushes that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I finally caved in and told her that she could get a good quality brush kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for the whole face - you will not need any other brush!</li>
            <li> I think that they are so great due to the density of the pack of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I love the new synthetic Kabuki Kit that just came in my mail !</li>
            <li> Holds product really well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the MAC brushes, I have to say that these brushes are FAR better</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and dense which makes spreading foundation very easy.</li>
            <li> my super most fav is the flat top one (forget what its called), but i use it for foundation, concealers and blending.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush is the flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li> They are so smooth on my face and because of it being so dense, it does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it better if there was a cheaper set with just the other 3 brushes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh like other brushes out there and its a perfect blush brush size.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the angled kabuki and the flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li> I love my new brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently just switched out all my MAC brushes to Sigma brushes &amp; I am definitely pleased!</li>
            <li> The first day of use, it looked like her foundation was airbrushed!</li>
            <li> At first arrival they looked and felt soft and good and high quality.</li>
            <li> I have no shedding and love the soft feel of the brushes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and I love that I have the four to choose from so I can put on my foundation, blush, contour, etc.</li>
            <li> Worth the imvesment.</li>
            <li> Spend the money, its worth it.</li>
            <li> thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, the quality of the brush is what means the most to me</li>
            <li> The handles have a nice weight to them and they are attached very solidly to the metal ferrule part.</li>
            <li> So far im in love</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Sigma brushes in the past and again I was thrilled with their products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with my purchase, and the short shipping time!</li>
            <li> Great product just not satisfied with how I received it</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> They are so soft apply so easily.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product, made especially for liquid.</li>
            <li> They are soft, dense, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I applied my highlighter on top of my cheeks with the Tapered Kabuki-F86, it feels soft like a babies blanket and pats on the highlighter really well.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these brushes are yet very dense</li>
            <li> First off this kit is a great price, second its sigma brushes and not some knockoff brand and third shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> kit was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> Thanks sigma!</li>
            <li> I was hesistant about purchasing these items initially, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Overall, love the kit and would repurchase if needed</li>
            <li> I will definitely use them on my clients once I become a makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li> They are very dense and worth the price.</li>
            <li> If trying to buy you should just buy one because they all basically do the same thing the pointy one is perfect for getting into small spaces and coverage over the eye.</li>
            <li> Love them and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this set because I love how they had different shaped kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> First off the brushes were delivered way before the estimated delivery date.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of their stuffs.</li>
            <li> so i cant give any first hand knowledge</li>
            <li> I already have the essential kit (fabulous!)</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the brushes!</li>
            <li> These are of great quality and feel great if you don&#x27;t wash them often enough they can start to feel scratchy and since they are thick take some time to dry.</li>
            <li> The flat top Kabuki brush is very dense and soft, very well made and is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Right away my daughter cleaned the brushes with a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> Both she and I love MAC products; however, I didn&#x27;t want to make such a large investment.</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki has been a stable in my foundation routine.  </li>
            <li> I use the pointed kabuki and flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Sigma also makes great brushes and have a few of there brushes and they are quality brushes they are soft and also have had no shedding on them.</li>
            <li> Have used Mac and their brushes shed too much and a lot more $$$ I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Fast international shipping as always, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> All brushes are super soft!  </li>
            <li> I am super excited to finally have real brushes</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki really buffs in your foundation.</li>
            <li> Wanted them for a long time, love the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> These Sigma brushes are the best, and my other brushes were not cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; with my brushes when applying foundation and I&#x27;ve had 0 hairs fall out, so I&#x27;m happy with the quality overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are as good if not better</li>
            <li> The brush fibers are very dense and full, yet soft.  </li>
            <li> All the brushes are super soft and feel lightweight agains the skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they the softest brushes I have ever felt, but they are the easiest to clean, the most versatile, and I see a big difference in the way the makeup is applied.</li>
            <li> (would recommend cleaning them with a standard brush cleaner that many manufacturers make or you could use baby shampoo to cleanse them and then apply a small amount of mild hair conditioner, let soak for 5 - 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water to help keep them soft which I&#x27;ve found works very well).</li>
            <li> Received the brushes very quickly after ordering and they were exactly what I expected and exactly what others have raved about.</li>
            <li> Each brush gives me a different shape to work with, which I love, because I can get every nook and cranny on my face without putting on too much foundation and have it look so natural!</li>
            <li> Next i used the Round Kabuki-F82 to contour my face and as well it works great.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare these to them.  </li>
            <li> This was a very affordable price for really well made brushes.</li>
            <li> It blends your foundation better than expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> I took off a star because I find that the F86 isn&#x27;t really needed in the kit.  </li>
            <li> What I really like is that you can also use cream / liquid blushes without problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much foundation to my brushes.</li>
            <li> and they really get into the corners of your face.</li>
            <li> It leaves that much bristles.</li>
            <li> have washed two of them, and they held up very well, no lost hairs.</li>
            <li> so you can really buff in your makeup.</li>
            <li> There are reasonably priced, and do wonders for my makeup application.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are made very well and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are all very dense it picks up my foundation and cream blushes well</li>
            <li> I am a BAREMINERALS addict, these things have saved me so much money, I had no clue how much powder I was wasting inside my brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite is definitely the round top kabuki.</li>
            <li> I got them in the mail, they were packaged in this cute box with pamphlets on the different kits that Sigma offers and a guide on the brushes and their uses.</li>
            <li> I have been told for so long that for flawless makeup you must use \\&quot;good\\&quot; brushes, I could never seem to get my self to spend so much money on a makeup brush, I finally broke down and bought a Sigma set.  </li>
            <li> Wow what a difference it makes to have the right brush.  </li>
            <li> They are kind of difficult to clean but definately worth the struggle.</li>
            <li> and I was willing to spend a little more money on these</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, which is actually pretty low considering the quality!</li>
            <li> I may break down and buy more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> I am excited to have these as a new addition to my makeup collection and would definitely recommend them to others!</li>
            <li> and I think they are terrific, so soft so accurate</li>
            <li> I read and watched reviews, and was expecting decent quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, well made, do not shed and my makeup goes on so smoothly and with such precision</li>
            <li> The handles are very durable and the fibers of the brushes are very soft</li>
            <li> These are very, very soft, and very dense.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, yet handle product application really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use the F84 for blush although it is a little dense and tends to work better with cream blushes vs just powder ones for me.  </li>
            <li> These brushes spread my foundation so nicely and don&#x27;t pick up hardly any product.</li>
            <li> and they distribute the makeup more evently then any other brushes!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and dense that it really does give you an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft you&#x27;d think they were real animal fur</li>
            <li> Got the brushes much sooner than estimated.&lt;br /&gt;They seem really soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they really blend makeup well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are so soft and blend really well..</li>
            <li> But when I received them, the brushes were noticeably smaller than the regular mr bunny essential collection kit, but after actually using them on my face and applying foundation with these, they gave such a flawless finish that I don&#x27;t even care about the brushes being smaller than what I thought.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me 5-10 minutes to have a really great air brushed look with a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I have several other high-end brands brushes, I can easily say that this set is now , to me, better then my other sets.</li>
            <li> Now, I seriously can&#x27;t live without them.  </li>
            <li> after cleaning them every 3 days they hold up like if they r brand new..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to get something brand new and received something that was opened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Sigma Brushes</li>
            <li> sure many women would agree with me when I say that you can pretty much use any brush and make it work for you; I have tons of brushes that are less expensive and with blending etc</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and dense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of sigma brushes and had initially brought the flat top and the round top one separately.</li>
            <li> They are so dense and soft!</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazingly soft and no shedding!</li>
            <li> The flattop kabuki is by far my fav!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of professional brushes and I am never turning back.</li>
            <li> They are soft and are made with quality.  </li>
            <li> soooo soft</li>
            <li> It seamlessly blends the foundation into my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is by far by go to brushes to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> They are soft yet dense.</li>
            <li> I have never had my foundation or creme blush go on so seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> so far a brush a year has fallen apart..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine doing my makeup anymore with my old brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes but honestly I only use one &amp; don&#x27;t really need the others.</li>
            <li> i felt them and they felt so soft.....</li>
            <li> Professional quality</li>
            <li> The look of my foundation completely changed the moment I started using these brushes.</li>
            <li> These Sigma brushes are so soft to my skin.</li>
            <li> they are extremely soft..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them, they are soft and affordable.</li>
            <li> they are soft and so far haven&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Soft and dense.</li>
            <li> These are so soft, the cover every area.</li>
            <li> i throw my old brushs for this</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the entire kit so that I could have more brushes to use and not need to wash brushes everyday.</li>
            <li> Wash nicely and don&#x27;t leave hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> Not too much or too little, Just right.</li>
            <li> However I found the round top brush hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I also clean mine weekly with a little bit of dish soap and olive oil.  </li>
            <li> far as shipping goes, I was really nervous that I would get these brushes super late because they shipped it out 2 days after I had ordered them.</li>
            <li> Once she sees and tries one of these brushes, there&#x27;s no way she should have to wait that long to enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure after you wash them to dry them out gently on a towel and dry them upside down</li>
            <li> they feel solid and high quality.</li>
            <li> These are quality brushes and they are so reasonably priced compared to other high end makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> I will slowly add more of these brushes to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that they accidently sent me two of the same brushes &amp; they sent me the missing brush right away, and let me keep the duplicate brush!</li>
            <li> This allows the brush fibers to be very soft but overall they work as a unit to deposit color and product where it needs to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are pretty soft and tightly bound</li>
            <li> It is so soft and dense at the same time.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and are the essential face kit!!!!</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft, and it took me only 5 minutes to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account</li>
            <li> I have never owned or felt such soft yet sturdy cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> I dip my brushes in a tiny amount of foundation and it applies to my face easily and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> (sorry MAC), no shedding and solid, love these!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I waited so long on buying these but will definitely be a loyal Sigma brush user!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got to use the other two brushes as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be a little larger, but I am  surprised at how much I can cover with such precision!</li>
            <li> They are durable, made sooooo well.. and easy to wash and dry, i have not one complaint.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re essentially micro exfoliating your skin when you do the buffing motion, so it might worsen dry patches slightly if you buff too much.</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the four are still good :-(</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty late on the Sigma train...</li>
            <li> Only regret waiting so long to pick them up.</li>
            <li> and so i used the Flat Kabuki-F80 for my foundation and</li>
            <li> And my costal scent brushes that I bought before these are still good and working no shedding... :-(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that certain foundations stain the brush and the tips will not remain white for very long.</li>
            <li> but I think they will last a very very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this set for a long time after watching makeup guru&#x27;s use them in their makeup videos on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I recieved these brushes earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I washed them prior to use as directed, there was minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed when I received the product because in youtube videos, these brushes look way bigger.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy other brushes by Sigma.</li>
            <li> I washed them upon receiving and it took two days for them to dry because they are so dense.</li>
            <li> Dry them well as to avoid the smell of mildew.</li>
            <li> and they were dry by the morning.</li>
            <li> I use them every single day for foundation, powder, and blush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so dense they take a long time to dry and the water seeps down into the handle and loosens the glue and messes up the brushes.</li>
            <li> At least as soft as Too Faced &amp;#34;teddy bear hair&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I use my flat kabuki everyday to apply my foundation.  </li>
            <li> shes planning to order the other sets too</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and if you&#x27;re on the fence and trying to decide, trust me, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews were spot on regarding the brushes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> These blow other brushes out of the water.</li>
            <li> Not great for loose powders so far, the angle one worked well for Benefit Hula bronzer, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very thick and soft.</li>
            <li> Got it to use with Chanel bronzer base, it was a better deal to get a set.</li>
            <li> (bristle side down).</li>
            <li> i cant wait to try out the other set of synthetic brushes!</li>
            <li> You will never buy any other brushes!</li>
            <li> Thankful for sigma brushes and how they helped me finish my makeup in less time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other face brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> I think they are a little dense</li>
            <li> I use all everyday,  yet they look like I haven&#x27;t used them.</li>
            <li> I use every brush in this kit everyday.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday and they are so versatile.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not cheap whatsoever.</li>
            <li> A few words of caution though...</li>
            <li> I found out about Sigma products from a few online tutorials and immediately had to get my daughter the Synthetic Kabuki kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were plain as drugstore brushes... had no brush numbers nor sigma logo...</li>
            <li> and I have been washing my brushes everyday!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually sad it took me so long to try Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I wonder if it loses its all hair one day.</li>
            <li> My foundation applies evenly and does not feel as thick.  </li>
            <li> it does take a while to wash them as they have thick bristles.</li>
            <li> Brush is thick and NO hairs fall out at all.....</li>
            <li> My other brushes (thought expensive) shed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the box they came in was beat up, but since this was for me and not as a gift, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed as to it was a gift for my girlfriend and had to explain thats how the product was when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Sad face</li>
            <li> person was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> They stick and are difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I use all these every single morning and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a must have to any makeup obsessed person or brush obsessed person!</li>
            <li> I have tried every brush out there from MAC to Sonia Kashiuk to a very expensive set from Sephora and none of them can hold a candle to Sigma.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> &amp;Eacute; o melhor pincel para aplicação de todos os tipos de base.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes are FAKE!!!  </li>
            <li> do meu p&amp;oacute; - base, pois fica impec&amp;aacute;vel o acabamento!!</li>

            <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re very soft and dense. The only thing is it is a chore to wash these babies because of how dense they are, but still rating it 5 stars because they are awesome and apply foundation so nicely.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing! Have used Mac and their brushes shed too much and a lot more $$$ I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy these brushes because all the beauty gurus on YouTube use them.  Now, I seriously can&#x27;t live without them.  My favorite brush is the flat top kabuki.  I use it to apply my foundation every day.  The tapered brush is good for applying my concealer.  I haven&#x27;t got to use the other two brushes as much as I would like. They are soft and are made with quality.  I really enjoy these brushes.  I also clean mine weekly with a little bit of dish soap and olive oil.  It keeps the brushes in good shape.</li>
            <li> This is the best brushes I ever purchased. It is so soft and dense at the same time. I&#x27;m glad I bought this brushes. I&#x27;m amazed how it does gives me the flawless look using my foundation. It&#x27;s worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of foundation brushes, Hakuhodo, MAC, BOBBI BROWN, SHISEDO, ARMARNI, EDM...I have to say that the sigma synthetic kabuki kit is among the best.They are very good for all kinds of foundations, very easy to handle and do the job fast and good! Beside, their price is the best, absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty late on the Sigma train...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit was exactly what I was looking for. I tend to switch my foundation from powder to liquid often and love to highlight/contour. The bristles are so soft and perfectly dense leaving an airbrushed finish. I thought they were going to be a little larger, but I am  surprised at how much I can cover with such precision! Kudos to Sigma for making such a great synthetic kit, I can&#x27;t wait to get me some more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> I received the Sigma Beauty Synthetic Kabuki Kit a week ago and I could not wait to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed and satisfied with these brushes! They&#x27;re defintely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re extremely soft and dense, which gives you an airbrushed look...very flawless. I noticed you do not need a lot of product; you will actually save a lot of product, which is awesome. They do their duty perfectly. I highly recommend them. I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes!  I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this set for a long time after watching makeup guru&#x27;s use them in their makeup videos on YouTube.  Love the F80 for foundation application!  This set is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with makeup brushes and I&#x27;ve never used MAC brushes so I can&#x27;t really compare these to them.  All I can say is they are very good brushes - they are very dense and the type of hair is very nice.  If you want really good brushes but don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Alright...so i&#x27;ve always been in the market to purchase good quality brushes but I have refused to pay more than $10 per brush. When I heard about sigma, I thought wow, these are actually affordable and everyone reviews them as awesome. But I honestly had to see them for myself. BOY AM I GLAD I ORDERED THESE!!!! These are the BEST brushes i&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ve seen MAC ones, and these are literally 200% comparable, if anything better!! I am going to be ordering two more brush kits from sigma. They are so smooth on my face and because of it being so dense, it does exactly what it is supposed to. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Im inlove with this set of brushes !!!! soooo soft and they distribute the makeup more evently then any other brushes!!</li>
            <li> I love my synthetic kabuki kit! I just got these brushes in the mail today and tried all of them out. The flat top kabuki is great for buffing in your foundation! It usually takes me 5-10 minutes to have a really great air brushed look with a regular foundation brush. The flat top kabuki really buffs in your foundation. I also love the tappered synthtic brush. It is great for applying highlight on my cheek bones. This was a very affordable price for really well made brushes. Thanks sigma!</li>
            <li> I recieved these brushes earlier than expected. They have been the best makeup brushes that I have use. It blends your foundation better than expected. I will reorder these brushes again if I have to.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get these today! Super fast shipping and I just love the feel of these brushes! The quality is amazing, better then I thought. :) Really happy with this purchase, will buy more products in the future!</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, and I LOVE these brushes! They are amazing quality and the perfect shape. I would recommend them to any one wanting more brushes for foundation, highlighting, or bronzer application.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with all 4!!!! They are my favorite brushes. I have used them every day since i received them....THANK YOU SIGMA</li>
            <li> Love this brushes... you get for what you pay...&lt;br /&gt;Even after cleaning them every 3 days they hold up like if they r brand new..</li>
            <li> THE BEST brushes I own. These brushes spread my foundation so nicely and don&#x27;t pick up hardly any product. Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite Kabuki brushes. Great addition to my brush collection! My face has never looked better after foundation application. The flat top Kabuki brush is very dense and soft, very well made and is my favorite. All brushes are super soft!  What I love also is how little amount of product I need to apply  to have a great coverage. It doesn&#x27;t absorb any product at all.  Fantastic brushes, very happy. Also, is very easy to clean them, just with a mild soap. Already washed them twice and didn&#x27;t notice any shedding. Thank you Sigma!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The products are 5 Stars, just excellent, and I confirm that SIGMA is the best you can buy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my time to put makeup on enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes work fabulous! Wanted them for a long time, love the quality of the brushes. Love how they apply the make up on me. Will order another set!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping time. At first arrival they looked and felt soft and good and high quality. Descent price for quality and softness. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!  I was hesistant about purchasing these items initially, but I am so glad I did.  I have no shedding and love the soft feel of the brushes on my skin.  I use them for a multitude of things ranging from buffing foundation into my skin to applying my highlighter.  I have used so many quote on quote higher end brushes and honestly say the quality of these brushes are amazing.  The brush fibers are very dense and full, yet soft.  The flat top kabuki has been a stable in my foundation routine.  It seamlessly blends the foundation into my skin.  I am very glad I made this purchase and look forward to replacing all of my brushes to sigma.</li>
            <li> This set is a must have for anyone, they&#x27;re great quality face brushes that are so dense and soft on the skin! I am excited to have these as a new addition to my makeup collection and would definitely recommend them to others!</li>
            <li> Dont wait to pick up these brushes. I have wanted them for a while now and finally picked them up. Only regret waiting so long to pick them up. The brushes are so soft and easy to work with. They make applying your make-up easy and flawless. I cant wait to try more of the Sigma brushes! If you are thinking about picking them up DONT WAIT!!</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are as good if not better&lt;br /&gt;than the MAC brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to buy some more!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a Beauty guru using these on youtube and decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;They are great.  Delivery was fast.  I am very pleased</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice and soft. They are also very sturdy and apply foundation very nicely. I very happy with my purchase and i would totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> I got his for my girlfriend, and she loves it! Here is what she said: This is a must have for the entire face.  I use it for foundation, contouring, blush (cream and powder).  It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for the whole face - you will not need any other brush!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of brushes but these Sigma brushes are by far my favorite! I would recommend these brushes and I will be purchasing more from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Thank God I found the most perfect foundation brushes because I just recently started using liquid foundation. The brushes are so soft and dense that it really does give you an airbrush finish. The best part is that it&#x27;s definitely affordable. Getting 4 high-end quality brushes for the price of one MAC foundation brush! It really can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! They are so soft and are the essential face kit!!!! From highlighting to setting powder to blush to foundation..AMAZING!!!!! must have! The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was that it doesnt come with a brush holder..but whatever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed at how dense and soft the brushes are.  I took off a star because I find that the F86 isn&#x27;t really needed in the kit.  I would have liked it better if there was a cheaper set with just the other 3 brushes but they are still a very good buy.  My favorite is the F80 for applying liquid foundation.  I use the F84 for blush although it is a little dense and tends to work better with cream blushes vs just powder ones for me.  F82 I use for powder products.  The brushes also clean very easily.  Overall, love the kit and would repurchase if needed but I think they will last a very very long time.  :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!! I ordered the Synthetic Kabuki Kit and am absolutely in love with it!  The brushes are SO soft you&#x27;d think they were real animal fur (glad that they aren&#x27;t, though!). I&#x27;ve already used all 4 of them, and they work amazing, too! Without any effort my foundation spreads and blends and looks absolutely flawless. The delivery was so smooth and came on time :)  I can&#x27;t wait to order more brushes and maybe some accessories from Sigma, too!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes ! This is by far by go to brushes to apply my foundation. It blends so smooth and so evenly on to my skin. The brushes are really soft and dense which makes spreading foundation very easy.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are so dense and soft! This kit is all I need for my face makeup routine; foundation (the flat top is great at buffing foundation into the skin), powder, under eye concealer, and blush/contouring! I will definitely use them on my clients once I become a makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different foundation brushes but they weren&#x27;t perfect. Then I decided to purchase the kabuki kit and I&#x27;m absolutly in love.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are pretty soft and tightly bound so doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using liquid foundation oder pressed/loose Powder. What I really like is that you can also use cream / liquid blushes without problems.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are just perfect for a flawless make up and they are affordable and great quality. I was also really happy with the shipping it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Sigma brushes before and took a chance on these. I have to say these are the most amazing brushes I have ever used. They are soft yet dense. They provide excellent control and precision. I have used brushes from MAC and Sephora as well as cheap brands like e.l.f. and I have to say these are the best. I use them every single day for foundation, powder, and blush. I think this is a very good kit and great addition to any brush collection. The brushes arrived very quickly and were well packaged.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased these brushes. My foundation applies evenly and does not feel as thick.  I don&#x27;t see streakes when appling foundation.  The angled brush is great for contouring.  All the brushes are super soft and feel lightweight agains the skin.  When using the brushes,I don&#x27;t feel like I am appling make up, but I can see the make up being applied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of set of brushes after seeing multiple YouTube videos saying that they were great.  I am not disappointed!  I have 7 or 8 foundation brushes already and I work in the skin care  and cosmetic industry.  I have never had my foundation or creme blush go on so seamlessly.  I have been told that I look airbrushed!  What more could you ask for?  A great value as well!</li>
            <li> for a first time user of Sigma products, this is a great product. the quality and intensity of those brushes is excellent, great for application and use. I have several other high-end brands brushes, I can easily say that this set is now , to me, better then my other sets. its a good deal. it would have been great if the handles were matt. but none the-less, these are great as they are.</li>
            <li> I love the new synthetic Kabuki Kit that just came in my mail ! I already use them and they are so soft and gives good coverage. I highly recommend this kit! Five stars :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They give a flawless finish. They are very dense and worth the price. My daughter uses all sigma brushes and these are her favorite by far!!!!!! 10 STARS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Esse Kit da Sigma &amp;eacute; perfeito!! O F 80 dispensa coment&amp;aacute;rios n&amp;eacute;?? &amp;Eacute; o melhor pincel para aplicação de todos os tipos de base. O F 82 tb &amp;eacute; demais!! Gosto de us&amp;aacute;-lo para aplicação do meu p&amp;oacute; - base, pois fica impec&amp;aacute;vel o acabamento!! Amei e recomendo!!</li>
            <li> I have a number of Sigma brush kits and this one, like others, does not disappoint. These are all great brushes and the quality is once again top notch. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Got the brushes much sooner than estimated.&lt;br /&gt;They seem really soft. Got it to use with Chanel bronzer base, it was a better deal to get a set. Will try it on my liquid make up as well. My other brushes (thought expensive) shed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and I love that I have the four to choose from so I can put on my foundation, blush, contour, etc. Each brush gives me a different shape to work with, which I love, because I can get every nook and cranny on my face without putting on too much foundation and have it look so natural! I would recommend these to a friend in a heart beat because they are worth while and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s brush collection! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> These are a must have for anyone who uses make up. I use all everyday,  yet they look like I haven&#x27;t used them. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to get something brand new and received something that was opened.  A little disappointed as to it was a gift for my girlfriend and had to explain thats how the product was when I received it.  I received a torn open box when I received the package and all the brushes were spread out through out the box.  Great product just not satisfied with how I received it</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the four are still good :-( I take great care of my brushes... And my costal scent brushes that I bought before these are still good and working no shedding... :-( so far a brush a year has fallen apart.. Sad face</li>
            <li> I have been using my brushes for about 2 weeks and am so pleased! They are very thick and soft. I washed them upon receiving and it took two days for them to dry because they are so dense. Great value and great quality! Can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazingly soft and no shedding! it does take a while to wash them as they have thick bristles.</li>
            <li> This Brushes are amazing so soft and they are very precise,they will make a great brush kit for start or someone that wants to add to their brushes collection!!!</li>
            <li> So I purchased these brushes because I kept watching youtube videos on how brushes can make a different when applying liquid foundation. Before I used BH cosmetic brushes that I recieved when I ordered one of their palettes. Whenever I would use foundation with the BH brushes it would leave streaks and I would have to apply a lot of cover-up/foundation just to get my desired look. So I got my sigma brushes and what a differece! They are extremely soft, and it took me only 5 minutes to apply my foundation. My foundation went on so smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much foundation to my brushes. I dip my brushes in a tiny amount of foundation and it applies to my face easily and a little goes a long way! I can&#x27;t even imagine doing my makeup anymore with my old brushes. This is my first set of professional brushes and I am never turning back.</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes are FAKE!!!  They were plain as drugstore brushes... had no brush numbers nor sigma logo...</li>
            <li> I just got this Sigma brushes and they are so amazing, I am so glad I decide to buy them. I never thought I would like it since i always been using MAC, but now this brushes are my favorites.</li>
            <li> These are great face make up brushes.  I like the fullness of the hair it makes product placement so smooth.  Great design and have held up over use and washings.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes of all time and they are great prices too! A must have in the makeup world.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes but honestly I only use one &amp; don&#x27;t really need the others. If trying to buy you should just buy one because they all basically do the same thing the pointy one is perfect for getting into small spaces and coverage over the eye. Brush is thick and NO hairs fall out at all..... compared to my brush set where the powder brush sheds ALOT. These are of great quality and feel great if you don&#x27;t wash them often enough they can start to feel scratchy and since they are thick take some time to dry. Dry them well as to avoid the smell of mildew. This is a must have to any makeup obsessed person or brush obsessed person!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! The foundation looks flawless and the blush brush is contoured to worked beautifully when applying blush. Would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have never had foundation or blush or concealer go on as seemlessly as these brushes make your look. They are durable, made sooooo well.. and easy to wash and dry, i have not one complaint. So GLAD to have found these!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, great quality, and my makeup looks so much better since I started using them. Worth the imvesment.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes. Worth the price! I use all these every single morning and have never been disappointed! Spend the money, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Thankful for sigma brushes and how they helped me finish my makeup in less time. I wash them daily hope they can last.</li>
            <li> First off this kit is a great price, second its sigma brushes and not some knockoff brand and third shipping was very fast. This kit is perfect, it had 4 great brushes in 1 kit. I use these brushes everyday and they work great!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great quality. I bought them with the intention of using them to apply my foundation, however, my foundation does not go on smooth with these brushes and goes on easier with a sponge. Not the brushes fault! I use the brushes in different ways now and they really get into the corners of your face. Great purchace!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Sigma Brushes&lt;br /&gt;The difference when applying foundation&lt;br /&gt;with these brushes is Remarkable!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li> Most are pretty good, the angle of the brush is very nice to use but one of them which is in flat head is off...</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a couple weeks ago and I think they are terrific, so soft so accurate, it makes it so easy to apply. Wow what a difference it makes to have the right brush.  I love them.</li>
            <li> These brushes make applying my foundation and blushes so perfectly! They are so soft apply so easily. Love them and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product especially for cream and liquid, not the best for powders, the brush is just way too compacted that it&#x27;s hard to make sure the makeup (ex. blush (powder)) is apply evenly on the brush. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, made especially for liquid.</li>
            <li> i ordered these for my wife. she had brush sets from mac and sephora. theyre in the trash now. shes planning to order the other sets too</li>
            <li> I use every brush in this kit everyday. I like to use F80 to blend my liquid foundation, set it with powder by using F82, contour my face with F86, and apply cream blush with F84. These brushes are so amazing! They are soft, dense, and easy to work with. The only problem is that F80 leaves tons of bristles on my face all the time. I wonder if it loses its all hair one day. It leaves that much bristles. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the kit. Fast international shipping as always, which I absolutely love. Thank you!</li>
            <li> SIgma brushes are great! they work perfectly.  They arrived on time.  They were at a great price.  I am very very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushes i have ever used. The  quality is superb and the brushes are so soft. I love them.</li>
            <li> This little kit is awesome! I use these brushes everyday and they are so versatile. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to using my hands for foundation after using these brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes. I recently just switched out all my MAC brushes to Sigma brushes &amp; I am definitely pleased! The brushes are so soft and they really blend makeup well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shipping goes, I was really nervous that I would get these brushes super late because they shipped it out 2 days after I had ordered them. BUT they arrived to my house within 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE EVERYTHING. thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> Got my Sigma brushes today and once i opened the box i felt them and they felt so soft.....I had to use them at once and so i used the Flat Kabuki-F80 for my foundation and WOW, i had a clean and flawless look. I&#x27;ve read the reviews on this brush and that&#x27;s why i wanted to try it on my own and the results are amazing. Next i used the Round Kabuki-F82 to contour my face and as well it works great. I applied my highlighter on top of my cheeks with the Tapered Kabuki-F86, it feels soft like a babies blanket and pats on the highlighter really well. Not too much or too little, Just right. To top of my look I applied some Blush with the Angled Kabuki-F84. It picked up the blush great and applied it evenly on my cheeks. It&#x27;s not harsh like other brushes out there and its a perfect blush brush size. Overall I give these brushes 5 stars, they are great quality and feel AMAZING on your face. Best brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are amazing and worth every penny. I got this set because I love how they had different shaped kabuki brushes. The make putting my makeup on so much easier and it looks flawless!</li>
            <li> Wish they came with a travel holder, recommended cleaning instructions, and a description of each for beginners but love how they have transformed my makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Very nice very soft brushes.... Professional quality no doubt...... Feel good to face and touch....I Would def buy this brand again</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful happy I got them plus at a good price! They make your skin look so beautiful!</li>
            <li> The look of my foundation completely changed the moment I started using these brushes. As a professional makeup artist, the quality of the brush is what means the most to me and I was willing to spend a little more money on these and I definately dont regret it. Not only are they the softest brushes I have ever felt, but they are the easiest to clean, the most versatile, and I see a big difference in the way the makeup is applied. Recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I just got this set and is the best brush ever, the most soft I had, and the best part do the best face make up I ever see.</li>
            <li> These are quality brushes and they are so reasonably priced compared to other high end makeup brushes.  I&#x27;m super pleased with my purchase, and the short shipping time!</li>
            <li> i LOVE these brushes. i love the size, the look, and obviousy especially love how well they work! my super most fav is the flat top one (forget what its called), but i use it for foundation, concealers and blending. it works like MAGICCCCCCCCCCCC. i have been likeing the angle brush for applying powder over the concealer under my eye area.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! Love them!</li>
            <li> I am loving my sigma brushes, it&#x27;s the perfect set of brushes for contouring and applying blush.  I use my flat kabuki everyday to apply my foundation.  Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other face brushes in the past.  These Sigma brushes are the best, and my other brushes were not cheap. These Sigma brushes are so soft to my skin. The makeup I put on these brushes does not absorb into the bristles, thus more goes on my face without wasting product.  Will definitely buy other brushes by Sigma.</li>
            <li> This brush set is fantastic. The handles are very durable and the fibers of the brushes are very soft (would recommend cleaning them with a standard brush cleaner that many manufacturers make or you could use baby shampoo to cleanse them and then apply a small amount of mild hair conditioner, let soak for 5 - 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water to help keep them soft which I&#x27;ve found works very well). I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; with my brushes when applying foundation and I&#x27;ve had 0 hairs fall out, so I&#x27;m happy with the quality overall.</li>
            <li> I read and watched reviews, and was expecting decent quality. A MUA at a Nordstrom counter told me that Sigma brushes are very low quality and made by machines which causes them to lose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That person was completely wrong. These are very, very soft, and very dense. At least as soft as Too Faced &amp;#34;teddy bear hair&amp;#34; brushes. Super dense though, works great for buffing liquid foundation, looks air brushes. Not great for loose powders so far, the angle one worked well for Benefit Hula bronzer, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed two of them, and they held up very well, no lost hairs. they feel solid and high quality. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> i bought those brushes for my wife and she is in love with them and she cant wait to buy the rest of the collection .</li>
            <li> Sigma has great consumer service and fast shipping!!! I get all of my make up brushes from them! Great price for wonderful quality! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my percuss! i cant wait to try out the other set of synthetic brushes!</li>
            <li> Finally I have found good quality brushes that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg. I ordered these after hearing many good reviews and know I&#x27;m joining the bandwagon. I love how soft these brushes are yet very dense so you can really buff in your makeup. I use them for foundation. cream products and anytime I need to buff something in.</li>
            <li> The brushes came in quick and I found the brushes great for foundation, blush and contouring. However I found the round top brush hard to clean. Still love the brushes however.</li>
            <li> After receiving my item, I loved it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for affordable and excellent brushes. Feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> First off the brushes were delivered way before the estimated delivery date.  I have been told for so long that for flawless makeup you must use \\&quot;good\\&quot; brushes, I could never seem to get my self to spend so much money on a makeup brush, I finally broke down and bought a Sigma set.  AMAZING!  There are reasonably priced, and do wonders for my makeup application.  My makeup goes on smooth and seems to stay put longer.  Definatley a good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve learned about Sigma brushes on you tube and I decided to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;They are absolutely brilliant! Especially flat top kabuki is excellent. So dense and yet so soft,&lt;br /&gt;it gives the perfect finish. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> BEST FOUNDATION BRUSHES EVER! I was kind of disappointed when I received the product because in youtube videos, these brushes look way bigger.  But when I received them, the brushes were noticeably smaller than the regular mr bunny essential collection kit, but after actually using them on my face and applying foundation with these, they gave such a flawless finish that I don&#x27;t even care about the brushes being smaller than what I thought.  My favorite is the angled kabuki and the flat top kabuki.  I like the round kabuki to get in the crevices of my face, and the tapered kabuki is best for applying concealer or highlighting. I am happy with the purchase and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love love love the brushes. I used them as soon as I got them. I will definitely buy more of their stuffs.</li>
            <li> For the price you will not find better quality brushes.  Just keep in mind how you will use them and the type of make up you will use to apply.  Love these brushes and if you&#x27;re on the fence and trying to decide, trust me, you will not be disappointed.  These are the ones to purchase.  ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I heard about these brushes while watching a tutorial on youtube. The reviews on Amazon were really convincing as well so I went ahead and purchased the product. I got them fairly quick and was absolutely satisfied with the product. These brushes are not cheap whatsoever. I own several M.A.C. brushes and one Sephora brush and the Sigma brushes are just as good or even better. I love the tapered pointy brush because it gets around my eye are nicely when I am blending my under eye concealer and highlighter. The application goes on smoothly and feels great on the skin. I would definitely recommend everyone to try these brushes. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are the softest synthetic brushes I have used! The other reviews were spot on regarding the brushes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The plastic sleeve which came with each brush is genius! I think it will help keep my brushes in good shape when I place them in my travel pouch. I may break down and buy more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> Just got these brushes last week and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  These brushes are made very well and are very sturdy.  Holds product really well and is easy to clean.  I haven&#x27;t seen any bristles fall out and I have been washing my brushes everyday!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes there are on the market.&lt;br /&gt;They are very high quality and apply makeup flawlessly. The best!</li>
            <li> These brushes are literally THE best brushes i have ever used. The brushes are so dense and soft, they are amazing. They are kind of difficult to clean but definately worth the struggle. The shipping also took a while but all together i LOVE these.</li>
            <li> They are ok. I think they are a little dense but maybe that is good for some. I like them ok.</li>
            <li> Sigma also makes great brushes and have a few of there brushes and they are quality brushes they are soft and also have had no shedding on them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are very soft, yet handle product application really well. I think that they are so great due to the density of the pack of the bristles. This allows the brush fibers to be very soft but overall they work as a unit to deposit color and product where it needs to go. I think these work best with cream products, but they can handle liquid and powders as well. The handles have a nice weight to them and they are attached very solidly to the metal ferrule part. I washed them prior to use as directed, there was minimal shedding. I was a little disappointed that the box they came in was beat up, but since this was for me and not as a gift, not a big deal. There is also a similar set with five brushes, but I thought the four set was plenty for me. I have some brushes in the $35-50 range (each!) that are on par with these brushes, making this set a great value. Would be a nice set for a gift or if you are building a brush collection.</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the MAC brushes, I have to say that these brushes are FAR better (sorry MAC), no shedding and solid, love these!</li>
            <li> Cant say enough good things about these Sigma brushes! The flattop kabuki is by far my fav! Blends liquid foundation so smoothly. AH! amazing :) You need this for your kit, just a must.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing! I never imagined it would look so flawless. If you your used to doing your own makeup a lot Im sure many women would agree with me when I say that you can pretty much use any brush and make it work for you; I have tons of brushes that are less expensive and with blending etc my makeup always comes out nice...HOWEVER these brushes do make a difference; it&#x27;s like it provides the perfect amount of coverage without having to keep blending out and adding extra foundation (if needed). These brushes are a must have and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I do not regret buying them!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get them. The were nicely packaged.Still learning how to use them properly. But love them already</li>
            <li> I am super excited to finally have real brushes..cant wait to order the Sigma Synthetic Eye brush kit! I love them...they are extremely soft..OMG! I wanted to keep them in the box and display them but then had to try them out absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife, she loves them.  Brushes are well-made.  One thing that can be improved is the plastic cases they come with.  They stick and are difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how quickly my order arrived!! I ordered this set for one of my close friends for her birthday. She was the one who recommended them to me as well. I love the brushes!! I can&#x27;t wait to see my friend&#x27;s face when she receives this gift. The sigma brushes are a MUST!! Don&#x27;t delay on buying. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them, they are soft and affordable. Cheaper than the big retailers stores and they are of the same quality.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes.. they are so soft and blend really well..&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommended them to my sister in law.</li>
            <li> I use 3 of the 4 brushes on a daily basis.  They&#x27;re very good quality and holds up pretty good through washings.</li>
            <li> The 4 Kabuki Brush kit is the second set of burshes I have from Sigma. I love these. they are soft and so far haven&#x27;t shed. they make blending smooth and easy. I&#x27;m looking forward to making my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I finally got my sigma brushes that I&#x27;ve been waiting to get!! The shipping wasn&#x27;t bad at all I actually got it before the estimated shipping time which is great because I was so excited in trying the brushes already. The brushes I got Is the synthetic kabuki kit which includes 4 face brushes. The brushes are all very dense it picks up my foundation and cream blushes well and it doesn&#x27;t absorbed deep into the bristles which is great for saving products! So far im in love, it gives me a flawless finish its worth the money for the quality it has! Its a must try :)</li>
            <li> Great brushes, love them! I especially love the angled one.  Wash nicely and don&#x27;t leave hairs behind.  Soft and dense.</li>
            <li> THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING! I have tried tons of brushes over the years. I am a BAREMINERALS addict, these things have saved me so much money, I had no clue how much powder I was wasting inside my brushes. These are so soft, the cover every area. You will never buy any other brushes! These blow other brushes out of the water. Nothing I have used or tried in stores has compared to these. I am a make up hoarder! I have tried it all at one point in my life. I will slowly add more of these brushes to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that they accidently sent me two of the same brushes &amp; they sent me the missing brush right away, and let me keep the duplicate brush! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes will but more and more!!! The shipping and quiality of the brushes are top notch! Will buy more and more :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes...each brush is very dense and when I apply my foundation it gives me a flawless face.  I use the pointed kabuki and flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  I also use the round top kabuki for my powder foundation which also gives a flawless look.  I have yet to try the angled brush but I&#x27;m looking forward to using it for bronzer or blush.  I definitely don&#x27;t regret buying these brushes and want to try the precision kabuki brushes for concealer and the eye set.</li>
            <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she actually made a big deal about these things and i saw her putting a lot of effort into keeping them in good shape by washing and taking care of them... which ive never seen her do with anything else, including the bathroom sink area which is constantly a disaster with all her products everywhere... but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot... like things should be so... it appears that she loves them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of sigma brushes and had initially brought the flat top and the round top one separately. I decided to buy the entire kit so that I could have more brushes to use and not need to wash brushes everyday. My favorite is definitely the round top kabuki. It buffs everything in flawlessly and makes virtually any foundation look great. A few words of caution though...you should definitely exfoliate and moisturize your skin well before using these brushes. You&#x27;re essentially micro exfoliating your skin when you do the buffing motion, so it might worsen dry patches slightly if you buff too much. Also, make sure after you wash them to dry them out gently on a towel and dry them upside down (bristle side down). These brushes are so dense they take a long time to dry and the water seeps down into the handle and loosens the glue and messes up the brushes. Invest in a brush holder or tie a rubber band to the handle and hang them from a clothes hanger! Definitely worth it though. These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> Dense brush. Great for blending liquid foundations. Brushes do not shed and last for years. My only complaint is that certain foundations stain the brush and the tips will not remain white for very long.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best makeup brushes, then look no further then Sigma. I have tried every brush out there from MAC to Sonia Kashiuk to a very expensive set from Sephora and none of them can hold a candle to Sigma. In fact, these brushes work so fabulously that I ordered more ....I already have the essential kit (fabulous!) but I wanted more! So I ordered this set of the Kabuki Kit. These brushes are soft, well made, do not shed and my makeup goes on so smoothly and with such precision that I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along with out them! I believe that there is wonderful makeup out there, both high end and drugstore BUT to make it look fabulous you need the best brushes, which are Sigma!!!!</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, i love the flat kabuki brush the best. its awesome, i totally recommend it. they&#x27;re well made.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been complaining non-stop about her brushes (cheaper brand) shedding all over her face. I finally caved in and told her that she could get a good quality brush kit. Both she and I love MAC products; however, I didn&#x27;t want to make such a large investment. I did want to get her good quality brushes for a reasonable price. I found out about Sigma products from a few online tutorials and immediately had to get my daughter the Synthetic Kabuki kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got them in the mail, they were packaged in this cute box with pamphlets on the different kits that Sigma offers and a guide on the brushes and their uses. Right away my daughter cleaned the brushes with a gentle cleanser and they were dry by the morning. The first day of use, it looked like her foundation was airbrushed! It looked gorgeous! She absolutely loves the brushes! Both her and I are now Sigma fans! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes never shed!</li>
            <li> love this brush there so soft and really good fast delivery and i got a free gift i got the eye shadow E55 brush i love&lt;br /&gt;this i will get more of this brush so in love you have to try this i throw my old brushs for this i love best brushs i have ever used</li>
            <li> My wife not only happy with the quality of the product but also with the service of the company that sells them.  They were able to deliver faster than I inicially order with no problem.  Apart from that she adore the products, they give her a nice even look.</li>
            <li> I loved the product of great quality would buy again . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually sad it took me so long to try Sigma brushes! They work amazingly well on my skin. LOVE THEM!!  Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great these brushes are! I got them based on a youtube video suggestion and they are absolutely amazing with either my mac makeup etc, or my walmart makeup. They transformed how it looks!&lt;br /&gt;Love them!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Sigma brushes. I own a Sephora brush and I use my Sigma over Sephora. I know it&#x27;s the best choice I&#x27;ve made in purchasing these brushes, I use them every day. I love them because I get the flawless look being a 37yr old living in LA, Ca. also I have acne and acne scars. Two thumbs way up for these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard lots of great reviews on Sigma brushes and even read the reviews on Amazon before buying. Received the brushes very quickly after ordering and they were exactly what I expected and exactly what others have raved about. Not sure why I waited so long on buying these but will definitely be a loyal Sigma brush user! Definitely worth the price, which is actually pretty low considering the quality!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Sigma brushes in the past and again I was thrilled with their products.  These brushes are super soft and they leave your makeup looking almost flawless.  The only thing I&#x27;d have to say is that the brushes seem a lot larger in the picture than in person.  I would recommend these brushes to anyone, especially anyone who struggles with applying foundation!</li>
            <li> LOVE SIGMA KABUKI BRUSH SET - Just received the brushes moments ago from AMAZON, and I could not believe the amazing quality and workmanship for the price. I have never owned or felt such soft yet sturdy cosmetic brushes. They feel like silk against my skin - they&#x27;re simply heavenly. I am so excited with my purchase that I immediately phoned my daughter and told her I ordered a set for her birthday, way ahead of her May birthdate! Once she sees and tries one of these brushes, there&#x27;s no way she should have to wait that long to enjoy them. This set makes a perfect gift for someone you love.</li>
