            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>More child size than adult.</li>
            <li>theyre awesome seriously!</li>
            <li>These Minnie Ears arrived &amp;#62; 1 week prior to the expected date and were very good quality.  </li>

            <li>These ears were cute but they took about 3 weeks to arrive, the band was broken (snapped) and I could still manage to wear them but they were also distorted so they did not lay flat against my head.  </li>
            <li>Half the size of real mouse ears.</li>

            <li> These ears were cute but they took about 3 weeks to arrive, the band was broken (snapped) and I could still manage to wear them but they were also distorted so they did not lay flat against my head.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the amount they are charging.</li>

            <li> Very cute, but smaller than expected. I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the tiny envelope it was shipped in. Now I have to try to get the adhesive off one or the ears</li>
            <li> They look great and they were delivered very quick. We are pleased with the Minnie Ears and can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Speedy Service!!! Great product!!</li>

            <li> Ears are small. More child size than adult.</li>
            <li> Loveee them! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Only giving it one star for fast shipping. The bow wasn&#x27;t red at all, faded and small. Made for children not adults. Also the bow looked glued on which was not attached when arrived. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Opened package to find damaged item.  Unusable.  No receipt, no return address, no phone number, nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Poorly made product. Ships from Hong Kong according to postage.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Definitely worth the price, they even threw in some tiny red polka dot hair clips, thank you!</li>
            <li> These are way smaller and flimsier than disney ears. the ears are obvious knock offs. Half the size of real mouse ears.</li>
            <li> The bow fell off on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> Cute! My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> headband at the bottom has a defect(pointy edge to it)&lt;br /&gt;did not receive a pair of hair clips.</li>
            <li> These Minnie Ears arrived &amp;#62; 1 week prior to the expected date and were very good quality.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. Ships from China so allow enough time for delivery.</li>
            <li> Looked really nice for my twins mickey and minnie themed birthday. Stood up well does not look cheap</li>
            <li> ADORABLE !!! My 14 year old used these for her Minnie costume...fit her teenage head perfect!!!</li>
