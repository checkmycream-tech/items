            <li>Perfect for what i needed!</li>
            <li>I bought these for use with my fractionated oil samples and they work great!</li>
            <li>price on these is top-notch.</li>
            <li>Good quality!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Good bottles.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Already filled these and stored them away with e-liquid, they work great no leak</li>
            <li>Nice bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottles are fully functional with snap in tips and screw on top.</li>
            <li>As advertised, nothing more</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>They cost more, but they don&#x27;t leak...</li>
            <li>some of the caps didn&#x27;t seal properly, and the blunt tips aren&#x27;t ideal for filling my vape tanks, but they work as an inexpensive option for mixing my sample recipes.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, not the cheap flimsly plastic you will find from other manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Work fine for ejuice uses.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for to make my own e-cig juice fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Has locking caps so once the bottle is filled</li>
            <li>Great bottles only issue I have with them is the lock doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li>You can fit 8 if you put them in sideways, or 5-6 if you put them in vertically.</li>
            <li>Cheap bottles caps leak and locking ring doesn&#x27;t work .</li>
            <li>A couple of the bottles are damaged, but overall I consider this a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Avery-brand 0.75-inch round labels fit perfectly on the bottom of these, making them easy to read when the bottles are sideways in a clear box or upside-down in an opaque one.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and came quickly</li>
            <li>Nipples are the shorter fat style but for quick shipping and price I&#x27;ll purchase here again.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with these dropper bottles.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about these is that they fit in a standard index card holder, so if you need to have them on the go, you don&#x27;t need a fancy holder.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>Was smaller than I was thinking but my fault for not reading the description better.</li>
            <li>, it should stop twisting when it gets to its limit, but with these you risk not tightening it enough, or the top cap breaks.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d get higher quality dropper bottles from one of the miniatures paint manufacturers that sell their paint in dropper bottles...  </li>
            <li>Using these for storing miniatures paints; the dropper tips have a tendency to crack and split if you tighten the cap too much, which then causes them to leak.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a second batch and am pleased with the quality, fast shipment and overall product!</li>
            <li>Filled up the very first one out of the bag with paint and found out the hard way that it leaked.  </li>
            <li>They were cheap and alright for getting some juice made, but I will be looking for a different brand next time around.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but I was expecting them to actually hold liquid.</li>
            <li>Used to dispense 99% professional grade alcohol based paint for work.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the plastic would break down due to the high alcohol content but they lasted and have held up over a year of consistent use!</li>
            <li>If you overtighten them, it will pop the very top of the cap open, exposing the actual bottle dripper, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li>Absolute garbage, and a complete waste of time, money and paint.</li>

            <li> Absolute garbage, and a complete waste of time, money and paint.</li>
            <li> I use it to transfer my Systane Ultra dry eye drops into, since the unpreserved drops only come in individual, one-use vials.  </li>
            <li> but when I drip my juice there is a little left on the outside of the tip so every once in a while</li>
            <li> They are smaller than other 15ml bottles I have ordered.</li>
            <li> Every single one leaks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the BS reviews.</li>
            <li> Too loose, it leaks.  </li>
            <li> And the drip tip is to wide</li>
            <li> So you have to be very careful when you screw on the cap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not worth my time to test the rest.  </li>
            <li> but honestly it is not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li> I used them to transfer paint from small jars to aid in painting miniatures and the product works well enough, but they&#x27;re not top notch.  </li>
            <li> I have used a little over half of the pack and of those used, half have this problem.  </li>
            <li> Too tight, it breaks the dropper tip and it leaks.  </li>
            <li> None of mine have leaked so far, although a few of the lids were difficult to screw on.  </li>
            <li> They have a small problem with leaking unless screwed obscenely tight, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I&#x27;ve got 50 of these and at least half of them leak.  </li>
            <li> a few short its not that bad.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers must have gotten a bad batch, ordered twice no bottles had holes, deformities or anything unusual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am having a weird problem with the tops someone else seemed to have mentioned in the review.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to make my own e-cig juice fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Filled up the very first one out of the bag with paint and found out the hard way that it leaked.  I checked the next three with water and they also leaked.  It&#x27;s probably not worth my time to test the rest.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but I was expecting them to actually hold liquid.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle. Perfect for miniature paints.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and came quickly</li>
            <li> perfect for DIY e-juicers</li>
            <li> I have not tested all of them but the ones I have used are holding up great!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product three times now.  It definitely does its job.  I use this for my DIY ejuice and would have given it five stars if not for one thing.  Obviously its not a deal breaker but when I drip my juice there is a little left on the outside of the tip so every once in a while I have to wipe the tip but honestly it is not that big of a deal.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Has locking caps so once the bottle is filled it&#x27;s tamper proof</li>
            <li> Every single one leaks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the BS reviews.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and have yet to find one with a leak. Perfect for face oils and toners. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with these dropper bottles.</li>
            <li> Locking ring/seal doesn&#x27;t work and every bottle leaks</li>
            <li> Was smaller than I was thinking but my fault for not reading the description better. The bottles are fully functional with snap in tips and screw on top. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great bottles only issue I have with them is the lock doesn&#x27;t always work. And the drip tip is to wide</li>
            <li> Perfect for ejuice! Nipples are the shorter fat style but for quick shipping and price I&#x27;ll purchase here again.</li>
            <li> A couple of the bottles are damaged, but overall I consider this a good purchase. These work perfectly for my paint. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not for storage of gasoline and do not microwave.  Work fine for ejuice uses.</li>
            <li> Great bottles! Good quality! Came with 50 bottles, caps, and dropper tips.</li>
            <li> According to the cheap syringe I was using to fill these, they hold approximately 15 CCs. I used them to pass out samples of cabbage juice to students. None of mine have leaked so far, although a few of the lids were difficult to screw on.  One of my favorite things about these is that they fit in a standard index card holder, so if you need to have them on the go, you don&#x27;t need a fancy holder. You can fit 8 if you put them in sideways, or 5-6 if you put them in vertically. See attached photos for reference.  Avery-brand 0.75-inch round labels fit perfectly on the bottom of these, making them easy to read when the bottles are sideways in a clear box or upside-down in an opaque one. See attached photos for reference.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what i needed! Used to dispense 99% professional grade alcohol based paint for work. I was worried that the plastic would break down due to the high alcohol content but they lasted and have held up over a year of consistent use! Will buy again (if I ever run out!)</li>
            <li> They have a small problem with leaking unless screwed obscenely tight, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they are using children to count because they can not count to 50. I received 46 bottles and 47 caps and 49 tips. Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I bought these for use with my fractionated oil samples and they work great! I just ordered a second batch and am pleased with the quality, fast shipment and overall product!</li>
            <li> Cheap bottles caps leak and locking ring doesn&#x27;t work .</li>
            <li> The other reviewers must have gotten a bad batch, ordered twice no bottles had holes, deformities or anything unusual.&lt;br /&gt;The price on these is top-notch. The quality aswell.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t look elsewhere these are the cheapest you&#x27;ll find without ordering in bulk or overseas.</li>
            <li> As advertised, nothing more</li>
            <li> The price was right.  Had all the pieces ordered.  I used them to transfer paint from small jars to aid in painting miniatures and the product works well enough, but they&#x27;re not top notch.  In the future I&#x27;ve decided to just order my paints in the dropper bottles in order to avoid the hassle of transferring them over.  It&#x27;s time consuming, but these will work for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but I am having a weird problem with the tops someone else seemed to have mentioned in the review.  If you overtighten them, it will pop the very top of the cap open, exposing the actual bottle dripper, rendering it useless.  I have used a little over half of the pack and of those used, half have this problem.  There should be no such thing as overtightening, it should stop twisting when it gets to its limit, but with these you risk not tightening it enough, or the top cap breaks.  They were cheap and alright for getting some juice made, but I will be looking for a different brand next time around.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I lose a bottle of eyedrops now.  :)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leak.... Enough said!</li>
            <li> Good bottles. They are smaller than other 15ml bottles I have ordered. No complaints about leaking. I use these to hold ejuices.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, not the cheap flimsly plastic you will find from other manufacturer. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Using these for storing miniatures paints; the dropper tips have a tendency to crack and split if you tighten the cap too much, which then causes them to leak. So you have to be very careful when you screw on the cap.  Too loose, it leaks.  Too tight, it breaks the dropper tip and it leaks.  Bottom line, I&#x27;ve got 50 of these and at least half of them leak.  Very disappointed.  If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d get higher quality dropper bottles from one of the miniatures paint manufacturers that sell their paint in dropper bottles...  they sell empties.  They cost more, but they don&#x27;t leak...&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - Update 9/2015 - I&#x27;m having to replace all of these - if the dropper tips haven&#x27;t split open, the tops have literally split open.  Absolute garbage, and a complete waste of time, money and paint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product I didn&#x27;t receive the dripper tops and then It was a big hassle to get them so I just cut my losses and threw them away</li>
            <li> bought for  my DIY e-liquid. some of the caps didn&#x27;t seal properly, and the blunt tips aren&#x27;t ideal for filling my vape tanks, but they work as an inexpensive option for mixing my sample recipes.</li>
            <li> I use it to transfer my Systane Ultra dry eye drops into, since the unpreserved drops only come in individual, one-use vials.  Now I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Already filled these and stored them away with e-liquid, they work great no leak</li>
            <li> Good. No leaks. Havent counted them all but if im a few short its not that bad.</li>
