            <li>It does not bother my eyes, which is good!</li>
            <li>The price is great too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump but adds great definition to your lashes.  </li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t really great for the days when I wanted to do a bit heavier makeup.</li>
            <li>I works great</li>
            <li>I am soooo happy that I decided to try this.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this mascara and will be purchasing it again this weekend.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>In love!!</li>
            <li>Best of all, I love the fact that it is NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li>One good thing is that it didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>The color was good</li>
            <li>I put on two coats and am good to go until I wash it off at night.</li>
            <li>and it stays on fairly well.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara, but it depends on what you desire in your mascara.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>I have to replace this slightly more often than store brands, but the coverage and color are great.  </li>
            <li>i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Kind of like paint.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, have a nice texture -</li>
            <li>it smells nice and goes on without clumps.</li>
            <li>I thought this mascara looked nice.</li>
            <li>This mascara is really nice.</li>
            <li>IT has a nice color</li>
            <li>it goes on nice-</li>
            <li>and it applies nicely and holds up rather well.  </li>
            <li>Some mascaras have a kind of odor, but this has none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on nicely all day.  </li>
            <li>It is very clumpy and I cannot imagine why this aspect of a wonderful product could not be solved.</li>
            <li>It covers nicely, without clumping too.</li>
            <li>Mascara goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>This one is one of the best I tried (in natural mascara department that is).</li>
            <li>The price is right, the color is color is great, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake after a couple of hours and</li>
            <li>It washes off so easily!</li>
            <li>I also read reviews that it smelled good, like cereal... and that&#x27;s partly why I ordered it, but it didn&#x27;t really smell good to me.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the natural ingredient list and feel good about putting this so close to my eyes-daily.  </li>
            <li>The consistency isn&#x27;t very smooth while applying to my eyes.</li>
            <li>final best thing about this mascara is that it washes off soooo easily!  </li>
            <li>I liked the mascara just fine, but about two months in, the brush broke off in the tube</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is OK.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have as many clumps.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Honeybee Gardens Products.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>While this makes my eyes look okay</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the point of spending money on this if it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any mascara on no matter how many coats I tried to apply.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many mascara brands I have been through, there have been so many.  </li>
            <li>I am fully able to compare.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best performing mascara from the get go.</li>
            <li>Most mascara makes my eye itchy, so I rub &amp; get racoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product has enabled me to wear mascara more often than I ever did before.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to use up a tube of mascara, so that doesn&#x27;t help me remember.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing?</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I was camping and was able to wash it off with just some water.  </li>
            <li>I am so relived to have a mascara to wear that is Gluten free and does not irritate my eyes!</li>
            <li>(although I&#x27;m sure there are people with allergies to everything out there).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li>my favorite aspect of this is its beauty prowess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It performs just as well as chemical-laden brands, and I think changing the brush would put it on par with my favorite CG mascara.</li>
            <li>I love Honeybee Gardens products.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the futures.</li>
            <li>It rates ok on [...</li>
            <li>but that resided and after a break I was able to use it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited!  </li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not advertised as waterproof, but you&#x27;d think that it would be able to hold up to a light mist.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect a lot from a natural mascara, but it really is great.</li>
            <li>Great natural feeling mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with Honeybee Gardens mascara for its ingredients, and it performs adequately, although not up to par with more chemical-laden mascaras that will thicken, lengthen, and/or curl.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge and removes easily with make up remover or soap/water.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, natural product that goes on smooth (no clumps) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The mascara washes of easily with cleanser and water</li>
            <li>, it might even wash off easily with just water.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off and runs easily.</li>
            <li>Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li>There is no racoon eyes at the end of the day either and its easy peezy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>So note that this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to remove with just water and a face tissue.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much I&#x27;ve had multiple dreams about telling my friends how great it is!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy the brown anymore, because this black mascara gives me the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>I feel good about whats going on/near a very sensitive part of the body.</li>
            <li>This is the most affordable organic mascara I&#x27;ve tried and it works great for me - better than conventional mascara even.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not like the high performance chemical laden mascaras ( I do use waterproof Loreal for special occasions) but it is great for a healthy alternative for daily wear.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;big sythetic&amp;#34; lashes type of mascara, I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;darken and add a bit of definition&amp;#34; kind of girl, so this was similar to what I already used.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for makeup products that are more natural and do not contain so many chemicals and unpronouncable things.  </li>
            <li>Good alternative to regular drug store toxin filled mascara.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may have to brush more to get desired good than with other mascaras</li>
            <li>and it was ok, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase as I have another brand of organic mascara that I much prefer.</li>
            <li>it is really lightweight and you can even put on more than one coat.</li>
            <li>I tried using it for a full week and will never purchase again.</li>
            <li>True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is full and the formula is scentless.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is not bad.</li>
            <li>To use it up, I wear it for a quick weekend day but not for work or going out at night.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many organic Mascaras, because normal Mascaras make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mascara thicken up when I&#x27;ve had the tube for more than a couple of months, but never with a brand new tube.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clump overly much and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It smells just like hot wheat cereal!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t thicken your lashes, but it certainly defines them nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li>If you have to have something Paraben free, or have really sensative eyes, this mascara gets the job done....</li>
            <li>I was glad to see the mascara was fresh and not dried out.  </li>
            <li>i love that this mascara is all natural.</li>
            <li>It may be natural, but invest the money for a brand like Tarte if you want a GOOD natural mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am thrilled with this find.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t have potentially harmful ingredients and goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and I love that.  </li>
            <li>With something of a desire to get into more natural beauty products, I&#x27;ve spent about three years floating around testing various natural/organic/whatever mascaras and while I&#x27;ve liked all well enough, this has to be the best I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the brown, as it looked super natural on me while giving a bit of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to my near-invisible blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!t this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, looks beautiful &amp; natural, adds just the right amount of color, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It does not make lashes longer or thicken them, neither does it run but rather crumbles off and comes right off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>For a truly natural mascara, I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am fairly dedicated to natural beauty products and have tried several natural/organic macaras.</li>
            <li>a good natural product (not totally organic,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t thicken or lengthen my lashes very much</li>
            <li>But right out of the box, it is a dry mascara that lightly clumps and lightly flakes throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>not outrageously expensive--</li>
            <li>When I reinserted the wand for an 2nd application, it was as if all the mascara migrated to the top of the tube &amp; wrapped itself around the wand.</li>
            <li>This is my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara that I have tried, since I&#x27;ve decided to go more&lt;</li>
            <li>I am excited to find something natural that works for me!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous for a natural mascara.</li>
            <li>I feel it could stand up to it pretty well.</li>
            <li>As far as natural mascaras go, it was okay, but I would not order it again.</li>
            <li>The result is a nice, just above natural look.  </li>
            <li>My favorite natural mascara so far.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using my first vegan mascara, but this itched me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you the effect of super long and volumous eyelashes, it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Honeybee Gardens Mascara and 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Mascara.  </li>
            <li>the past couple of years, my eyes have become more and more sensitive to product</li>
            <li>The first time I pulled out the wand, it came out cleanly with just enough mascara on it to let me apply 1 coat to the lashes on 1 eye.</li>
            <li>If your whole reason for wearing mascara is just to darken your lashes (and if you have blonde tipped lashes and wear glasses, like me), then it is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo hard to find cosmetics that are of good quality and do not have parabens.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping a curl, but this does nicely to help hold my curl, at least better then most.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re just health conscious like me, and want to use healthier products, I would go with the organic wear mascara with the bright green cap shaped like a leaf.  </li>
            <li>So much product comes out of the sides of the TUBE upon pushing the wand in and out and closing</li>
            <li>but it is very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>It bothered my eyes and made them very irritated.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work out.  </li>
            <li>And I swear my lashes are so much nicer after using this for 2 months.</li>
            <li>I usually only like a macara the final 3rd of its life and this one worked great straight away.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like honeybee garden&#x27;s mascara after trying a handful of natural/hypo mascaras.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump much either which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I found this brand of mascara, I was really concerned about what products I was putting near my eyes on a daily basis in the name of fitting in/beauty, now I don&#x27;t worry at all.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the brush so much.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again, and will try more Honeybee Garden products - so far this and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to use as many natural products as possible.  </li>
            <li>mascara goes on nicely, leaving a light layer to thicken and the black color really makes my lashes look long.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, the other mascara is a better product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Sooo much product has been wasted I&#x27;m sure this msscara will only last a couple more weeks!</li>
            <li>It takes several strokes to apply any significant amount to make it look like I have mascara on.  </li>
            <li>Tends to get fairly dry after a couple months but overall I really like it and works just about as good as a NON natural mascara, but without all the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its a bit messy ..flaky to be exact, but its better than&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without decent mascara that fit my no chemical requirements.</li>
            <li>maybe they can come up with a better formula to keep the product on lashes, i might reconsider down the road.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, doesn&#x27;t clump, and it&#x27;s more water resistant than my previous brand.</li>
            <li>I feel much happier about putting this near my eyes as it has much safer ingredients than the drugstore brand I was using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several years now, and overall, I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews online I really thought this would live up to my normal expectations.</li>
            <li>Because the other mascara has been more than sufficient and now I know that just because a mascara is made with natural ingredients it does not have to clump and flake.</li>
            <li>does not run, gently comes off with natural soap or oil, does not irritate my eyes,</li>
            <li>It does however wash off really well and doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The natural ingredients really matter to me, too.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It takes several coats being worked on to your lashes to get a nice dark effect.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was that it had a rather odd smell - not offensive, but far from appealing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get stiff like most mascaras</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it, and I really like the fact there are only natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>- you are supposed to replace your mascara at every 3 months &amp; getting a new one in teh mail</li>
            <li>I had to clean lots of gooey mascara that would ooze out the sides every time I closed the tube.</li>
            <li>For the price and the natural ingredients, I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The product is very thin and does not last well at all, it is also very good at making &#x27;tarantula lashes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This mascara flakes on me and clumps a little which sucked because other than that it was good mascara.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a pretty standard mascara bottle size.  </li>
            <li>there are other clean mascaras out there</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on well.. not very thick</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, which is why I look for natural make up and skin care products, and this made me itch</li>
            <li>This mascara was some what dry right when I opened it, and I had to use two coats.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item after becoming concerned about the amount of chemicals in my usual mascara.</li>
            <li>It is just your basic mascara, doesn&#x27;t make the lashes stand out much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, but I need something that can give me some fullness.</li>
            <li>It is natural and works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is all natural, yes-</li>
            <li>Try Gabrielle mascara if you want all natural and non-clumpy.</li>
            <li>I switched to this mascara because my old one was causing irritation in my eyes and</li>
            <li>tube isn&#x27;t wide enough and when I take the brush out and in, the extra mascara clumps at the top.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, stays on, doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because natural products like this just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was all natural and it was</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;high fashion&amp;#34; mega-lashes look, but is natural &amp; defintely enhances your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Is that supposed to be truly natural?</li>
            <li>I like this brand mascara because of the natural ingredients and the price.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again though or keep looking for a natural mascara.</li>
            <li>I am way too cheap to wipe off the brush with a tissue and waste mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess everyone&#x27;s lashes are different, but unless they change the brush I can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
            <li>This is truly a natural mascara in that it has a natural look as well as getting an EWG rating of 1 - the safest rating they give out.  </li>
            <li>It is a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; though, so I do have to clean up my eyelid area with a Q-Tip after application.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve yet to go to any fancy beauty store in search of the ultimate natural mascara that costs a pretty penny, so this is definitely of your drugstore variety.  </li>
            <li>But you shouldn&#x27;t have to thin out a brand new tube of mascara to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>(my fave mascara so far is one by bare minerals that I got as a sample, but I can&#x27;t stand to drop $25 on a tube).</li>
            <li>It may not have the fullness of others on the market, but it wins hands down in the areas that count for my eye health.</li>
            <li>A little wet but better than clumpy.</li>
            <li>but that is a hard thing to achieve with some beauty products and doesn’t necessarily make them any better perfoming/cleaner/etc.</li>
            <li>Its true that it does not provide the va-voom volume of my previous mascara, but several coats gives the color and length that I want.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d recommend it, but I may experiment with other natural mascaras after this since it was my first.</li>
            <li>It is very light however, and is difficult to layer enough so that it shows up much.  </li>
            <li>Also, the silver plastic casing seperated from the clear tube of product so when you spin the brush to open it, the three pieces seperate in your hands.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate but then it&#x27;s barely does a thing.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to those that are wanting to try a natural mascara.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really last throughout the day/evening, but a natural mascara was a priority to me.</li>
            <li>It has a tasteful and natural look about it when I apply it (which I prefer personally).</li>
            <li>I wish more makeup could list their ingredients and have some ethics behind their products.  </li>
            <li>mascara, the voluminous million lashes gold tube of mascara is what I always get, but this is healthier, I will repurchase it again sometimes, but its more expensive, you get less, and the narrowing at the top doesn&#x27;t allow the wand with left over mascara to return into the bottle, so you end up wasting a lot, or trying for 5 minutes to scrape it back into the tube using different methods so that you don&#x27;t spend $10 for 3 applications.</li>
            <li>Does not clump as much as the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is slightly on the wetter side, but that is very easily remedied by dusting my lashes with powder prior to applying, which I usually do anyway.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I had mascara on the outside of the tube when I could finally closed it.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous times to find a natural mascara, unsure if they actually made one.</li>
            <li>But for a gal with little and short lashes, it just does not thicken and lengthen as great as the poison Maybelline mascara does sadly.</li>
            <li>It also smells normal - some &#x27;natural&#x27; products have odd scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wipe down the whole thing with a tissue before I could put it away --</li>
            <li>I even tried using the tip of the brush which usually applies a little more.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, it can get a little smudgy, but it cleans up very well with a cotton swab.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel hard or sticky on the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Natural, long lasting, no clumping!</li>
            <li>I think this product is a decent substitute, but I&#x27;ll probably try a few different brands before I make up my mind on my HG natural mascara</li>
            <li>So at some point I went to the store and bought a regular black mascara, and I was absolutely horrified when I put it on...</li>
            <li>I wish the tube were a little tighter, because when you pull the wand out it tends to have excess mascara, but this isn&#x27;t much of a bother to me.  </li>
            <li>You could probably pull a Tammy-Faye look if you really wanted to, but it might get a little clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> In love!!</li>
            <li> Best of all, I love the fact that it is NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li> One good thing is that it didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> The color was good</li>
            <li> I put on two coats and am good to go until I wash it off at night.</li>
            <li> and it stays on fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara, but it depends on what you desire in your mascara.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will buy again.  </li>
            <li> I have to replace this slightly more often than store brands, but the coverage and color are great.  </li>
            <li> i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Kind of like paint.  </li>

            <li> I thought this mascara looked nice.</li>

            <li> IT has a nice color</li>
            <li> it goes on nice-</li>
            <li> and it applies nicely and holds up rather well.  </li>
            <li> Some mascaras have a kind of odor, but this has none.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on nicely all day.  </li>
            <li> It is very clumpy and I cannot imagine why this aspect of a wonderful product could not be solved.</li>
            <li> It covers nicely, without clumping too.</li>
            <li> Mascara goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> This one is one of the best I tried (in natural mascara department that is).</li>
            <li> The price is right, the color is color is great, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake after a couple of hours and</li>
            <li> It washes off so easily!</li>
            <li> I also read reviews that it smelled good, like cereal... and that&#x27;s partly why I ordered it, but it didn&#x27;t really smell good to me.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the natural ingredient list and feel good about putting this so close to my eyes-daily.  </li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t very smooth while applying to my eyes.</li>
            <li> final best thing about this mascara is that it washes off soooo easily!  </li>
            <li> I liked the mascara just fine, but about two months in, the brush broke off in the tube</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is OK.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have as many clumps.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Honeybee Gardens Products.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> While this makes my eyes look okay</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of spending money on this if it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any mascara on no matter how many coats I tried to apply.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many mascara brands I have been through, there have been so many.  </li>
            <li> I am fully able to compare.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best performing mascara from the get go.</li>
            <li> Most mascara makes my eye itchy, so I rub &amp; get racoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product has enabled me to wear mascara more often than I ever did before.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to use up a tube of mascara, so that doesn&#x27;t help me remember.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing?</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I was camping and was able to wash it off with just some water.  </li>
            <li> I am so relived to have a mascara to wear that is Gluten free and does not irritate my eyes!</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m sure there are people with allergies to everything out there).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li> my favorite aspect of this is its beauty prowess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It performs just as well as chemical-laden brands, and I think changing the brush would put it on par with my favorite CG mascara.</li>
            <li> I love Honeybee Gardens products.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the futures.</li>
            <li> It rates ok on [...</li>
            <li> but that resided and after a break I was able to use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited!  </li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not advertised as waterproof, but you&#x27;d think that it would be able to hold up to a light mist.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect a lot from a natural mascara, but it really is great.</li>
            <li> Great natural feeling mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with Honeybee Gardens mascara for its ingredients, and it performs adequately, although not up to par with more chemical-laden mascaras that will thicken, lengthen, and/or curl.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge and removes easily with make up remover or soap/water.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, natural product that goes on smooth (no clumps) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The mascara washes of easily with cleanser and water</li>
            <li> , it might even wash off easily with just water.  </li>
            <li> and it comes off and runs easily.</li>
            <li> Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li> There is no racoon eyes at the end of the day either and its easy peezy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> So note that this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to remove with just water and a face tissue.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much I&#x27;ve had multiple dreams about telling my friends how great it is!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy the brown anymore, because this black mascara gives me the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> I feel good about whats going on/near a very sensitive part of the body.</li>
            <li> This is the most affordable organic mascara I&#x27;ve tried and it works great for me - better than conventional mascara even.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not like the high performance chemical laden mascaras ( I do use waterproof Loreal for special occasions) but it is great for a healthy alternative for daily wear.</li>
            <li> The price is worth it!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;big sythetic&amp;#34; lashes type of mascara, I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;darken and add a bit of definition&amp;#34; kind of girl, so this was similar to what I already used.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for makeup products that are more natural and do not contain so many chemicals and unpronouncable things.  </li>
            <li> Good alternative to regular drug store toxin filled mascara.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may have to brush more to get desired good than with other mascaras</li>
            <li> and it was ok, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase as I have another brand of organic mascara that I much prefer.</li>
            <li> it is really lightweight and you can even put on more than one coat.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for a full week and will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is full and the formula is scentless.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is not bad.</li>
            <li> To use it up, I wear it for a quick weekend day but not for work or going out at night.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many organic Mascaras, because normal Mascaras make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mascara thicken up when I&#x27;ve had the tube for more than a couple of months, but never with a brand new tube.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clump overly much and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It smells just like hot wheat cereal!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t thicken your lashes, but it certainly defines them nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li> If you have to have something Paraben free, or have really sensative eyes, this mascara gets the job done....</li>
            <li> I was glad to see the mascara was fresh and not dried out.  </li>
            <li> i love that this mascara is all natural.</li>
            <li> It may be natural, but invest the money for a brand like Tarte if you want a GOOD natural mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am thrilled with this find.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t have potentially harmful ingredients and goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is all natural and I love that.  </li>
            <li> With something of a desire to get into more natural beauty products, I&#x27;ve spent about three years floating around testing various natural/organic/whatever mascaras and while I&#x27;ve liked all well enough, this has to be the best I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the brown, as it looked super natural on me while giving a bit of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to my near-invisible blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!t this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, looks beautiful &amp; natural, adds just the right amount of color, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It does not make lashes longer or thicken them, neither does it run but rather crumbles off and comes right off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> For a truly natural mascara, I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am fairly dedicated to natural beauty products and have tried several natural/organic macaras.</li>
            <li> a good natural product (not totally organic,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t thicken or lengthen my lashes very much</li>
            <li> But right out of the box, it is a dry mascara that lightly clumps and lightly flakes throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> not outrageously expensive--</li>
            <li> When I reinserted the wand for an 2nd application, it was as if all the mascara migrated to the top of the tube &amp; wrapped itself around the wand.</li>
            <li> This is my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara that I have tried, since I&#x27;ve decided to go more&lt;</li>
            <li> I am excited to find something natural that works for me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for a natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I feel it could stand up to it pretty well.</li>
            <li> As far as natural mascaras go, it was okay, but I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> The result is a nice, just above natural look.  </li>
            <li> My favorite natural mascara so far.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using my first vegan mascara, but this itched me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you the effect of super long and volumous eyelashes, it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Honeybee Gardens Mascara and 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Mascara.  </li>
            <li> the past couple of years, my eyes have become more and more sensitive to product</li>
            <li> The first time I pulled out the wand, it came out cleanly with just enough mascara on it to let me apply 1 coat to the lashes on 1 eye.</li>
            <li> If your whole reason for wearing mascara is just to darken your lashes (and if you have blonde tipped lashes and wear glasses, like me), then it is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo hard to find cosmetics that are of good quality and do not have parabens.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping a curl, but this does nicely to help hold my curl, at least better then most.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re just health conscious like me, and want to use healthier products, I would go with the organic wear mascara with the bright green cap shaped like a leaf.  </li>
            <li> So much product comes out of the sides of the TUBE upon pushing the wand in and out and closing</li>
            <li> but it is very clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> It bothered my eyes and made them very irritated.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work out.  </li>
            <li> And I swear my lashes are so much nicer after using this for 2 months.</li>
            <li> I usually only like a macara the final 3rd of its life and this one worked great straight away.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like honeybee garden&#x27;s mascara after trying a handful of natural/hypo mascaras.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump much either which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I found this brand of mascara, I was really concerned about what products I was putting near my eyes on a daily basis in the name of fitting in/beauty, now I don&#x27;t worry at all.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the brush so much.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, and will try more Honeybee Garden products - so far this and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to use as many natural products as possible.  </li>
            <li> mascara goes on nicely, leaving a light layer to thicken and the black color really makes my lashes look long.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, the other mascara is a better product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Sooo much product has been wasted I&#x27;m sure this msscara will only last a couple more weeks!</li>
            <li> It takes several strokes to apply any significant amount to make it look like I have mascara on.  </li>
            <li> Tends to get fairly dry after a couple months but overall I really like it and works just about as good as a NON natural mascara, but without all the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Its a bit messy ..flaky to be exact, but its better than&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without decent mascara that fit my no chemical requirements.</li>
            <li> maybe they can come up with a better formula to keep the product on lashes, i might reconsider down the road.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, doesn&#x27;t clump, and it&#x27;s more water resistant than my previous brand.</li>
            <li> I feel much happier about putting this near my eyes as it has much safer ingredients than the drugstore brand I was using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several years now, and overall, I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews online I really thought this would live up to my normal expectations.</li>
            <li> Because the other mascara has been more than sufficient and now I know that just because a mascara is made with natural ingredients it does not have to clump and flake.</li>
            <li> does not run, gently comes off with natural soap or oil, does not irritate my eyes,</li>
            <li> It does however wash off really well and doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> The natural ingredients really matter to me, too.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It takes several coats being worked on to your lashes to get a nice dark effect.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was that it had a rather odd smell - not offensive, but far from appealing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get stiff like most mascaras</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it, and I really like the fact there are only natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> - you are supposed to replace your mascara at every 3 months &amp; getting a new one in teh mail</li>
            <li> I had to clean lots of gooey mascara that would ooze out the sides every time I closed the tube.</li>
            <li> For the price and the natural ingredients, I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The product is very thin and does not last well at all, it is also very good at making &#x27;tarantula lashes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This mascara flakes on me and clumps a little which sucked because other than that it was good mascara.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a pretty standard mascara bottle size.  </li>
            <li> there are other clean mascaras out there</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on well.. not very thick</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, which is why I look for natural make up and skin care products, and this made me itch</li>
            <li> This mascara was some what dry right when I opened it, and I had to use two coats.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item after becoming concerned about the amount of chemicals in my usual mascara.</li>
            <li> It is just your basic mascara, doesn&#x27;t make the lashes stand out much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, but I need something that can give me some fullness.</li>
            <li> It is natural and works well for me.  </li>
            <li> This is all natural, yes-</li>
            <li> Try Gabrielle mascara if you want all natural and non-clumpy.</li>
            <li> I switched to this mascara because my old one was causing irritation in my eyes and</li>
            <li> tube isn&#x27;t wide enough and when I take the brush out and in, the extra mascara clumps at the top.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, stays on, doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because natural products like this just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was all natural and it was</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;high fashion&amp;#34; mega-lashes look, but is natural &amp; defintely enhances your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Is that supposed to be truly natural?</li>
            <li> I like this brand mascara because of the natural ingredients and the price.  </li>
            <li> I would buy it again though or keep looking for a natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I am way too cheap to wipe off the brush with a tissue and waste mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess everyone&#x27;s lashes are different, but unless they change the brush I can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is truly a natural mascara in that it has a natural look as well as getting an EWG rating of 1 - the safest rating they give out.  </li>
            <li> It is a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; though, so I do have to clean up my eyelid area with a Q-Tip after application.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve yet to go to any fancy beauty store in search of the ultimate natural mascara that costs a pretty penny, so this is definitely of your drugstore variety.  </li>
            <li> But you shouldn&#x27;t have to thin out a brand new tube of mascara to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> (my fave mascara so far is one by bare minerals that I got as a sample, but I can&#x27;t stand to drop $25 on a tube).</li>
            <li> It may not have the fullness of others on the market, but it wins hands down in the areas that count for my eye health.</li>
            <li> A little wet but better than clumpy.</li>
            <li> but that is a hard thing to achieve with some beauty products and doesn’t necessarily make them any better perfoming/cleaner/etc.</li>
            <li> Its true that it does not provide the va-voom volume of my previous mascara, but several coats gives the color and length that I want.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d recommend it, but I may experiment with other natural mascaras after this since it was my first.</li>
            <li> It is very light however, and is difficult to layer enough so that it shows up much.  </li>
            <li> Also, the silver plastic casing seperated from the clear tube of product so when you spin the brush to open it, the three pieces seperate in your hands.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate but then it&#x27;s barely does a thing.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to those that are wanting to try a natural mascara.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really last throughout the day/evening, but a natural mascara was a priority to me.</li>
            <li> It has a tasteful and natural look about it when I apply it (which I prefer personally).</li>
            <li> I wish more makeup could list their ingredients and have some ethics behind their products.  </li>
            <li> mascara, the voluminous million lashes gold tube of mascara is what I always get, but this is healthier, I will repurchase it again sometimes, but its more expensive, you get less, and the narrowing at the top doesn&#x27;t allow the wand with left over mascara to return into the bottle, so you end up wasting a lot, or trying for 5 minutes to scrape it back into the tube using different methods so that you don&#x27;t spend $10 for 3 applications.</li>
            <li> Does not clump as much as the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is slightly on the wetter side, but that is very easily remedied by dusting my lashes with powder prior to applying, which I usually do anyway.  </li>
            <li> so much so that I had mascara on the outside of the tube when I could finally closed it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous times to find a natural mascara, unsure if they actually made one.</li>
            <li> But for a gal with little and short lashes, it just does not thicken and lengthen as great as the poison Maybelline mascara does sadly.</li>
            <li> It also smells normal - some &#x27;natural&#x27; products have odd scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to wipe down the whole thing with a tissue before I could put it away --</li>
            <li> I even tried using the tip of the brush which usually applies a little more.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful, it can get a little smudgy, but it cleans up very well with a cotton swab.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel hard or sticky on the lashes.  </li>
            <li> Natural, long lasting, no clumping!</li>
            <li> I think this product is a decent substitute, but I&#x27;ll probably try a few different brands before I make up my mind on my HG natural mascara</li>
            <li> So at some point I went to the store and bought a regular black mascara, and I was absolutely horrified when I put it on...</li>
            <li> I wish the tube were a little tighter, because when you pull the wand out it tends to have excess mascara, but this isn&#x27;t much of a bother to me.  </li>
            <li> You could probably pull a Tammy-Faye look if you really wanted to, but it might get a little clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, but they point straight down</li>
            <li> This mascara did not irritate her eyes (like other natural mascaras).</li>
            <li> I am not aware of another natural brand that compares in price to Honeybee Gardens.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating, no bad stuff….just</li>
            <li> with one coat it still looks fairly natural even with my blonde hair, and with two coats, I can do a little darker makeup without my eyelashes looking like gunk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, it has an odd smell</li>
            <li> To thicken just put on one coat, wait for it to dry a bit, then apply the second coat.  </li>
            <li> (I went with black), the formula isn&#x27;t oozy, and the result is natural,</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s affordable and it gets a good score on the Skin Deep data base from Environmental Working Group</li>
            <li> When I received this, on first use I found it very dry and hard to put on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that strange smell -</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money...</li>
            <li> , it is a long process to get the mascara on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of mascara at natural food stores (some even very expensive!), but this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a racoon within hours.  </li>
            <li> It can be slightly clumpy if you&#x27;re not careful, but it volumizes and stays put all day without smudging.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I was sent a very old tube or if it&#x27;s always that dry, but it did not work like mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Other reviews on here mentioned the same issue as well.</li>
            <li> so maybe that’s why it flakes however even on dry days</li>
            <li> It took a while for it to dry-</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it made my eyes dry out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Physicians formula mascara also makes my eyes really dry, but I can use their eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use a dry wand to get any excess off my lashes after applying.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive eyes, in my experience over the past month using this mascara, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  </li>
            <li> Well...it is natural :/</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really last as long as I want and smudges under my eyes a little at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I had become so used to the smoothness and lightness of the honeybee gardens mascara that the standard store-bought mascara felt like black chemical sludge on my eyes...</li>
            <li> I tried several times to get it to be less like tar, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> While other ones just fall off after a while, this Mascara lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Even after using a heated lash curler my lashes fell flat down again after applying it.</li>
            <li> I like mine to really fluff out my lashes and this only darkened and lengthened them a little.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a natural mascara that performs well.</li>
            <li> But as a former makeup artist, she at least knows application and I am a big mascara girl.</li>
            <li> It may take a few coats to get it dark/thick vs one coat with the commercial.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy but be careful as the brush broke on me</li>
            <li> I wish I spent the $11 towards a brand I trust.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly, as expected.  </li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t run (unless you get it wet), doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and coats my lashes well.</li>
            <li> I guess I will go back to the yucky stuff in the pink and green bottle for now - it doesn&#x27;t irriate my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, thickens, doesn&#x27;t run or smear as long as you let it dry for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the glitch is due to a design flaw with the tube or a problem with the texture of the product.</li>
            <li> However I will be trying out other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I will have to try some other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain the area around my eyes like other mascaras do.  </li>
            <li> I like it for daytime when Im not wearing other makeup, but prefer something that is easier to layer and build up for evening wear as well.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not bother my eyes the way other mascaras can and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> It left my eyelashes very stiff and spidery looking.</li>
            <li> Plus, it wasn&#x27;t thick enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even accidentally jammed the brush in my eye a little bit with little problems.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky/clumpy, visible but not overly dramatic, stays on all day but keeps my lashes soft.</li>
            <li> This just turns your lashes black.  </li>
            <li> thus leaving black smudges when I&#x27;d blink.</li>
            <li> My quest to find less toxic makeup continues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the espresso brown color and the black color.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing that away after about a week, and then thought to try the honeybee gardens mascara in black.</li>
            <li> Has a slight &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> it just coats in black.</li>
            <li> That being said, the brush leaves my lashes clumpy and spikey and weird, and doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The wand is extremely long and therefore hard to control.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that hasn&#x27;t made my eyes swell up, burn, itch and water like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Making for a bit of a mess.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not smell like any botanical I&#x27;ve ever smelled and this is a little off-putting.</li>
            <li> Which is weird for me, because I have really thick and long eyelashes naturally.  </li>
            <li> I bought this when looking for an all natural mascara, but I am not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of product trying to reinsert the wand into the tube --</li>
            <li> just you would need to keep applying and wiping off the dried pieces.</li>
            <li> It does have a funny smell but it is very faint and does not bother my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> There was something about the combination of my eye cream, moisturizer &amp; mascara that would cause my eyes to water, thus destroying my made-up face and forcing me to attempt to fix it while now running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to apply a few coats to get where I want to be, but it stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t chunk or flake off or smear and it comes off</li>
            <li> other mascara&#x27;s with more nasty ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first natural mascara that I have tried, not the worst either, but I still don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I do live in Florida where is usually muggy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a way to make it lengthen, although at least for my lashes, it makes them look longer just by making the sun-bleached tips black and visible.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this in the past from iherb.</li>
            <li> All natural, made from fruit extracts, so no eye irritation or dangerous chemicals to deal with--and it works as well as any over-the-counter mascara--stays on without smudging.</li>
            <li> MAJOR BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;I do notice it doesn&#x27;t go on quite as well if it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> Sad how the packaging is just a FAIL, and cannot be overlooked by this decent mascara.</li>
            <li> Taking it off is another story, because it is hard to get off even with remover</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is one of the least toxic mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> I pulled out the wand &amp; it was a sloppy, gloppy mess!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my tear duck swelled up and was very painful ...</li>
            <li> I THINK I like this mascara, but it&#x27;s hard to tell because the brush is complete crap.</li>
            <li> it shut its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> If you want thicker looking lashes, you have to put 2-3 coats on, and if you want curl, you have to do some serious lash-curling ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> But because the packaging alone is just horrible, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had a few uncomfortable situations when I ran with friends after wearing it to work.  </li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t seem irritating, blackens my lashes, but can be a bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> If you want dramatic lashes, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t be movie star dramatic, but they will be noticeably thicker.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problem with this mascara smearing or flaking off, but I find it a bit difficult to remove at the end of the day with my cleansing oils.  </li>
            <li> it just rendered itself useless.</li>
            <li> and I look stupid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly annoying.  </li>
            <li> If your house is especially chilly you could probably remedy that by tucking it in your bra for a couple minutes while your doing the rest of your makeup.</li>
            <li> the worst mascara Ive ever had.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not run, gently comes off with natural soap or oil, does not irritate my eyes, not outrageously expensive-- i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard of all the horrid chemicals in commercial mascara.  So as soon as I received it I immediately threw out my commercial mascara!  This stuff works well!  It may take a few coats to get it dark/thick vs one coat with the commercial.  Doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge and removes easily with make up remover or soap/water.  I&#x27;m excited!  This is a must for anyone looking for non-chemically mascara!  The price is worth it!</li>
            <li> If you have to have something Paraben free, or have really sensative eyes, this mascara gets the job done.... but if you&#x27;re just health conscious like me, and want to use healthier products, I would go with the organic wear mascara with the bright green cap shaped like a leaf.  You can get it on amazon or at walmart.  It&#x27;s a better product.  This mascara was some what dry right when I opened it, and I had to use two coats.  Which is weird for me, because I have really thick and long eyelashes naturally.  I also read reviews that it smelled good, like cereal... and that&#x27;s partly why I ordered it, but it didn&#x27;t really smell good to me.  Kind of like paint.  Like I said, the other mascara is a better product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my fav. mascara, the voluminous million lashes gold tube of mascara is what I always get, but this is healthier, I will repurchase it again sometimes, but its more expensive, you get less, and the narrowing at the top doesn&#x27;t allow the wand with left over mascara to return into the bottle, so you end up wasting a lot, or trying for 5 minutes to scrape it back into the tube using different methods so that you don&#x27;t spend $10 for 3 applications.</li>
            <li> The mascara is OK. But for a gal with little and short lashes, it just does not thicken and lengthen as great as the poison Maybelline mascara does sadly. Well...it is natural :/ I could probably deal with that assuming that it&#x27;s not poison. BUT THEN...closing the tube is what the eff?! So much product comes out of the sides of the TUBE upon pushing the wand in and out and closing it shut its ridiculous. I had to clean lots of gooey mascara that would ooze out the sides every time I closed the tube. Sooo much product has been wasted I&#x27;m sure this msscara will only last a couple more weeks! Other reviews on here mentioned the same issue as well. I would probably purchase again if it wasn&#x27;t for this. But because the packaging alone is just horrible, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth the price and I won&#x27;t purchase again. Sad how the packaging is just a FAIL, and cannot be overlooked by this decent mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teen daughter. This mascara did not irritate her eyes (like other natural mascaras). It goes on smooth, looks beautiful &amp; natural, adds just the right amount of color, not too heavy. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> The mascara is not bad. It doesn&#x27;t give you the effect of super long and volumous eyelashes, it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I thought this mascara was alright. It left my eyelashes very stiff and spidery looking. I do like that it&#x27;s natural, it has an odd smell though.&lt;br /&gt;I used it up and it was ok, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase as I have another brand of organic mascara that I much prefer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after becoming concerned about the amount of chemicals in my usual mascara. I am happy with the natural ingredient list and feel good about putting this so close to my eyes-daily.  Its true that it does not provide the va-voom volume of my previous mascara, but several coats gives the color and length that I want.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see the mascara was fresh and not dried out.  I had purchased this in the past from iherb.</li>
            <li> I bought this when looking for an all natural mascara, but I am not impressed with it. The wand is extremely long and therefore hard to control. It is just your basic mascara, doesn&#x27;t make the lashes stand out much. One good thing is that it didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with Honeybee Gardens mascara for its ingredients, and it performs adequately, although not up to par with more chemical-laden mascaras that will thicken, lengthen, and/or curl.  This just turns your lashes black.  If you want thicker looking lashes, you have to put 2-3 coats on, and if you want curl, you have to do some serious lash-curling ahead of time.  I haven&#x27;t found a way to make it lengthen, although at least for my lashes, it makes them look longer just by making the sun-bleached tips black and visible.  Also, it&#x27;s not at all waterproof or rub-proof.  It does, however, have a nice texture - it&#x27;s not as goopy/sticky as regular mascara and it doesn&#x27;t have as many clumps.  It also doesn&#x27;t have that strange smell - in fact, I think it smells a bit like cereal.  Overall I&#x27;d recommend it, but I may experiment with other natural mascaras after this since it was my first.</li>
            <li> I have skimpy eyelashes and this mascara doesn&#x27;t do me any favors. I like that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, but I need something that can give me some fullness. Looks like I need to keep searching...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the glitch is due to a design flaw with the tube or a problem with the texture of the product. The first time I pulled out the wand, it came out cleanly with just enough mascara on it to let me apply 1 coat to the lashes on 1 eye. When I reinserted the wand for an 2nd application, it was as if all the mascara migrated to the top of the tube &amp; wrapped itself around the wand. I pulled out the wand &amp; it was a sloppy, gloppy mess! I wasted a lot of product trying to reinsert the wand into the tube -- so much so that I had mascara on the outside of the tube when I could finally closed it. I had to wipe down the whole thing with a tissue before I could put it away -- yuk! I&#x27;ve had mascara thicken up when I&#x27;ve had the tube for more than a couple of months, but never with a brand new tube. I may try adding a drop or 2 of coconut oil to it to see it that thins it out. But you shouldn&#x27;t have to thin out a brand new tube of mascara to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> This mascara flakes on me and clumps a little which sucked because other than that it was good mascara.  I do live in Florida where is usually muggy so maybe that’s why it flakes however even on dry days the mascara flakes come mid-day, but I do have oily skin and my lashes touch my eye lids when I blink so maybe that’s why is flakes?  It does however wash off really well and doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin which is a plus.  However I will be trying out other mascaras.</li>
            <li> This mascara was liquidy- if that makes sense at all.  It took a while for it to dry- thus leaving black smudges when I&#x27;d blink. As far as natural mascaras go, it was okay, but I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to eye make up and the last bout of buying several different mascaras and watching my eyelids swell lead me to Honey Bee Gardens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful! I have not had a problem since I started using it. Best of all, I love the fact that it is NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li> It is natural and works well for me.  I don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes and it provides darkness and definition to my eyes!  I have already bought another back up tube.</li>
            <li> I bought two &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras to compare.  Honeybee Gardens Mascara and 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Mascara.  Honeybee Gardens clumped.  I was hoping that would not happen until I had used it for a while.  But right out of the box, it is a dry mascara that lightly clumps and lightly flakes throughout the day.  My comparison turned out well.  Because the other mascara has been more than sufficient and now I know that just because a mascara is made with natural ingredients it does not have to clump and flake.</li>
            <li> i love that this mascara is all natural. it smells nice and goes on without clumps. it is really lightweight and you can even put on more than one coat.</li>
            <li> This is all natural, yes- but it is very clumpy.  Try Gabrielle mascara if you want all natural and non-clumpy.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not irritating at all. It takes a couple coats to give some volume. I have long lashes so it works for me. If you have short lashes I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for volume effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo hard to find cosmetics that are of good quality and do not have parabens. This mascara goes on well.. not very thick so you will likely need 2 coats. It doesn&#x27;t really last as long as I want and smudges under my eyes a little at the end of the day. To use it up, I wear it for a quick weekend day but not for work or going out at night. Because of this, I will likely not buy again.</li>
            <li> When I received this, on first use I found it very dry and hard to put on my lashes. It bothered my eyes and made them very irritated. I am not sure if I was sent a very old tube or if it&#x27;s always that dry, but it did not work like mascara at all. It was a complete waste of money...I tried using it for a full week and will never purchase again. My quest to find less toxic makeup continues.</li>
            <li> This is a great, natural product that goes on smooth (no clumps) and lasts all day. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a natural mascara that performs well. This one is one of the best I tried (in natural mascara department that is). It doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, doesn&#x27;t clump, and it&#x27;s more water resistant than my previous brand. It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it does not run if I tear up.</li>
            <li> It may be natural, but invest the money for a brand like Tarte if you want a GOOD natural mascara. This one is like smearing a beeswax candle on your lashes. I have very sensitive eyes, which is why I look for natural make up and skin care products, and this made me itch</li>
            <li> I thought this mascara looked nice. It didn&#x27;t clump overly much and it was easy to apply. It also smells normal - some &#x27;natural&#x27; products have odd scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it made my eyes dry out. I guess I will go back to the yucky stuff in the pink and green bottle for now - it doesn&#x27;t irriate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physicians formula mascara also makes my eyes really dry, but I can use their eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Honeybee Gardens Products.  This mascara works just as well as the non-natural types.  Very satisfied and will buy again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using my first vegan mascara, but this itched me.  I really wanted this to work out.  Plus, it wasn&#x27;t thick enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> need to put several layers and still doesn&#x27;t get to that point where my eyelashes appear longer. The color was good but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have to replace this slightly more often than store brands, but the coverage and color are great.  i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;It takes several coats being worked on to your lashes to get a nice dark effect.  It doesn&#x27;t clump but adds great definition to your lashes.  I don&#x27;t have any problem with this mascara smearing or flaking off, but I find it a bit difficult to remove at the end of the day with my cleansing oils.  I switched to this mascara because my old one was causing irritation in my eyes and I was concerned about the ingredients.  I feel much happier about putting this near my eyes as it has much safer ingredients than the drugstore brand I was using.  I think this product is a decent substitute, but I&#x27;ll probably try a few different brands before I make up my mind on my HG natural mascara product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;big sythetic&amp;#34; lashes type of mascara, I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;darken and add a bit of definition&amp;#34; kind of girl, so this was similar to what I already used.  If you use mascaras that add a lot of volume or length, you may find this product does not suit your needs.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really nice. This is my first time using it, and I really like the fact there are only natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Not sticky/clumpy, visible but not overly dramatic, stays on all day but keeps my lashes soft. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> All natural, made from fruit extracts, so no eye irritation or dangerous chemicals to deal with--and it works as well as any over-the-counter mascara--stays on without smudging.</li>
            <li> While this makes my eyes look okay, it is a long process to get the mascara on.  Taking it off is another story, because it is hard to get off even with remover and it isn&#x27;t water proof.&lt;br /&gt;The tube isn&#x27;t wide enough and when I take the brush out and in, the extra mascara clumps at the top.  The consistency isn&#x27;t very smooth while applying to my eyes. It takes several strokes to apply any significant amount to make it look like I have mascara on.  It does not bother my eyes, which is good! I wanted to like this but I just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the espresso brown color and the black color. I was pretty happy with the brown, as it looked super natural on me while giving a bit of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to my near-invisible blonde eyelashes. But it wasn&#x27;t really great for the days when I wanted to do a bit heavier makeup. So at some point I went to the store and bought a regular black mascara, and I was absolutely horrified when I put it on... I had become so used to the smoothness and lightness of the honeybee gardens mascara that the standard store-bought mascara felt like black chemical sludge on my eyes... I tried several times to get it to be less like tar, but to no avail. I ended up throwing that away after about a week, and then thought to try the honeybee gardens mascara in black. It&#x27;s perfect! with one coat it still looks fairly natural even with my blonde hair, and with two coats, I can do a little darker makeup without my eyelashes looking like gunk. I don&#x27;t think I will buy the brown anymore, because this black mascara gives me the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I works great, it&#x27;s affordable and it gets a good score on the Skin Deep data base from Environmental Working Group so I don&#x27;t have to worry that it&#x27;s harmful to my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate but then it&#x27;s barely does a thing.  You wouldn&#x27;t even know I have mascara on at all.  What&#x27;s the point of spending money on this if it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any mascara on no matter how many coats I tried to apply.  I even tried using the tip of the brush which usually applies a little more.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> In love!! Hubby likes this on me too which says a ton since he hates makeup! It&#x27;s not clumpy but be careful as the brush broke on me</li>
            <li> I suffer from multiple chemical sensitivities.  This is the first mascara that hasn&#x27;t made my eyes swell up, burn, itch and water like crazy.  I am soooo happy that I decided to try this.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many mascara brands I have been through, there have been so many.  The price is wonderful too.  I am not aware of another natural brand that compares in price to Honeybee Gardens.  The mascara goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and stays all day.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel hard or sticky on the lashes.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking while wearing either.  The mascara washes of easily with cleanser and water, it might even wash off easily with just water.  Overall, I am thrilled with this find.  I can finally wear mascara again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without decent mascara that fit my no chemical requirements. I used Physician&#x27;s Formula organic mascara before this and it would always get clumpy and flakey halfway through the day. This stuff is great. I put on two coats and am good to go until I wash it off at night. It lengthens and thickens with no clumping. It is a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; though, so I do have to clean up my eyelid area with a Q-Tip after application. Totally worth it. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara that I have tried, since I&#x27;ve decided to go more&lt;br /&gt;toward organic cosmetic&#x27;s. Its a bit messy ..flaky to be exact, but its better than&lt;br /&gt;the other mascara&#x27;s with more nasty ingredients. I will have to try some other one&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;so I am fully able to compare.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, stays on, doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting, and looks natural. I am excited to find something natural that works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of mascara at natural food stores (some even very expensive!), but this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a racoon within hours.  I have oily eyelids, but this mascara stays on my lashes.  The natural ingredients really matter to me, too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for a natural mascara. Doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble or smudge or smear. Sure it&#x27;s not like the high performance chemical laden mascaras ( I do use waterproof Loreal for special occasions) but it is great for a healthy alternative for daily wear. And I swear my lashes are so much nicer after using this for 2 months. MAJOR BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;I do notice it doesn&#x27;t go on quite as well if it&#x27;s cold. I imagine that&#x27;s because of the beeswax. If your house is especially chilly you could probably remedy that by tucking it in your bra for a couple minutes while your doing the rest of your makeup.</li>
            <li> For a truly natural mascara, I am pretty satisfied. Tends to get fairly dry after a couple months but overall I really like it and works just about as good as a NON natural mascara, but without all the harmful ingredients. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I feel good about whats going on/near a very sensitive part of the body. It stays on well and while I haven&#x27;t had my face soaked while wearing it I feel it could stand up to it pretty well.</li>
            <li> I liked the mascara just fine, but about two months in, the brush broke off in the tube and I can&#x27;t get it out without breaking the bottle...it just rendered itself useless. Is this a quality control issue?</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous times to find a natural mascara, unsure if they actually made one. This has caused no eye irritation and does not smear.</li>
            <li> the worst mascara Ive ever had.  made my lashes clump and it comes off and runs easily. there are other clean mascaras out there</li>
            <li> A lot of people touch on how this mascara is clumpy, but my biggest problem is that I end up looking like a goth teen if I go outside in the rain.  I know it&#x27;s not advertised as waterproof, but you&#x27;d think that it would be able to hold up to a light mist.  I&#x27;ve also had a few uncomfortable situations when I ran with friends after wearing it to work.  It just gets everywhere and I look stupid.  Now I understand why cosmetic companies put all the cancer in their products... It&#x27;s because natural products like this just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was all natural and it was but after a while it starts to chip off. IT has a nice color just you would need to keep applying and wiping off the dried pieces.</li>
            <li> I am fairly dedicated to natural beauty products and have tried several natural/organic macaras. This is definitely the best performing mascara from the get go. I usually only like a macara the final 3rd of its life and this one worked great straight away. Non irritating, no bad stuff….just a good natural product (not totally organic, but that is a hard thing to achieve with some beauty products and doesn’t necessarily make them any better perfoming/cleaner/etc. Try it…you’ll like it!</li>
            <li> great mascara- it goes on nice- gives me long lashes and stays put - no smudging - lashes look natural and long</li>
            <li> Most mascara makes my eye itchy, so I rub &amp; get racoon eyes.  this does not bother myeyes &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Now I don&#x27;t wear it for occaissions like funerals when I know I will cry (don&#x27;t wear any eye make up then).  This product has enabled me to wear mascara more often than I ever did before.  It is not goopy either.  It doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;high fashion&amp;#34; mega-lashes look, but is natural &amp; defintely enhances your lashes.  I wish Amazon had Subscribe &amp; Save for this item - you are supposed to replace your mascara at every 3 months &amp; getting a new one in teh mail would be a great reminder.  I have never been able to use up a tube of mascara, so that doesn&#x27;t help me remember.</li>
            <li> This is the most affordable organic mascara I&#x27;ve tried and it works great for me - better than conventional mascara even.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, thickens, doesn&#x27;t run or smear as long as you let it dry for a few seconds.  To thicken just put on one coat, wait for it to dry a bit, then apply the second coat.  Will definitely buy again, and will try more Honeybee Garden products - so far this and their nail polish is great, affordable, and organic.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage and it stays on fairly well. It washes off so easily! Downside is that my brush tip came off in the tube and I only had it 3 weeks. PharmaFrag refunded for $7.99.</li>
            <li> If your whole reason for wearing mascara is just to darken your lashes (and if you have blonde tipped lashes and wear glasses, like me), then it is fine. It does not make lashes longer or thicken them, neither does it run but rather crumbles off and comes right off with soap and water.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate allergic eyes and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell. Another reviewer said it smelled like cereal and I agree. It smells just like hot wheat cereal!</li>
            <li> Received product very quickly. Mascara is very nice and does a wonderful job of thickening my lashes. It does have a funny smell but it is very faint and does not bother my eyes at all. I would definitely recommend to those that are wanting to try a natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. No irritation. But crumbles off during the day, needs to be reapplied throughout. maybe they can come up with a better formula to keep the product on lashes, i might reconsider down the road.</li>
            <li> The product itself is gooey.  Has a slight &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell. Drippy.  It&#x27;s no bueno.  I wish I spent the $11 towards a brand I trust.  If I could toss this back at them I would.  Also, the silver plastic casing seperated from the clear tube of product so when you spin the brush to open it, the three pieces seperate in your hands.  Is that supposed to be truly natural? It&#x27;s truly annoying.  I had to buy another tube of mascara at Ulta (woe is me!!) and this one just sits in my makeup bag, mocking me.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first natural mascara that I have tried, not the worst either, but I still don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was that it had a rather odd smell - not offensive, but far from appealing. The product is very thin and does not last well at all, it is also very good at making &#x27;tarantula lashes&#x27;.  Better than nothing? Not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this brand mascara because of the natural ingredients and the price.  I wish the tube were a little tighter, because when you pull the wand out it tends to have excess mascara, but this isn&#x27;t much of a bother to me.  I use a dry wand to get any excess off my lashes after applying.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several years now, and overall, I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this product solely because it was the only paraban-free mascara I could find. It doesn&#x27;t thicken or lengthen my lashes very much and it doesn&#x27;t really last throughout the day/evening, but a natural mascara was a priority to me. I would buy it again though or keep looking for a natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like honeybee garden&#x27;s mascara after trying a handful of natural/hypo mascaras. It won&#x27;t thicken your lashes, but it certainly defines them nicely and naturally. I have very long lashes, but they point straight down so I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping a curl, but this does nicely to help hold my curl, at least better then most. There is no ewwie smell and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, which is wonderful. There is no racoon eyes at the end of the day either and its easy peezy to remove at night. Overall, it&#x27;s my mascara of choice.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara, but it depends on what you desire in your mascara.  I like mine to really fluff out my lashes and this only darkened and lengthened them a little.  It is also not waterproof.  And if you tear up even a bit, this mascara will run or smear.  Making for a bit of a mess.  Otherwise it is one of the least toxic mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for makeup products that are more natural and do not contain so many chemicals and unpronouncable things.  This product does that and it applies nicely and holds up rather well.  However, it does not smell like any botanical I&#x27;ve ever smelled and this is a little off-putting.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t have potentially harmful ingredients and goes on really nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t get stiff like most mascaras so you can reapply without getting clumps like they advertise.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. On my third tube.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much I&#x27;ve had multiple dreams about telling my friends how great it is!  True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past couple of years, my eyes have become more and more sensitive to product and I&#x27;m trying to use as many natural products as possible.  There was something about the combination of my eye cream, moisturizer &amp; mascara that would cause my eyes to water, thus destroying my made-up face and forcing me to attempt to fix it while now running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched for a replacement online, reading reviews and checking out ingredients.  I&#x27;d actually seen this mascara on another site, but wanted to take advantage of my Prime membership benefits through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, as expected.  The bottle is a pretty standard mascara bottle size.  The brush is full and the formula is scentless.  It is slightly on the wetter side, but that is very easily remedied by dusting my lashes with powder prior to applying, which I usually do anyway.  This works wonders.  I am way too cheap to wipe off the brush with a tissue and waste mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive eyes, in my experience over the past month using this mascara, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  I&#x27;ve even accidentally jammed the brush in my eye a little bit with little problems.  Some mascaras have a kind of odor, but this has none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara goes on nicely, leaving a light layer to thicken and the black color really makes my lashes look long.  If I&#x27;m not careful, it can get a little smudgy, but it cleans up very well with a cotton swab.  It stays on nicely all day.  The result is a nice, just above natural look.  You could probably pull a Tammy-Faye look if you really wanted to, but it might get a little clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final best thing about this mascara is that it washes off soooo easily!  I was camping and was able to wash it off with just some water.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain the area around my eyes like other mascaras do.  So note that this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this mascara and will be purchasing it again this weekend.  Highly recommended!t this means it is not waterproof, whatsoever, but the easily wash off is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this mascara and will be purchasing it again this weekend.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My favorite natural mascara so far.  Does not clump as much as the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you reference Skin Deep, this is a very low toxin product. But like their eye pencils, this just does not work. It is very clumpy and I cannot imagine why this aspect of a wonderful product could not be solved. I have had luck with Ecco Bella mascara. A little wet but better than clumpy. I have also ordered Jane Iredale which is a 3 on Skin Deep which I try to avoid especially around my eyes. But as a former makeup artist, she at least knows application and I am a big mascara girl. I have given Honeybee Gardens two stars for trying where almost all others do not. We should cheer these companies on while giving them direction, still knowing that low or no toxin will never probably perform as well as the chemicalized ingredients we have come to rely on.</li>
            <li> I am so relived to have a mascara to wear that is Gluten free and does not irritate my eyes! It covers nicely, without clumping too. It may not have the fullness of others on the market, but it wins hands down in the areas that count for my eye health. Thank you for offering this product!</li>
            <li> For the price and the natural ingredients, I highly recommend.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes and works well (although I&#x27;m sure there are people with allergies to everything out there).  It doesn&#x27;t clump much either which is a bonus.  It has a tasteful and natural look about it when I apply it (which I prefer personally). I wish more makeup could list their ingredients and have some ethics behind their products.  For now, this is my mascara of choice and I&#x27;m sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found this brand of mascara, I was really concerned about what products I was putting near my eyes on a daily basis in the name of fitting in/beauty, now I don&#x27;t worry at all.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara I have ever bought...Natural, long lasting, no clumping!</li>
            <li> I like this product and it does not irritate my eyes at all.  It is all natural and I love that.  It is very light however, and is difficult to layer enough so that it shows up much.  I like it for daytime when Im not wearing other makeup, but prefer something that is easier to layer and build up for evening wear as well.</li>
            <li> With something of a desire to get into more natural beauty products, I&#x27;ve spent about three years floating around testing various natural/organic/whatever mascaras and while I&#x27;ve liked all well enough, this has to be the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve yet to go to any fancy beauty store in search of the ultimate natural mascara that costs a pretty penny, so this is definitely of your drugstore variety.  I&#x27;m okay with that and if you are as well I recommend this one.  The price is right, the color is color is great, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake after a couple of hours and it&#x27;s right easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my favorite aspect of this is its beauty prowess.  Like I said, the color is awesome (I went with black), the formula isn&#x27;t oozy, and the result is natural, feathery lashes which I found delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be the mascara I stick with.</li>
            <li> I did not expect a lot from a natural mascara, but it really is great. It can be slightly clumpy if you&#x27;re not careful, but it volumizes and stays put all day without smudging. Yet it comes off with just water- and without burning your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs just as well as chemical-laden brands, and I think changing the brush would put it on par with my favorite CG mascara.</li>
            <li> Great natural feeling mascara. It did not hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this non-clumping mascara. I&#x27;ve got to apply a few coats to get where I want to be, but it stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t chunk or flake off or smear and it comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. No chemical smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews online I really thought this would live up to my normal expectations. All it does it color the lashes. There is no curling. Even after using a heated lash curler my lashes fell flat down again after applying it. Back to the drawing board....</li>
            <li> Goes on easily. I may have to brush more to get desired good than with other mascaras but hey, this is not toxic!! Worth it!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter, she just started wearing make up and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as promised in the time frame</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t seem irritating, blackens my lashes, but can be a bit clumpy. I&#x27;ll try another organic brand next time.</li>
            <li> I THINK I like this mascara, but it&#x27;s hard to tell because the brush is complete crap. The mascara doesn&#x27;t run (unless you get it wet), doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and coats my lashes well. That being said, the brush leaves my lashes clumpy and spikey and weird, and doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past. (my fave mascara so far is one by bare minerals that I got as a sample, but I can&#x27;t stand to drop $25 on a tube). I guess everyone&#x27;s lashes are different, but unless they change the brush I can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is truly a natural mascara in that it has a natural look as well as getting an EWG rating of 1 - the safest rating they give out.  If you want dramatic lashes, look elsewhere.  However, you can build up coats without the mascara getting clumpy.  They won&#x27;t be movie star dramatic, but they will be noticeably thicker.  This mascara does not bother my eyes the way other mascaras can and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I love Honeybee Gardens products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many organic Mascaras, because normal Mascaras make my eyes burn. This one definitely fits the bill. While other ones just fall off after a while, this Mascara lasts all day long. It doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to remove with just water and a face tissue. Not burning to the eyes. Great product.</li>
            <li> Mascara goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake. Good alternative to regular drug store toxin filled mascara. I will be buying more in the futures.</li>
            <li> I like the actual Mascara liquid but I don&#x27;t like the brush so much.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping for \\&quot;lash blast fusion\\&quot; type mascara that lengthens and thickens, this definitely isn&#x27;t it ... it just coats in black. But I was coming from that, and I&#x27;ve grown used to this as an acceptable (and healthier) alternative. It rates ok on [...] The first time I used it, my tear duck swelled up and was very painful ... but that resided and after a break I was able to use it again.</li>
