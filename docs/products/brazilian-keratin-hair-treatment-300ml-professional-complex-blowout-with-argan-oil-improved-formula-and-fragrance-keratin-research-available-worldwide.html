            <li>This works great.  </li>

            <li>After I wash it out, I have 3b/3c curls all over and win every battle with humidity -- even the humidity in the Dominican Republic in July couldn&#x27;t win against this product.</li>

            <li>The smell is great</li>

            <li>Make sure to read all the instructions and follow them to the letter for best results.</li>
            <li>The product by keratin research is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and is better than the treatment i received in the salon (coppola).</li>
            <li>Excellent, better than paying the hair salon $150</li>
            <li>i do not recommend someone without salon knowledge applying this product to your own hair!  </li>
            <li>and she said very good and pleased for that</li>
            <li>The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined.</li>
            <li>The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined.</li>
            <li>I kept the treatment in my hair for 3 days (just for good measure) and washed it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Even with the good reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect this treatment to work as well as the ones I&#x27;d gotten at the salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed 24 hours after with good results</li>
            <li>and my hair is in good shape</li>
            <li>and my hair is in good shape considering.    </li>
            <li>Just one bottle is good for me and my 2 daughters.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Great money saver and why not learn how to manage your own hair.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting it to be so good.  </li>
            <li>I loved taking a shower and putting a spritz of mousse in my hair and letting it air-dry.</li>
            <li>I wake up with beautiful beach waves that I can&#x27;t stop touching...</li>
            <li>Really good product I love it!</li>
            <li>It lasted way longer than 6 months, and i got so many compliments on how great my hair</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, please leave them on my YT Channel and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to answer them.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Honestly works just as good as when I had it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Love the product !</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>After treating my hair with this product I am glad I gave it a shot!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>, I wasn very happy with my first results, also every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with great results</li>
            <li>Was great fumes are just too strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Pleasant smell (better than salon version)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>May not be suitable for exceptionally unruly hair,but I like it.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing results</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazing if you follow directions</li>
            <li>This product is amazing though the effect doesn&#x27;t stay longer than two to three weeks.</li>
            <li>thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work, to be honest.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect it to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look nice either.</li>
            <li>I started doing my own brasilians and tried this formula and another coco one (forget the name).  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice and silky.</li>
            <li>but my hair has not frizzed up, dries well and straightens nicely.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re good with at home beauty stuff, want more manageable hair and don&#x27;t wanna break the bank, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is Brazilian or not, and I honestly don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Since I started doing my own hair it has grown from shoulder length to mid-back.</li>
            <li>and it is nice and straight love it!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I completed the application process for this treatment, I declared to my husband: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if this gives me the most wonderful hair ever</li>
            <li>I love, luv, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it wasThis keratin treatment that is being sold here, but I had a keratin treatment and it was simply amazing, you will love your hair.</li>
            <li>Hope this is useful for those looking for a great alternative that works and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg .</li>
            <li>I can easily get 2-3 treatments in this 1 bottle, and it was easier to do to myself than I thought!</li>
            <li>However, after about 24 hours my hair becomes very smooth, and it lasts like that until I wash it again.</li>
            <li>but it is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>, I think i have 3 more times to use up the bottle</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t oversaturate your hair</li>
            <li>so make sure you wear a mask or apply in an well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>Anything that promises to strengthen, give more shine, straighten or repair my damaged hair - I buy and try.</li>
            <li>My bangs still grow at a healthy rate and feel healthy too.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wear a face mask..</li>
            <li>Both times I have used it , my hair looks better then</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than what I thought.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It was shiny, healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li>and I was able to do it myself.</li>
            <li>my hair looks more controlled and healtier</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work</li>
            <li>My hair is medium length just touching the shoulder.</li>
            <li>A cheap plastic pair (like the kind that come in the boxed</li>
            <li>Go close to the roots without actually touching the roots.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a sodium-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>It ok, if work on hair</li>
            <li>I love this keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>this has been the closest in quality to my favorite one.</li>
            <li>however it also works significantly better.</li>
            <li>I just love this treatment and Keratin Research products.  </li>
            <li>I have also purchased a couple of at home treatments that had OK results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>more solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept the product on for four days instead of three without washing my hair since my hair is Curlier than most.</li>
            <li>and I tried getting texturizers and everything, but I think I finally found the best product for my hair.</li>
            <li>, I did not want to take out my curl at all, I just wanted to make it more manageable in the humidity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy curls! :-)</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, and followed the instructions I saw in many of them.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>fact, this treatment worked BETTER than the salon treatments I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it was okay, but</li>
            <li>My hair frizzes up again within a month, and while I like the price, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as healthy</li>
            <li>This product could be better</li>
            <li>I bought this :)</li>
            <li>I do advice that wearing gloves is a must, and make sure to clarify your hair before applying the treatment</li>
            <li>I have never made a better decision.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>This one is better</li>
            <li>The product is okay</li>
            <li>My hair has not felt this heathy in many years.</li>
            <li>I used it on myself with fantastic results!</li>
            <li>Why pay a hair-dresser : )</li>
            <li>Despite the fans, the fumes were overwhelming and my eyes did sting a bit.</li>
            <li>Of course, final results aren&#x27;t until you after you wash your hair -- and these results were absolutely incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been almost 3 weeks and my hair just feels like precious.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I now believe I am doing a better job than the salon since I know which areas need the most attention or heat.</li>
            <li>made the color look better.</li>
            <li>received many compliments.</li>
            <li>My wife love it, now she have the hair beatifull.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 WASH.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair but my hair this time was a bit more curly</li>
            <li>I love the results of this keratin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and this one is not the best.</li>
            <li>The results were better than I had dreamed.</li>
            <li>Since there is no &#x27;mixing&#x27; ingredients, like with hair color, I think it would be ok, but I&#x27;m still going to find out for sure.</li>
            <li>I used maybe a third of this bottle --- so I would say $20 for 3 times is an AWESOME deal!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>I researched many keratin treatments on the web and decided to try out the Brazilian.  </li>
            <li>I would say this treatment is not quite as good as from the Salon but almost and for the price difference it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is way better.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron is one that will heat up to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I first thought this was a good product because it took rid of all fizziness in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to try this based on the reviews!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love, however, the strong oder when blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have fine caucasian hair that is curly underneath and wavy on the top.  </li>
            <li>on here that wasn&#x27;t more than $25, and all the tools id need (hair clips, hair dye brushes, fine tooth comb, plastic gloves &amp; heat resistant comb thing for straightening).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I washed my hair around Day 3 or Day 4 with salon-quality products (be sure to avoid sulfates!), and I felt the silkiness in my hair right in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The product actually smells very good like coconuts.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny - and best of all straight!</li>
            <li>Protects the hair and makes it so much more manageable and smooth...</li>
            <li>year was the best that my hair has performed in the nearly three decades of living in this hot humid climate.</li>
            <li>so far my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Now I can enjoy the summer and go swimming more often without worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use sulfate &amp; sodium free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the non-formaldehyde and the kind with formaldehyde, and the kind with formaldehyde is the ONLY kind that works for me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why this product didn&#x27;t work good  </li>
            <li>This worked as good as the Rejuvenol product which costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>I applied this product as directed and my hair feels silky, smooth, healthy and super shiny!</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you that it is absolutely true!</li>
            <li>I love this Keratin treatment, it leaves your hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it gives my hair great shine and instant body</li>
            <li>Application is easy, it just takes patience.</li>
            <li>me)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to comb into hair</li>
            <li>importantly, know that this keratin treatment will leave your hair shiny, healthy and free of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was dull/frizzy/Curley and now it shines and is easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Curl level is about a 2b and without product it frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>Styling my hair was easy and a no hassle at all.</li>
            <li>easy breezy</li>
            <li>If you have strong unmanageable hair, I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>: the product owns a strong smell when dispensed but will not linger.</li>
            <li>But the results are amazing and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 3 days before washing it out, and it came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>all day $150 later beautiful hair</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure i followed the instructions very accurately</li>
            <li>( WARNING the fumes are very strong and u need to do this outside with a fan on or a room with good windows and the fan)</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and do yourself, saving the huge cost of salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m fine...)</li>
            <li>These worked fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for a year and a half every 2-3 months and my hair has never looked so flawless.</li>
            <li>chose this product because it had good reviews, and the at-home professional-quality keratin treatment I&#x27;d used in the past, QOD Happy Hair, was no longer available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I applied the product, coming it through with a fine tooth comb over and</li>
            <li>Each hair is fine in diameter, but I have a ton of it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, shoulder-length, bleached and dyed.</li>
            <li>and I was fine .</li>
            <li>I am a natural curly girly gurl (a mix of 3c/4a) and was great with maintaining my hair until I moved to super humid 365 a year</li>
            <li>Today was my first wash and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Remember on friends when Monica goes to the carribean and her hair is so huge she has to get it in braids?</li>
            <li>It was a nice straight and smooth hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>My hair is 100% fizzy free.</li>
            <li>At only $59 it was a great price cut.</li>
            <li>I use Lanza Keratin oil sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It will look fabulous when you&#x27;re done the treatment.</li>
            <li>its available at cvs for $20 and probably cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>Product if fabulous and the results of a Brazilian Blow-out are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Treatment Formaldehyde Free with Inverto 120ml</li>
            <li>and it was still smooth.  </li>
            <li>I poured some into a cheap, travel size 1 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li>and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with the ones that last 3 months or even longer.  </li>
            <li>I use this as instructed I wash my hair out with an herbal essence shampoo that was sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li>I did the treatment according to the directions and I have to say it did make my hair smooth</li>
            <li>I have nature light wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The t keratin is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair is now 100% frizz free and 80% curl free.</li>
            <li>It is shiny, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I loved the professional one, but this doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to that.  </li>
            <li>followed the instruction, easy to apply,  the smell is not bad as i imagine it would be, stings eyes a bit.</li>
            <li>My hair is smoother and it feels so much healthier !!!</li>
            <li>My hair was immediately super shiny and easy to blowdry.</li>
            <li>so instead of having a head full of fine flyaways blowing around all the time, my hair hung better---as if each strand was</li>
            <li>I waited 48 hours and washed with this L&#x27;oreal shampoo (the best SLS free shampoo you can get for less than $10!!)</li>
            <li>is ok my hair look pretty</li>
            <li>It was love at first use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see how it looks after a wash with 2 rounds of this in 2 months.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, very smooth, shiny and not greasy and zero frizz!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I can get close to 4  months out of it.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s straight and smooth and has life. :)</li>
            <li>and my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super smooth</li>
            <li>I had a side part and really ensured that I took the thinnest sections up top because my primary issue was fly-aways and frizz.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy any special clarifying shampoo - I used baking soda paste, then dish liquid - did it twice</li>
            <li>:) no other product worked for me until i discovered this :)</li>
            <li>Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later.</li>
            <li>I always had to either perm it and go full curly, or straighten it.</li>
            <li>I can even curl my hair (the kind of curls I want...not the ones I naturally have) without the frizz and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is straight and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I recently bought the Keratin Research Forte (which is good for 1a-3c curls).  </li>
            <li>For a full review on this product, please watch my video &amp;#34;Keratin Hair Treatment by Keratin Research, Inc. Review&amp;#34; on my YT Channel (StyleByZaza - no spaces).  </li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a fabulous day!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a cynic and have never had a hair product really change my hair for the better,  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product just be prepared for the smell.</li>
            <li>instead I bought the full kit (cleansing shampoo, treatment, shampoo &amp; conditioner for after) for about $95 and watched a million YouTube videos to prepare myself.</li>
            <li>However, I am thrilled so far.</li>
            <li>No bad smell or fumes and</li>
            <li>While my hair still hangs nicely if I blowdry and straighten right after my shower, you can still tell that the frizz and puff is coming back, mostly on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to live without it now!</li>
            <li>My hair is normally super curly and course.  </li>
            <li>And super shiny.</li>
            <li>However, I bought their shampoo and conditioner because I think each person just has to try different brands of home keratin to find the one or ones that work best for her individual hair.</li>
            <li>Im pregnant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had both Japanese thermal reconditioning and Brazilian blowout treatments done many times in the salon, but was looking for something more affordable that could be done at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my hair is super frizzy and course.</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail, fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>However, my hair grows quickly and I don&#x27;t have the money to keep it up.  </li>
            <li>I bought this while living in a super humid area.</li>
            <li>No smoothness, no straightening, it just looked super damaged.</li>
            <li>that is super curly/frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had been getting keratin treatments done for years by a friend of mine who would charge me $150 a treatment (in the DC area, that&#x27;s pretty cheap).  </li>
            <li>If you read the bottle it says you&#x27;ll wake up with beautiful hair everyday...</li>
            <li>It was not quite as effective as the salon treatments, but it certainly made my hair much more manageable without leaving it quite as flat.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not bad compared to what I experienced at the salon, my eyes did sting a little when doing the hair strands closer to them</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this product was great.</li>
            <li>Good for first timers, after trashy different story.</li>
            <li>Since getting a Keratin treatment my hair is so easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li>the first wash!  </li>
            <li>the first wash!  </li>
            <li>A million thanks to the makers of this product!!  </li>
            <li>My hair looked EXACTLY like when my original stylist used to do the treatments.  </li>
            <li>feel like I reacted more strongly to the fumes this second time</li>
            <li>this product is amazing i dont have to blow dry my hair for an hour to get it straight 10 minutes top</li>
            <li>At the salon I was able to achieve almost completely straight hair with one application and it&#x27;s still going strong three months later with sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also an important tip; while putting the product in hair and geting ready to flatiron</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you with words how fantastic this product really is...</li>
            <li>Amazing product for damaged hair especially if you have wavy/curly hair that you straighten.</li>
            <li>Its still smooth and easier to straighten, but i wish it would of stayed really straight after i washed it out.</li>
            <li>With the help of this product, my curls are CALM and WAVY</li>
            <li>However while i was straightening my hair the smell was gone, my hair did end up smooth  and straight.</li>
            <li>You could describe my hair texture as deep-fried straw with a fresh &amp;#34;I just stuck my finger in a light-socket&amp;#34; style.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It did take a lot of time &amp; elbow grease (4 hours) and also made my eyes and nose burn, but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Take a break for some fresh air too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the time and money though.</li>
            <li>but it is soft and flows now :).</li>
            <li>no coloring, rarely treated with heat)</li>
            <li>ironing is the most important part above and beyond.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it for me to save on the salon price.</li>
            <li>and it is SOOOOOOOO much cheaper than getting it done at the salon (as it should be done every 4-6mo minimum) and its pretty easy to do yourself.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own BKT for several years now, after trying out most of the major brands in salons.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH CHEAPER, and MORE EFFECTIVE at taming down frizz, and calming my curls than the Coppola Keratin Treatment</li>
            <li>and she wanted to do another one right before school started</li>
            <li>cannot stop touching my new soft shiny, freeze free hair.</li>
            <li>so I need to get one done in order to get a nice, smooth blow dry and ironed straight hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Japanese straightining system liscio &amp; loved that left my hair more straight</li>
            <li>It was dry in about 3-4 minutes my hair was almost frizz free!!</li>
            <li>and I feel so good about how I looked that now I&#x27;m on the other end of that first statement.</li>
            <li>The product does have a very strong odor that gave me a headache while I was waiting the 20 minutes and blow drying/ flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your new hair.</li>
            <li>As the keratin treatment i used to use is no longer available for purchase, ive been looking for years for a new one.</li>
            <li>My eyes were pouring like I had just watched Titanic for the first time at the right time of the month.  </li>
            <li>You will notice a huge huge different .</li>
            <li>You can use any sodium free shampoo but you must use sodium free if you want the product to last.</li>
            <li>hmm i do not even hav that much curly hair, it just kept my hair straight and smooth for a day.</li>
            <li>but this seemed extremely mild and worked very well.  </li>
            <li>and my ends are still very straight.</li>
            <li>Hair was very straight</li>
            <li>The video provides exact instructions, and I followed each step.  </li>
            <li>I waited exactly 24 hours before washing it out.</li>
            <li>The first photo is my hair after blow drying with no product.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my bangs, but it works better than whatever they used when I got it in a salon.</li>
            <li>so I could only do the top portion of my hair to keep some volume.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $300 to experiment.</li>
            <li>Sure enough it worked as well!</li>
            <li>This product is the first thing that has ever worked on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  </li>
            <li>My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use it in my hair 4 times already and always come back for more.</li>
            <li>The first time I used Brazilian Keratin Treatment</li>
            <li>I did it exactly how the directions said.</li>
            <li>(Yes, you will now have the exact look you are trying to avoid...)</li>
            <li>The results are the exact to when I&#x27;ve had it done in the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like a teenager on a first date...</li>
            <li>Ps make sure you blow our your hair outside of your house</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thick, wavy/curly hair, but not in a way that was attractive.</li>
            <li>My hair would turn to frizz at the first sign of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>me start out by saying that if you do this treatment properly, you will have fantastic results!</li>
            <li>make sure you have the proper tools you need.</li>
            <li>Make sure you blowdry as smoothly as possible.</li>
            <li>make sure your iron is hot enough.</li>
            <li>i used about 4 ounces on my hair so i will have more than enough for another treatment.</li>
            <li>I waited over 24 hours before washing the first time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Also had a funny smell, but that went away as soon as I washed it out</li>
            <li>I wonder how long this will last, but Im really  happy with the results</li>
            <li>And, if there’s a product I’m interested in, I will put it to the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>and I sweat A LOT!  ;)</li>
            <li>It does contain an aldehyde, but so does many of the household  products we use daily.</li>
            <li>Until now my brand of choice has been Coppola, but I found myself out of product and without enough time to order more and wait three days for it to cure.</li>
            <li>This is a worthwhile product if you are OK with it only lasting 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>very helpful!</li>
            <li>This stuff straightened my hair for exactly ONE WASH.  </li>
            <li>The results are even better after the second treatment.  </li>
            <li>I waited 4 weeks after my first treatment to review.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty hot iron, about 420-430 degrees, so I wore a glove on the hand that was holding the hair.  </li>
            <li>My biggest praise is how SOFT and practically frizz free my hair is.  </li>
            <li>The fumes are unbearable at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li>and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll just have to see after the first wash</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li>exactly however I did not wash for 2 1/2 days.</li>
            <li>I wore a heat resistant glove I had received with a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This is the first at home Keratin treatment I&#x27;ve purchase</li>
            <li>The second time I did a better job at getting all my roots straightened.</li>
            <li>After Treatment Shampoo to wash your hair with or you will wash the treatment out with the first wash.</li>
            <li>It looks great, way better than it usually does after I blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair afterwards is much less curly and very healthy.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair twice, blow dried it, applied the product as instructed (making sure to use a fine tooth comb to get out all excess product), let it sit for 20 minutes, then straightened it with 7-10 passes for each section.  </li>
            <li>Flat Iron and I love it.</li>
            <li>I had never been a flat iron user and was able to manage getting this treatment done on myself.</li>
            <li>I am one week post treatment and have straight, soft, smooth hair even after washing three times and swimming once.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it is better than the salon because they skimp on the product at the salon to save money and don&#x27;t spend as much time sealing it in.</li>
            <li>and i left it in for two days just to be sure it stays straight, but it didnt.</li>
            <li>But so far, the results are way better then any I&#x27;ve had done professionally.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff will only buy this brand for now on package came faster than expected this my second time purchasing this item so far so good!</li>
            <li>until that waxy feeling is gone and when ur hair feels super duper soft ur all set!</li>
            <li>Now I can style my hair straight and it&#x27;ll stay that way no matter how humid and hot the day may be.</li>
            <li>My hair used to have a beautiful curl, but after 2 babies and hormone changes its become a coarse, brittle frizzy mess that would start to frizz up as soon as I stepped out into any sort of humidity.</li>
            <li>advice for someone who wants to try this product for the first time would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took me longer to straightened about 30 mins, it wasn&#x27;t as straight as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For ventilation, I had a high-speed fan sucking air out the bathroom window, plus a large fan on high blowing fresh air onto me as I worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may wait an extra month in between just because it seemed so strong.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the strong smell when applying the product..</li>
            <li>Only issue, is that it is so strong that I felt I was burning my eyes.</li>
            <li>Putting it on was pure torture.</li>
            <li>But I have been using a large barrel curling iron to add some body waves to it before work</li>
            <li>Large bottle</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t really become any more manageable to blow dry or straighten either.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to follow directions exactly on my daughter and so far 3 months later her hair is still straight.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was a little nervous to try it after I received it and saw there were some misspelling in the directions</li>
            <li>that flat irons easily</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who wants a keratin treatment, and is willing to go through the time consuming process of doing it while saving yourself hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to deal with</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t straighten very well</li>
            <li>My bangs will be perfectly straight for about a month or two.</li>
            <li>I am over two months in and my hair is still straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>The real test...</li>
            <li>I did not see a purpose in taking a picture after applying the product and straightening because, as I said, of course it&#x27;s straight after I &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it.ppy with it.  </li>
            <li>The real test...</li>
            <li>I did not see a purpose in taking a picture after applying the product and straightening because, as I said, of course it&#x27;s straight after I &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li>Your hair will turn out straight once done.</li>
            <li>My hair staid straight.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>I color my hair very</li>
            <li>First color your hair as you normally would.</li>
            <li>Its straight</li>
            <li>So much faster.</li>
            <li>It really is so manageable now.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the hair..</li>
            <li>It really eliminated frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very curly/coarse/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It stays straight.</li>
            <li>My hair stays smooth and shiny, and I get compliments daily.</li>
            <li>, my hair curls were much looser....</li>
            <li>It performs beautifully straight from application to finish.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost too straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier if you can convince a friend to do your hair....</li>
            <li>it really is the product burning off.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still straight after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Before the treatment it took forever to get it straight</li>
            <li>and she would often still have some places that didn&#x27;t look totally straight.  </li>
            <li>This treatment did NOT make my hair pin straight, but maybe its my cut, I have ends that just want to flip up</li>
            <li>and my hair is MUCH straighter than (a)</li>
            <li>This really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my hair this straight without come parts looking fried before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So you really need to be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It did turn out really straight after the process</li>
            <li>and I have really notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I use the keratin treatment on all my hair and it makes it very sleek and manageable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make it perfectly straight</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li>As much hair as used to get cleaning my hairbrush out after a month or two</li>
            <li>You really need to have a fan pointed at your face to keep your eyes from stinging...</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and it turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I would assume it&#x27;s somewhere between 5-15% just based on the degree to which it irritated my throat/eyes (about as much as the treatment I used to get)</li>
            <li>I do this treatment every 3 months and helps my hair stay straight.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am currently using the sulfate free Ion shampoo from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my corse hair, it doesn&#x27;t make it straight by any stretch of the immagination</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair...</li>
            <li>One piece of advice, get a face mask because the smell really got to me.</li>
            <li>If I felt like using the straight iron-- running it through my hair for five or six minutes</li>
            <li>This product will not make your hair 100% straight.</li>
            <li>So have a reasonable expectation.</li>
            <li>I put this in before our very rainy disney vacation and i had no, zero, none, nothing, not a one piece of frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I did this treatment 3 months ago and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged with repeated coloring, bleaching, and overusing hair iron.</li>
            <li>I think I must have put a bit too much on hair because it felt gummy after drying and ironing.  </li>
            <li>but the cost would be too much at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really helps or not</li>
            <li>It finally occurred to me that I could do my own Brazilian blow-out, and this product lasts the same as if I had gone to the salon.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s only been a couple of days (don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the long run), um very pleased.</li>
            <li>And I live in a hot humid area of the United States.</li>
            <li>It was silky, soft, and I could run my fingers right through it.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair straight and soft, could just get up, comb through, and it was very silky and amazing, I would roll the window down on the car and look in the mirror and just let my hair blow and smile, because my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>If your hair is as curly as mine, don&#x27;t expect your hair to be stick straight all throughout from this product or any other keratin treatment, but it will be much more manageable from doing this.</li>
            <li>I love this brand as it does not have that funky smell like the other keratin treatments and it works</li>
            <li>I use argan oil on the ends; however, since incorporating this particular product, I don&#x27;t need as much argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Without salon expertise, this makes my hair shiny and soft and more manageable but not especially straight.</li>
            <li>To be honest, they&#x27;re a little TOO relaxed for my liking, so I advise you not to underestimate the strength of the treatment!</li>
            <li>She is so much happier with her hair now and the daily complaining about how much she hates her curly hair has finally stopped! :)</li>
            <li>It was such a long a grueling process with my type of hair, and in pretty sure I oversaturated it with the product, but after 4 hours my hair was straight as a board.</li>
            <li>When she moved away, I went to another stylist who was offering a similar special, and her treatment did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>So, assuming this stuff would be less potent than the salon treatment, I overcompensated by leaving it on for 48, rather than 24 hours (don&#x27;t worry, the directions specifically say people with very curly hair could should try this).</li>
            <li>I have somewhat fine yet curly/frizzy hair, that&#x27;s dry but not damaged (</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m all: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if it takes me three hours to finish this smoothing treatment; I&#x27;m ordering it NOW!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s available (hopefully for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Then I left it in my hair for 3 full days.</li>
            <li>By then my hair is a little crunchier and my lungs are sufficiently filled with the essence of freshly smoked anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li>New idea!</li>
            <li>It was more liquid than a previous one I used that was thicker</li>
            <li>My frizzy hair that used to take forever to dry is now smooth and dries in no time.</li>
            <li>I think having my hair more manageable (after the Keratin) has reduced the breakage since it tangles less</li>
            <li>To start, make sure you allow yourself enough time to do the treatment properly.</li>
            <li>It took about 20-25 minutes to get my whole head soaked, I waited a bit and blow dried, then waitied a bit more before I ironed.  </li>
            <li>so I looked it up on Amazon and decided to the main ingredients</li>
            <li>My main issue is how puffy my hair gets anytime it air dries.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>Each time I loved the results, although I felt that my hair was a little flat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this keratin treatment..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is especially alarming because I had excellent ventilation going during the treatment and even did it in two parts--half my hair one day and half the next.</li>
            <li>My curly, frizzy, dry hair is straight, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>I took 3 more minutes to quickly blow it out with a round brush and a tiny bit of anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li>I took 3 more minutes to quickly blow it out with a round brush and a tiny bit of anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li>Clipped my hair up and started applying at the back of my head using the flat applicator brush and combing through to make sure I had an even consistency.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews, but this product deserves every star!</li>
            <li>However, when I want to get fancy shmancy it takes a little more work.  </li>
            <li>This will help tremendously when you start flat ironing.</li>
            <li>hard to do it correctly on your own head.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick run through with the flat iron to touch up and give it the sleek look.</li>
            <li>But with this treatment, my hair is silky soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product before, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results I got from this product that it seemed wrong not to share.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, silky and straight.</li>
            <li>Professional Complex Bottle Free Shipping Available Worldwide]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brazilian blowouts are so expensive, so I was really happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely straighten, but makes  hair very silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>my hair is naturally curly and it is straight now.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product I just must.</li>
            <li>So in a few months when I need a touch up its free!</li>
            <li>I rinsed and styled normally this morning</li>
            <li>Will buy it again but the bottle should last a long time :)</li>
            <li>I love it cuz it cuts the time I wait for her to prep in half!</li>
            <li>Not only this, but if you have very curly/wavy hair like me that can get very kinky and annoying to manage, this treatment will relax your curls a good amount while keeping it looking slightly curly and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Use your round brushes and make sure the top is dried to the side and style you want because it will stay that way!</li>
            <li>And the Keratin treatment cost $300 in a salon, so this is well worth it if you are going to be doing all the blow drying and flat ironing yourself.</li>
            <li>I need to buy googles because when I flat iron while putting in the treatment my eyes water but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I truly cant live without this.</li>
            <li>I also live in south florida.</li>
            <li>I also bought a new straightener (one that went up to 450 degrees)</li>
            <li>I paid a lot for a professional keratin and this does the same for a lot less in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li>Only thing is GK only lasted me a month using the sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t hold up like those treatments did I&#x27;ll come back and update, but I am very very optimistic about this treatment.  </li>
            <li>but I totally over did it the first time.</li>
            <li>EXACT SAME!!</li>
            <li>After washing, drying, applying, 20 minutes of waiting, drying and flat ironing ad nauseum, it finally looked smooth but with the teensiest amount of poof on the ends.</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller bottles to try first.</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle in March 2013; my second in November.</li>
            <li>So the bottom line is, you&#x27;ll have to weight the benefits of having smooth hair vs dark hair.</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY the same stuff that has been used in my salon....</li>
            <li>the smell is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>this is a long process (well worth it though).  </li>
            <li>She still runs a flat iron over it if she wants it to be really straight</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions closely, fought the fumes with multiple fans (and eventually some goggles-the eye sting is real!), and even waited beyond the recommended waiting period to wash out my hair with sulfate/sodium-free shampoo and conditioner (per the bottle&#x27;s recommendation for curly/resistant hair).</li>
            <li>, I would only give this product a 3 start because of the fumes and hair lost I&#x27;ve experienced using it, I will see if it last at least 3-5 months</li>
            <li>and I only used 1/2 the bottle the first time.</li>
            <li>I do possess the knowledge to apply the product as well as researching online and watching videos to make sure it was similar to other keratin treatments i&#x27;d assisted with</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cheaper option than the salon, just know that your hair may not come out as straight</li>
            <li>I stuck my head out of the bathroom window while a fan blew directly at me causing my newly drenched locks to splatter on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>When flat ironing make sure that you take very small sections of hair as this will ensure amazing results, make sure that sections are not more than a quarter inch thick and Definately make sure that they are smaller than the width of your flat iron.</li>
            <li>and my hair seems to stay smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen similar shedding when doing deep conditioning treatments pack full of it too.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and so my stylist warned me several times that the salon treatment would only eliminate frizz, but not relax my curls very much.</li>
            <li>(it was a huge frizzy mess)</li>
            <li>My hair looks just like it would after I burn it to a crisp with the flat</li>
            <li>My hair looks just like it would after I burn it to a crisp with the flat</li>
            <li>Expect to spend at least 3 hours in a well ventilated area, because although this stuff smells fine (coconutty!)</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers about the fumes- they were worse than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, so make sure you have good ventilation and take breaks if you need to.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure how much more I&#x27;ll be able to loose before other people start to notice.</li>
            <li>I did put a fan in the window to suck air out of the room, and I had another fan blowing on our faces while she was using the flat iron because that is pretty much the only time there are any fumes.  </li>
            <li>I bought it on eBay because it was a little bit cheaper and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Blow drying was quick, the drying time was probably half of what it normally is</li>
            <li>, that being said, it&#x27;s a little more than three months later</li>
            <li>Elegant style for my life as a hard working RN.</li>
            <li>Apart from the fact that it only lasted a month, the other main drawback is the fact that it SIGNIFICANTLY lightens your hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was a great solution for my crazy hair and frizz</li>
            <li>I really saw no difference in my hair, I have had this treatment professionally done and have done it numerous times at home.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it actually worked great.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal, the same as my hairdresser was using and charging me a fortune for.  </li>
            <li>I had the treatment professionally at a salon</li>
            <li>Straightening my hair takes nearly 1 hour to get the puff out.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny a extremely soft.</li>
            <li>After applying the treatment my hair is extremely soft my curls are almost gone</li>
            <li>did I say SOFT???</li>
            <li>I left it on 2 days as my hair is very fizzy.</li>
            <li>The day that I do complete the treatment and style my hair - I see no change.</li>
            <li>I had a professional coppolla keratin treatment in a salon ($150), and this home treatment lasts WAY longer.</li>
            <li>And my hair is bouncy and soft...</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft and shiny afteeeerwards.</li>
            <li>; My hair is real curly and coarse</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t do it completely, your hair will be sticky until you wash it</li>
            <li>I waited about 30 hours before washing again, and WOW I was blown away....</li>
            <li>So when I realized I could buy professional grade keratin treatment for $60 off Amazon</li>
            <li>it is naturally</li>
            <li>Better than salon quality (at least for</li>
            <li>But expect to see loss of curl when you let the treatment wash out of your hair completely if you have been using it like I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to be natural at the moment</li>
            <li>I have medium length naturally curly hair and frizzy by nature.</li>
            <li>My hair came out so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>From my roots I have about 4 inches of natural hair</li>
            <li>head on to blow the fumes away and one to direct fumes to the window.  </li>
            <li>I would rather have my natural hair than stringy greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li>Results only lasted about 3 weeks in my hair and it didn&#x27;t get my hair 100% straight.</li>
            <li>Just make sure NOT to wash the product out of your hair for at least 72 hours.</li>
            <li>My hair was ready for a treatment mid December</li>
            <li>My hair was kind of wavy until I had kids, and then it turned weird, with curl at the nape of my neck, straight but FRIZZY.</li>
            <li>I took about 2 1/2 hours to do the entire process but again her hair is super long.  </li>
            <li>Of course she was right; the first salon treatments I had made my hair slightly less curly (i.e. very wavy), but not straight by any means.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product, the way it burned my eyes a little, reminded me of the original Brazilian Blowout product.</li>
            <li>The softness and shine only lasts for about 30 days (wash my hair every other day to every 3 days with sulfate free products).</li>
            <li>I have VERY frizzy, curly, unmanageable hair and nothing works for me besides flat ironing of course.</li>
            <li>I suggest for very curly hair like mine, to apply flat iron at 450 and atleast 7 passes and in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>I have been getting the original Brazillian Blowout every four months for a few years now.</li>
            <li>First, about me:  I&#x27;m a 50yr old white woman of German descent.  </li>
            <li>I usually do the chi transformation system and it does much better with it, of the only reason why i bought this keratin</li>
            <li>Or blow dry it with my fingers and a quick once over with a flat iron if we were going out.</li>
            <li>After treatment it is like a soft curtain of hair straight down my back; exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>, I let it dry naturally to see the real results.</li>
            <li>( my hair is long and very frizzy/wavy).</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money for my Keratin at the Salon and was getting so hopeless with my hair until I tried this one!</li>
            <li>After a couple of shampoos, the coarse, thick coating went away and my hair was left nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will be the most unsightly frizzy, dry mess you have ever seen!</li>
            <li>I used a pair of heavy cotton gardening gloves, the kind that have little grippers on the palm area.</li>
            <li>While the straightness of my hair (I have very coarse, frizzy, curly, unruly hair as I am 75% Italian, 25% German) lasted about three weeks before my curls began to creep back into play, the frizz has been kept at bay for a full three months.</li>
            <li>Recently I was looking into a new salon to try it again</li>
            <li>I only do the Keratin on my roots or new growth</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really try to style here, just wanted to get it dry, but do brush through so you can run a comb through while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done all together at least 8 keratin treatments with the last bottle I love that I can do a treatment every 4-6 months and not have to worry about my curls being overly preocess with keratin</li>
            <li>I did that on my back porch as well, but still didn&#x27;t get much relief from the fumes even in the open outdoors.  </li>
            <li>I have super heavy color in my hair and when I touch up my roots, the keratin treatment does fade.  </li>
            <li>No Fluff!  </li>
            <li>No Fluff!  </li>
            <li>(I ended up pouring a little bit back into the original container when I was done)</li>
            <li>At first I was repeating use every other month feeling that my hair would be curly again.</li>
            <li>and the effects are still completely obvious, just a few more curls came back, so I&#x27;ve just now done my second one.</li>
            <li>I just got it back to normal with a deep conditioning treatment made for post-keratin treatments (my normal deep conditioners weren&#x27;t fixing the damage).</li>
            <li>I am curious why there are so many positive comments, I have did it twice, and my hair going to worse.</li>
            <li>The seller tells you that the product works &amp;#34;express&amp;#34; but it is not true, since you need to to exactly the same than other products (and the results remain in your hair about 2 or 3 weeks if you are lucky).</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy and smooth and takes so much less time to dry and style.  </li>
            <li>I live in New York City, and even with a deep discount I was paying $150+ for a single Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>one started out okay, but only lasted about 3 weeks and was not nearly as good as the salon, even when I held off washing for 3 days.</li>
            <li>It washes out gradually giving me my natural curl pattern back.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t use any product and my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to get this Brazilian treatment after having my hair professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and your money paying almost $60 for this product if you can buy three of them with the same results.</li>
            <li>Now she can get it to look perfectly straight with minimal effort and the straightness lasts.  </li>
            <li>Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>and we were sitting near the open door.</li>
            <li>and I barely had to do any touchups with my straightener.</li>
            <li>I did the treatment with the window open and two fans, one pointing directly at me</li>
            <li>It has only been a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li>Took about 2 total hours , but I left it in a while -- normally takes 4hours when I go  to the salon .  </li>
            <li>So this product seems to work out thus far definetly left my hair much smother, straighter &amp; easier to manage since my hair is very thick &amp; course, super frizzy since it was fired by a perm.</li>
            <li>Take the product and pour about three ounces (for just past shoulder lengh hair) into a container, Then  start by taking very very small sections of hair and then wearing gloves dip three fingers in the product and work it into hair from top to bottom, now use the small thoothed comb and comb the section a few times making sure it&#x27;s saturated but almost no product it&#x27;s coming out infront of the comb, if more than half a penny size it&#x27;s coming out you are applying too much product, do this with the whole head and then blow dry hair using a brush to dry it</li>
            <li>I will say there is a ingredient in this treatment that really burns my eyes during the initial application, but goes away once I dry my hair.</li>
            <li>The pictures are only before treatment, after washing and blow-drying, and after adding a bit of serum and a round brush quick blow-out.</li>
            <li>The pictures are only before treatment, after washing and blow-drying, and after adding a bit of serum and a round brush quick blow-out.</li>
            <li>it made my thick, curly, coarse hair satiny and so easy to blow-dry.  </li>
            <li>First of all I was expecting to wait about a week or week and a half for the product to arrive but it arrived in literally 2 days...</li>
            <li>have waist length hair, so I used half the bottle the first time---and its probably time to do another treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product makes exactly the same than other cheaper products.</li>
            <li>It seemed strange to apply, blow-dry, iron it in w a flat iron, THEN wash again and apply hair mask/leaving it in for 15 minutes, THEN rinse and blow-dry AGAIN, but it really really is shiny, silky, manageable.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the right tools and don&#x27;t be afraid that you are burning your hair when you see the steam come off the flat iron.....</li>
            <li>and it was so soft and straight just a little frizzy</li>
            <li>So you really need to be careful!    </li>
            <li>I only left it on for two days ( I have very curly and dry hair).</li>
            <li>I blow dried and the hair was so straight already and nowhere near the puff ball</li>
            <li>I keep using this product and cut the Japanese treated hair as it goes and will transition back to natural.</li>
            <li>theres a certain product ingredient in this one and in the good one i used in the past that makes it smell significantly worse than other treatments</li>
            <li>The second time I used it I did a quick job not sure how it was going to turn out.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have long, semi-wavy, healthy Asian hair, with a small amount of frizz that pops up if I don&#x27;t dry and straighten my hair every day.  </li>
            <li>, I had developed some techniques to keep the smoke away from my face while flat ironing (hold the straightener high above the head rather than on the side as usual), but it may have been too late as I had already gotten a couple of potent hits of smoke to the eyes that had made them sting and water like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>4- 6 weeks as I&#x27;m going grey early.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER it adds shine and really cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li>I bought this treatment due to high reviews.</li>
            <li>not super straight like when I had the GK treatment done.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry and frizzy and now became so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it took lmaybe 20 minutes to dry and straighten</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have the exact same effect at home as at the salon, (it lasts about 4 weeks at the longest, as opposed to a few months at the salon)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the professional treatment done in the past and started to get annoyed by them not really doing a good job.</li>
            <li>the past month, I&#x27;ve probably washed my hair every other day--alternating with sulfate free shampoo, and cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>No flat iron was necessary.</li>
            <li>No flat iron was necessary.</li>
            <li>I live in the southeast where it gets extremely humid in the warmer months.</li>
            <li>Sectioning off my hair, I started at the nape and got a very small section at a time, sprayed a few squirts on there, and combed through with a very fine tooth comb.</li>

            <li> Make sure to read all the instructions and follow them to the letter for best results.</li>
            <li> The product by keratin research is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and is better than the treatment i received in the salon (coppola).</li>
            <li> Excellent, better than paying the hair salon $150</li>
            <li> i do not recommend someone without salon knowledge applying this product to your own hair!  </li>
            <li> and she said very good and pleased for that</li>
            <li> The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined.</li>
            <li> The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined.</li>
            <li> I kept the treatment in my hair for 3 days (just for good measure) and washed it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Even with the good reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect this treatment to work as well as the ones I&#x27;d gotten at the salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed 24 hours after with good results</li>
            <li> and my hair is in good shape</li>
            <li> and my hair is in good shape considering.    </li>
            <li> Just one bottle is good for me and my 2 daughters.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Great money saver and why not learn how to manage your own hair.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be so good.  </li>
            <li> I loved taking a shower and putting a spritz of mousse in my hair and letting it air-dry.</li>
            <li> I wake up with beautiful beach waves that I can&#x27;t stop touching...</li>
            <li> Really good product I love it!</li>

            <li> If you have any questions, please leave them on my YT Channel and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to answer them.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly works just as good as when I had it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> Love the product !</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> After treating my hair with this product I am glad I gave it a shot!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> , I wasn very happy with my first results, also every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with great results</li>
            <li> Was great fumes are just too strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Pleasant smell (better than salon version)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> May not be suitable for exceptionally unruly hair,but I like it.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing results</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazing if you follow directions</li>
            <li> This product is amazing though the effect doesn&#x27;t stay longer than two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work, to be honest.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect it to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look nice either.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own brasilians and tried this formula and another coco one (forget the name).  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice and silky.</li>
            <li> but my hair has not frizzed up, dries well and straightens nicely.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re good with at home beauty stuff, want more manageable hair and don&#x27;t wanna break the bank, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is Brazilian or not, and I honestly don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Since I started doing my own hair it has grown from shoulder length to mid-back.</li>
            <li> and it is nice and straight love it!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I completed the application process for this treatment, I declared to my husband: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if this gives me the most wonderful hair ever</li>
            <li> I love, luv, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it wasThis keratin treatment that is being sold here, but I had a keratin treatment and it was simply amazing, you will love your hair.</li>
            <li> Hope this is useful for those looking for a great alternative that works and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg .</li>
            <li> I can easily get 2-3 treatments in this 1 bottle, and it was easier to do to myself than I thought!</li>
            <li> However, after about 24 hours my hair becomes very smooth, and it lasts like that until I wash it again.</li>
            <li> but it is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> , I think i have 3 more times to use up the bottle</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t oversaturate your hair</li>
            <li> so make sure you wear a mask or apply in an well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Anything that promises to strengthen, give more shine, straighten or repair my damaged hair - I buy and try.</li>
            <li> My bangs still grow at a healthy rate and feel healthy too.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wear a face mask..</li>
            <li> Both times I have used it , my hair looks better then</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than what I thought.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It was shiny, healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li> and I was able to do it myself.</li>
            <li> my hair looks more controlled and healtier</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length just touching the shoulder.</li>
            <li> A cheap plastic pair (like the kind that come in the boxed</li>
            <li> Go close to the roots without actually touching the roots.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a sodium-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> It ok, if work on hair</li>
            <li> I love this keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> this has been the closest in quality to my favorite one.</li>
            <li> however it also works significantly better.</li>
            <li> I just love this treatment and Keratin Research products.  </li>
            <li> I have also purchased a couple of at home treatments that had OK results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> more solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept the product on for four days instead of three without washing my hair since my hair is Curlier than most.</li>
            <li> and I tried getting texturizers and everything, but I think I finally found the best product for my hair.</li>
            <li> , I did not want to take out my curl at all, I just wanted to make it more manageable in the humidity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy curls! :-)</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and followed the instructions I saw in many of them.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> fact, this treatment worked BETTER than the salon treatments I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it was okay, but</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes up again within a month, and while I like the price, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as healthy</li>
            <li> This product could be better</li>
            <li> I bought this :)</li>
            <li> I do advice that wearing gloves is a must, and make sure to clarify your hair before applying the treatment</li>
            <li> I have never made a better decision.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it.  </li>
            <li> This one is better</li>
            <li> The product is okay</li>
            <li> My hair has not felt this heathy in many years.</li>
            <li> I used it on myself with fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Why pay a hair-dresser : )</li>
            <li> Despite the fans, the fumes were overwhelming and my eyes did sting a bit.</li>
            <li> Of course, final results aren&#x27;t until you after you wash your hair -- and these results were absolutely incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been almost 3 weeks and my hair just feels like precious.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I now believe I am doing a better job than the salon since I know which areas need the most attention or heat.</li>
            <li> made the color look better.</li>
            <li> received many compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife love it, now she have the hair beatifull.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 WASH.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair but my hair this time was a bit more curly</li>
            <li> I love the results of this keratin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and this one is not the best.</li>
            <li> The results were better than I had dreamed.</li>
            <li> Since there is no &#x27;mixing&#x27; ingredients, like with hair color, I think it would be ok, but I&#x27;m still going to find out for sure.</li>
            <li> I used maybe a third of this bottle --- so I would say $20 for 3 times is an AWESOME deal!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> I researched many keratin treatments on the web and decided to try out the Brazilian.  </li>
            <li> I would say this treatment is not quite as good as from the Salon but almost and for the price difference it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is way better.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron is one that will heat up to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I first thought this was a good product because it took rid of all fizziness in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to try this based on the reviews!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love, however, the strong oder when blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have fine caucasian hair that is curly underneath and wavy on the top.  </li>
            <li> on here that wasn&#x27;t more than $25, and all the tools id need (hair clips, hair dye brushes, fine tooth comb, plastic gloves &amp; heat resistant comb thing for straightening).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I washed my hair around Day 3 or Day 4 with salon-quality products (be sure to avoid sulfates!), and I felt the silkiness in my hair right in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The product actually smells very good like coconuts.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny - and best of all straight!</li>
            <li> Protects the hair and makes it so much more manageable and smooth...</li>
            <li> year was the best that my hair has performed in the nearly three decades of living in this hot humid climate.</li>
            <li> so far my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Now I can enjoy the summer and go swimming more often without worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use sulfate &amp; sodium free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the non-formaldehyde and the kind with formaldehyde, and the kind with formaldehyde is the ONLY kind that works for me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why this product didn&#x27;t work good  </li>
            <li> This worked as good as the Rejuvenol product which costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> I applied this product as directed and my hair feels silky, smooth, healthy and super shiny!</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you that it is absolutely true!</li>
            <li> I love this Keratin treatment, it leaves your hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it gives my hair great shine and instant body</li>
            <li> Application is easy, it just takes patience.</li>
            <li> me)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to comb into hair</li>
            <li> importantly, know that this keratin treatment will leave your hair shiny, healthy and free of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was dull/frizzy/Curley and now it shines and is easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Curl level is about a 2b and without product it frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> Styling my hair was easy and a no hassle at all.</li>
            <li> easy breezy</li>
            <li> If you have strong unmanageable hair, I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> : the product owns a strong smell when dispensed but will not linger.</li>
            <li> But the results are amazing and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 3 days before washing it out, and it came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> all day $150 later beautiful hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure i followed the instructions very accurately</li>
            <li> ( WARNING the fumes are very strong and u need to do this outside with a fan on or a room with good windows and the fan)</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and do yourself, saving the huge cost of salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m fine...)</li>
            <li> These worked fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for a year and a half every 2-3 months and my hair has never looked so flawless.</li>
            <li> chose this product because it had good reviews, and the at-home professional-quality keratin treatment I&#x27;d used in the past, QOD Happy Hair, was no longer available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I applied the product, coming it through with a fine tooth comb over and</li>
            <li> Each hair is fine in diameter, but I have a ton of it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, shoulder-length, bleached and dyed.</li>
            <li> and I was fine .</li>
            <li> I am a natural curly girly gurl (a mix of 3c/4a) and was great with maintaining my hair until I moved to super humid 365 a year</li>
            <li> Today was my first wash and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Remember on friends when Monica goes to the carribean and her hair is so huge she has to get it in braids?</li>
            <li> It was a nice straight and smooth hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> My hair is 100% fizzy free.</li>
            <li> At only $59 it was a great price cut.</li>
            <li> I use Lanza Keratin oil sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It will look fabulous when you&#x27;re done the treatment.</li>
            <li> its available at cvs for $20 and probably cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> Product if fabulous and the results of a Brazilian Blow-out are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Treatment Formaldehyde Free with Inverto 120ml</li>
            <li> and it was still smooth.  </li>
            <li> I poured some into a cheap, travel size 1 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li> and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with the ones that last 3 months or even longer.  </li>
            <li> I use this as instructed I wash my hair out with an herbal essence shampoo that was sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I did the treatment according to the directions and I have to say it did make my hair smooth</li>
            <li> I have nature light wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The t keratin is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hair is now 100% frizz free and 80% curl free.</li>
            <li> It is shiny, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I loved the professional one, but this doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to that.  </li>
            <li> followed the instruction, easy to apply,  the smell is not bad as i imagine it would be, stings eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother and it feels so much healthier !!!</li>
            <li> My hair was immediately super shiny and easy to blowdry.</li>
            <li> so instead of having a head full of fine flyaways blowing around all the time, my hair hung better---as if each strand was</li>
            <li> I waited 48 hours and washed with this L&#x27;oreal shampoo (the best SLS free shampoo you can get for less than $10!!)</li>
            <li> is ok my hair look pretty</li>
            <li> It was love at first use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to see how it looks after a wash with 2 rounds of this in 2 months.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, very smooth, shiny and not greasy and zero frizz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I can get close to 4  months out of it.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s straight and smooth and has life. :)</li>
            <li> and my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super smooth</li>
            <li> I had a side part and really ensured that I took the thinnest sections up top because my primary issue was fly-aways and frizz.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy any special clarifying shampoo - I used baking soda paste, then dish liquid - did it twice</li>
            <li> :) no other product worked for me until i discovered this :)</li>
            <li> Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later.</li>
            <li> I always had to either perm it and go full curly, or straighten it.</li>
            <li> I can even curl my hair (the kind of curls I want...not the ones I naturally have) without the frizz and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is straight and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I recently bought the Keratin Research Forte (which is good for 1a-3c curls).  </li>
            <li> For a full review on this product, please watch my video &amp;#34;Keratin Hair Treatment by Keratin Research, Inc. Review&amp;#34; on my YT Channel (StyleByZaza - no spaces).  </li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a fabulous day!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a cynic and have never had a hair product really change my hair for the better,  </li>
            <li> Overall, good product just be prepared for the smell.</li>
            <li> instead I bought the full kit (cleansing shampoo, treatment, shampoo &amp; conditioner for after) for about $95 and watched a million YouTube videos to prepare myself.</li>
            <li> However, I am thrilled so far.</li>
            <li> No bad smell or fumes and</li>
            <li> While my hair still hangs nicely if I blowdry and straighten right after my shower, you can still tell that the frizz and puff is coming back, mostly on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to live without it now!</li>
            <li> My hair is normally super curly and course.  </li>
            <li> And super shiny.</li>
            <li> However, I bought their shampoo and conditioner because I think each person just has to try different brands of home keratin to find the one or ones that work best for her individual hair.</li>
            <li> Im pregnant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had both Japanese thermal reconditioning and Brazilian blowout treatments done many times in the salon, but was looking for something more affordable that could be done at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my hair is super frizzy and course.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail, fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> However, my hair grows quickly and I don&#x27;t have the money to keep it up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this while living in a super humid area.</li>
            <li> No smoothness, no straightening, it just looked super damaged.</li>
            <li> that is super curly/frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had been getting keratin treatments done for years by a friend of mine who would charge me $150 a treatment (in the DC area, that&#x27;s pretty cheap).  </li>
            <li> If you read the bottle it says you&#x27;ll wake up with beautiful hair everyday...</li>
            <li> It was not quite as effective as the salon treatments, but it certainly made my hair much more manageable without leaving it quite as flat.  </li>
            <li> The smell was not bad compared to what I experienced at the salon, my eyes did sting a little when doing the hair strands closer to them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this product was great.</li>
            <li> Good for first timers, after trashy different story.</li>
            <li> Since getting a Keratin treatment my hair is so easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li> the first wash!  </li>
            <li> the first wash!  </li>
            <li> A million thanks to the makers of this product!!  </li>
            <li> My hair looked EXACTLY like when my original stylist used to do the treatments.  </li>
            <li> feel like I reacted more strongly to the fumes this second time</li>
            <li> this product is amazing i dont have to blow dry my hair for an hour to get it straight 10 minutes top</li>
            <li> At the salon I was able to achieve almost completely straight hair with one application and it&#x27;s still going strong three months later with sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also an important tip; while putting the product in hair and geting ready to flatiron</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you with words how fantastic this product really is...</li>
            <li> Amazing product for damaged hair especially if you have wavy/curly hair that you straighten.</li>
            <li> Its still smooth and easier to straighten, but i wish it would of stayed really straight after i washed it out.</li>
            <li> With the help of this product, my curls are CALM and WAVY</li>
            <li> However while i was straightening my hair the smell was gone, my hair did end up smooth  and straight.</li>
            <li> You could describe my hair texture as deep-fried straw with a fresh &amp;#34;I just stuck my finger in a light-socket&amp;#34; style.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It did take a lot of time &amp; elbow grease (4 hours) and also made my eyes and nose burn, but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Take a break for some fresh air too.</li>
            <li> Well worth the time and money though.</li>
            <li> but it is soft and flows now :).</li>
            <li> no coloring, rarely treated with heat)</li>
            <li> ironing is the most important part above and beyond.  </li>
            <li> This is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it for me to save on the salon price.</li>
            <li> and it is SOOOOOOOO much cheaper than getting it done at the salon (as it should be done every 4-6mo minimum) and its pretty easy to do yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own BKT for several years now, after trying out most of the major brands in salons.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH CHEAPER, and MORE EFFECTIVE at taming down frizz, and calming my curls than the Coppola Keratin Treatment</li>
            <li> and she wanted to do another one right before school started</li>
            <li> cannot stop touching my new soft shiny, freeze free hair.</li>
            <li> so I need to get one done in order to get a nice, smooth blow dry and ironed straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Japanese straightining system liscio &amp; loved that left my hair more straight</li>
            <li> It was dry in about 3-4 minutes my hair was almost frizz free!!</li>
            <li> and I feel so good about how I looked that now I&#x27;m on the other end of that first statement.</li>
            <li> The product does have a very strong odor that gave me a headache while I was waiting the 20 minutes and blow drying/ flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your new hair.</li>
            <li> As the keratin treatment i used to use is no longer available for purchase, ive been looking for years for a new one.</li>
            <li> My eyes were pouring like I had just watched Titanic for the first time at the right time of the month.  </li>
            <li> You will notice a huge huge different .</li>
            <li> You can use any sodium free shampoo but you must use sodium free if you want the product to last.</li>
            <li> hmm i do not even hav that much curly hair, it just kept my hair straight and smooth for a day.</li>
            <li> but this seemed extremely mild and worked very well.  </li>
            <li> and my ends are still very straight.</li>
            <li> Hair was very straight</li>
            <li> The video provides exact instructions, and I followed each step.  </li>
            <li> I waited exactly 24 hours before washing it out.</li>
            <li> The first photo is my hair after blow drying with no product.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my bangs, but it works better than whatever they used when I got it in a salon.</li>
            <li> so I could only do the top portion of my hair to keep some volume.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $300 to experiment.</li>
            <li> Sure enough it worked as well!</li>
            <li> This product is the first thing that has ever worked on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  </li>
            <li> My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it in my hair 4 times already and always come back for more.</li>
            <li> The first time I used Brazilian Keratin Treatment</li>
            <li> I did it exactly how the directions said.</li>
            <li> (Yes, you will now have the exact look you are trying to avoid...)</li>
            <li> The results are the exact to when I&#x27;ve had it done in the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like a teenager on a first date...</li>
            <li> Ps make sure you blow our your hair outside of your house</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick, wavy/curly hair, but not in a way that was attractive.</li>
            <li> My hair would turn to frizz at the first sign of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> me start out by saying that if you do this treatment properly, you will have fantastic results!</li>
            <li> make sure you have the proper tools you need.</li>
            <li> Make sure you blowdry as smoothly as possible.</li>
            <li> make sure your iron is hot enough.</li>
            <li> i used about 4 ounces on my hair so i will have more than enough for another treatment.</li>
            <li> I waited over 24 hours before washing the first time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Also had a funny smell, but that went away as soon as I washed it out</li>
            <li> I wonder how long this will last, but Im really  happy with the results</li>
            <li> And, if there’s a product I’m interested in, I will put it to the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> and I sweat A LOT!  ;)</li>
            <li> It does contain an aldehyde, but so does many of the household  products we use daily.</li>
            <li> Until now my brand of choice has been Coppola, but I found myself out of product and without enough time to order more and wait three days for it to cure.</li>
            <li> This is a worthwhile product if you are OK with it only lasting 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> very helpful!</li>
            <li> This stuff straightened my hair for exactly ONE WASH.  </li>
            <li> The results are even better after the second treatment.  </li>
            <li> I waited 4 weeks after my first treatment to review.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty hot iron, about 420-430 degrees, so I wore a glove on the hand that was holding the hair.  </li>
            <li> My biggest praise is how SOFT and practically frizz free my hair is.  </li>
            <li> The fumes are unbearable at first.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll just have to see after the first wash</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> exactly however I did not wash for 2 1/2 days.</li>
            <li> I wore a heat resistant glove I had received with a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This is the first at home Keratin treatment I&#x27;ve purchase</li>
            <li> The second time I did a better job at getting all my roots straightened.</li>
            <li> After Treatment Shampoo to wash your hair with or you will wash the treatment out with the first wash.</li>
            <li> It looks great, way better than it usually does after I blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair afterwards is much less curly and very healthy.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair twice, blow dried it, applied the product as instructed (making sure to use a fine tooth comb to get out all excess product), let it sit for 20 minutes, then straightened it with 7-10 passes for each section.  </li>
            <li> Flat Iron and I love it.</li>
            <li> I had never been a flat iron user and was able to manage getting this treatment done on myself.</li>
            <li> I am one week post treatment and have straight, soft, smooth hair even after washing three times and swimming once.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it is better than the salon because they skimp on the product at the salon to save money and don&#x27;t spend as much time sealing it in.</li>
            <li> and i left it in for two days just to be sure it stays straight, but it didnt.</li>
            <li> But so far, the results are way better then any I&#x27;ve had done professionally.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will only buy this brand for now on package came faster than expected this my second time purchasing this item so far so good!</li>
            <li> until that waxy feeling is gone and when ur hair feels super duper soft ur all set!</li>
            <li> Now I can style my hair straight and it&#x27;ll stay that way no matter how humid and hot the day may be.</li>
            <li> My hair used to have a beautiful curl, but after 2 babies and hormone changes its become a coarse, brittle frizzy mess that would start to frizz up as soon as I stepped out into any sort of humidity.</li>
            <li> advice for someone who wants to try this product for the first time would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took me longer to straightened about 30 mins, it wasn&#x27;t as straight as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For ventilation, I had a high-speed fan sucking air out the bathroom window, plus a large fan on high blowing fresh air onto me as I worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may wait an extra month in between just because it seemed so strong.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the strong smell when applying the product..</li>
            <li> Only issue, is that it is so strong that I felt I was burning my eyes.</li>
            <li> Putting it on was pure torture.</li>
            <li> But I have been using a large barrel curling iron to add some body waves to it before work</li>
            <li> Large bottle</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t really become any more manageable to blow dry or straighten either.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to follow directions exactly on my daughter and so far 3 months later her hair is still straight.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a little nervous to try it after I received it and saw there were some misspelling in the directions</li>
            <li> that flat irons easily</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who wants a keratin treatment, and is willing to go through the time consuming process of doing it while saving yourself hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to deal with</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten very well</li>
            <li> My bangs will be perfectly straight for about a month or two.</li>
            <li> I am over two months in and my hair is still straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> The real test...</li>
            <li> I did not see a purpose in taking a picture after applying the product and straightening because, as I said, of course it&#x27;s straight after I &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it.ppy with it.  </li>
            <li> The real test...</li>
            <li> I did not see a purpose in taking a picture after applying the product and straightening because, as I said, of course it&#x27;s straight after I &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Your hair will turn out straight once done.</li>
            <li> My hair staid straight.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> I color my hair very</li>
            <li> First color your hair as you normally would.</li>
            <li> Its straight</li>
            <li> So much faster.</li>
            <li> It really is so manageable now.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the hair..</li>
            <li> It really eliminated frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly/coarse/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It stays straight.</li>
            <li> My hair stays smooth and shiny, and I get compliments daily.</li>
            <li> , my hair curls were much looser....</li>
            <li> It performs beautifully straight from application to finish.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost too straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier if you can convince a friend to do your hair....</li>
            <li> it really is the product burning off.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still straight after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Before the treatment it took forever to get it straight</li>
            <li> and she would often still have some places that didn&#x27;t look totally straight.  </li>
            <li> This treatment did NOT make my hair pin straight, but maybe its my cut, I have ends that just want to flip up</li>
            <li> and my hair is MUCH straighter than (a)</li>
            <li> This really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my hair this straight without come parts looking fried before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> So you really need to be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It did turn out really straight after the process</li>
            <li> and I have really notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I use the keratin treatment on all my hair and it makes it very sleek and manageable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make it perfectly straight</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li> As much hair as used to get cleaning my hairbrush out after a month or two</li>
            <li> You really need to have a fan pointed at your face to keep your eyes from stinging...</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and it turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would assume it&#x27;s somewhere between 5-15% just based on the degree to which it irritated my throat/eyes (about as much as the treatment I used to get)</li>
            <li> I do this treatment every 3 months and helps my hair stay straight.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am currently using the sulfate free Ion shampoo from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my corse hair, it doesn&#x27;t make it straight by any stretch of the immagination</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair...</li>
            <li> One piece of advice, get a face mask because the smell really got to me.</li>
            <li> If I felt like using the straight iron-- running it through my hair for five or six minutes</li>
            <li> This product will not make your hair 100% straight.</li>
            <li> So have a reasonable expectation.</li>
            <li> I put this in before our very rainy disney vacation and i had no, zero, none, nothing, not a one piece of frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I did this treatment 3 months ago and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged with repeated coloring, bleaching, and overusing hair iron.</li>
            <li> I think I must have put a bit too much on hair because it felt gummy after drying and ironing.  </li>
            <li> but the cost would be too much at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really helps or not</li>
            <li> It finally occurred to me that I could do my own Brazilian blow-out, and this product lasts the same as if I had gone to the salon.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s only been a couple of days (don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the long run), um very pleased.</li>
            <li> And I live in a hot humid area of the United States.</li>
            <li> It was silky, soft, and I could run my fingers right through it.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair straight and soft, could just get up, comb through, and it was very silky and amazing, I would roll the window down on the car and look in the mirror and just let my hair blow and smile, because my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> If your hair is as curly as mine, don&#x27;t expect your hair to be stick straight all throughout from this product or any other keratin treatment, but it will be much more manageable from doing this.</li>
            <li> I love this brand as it does not have that funky smell like the other keratin treatments and it works</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on the ends; however, since incorporating this particular product, I don&#x27;t need as much argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Without salon expertise, this makes my hair shiny and soft and more manageable but not especially straight.</li>
            <li> To be honest, they&#x27;re a little TOO relaxed for my liking, so I advise you not to underestimate the strength of the treatment!</li>
            <li> She is so much happier with her hair now and the daily complaining about how much she hates her curly hair has finally stopped! :)</li>
            <li> It was such a long a grueling process with my type of hair, and in pretty sure I oversaturated it with the product, but after 4 hours my hair was straight as a board.</li>
            <li> When she moved away, I went to another stylist who was offering a similar special, and her treatment did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> So, assuming this stuff would be less potent than the salon treatment, I overcompensated by leaving it on for 48, rather than 24 hours (don&#x27;t worry, the directions specifically say people with very curly hair could should try this).</li>
            <li> I have somewhat fine yet curly/frizzy hair, that&#x27;s dry but not damaged (</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m all: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if it takes me three hours to finish this smoothing treatment; I&#x27;m ordering it NOW!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s available (hopefully for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Then I left it in my hair for 3 full days.</li>
            <li> By then my hair is a little crunchier and my lungs are sufficiently filled with the essence of freshly smoked anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li> New idea!</li>
            <li> It was more liquid than a previous one I used that was thicker</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair that used to take forever to dry is now smooth and dries in no time.</li>
            <li> I think having my hair more manageable (after the Keratin) has reduced the breakage since it tangles less</li>
            <li> To start, make sure you allow yourself enough time to do the treatment properly.</li>
            <li> It took about 20-25 minutes to get my whole head soaked, I waited a bit and blow dried, then waitied a bit more before I ironed.  </li>
            <li> so I looked it up on Amazon and decided to the main ingredients</li>
            <li> My main issue is how puffy my hair gets anytime it air dries.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> Each time I loved the results, although I felt that my hair was a little flat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this keratin treatment..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is especially alarming because I had excellent ventilation going during the treatment and even did it in two parts--half my hair one day and half the next.</li>
            <li> My curly, frizzy, dry hair is straight, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> I took 3 more minutes to quickly blow it out with a round brush and a tiny bit of anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li> I took 3 more minutes to quickly blow it out with a round brush and a tiny bit of anti-frizz serum.  </li>
            <li> Clipped my hair up and started applying at the back of my head using the flat applicator brush and combing through to make sure I had an even consistency.  </li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but this product deserves every star!</li>
            <li> However, when I want to get fancy shmancy it takes a little more work.  </li>
            <li> This will help tremendously when you start flat ironing.</li>
            <li> hard to do it correctly on your own head.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick run through with the flat iron to touch up and give it the sleek look.</li>
            <li> But with this treatment, my hair is silky soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product before, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results I got from this product that it seemed wrong not to share.</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft, silky and straight.</li>
            <li> Professional Complex Bottle Free Shipping Available Worldwide]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brazilian blowouts are so expensive, so I was really happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely straighten, but makes  hair very silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li> my hair is naturally curly and it is straight now.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product I just must.</li>
            <li> So in a few months when I need a touch up its free!</li>
            <li> I rinsed and styled normally this morning</li>
            <li> Will buy it again but the bottle should last a long time :)</li>
            <li> I love it cuz it cuts the time I wait for her to prep in half!</li>
            <li> Not only this, but if you have very curly/wavy hair like me that can get very kinky and annoying to manage, this treatment will relax your curls a good amount while keeping it looking slightly curly and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Use your round brushes and make sure the top is dried to the side and style you want because it will stay that way!</li>
            <li> And the Keratin treatment cost $300 in a salon, so this is well worth it if you are going to be doing all the blow drying and flat ironing yourself.</li>
            <li> I need to buy googles because when I flat iron while putting in the treatment my eyes water but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I truly cant live without this.</li>
            <li> I also live in south florida.</li>
            <li> I also bought a new straightener (one that went up to 450 degrees)</li>
            <li> I paid a lot for a professional keratin and this does the same for a lot less in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li> Only thing is GK only lasted me a month using the sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t hold up like those treatments did I&#x27;ll come back and update, but I am very very optimistic about this treatment.  </li>
            <li> but I totally over did it the first time.</li>
            <li> EXACT SAME!!</li>
            <li> After washing, drying, applying, 20 minutes of waiting, drying and flat ironing ad nauseum, it finally looked smooth but with the teensiest amount of poof on the ends.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottles to try first.</li>
            <li> bought my first bottle in March 2013; my second in November.</li>
            <li> So the bottom line is, you&#x27;ll have to weight the benefits of having smooth hair vs dark hair.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY the same stuff that has been used in my salon....</li>
            <li> the smell is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> this is a long process (well worth it though).  </li>
            <li> She still runs a flat iron over it if she wants it to be really straight</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions closely, fought the fumes with multiple fans (and eventually some goggles-the eye sting is real!), and even waited beyond the recommended waiting period to wash out my hair with sulfate/sodium-free shampoo and conditioner (per the bottle&#x27;s recommendation for curly/resistant hair).</li>
            <li> , I would only give this product a 3 start because of the fumes and hair lost I&#x27;ve experienced using it, I will see if it last at least 3-5 months</li>
            <li> and I only used 1/2 the bottle the first time.</li>
            <li> I do possess the knowledge to apply the product as well as researching online and watching videos to make sure it was similar to other keratin treatments i&#x27;d assisted with</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cheaper option than the salon, just know that your hair may not come out as straight</li>
            <li> I stuck my head out of the bathroom window while a fan blew directly at me causing my newly drenched locks to splatter on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> When flat ironing make sure that you take very small sections of hair as this will ensure amazing results, make sure that sections are not more than a quarter inch thick and Definately make sure that they are smaller than the width of your flat iron.</li>
            <li> and my hair seems to stay smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen similar shedding when doing deep conditioning treatments pack full of it too.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and so my stylist warned me several times that the salon treatment would only eliminate frizz, but not relax my curls very much.</li>
            <li> (it was a huge frizzy mess)</li>
            <li> My hair looks just like it would after I burn it to a crisp with the flat</li>
            <li> My hair looks just like it would after I burn it to a crisp with the flat</li>
            <li> Expect to spend at least 3 hours in a well ventilated area, because although this stuff smells fine (coconutty!)</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the fumes- they were worse than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, so make sure you have good ventilation and take breaks if you need to.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how much more I&#x27;ll be able to loose before other people start to notice.</li>
            <li> I did put a fan in the window to suck air out of the room, and I had another fan blowing on our faces while she was using the flat iron because that is pretty much the only time there are any fumes.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on eBay because it was a little bit cheaper and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Blow drying was quick, the drying time was probably half of what it normally is</li>
            <li> , that being said, it&#x27;s a little more than three months later</li>
            <li> Elegant style for my life as a hard working RN.</li>
            <li> Apart from the fact that it only lasted a month, the other main drawback is the fact that it SIGNIFICANTLY lightens your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was a great solution for my crazy hair and frizz</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference in my hair, I have had this treatment professionally done and have done it numerous times at home.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually worked great.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, the same as my hairdresser was using and charging me a fortune for.  </li>
            <li> I had the treatment professionally at a salon</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair takes nearly 1 hour to get the puff out.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny a extremely soft.</li>
            <li> After applying the treatment my hair is extremely soft my curls are almost gone</li>
            <li> did I say SOFT???</li>
            <li> I left it on 2 days as my hair is very fizzy.</li>
            <li> The day that I do complete the treatment and style my hair - I see no change.</li>
            <li> I had a professional coppolla keratin treatment in a salon ($150), and this home treatment lasts WAY longer.</li>
            <li> And my hair is bouncy and soft...</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft and shiny afteeeerwards.</li>
            <li> ; My hair is real curly and coarse</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do it completely, your hair will be sticky until you wash it</li>
            <li> I waited about 30 hours before washing again, and WOW I was blown away....</li>
            <li> So when I realized I could buy professional grade keratin treatment for $60 off Amazon</li>
            <li> it is naturally</li>
            <li> Better than salon quality (at least for</li>
            <li> But expect to see loss of curl when you let the treatment wash out of your hair completely if you have been using it like I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to be natural at the moment</li>
            <li> I have medium length naturally curly hair and frizzy by nature.</li>
            <li> My hair came out so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> From my roots I have about 4 inches of natural hair</li>
            <li> head on to blow the fumes away and one to direct fumes to the window.  </li>
            <li> I would rather have my natural hair than stringy greasy looking hair.</li>
            <li> Results only lasted about 3 weeks in my hair and it didn&#x27;t get my hair 100% straight.</li>
            <li> Just make sure NOT to wash the product out of your hair for at least 72 hours.</li>
            <li> My hair was ready for a treatment mid December</li>
            <li> My hair was kind of wavy until I had kids, and then it turned weird, with curl at the nape of my neck, straight but FRIZZY.</li>
            <li> I took about 2 1/2 hours to do the entire process but again her hair is super long.  </li>
            <li> Of course she was right; the first salon treatments I had made my hair slightly less curly (i.e. very wavy), but not straight by any means.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product, the way it burned my eyes a little, reminded me of the original Brazilian Blowout product.</li>
            <li> The softness and shine only lasts for about 30 days (wash my hair every other day to every 3 days with sulfate free products).</li>
            <li> I have VERY frizzy, curly, unmanageable hair and nothing works for me besides flat ironing of course.</li>
            <li> I suggest for very curly hair like mine, to apply flat iron at 450 and atleast 7 passes and in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> I have been getting the original Brazillian Blowout every four months for a few years now.</li>
            <li> First, about me:  I&#x27;m a 50yr old white woman of German descent.  </li>
            <li> I usually do the chi transformation system and it does much better with it, of the only reason why i bought this keratin</li>
            <li> Or blow dry it with my fingers and a quick once over with a flat iron if we were going out.</li>
            <li> After treatment it is like a soft curtain of hair straight down my back; exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> , I let it dry naturally to see the real results.</li>
            <li> ( my hair is long and very frizzy/wavy).</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money for my Keratin at the Salon and was getting so hopeless with my hair until I tried this one!</li>
            <li> After a couple of shampoos, the coarse, thick coating went away and my hair was left nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will be the most unsightly frizzy, dry mess you have ever seen!</li>
            <li> I used a pair of heavy cotton gardening gloves, the kind that have little grippers on the palm area.</li>
            <li> While the straightness of my hair (I have very coarse, frizzy, curly, unruly hair as I am 75% Italian, 25% German) lasted about three weeks before my curls began to creep back into play, the frizz has been kept at bay for a full three months.</li>
            <li> Recently I was looking into a new salon to try it again</li>
            <li> I only do the Keratin on my roots or new growth</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really try to style here, just wanted to get it dry, but do brush through so you can run a comb through while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done all together at least 8 keratin treatments with the last bottle I love that I can do a treatment every 4-6 months and not have to worry about my curls being overly preocess with keratin</li>
            <li> I did that on my back porch as well, but still didn&#x27;t get much relief from the fumes even in the open outdoors.  </li>
            <li> I have super heavy color in my hair and when I touch up my roots, the keratin treatment does fade.  </li>
            <li> No Fluff!  </li>
            <li> No Fluff!  </li>
            <li> (I ended up pouring a little bit back into the original container when I was done)</li>
            <li> At first I was repeating use every other month feeling that my hair would be curly again.</li>
            <li> and the effects are still completely obvious, just a few more curls came back, so I&#x27;ve just now done my second one.</li>
            <li> I just got it back to normal with a deep conditioning treatment made for post-keratin treatments (my normal deep conditioners weren&#x27;t fixing the damage).</li>
            <li> I am curious why there are so many positive comments, I have did it twice, and my hair going to worse.</li>
            <li> The seller tells you that the product works &amp;#34;express&amp;#34; but it is not true, since you need to to exactly the same than other products (and the results remain in your hair about 2 or 3 weeks if you are lucky).</li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy and smooth and takes so much less time to dry and style.  </li>
            <li> I live in New York City, and even with a deep discount I was paying $150+ for a single Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> one started out okay, but only lasted about 3 weeks and was not nearly as good as the salon, even when I held off washing for 3 days.</li>
            <li> It washes out gradually giving me my natural curl pattern back.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t use any product and my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to get this Brazilian treatment after having my hair professionally done.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and your money paying almost $60 for this product if you can buy three of them with the same results.</li>
            <li> Now she can get it to look perfectly straight with minimal effort and the straightness lasts.  </li>
            <li> Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> and we were sitting near the open door.</li>
            <li> and I barely had to do any touchups with my straightener.</li>
            <li> I did the treatment with the window open and two fans, one pointing directly at me</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Took about 2 total hours , but I left it in a while -- normally takes 4hours when I go  to the salon .  </li>
            <li> So this product seems to work out thus far definetly left my hair much smother, straighter &amp; easier to manage since my hair is very thick &amp; course, super frizzy since it was fired by a perm.</li>
            <li> Take the product and pour about three ounces (for just past shoulder lengh hair) into a container, Then  start by taking very very small sections of hair and then wearing gloves dip three fingers in the product and work it into hair from top to bottom, now use the small thoothed comb and comb the section a few times making sure it&#x27;s saturated but almost no product it&#x27;s coming out infront of the comb, if more than half a penny size it&#x27;s coming out you are applying too much product, do this with the whole head and then blow dry hair using a brush to dry it</li>
            <li> I will say there is a ingredient in this treatment that really burns my eyes during the initial application, but goes away once I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The pictures are only before treatment, after washing and blow-drying, and after adding a bit of serum and a round brush quick blow-out.</li>
            <li> The pictures are only before treatment, after washing and blow-drying, and after adding a bit of serum and a round brush quick blow-out.</li>
            <li> it made my thick, curly, coarse hair satiny and so easy to blow-dry.  </li>
            <li> First of all I was expecting to wait about a week or week and a half for the product to arrive but it arrived in literally 2 days...</li>
            <li> have waist length hair, so I used half the bottle the first time---and its probably time to do another treatment.  </li>
            <li> This product makes exactly the same than other cheaper products.</li>
            <li> It seemed strange to apply, blow-dry, iron it in w a flat iron, THEN wash again and apply hair mask/leaving it in for 15 minutes, THEN rinse and blow-dry AGAIN, but it really really is shiny, silky, manageable.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have the right tools and don&#x27;t be afraid that you are burning your hair when you see the steam come off the flat iron.....</li>
            <li> and it was so soft and straight just a little frizzy</li>
            <li> So you really need to be careful!    </li>
            <li> I only left it on for two days ( I have very curly and dry hair).</li>
            <li> I blow dried and the hair was so straight already and nowhere near the puff ball</li>
            <li> I keep using this product and cut the Japanese treated hair as it goes and will transition back to natural.</li>
            <li> theres a certain product ingredient in this one and in the good one i used in the past that makes it smell significantly worse than other treatments</li>
            <li> The second time I used it I did a quick job not sure how it was going to turn out.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have long, semi-wavy, healthy Asian hair, with a small amount of frizz that pops up if I don&#x27;t dry and straighten my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> , I had developed some techniques to keep the smoke away from my face while flat ironing (hold the straightener high above the head rather than on the side as usual), but it may have been too late as I had already gotten a couple of potent hits of smoke to the eyes that had made them sting and water like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4- 6 weeks as I&#x27;m going grey early.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER it adds shine and really cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment due to high reviews.</li>
            <li> not super straight like when I had the GK treatment done.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and frizzy and now became so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it took lmaybe 20 minutes to dry and straighten</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the exact same effect at home as at the salon, (it lasts about 4 weeks at the longest, as opposed to a few months at the salon)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the professional treatment done in the past and started to get annoyed by them not really doing a good job.</li>
            <li> the past month, I&#x27;ve probably washed my hair every other day--alternating with sulfate free shampoo, and cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> No flat iron was necessary.</li>
            <li> No flat iron was necessary.</li>
            <li> I live in the southeast where it gets extremely humid in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> Sectioning off my hair, I started at the nape and got a very small section at a time, sprayed a few squirts on there, and combed through with a very fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions painfully to a t, have the right shampoo but still 2 days later my hair is the exact same, which isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER thick, curly, frizzy, long hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other products and great that you don&#x27;t have to wait three days to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> If you do, you&#x27;ll need to fix those with the flat iron BEFORE you wash your hair out the next day.</li>
            <li> My hair is long; to the middle of my back and one length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a relaxer and nothing compares to BKTs especially since you can still dye and bleach your hair as long as it is BEFORE doing a BKT and after the BKT has left the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a relaxer and nothing compares to BKTs especially since you can still dye and bleach your hair as long as it is BEFORE doing a BKT and after the BKT has left the hair.</li>
            <li> However, after taking the third shower my hair returned to its normal condition!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wanted to order that from Amazon but was scared to do my self because if done incorrectly you can have serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a photo black &amp; white one be for treatment, one directly below right after tx applied to hair, &amp; one to the left after hair washed w/ treatment left in for 48 hrs, blow dryied &amp; flat ironed.</li>
            <li> Did want to note that I used my bare hands no gloves &amp; did notice a very dry feeling in my hands</li>
            <li> have hair about to my waist that is very thick and would be much more curly at the ends if not for the previous treatments.  </li>
            <li> After complete application I still have over half of a bottle left.  </li>
            <li> I purchase a small spray bottle at the Dollar Tree and sprayed the product on her hair which made the application process much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> After they removed the formeldahyde from the product it didn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> I used a clarifying shampoo, followed directions and purchased a flat iron that heats up to 450 degrees to do this.</li>
            <li> Then I load on gobs of anti-frizz serum and go at it with the fiery death of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I then broke out my handy-dandy flat iron to commence the ritual hair frying.  </li>
            <li> Then section off your frizzy, sticky hair and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> an use a fan when flat ironing the hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I will have to see how long it last.</li>
            <li> Than I flat ironer it.</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t expect this will last as long as the bottle says it has been a week since</li>
            <li> No need for a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair but still only used about 1/3 the bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash it for two dayside  flat ironed it each day.  </li>
            <li> No need for flat iron.</li>
            <li> and when i flat ironed it the ends looked frazzled.</li>
            <li> and it probably won&#x27;t last as long since it won&#x27;t be fully sealed.  </li>
            <li> My eyes started stinging because of the fumes during the flat ironing process.</li>
            <li> Daughter has long hair and there is probably enough in this bottle for three treatments.  </li>
            <li> so we will see how long this last I will up date in a month.</li>
            <li> but also didnt last long &amp; that at a salon is $400 &amp; up.</li>
            <li> It is still wavy just really flat.</li>
            <li> flat ironing).&lt;br /&gt;Flat</li>
            <li> it too forever to flat iron</li>
            <li> so I flat ironed</li>
            <li> you will feel/smell product in the hair) for atleast 48 hours before washing out and touch up w flat iron during that waiting phase of the treatment.</li>
            <li> last thing I wanted to say was that I have long hair.</li>
            <li> So I am half black and half white and always wear my hair straight, also live in Florida...</li>
            <li> I actually swam on this vacation because I knew I could come back and wash my hair, throw some gloss in there, and let it air dry!</li>
            <li> The last photo is after washing my hair for the first time - I did a ten minute blow dry with no product and it looks like I spent the usual hour straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a teeny bit weighed down, but sooooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I then dried my hair only with my fingers for less than 5 minutes and it was miraculously straight!  </li>
            <li> I then dried my hair only with my fingers for less than 5 minutes and it was miraculously straight!  </li>
            <li> I can blow-dry my hair in about 5 minutes and only have very very very minor areas where i want to pass the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> yet the only thing this treatment accomplished was to make my hair dull and crispy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2.5 months so far (with daily washing) and it is starting to wear off a little but not very much.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S OUTSIDE, with an extension cord and blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have left it air dry</li>
            <li> I even still have my bottom half professionally done, so I can tell the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> Directions recommend a flatiron capable of reaching at least 410 degrees; mine only goes up to 400 and it worked just as well</li>
            <li> I have had 2 keratin hair treatments before and none of them worked, my hair was still the same, which was somewhat curly and dry.</li>
            <li> This part took meabout an hour and a half to complete (but again, I was just doing the length from root to ears).  </li>
            <li> but after struggling to tame it I normally give into throwing it into a pony tail curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have such loose and shiny waves now.  </li>
            <li> I started with small little sections like a good girl, but by hour 4 I was getting sloppy with it.  </li>
            <li> then it takes forever to flat iron it out so follow directions and save the product!!</li>
            <li> I love it but not too crazy how flat my hair gets.</li>
            <li> I even took a hairdryer to it on high heat, medium speed and ran my fingers through it for a little bit while it was wet for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> I still have to blow dry and flat iron too</li>
            <li> I was hoping that after using this product I could go without the usual blow dry and flat iron that I have to do just to make my hair look normal.</li>
            <li> Next put on your other gloves for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old caucasian with semi-fine color treated, hair (red, which I usually do myself, but</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d spent the same amount of time on it without the keratin</li>
            <li> So when I am done washing my hair, I notice my hair isn&#x27;t frizzing up, tangling, or doing any of the normal things it usually does.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long each bottle has lasted.</li>
            <li> , hair is indeed healthier in the long run.</li>
            <li> Everything online suggests that you can just color your hair a shade darker initially, but that&#x27;s not very helpful advice for people who are already using the darkest blue-black.  </li>
            <li> Have serveral pairs of heavy duty professional latex gloves, as you&#x27;ll want to change them out.</li>
            <li> i am not a professional</li>
            <li> I was in hawaii the next week where it was humid, rained and I spent all day in the pool/ocean and still, no frizz.</li>
            <li> between 4-8 passes on each strand depending on how long it took the steam to dissipate.  </li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair that I like to wear straight...</li>
            <li> I have previously had about 5-6 keratin treatments at salons that were specified to last 3 months, and 1 keratin treatment that was specified to last 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very hard to keep straight especially with any humidity at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed if i use other shampoos, it degrades the Keratin a lot quicker and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look the same.</li>
            <li> recently did a review on their other treatment, Inverto Revolution Keratin Hair Treatment, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And here, about 4 weeks later, I can see a little frizz starting to return, I&#x27;m maybe at 20%.  </li>
            <li> I am due for a touchup and I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Be extremely careful not to drip any solution onto bare skin; I got a few drops on my neck and the skin became red, dry and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry hair</li>
            <li> Apply the treatment to your dry hair and comb through throughly.</li>
            <li> I know what it like to blow dry</li>
            <li> after that, blow dry hair straigh and then devide hair into three sections.  </li>
            <li> My ends ended up dry because I had bleach</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to blowdry into a style, just get the hair dry.</li>
            <li> When hair is dry apply the product.</li>
            <li> Blow dry the hair</li>
            <li> It did make my eyes water when I blew it dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> And even when done in the salon, it only lasts about 2 - 2.5 months leaving me with the last few weeks of August into September looking like Gilda Radnor.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I&#x27;m curious to see how long this will last.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is sick of spending so much time with products that claim &amp;#34;straight for 3-4 days&amp;#34; only to have the frizz back as soon as the humidity goes up</li>
            <li> I think I read every single review on here before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> You will also need a heavier pair of gloves when flat ironing your hair because the hair gets extremely hot1</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last but will definitely be reusing.</li>
            <li> For approximately $80 and an hour of my time, I got the same smooth, straight(er) hair that would cost me at least $350 in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have thick hair normal softness</li>
            <li> I had loose beach waves, no frizz.</li>
            <li> This definitely looses my curly down.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with hair all the way down her back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle eastern with frizzy, unruly, half way curls.</li>
            <li> Anything less than 430 degrees will not give you lasting result.</li>
            <li> and I have well over half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> I find that I, now, simply don&#x27;t need any other products other than argan oil.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s only a slight exaggeration of what my hair does.</li>
            <li> Now, I literally wash it, spray some smoothing cream on it, brush it, and let it air dry and it looks like I just spent an hour straightening it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused at all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Then I began flat ironing small sections, making several passes.</li>
            <li> , I left the product on for 20 mins, then I go ahead and dried my hair with a blower again sanctioning my hair, last I started flat Ironing my hair with small pieces of hair</li>
            <li> Also helpful to suck on a throat lozenge or hard candy and drink plenty of water during the application process to keep your throat from completely drying out.</li>
            <li> The whole process takes long long time, I don&#x27;t recommend it to others, waste time and money and damage hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how my hair is after doing treatments with this product, but the fumes are bad news.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long the result will last.</li>
            <li> I only waited 24 hours because I&#x27;m impatient like that</li>
            <li> I only waited 24 hours because I&#x27;m impatient like that</li>
            <li> Got here on time and seems to work as expected</li>
            <li> But I really never wear my hair curly</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde with heavy highlights and I did not experience any issues with color change.</li>
            <li> itchy even though I immediately wiped it off with a wet paper towel (resolved after 2-3 days)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> With 100 degree TX heat &amp; humidity its a pain to waste time on your hair if it&#x27;s only gonna lady 2 day.</li>
            <li> I got myself all set up, and mentally prepared</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money buying Living Proof</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I waited a few hours short of three days before washing.  </li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t get your hair wet.</li>
            <li> If you have any crazy flyaways when the ironing is complete, take a small amount (Just a dab) of the keratin and smooth down the hairs as you would with a styling product and your fingers.</li>
            <li> The blow dry time after the treatment was like 3-4 min!!</li>
            <li> My only negative observation is that it did burn my eyes while applying the product, but not while flat ironing.</li>
            <li> and I still not have straight hair.really sad about it, because I paid someone to come home and apply the keratin on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, easy to use, smell wasnt horrible</li>
            <li> Start from the back nape area and work in small sections.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use any clips or ponytail holders or get the hair wet or sweaty!</li>
            <li> Due for another treatment but don&#x27;t want the breakage.</li>
            <li> and they had a hair straightener just for wet hair!</li>
            <li> Eliminates the need for other products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten curly hair like the other keratin treatments I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother spending $300 in the salon because this does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li> so I kept my expectations low and took a gamble on a product that for me, was not cheap!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other chemicals in my hair</li>
            <li> You MUST get the shampoo, conditioner is optional, but you can&#x27;t use ANY OTHER conditioner on your hair if you don&#x27;t get the one made by Rejuvenol with this dertin treatment in your hair.</li>
            <li> used the Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment about 4 weeks ago---it was easy to do by myself, and the fumes were not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Because i colored my hair immediately before starting the keratin, the entire process took approximately 4 hours, including time to color.</li>
            <li> I felt encouraged by the positive reviews and immediately applied the product upon its arrival a mere two days after ordering.  </li>
            <li> , I usually take 1hr or 1 1/2 to flat iron my hair, by the end of the week</li>
            <li> It does burn your nostrils a bit during the application process due to the Formaldehyde but not worth complaining about.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing, I had some crazy frizzy, dry hair due to a perm gone wrong.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical , but since my last salon treatment didn&#x27;t last very long ...</li>
            <li> After following the instructions to a T, my hair felt sticky and kinda hard.</li>
            <li> My daily routine for work involves be getting out of the shower, towel drying my hair, and throwing that sucker up in a tucked under pony tail.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair and only used about 1/3 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Literally one week later my hair is thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Cuts down drying time.</li>
            <li> Cuts down maintenance time.</li>
            <li> If my frizz level was 100% before the treatment, it was cut down to about 7% after.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I have used other straightening products over the years, none of which worked as well as this!  </li>
            <li> I have thick , coarse , wavy hair that dries into a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> and it cut down the time to do my hair in half.</li>
            <li> Cut down on drying time and strAightening time to about half.</li>
            <li> The only negative about the treatment was it lightened my color, made it a little coppery.  </li>
            <li> My hair varies from wavy to slightly curly with lots of frizz.</li>
            <li> Did have a slight smell</li>
            <li> It took a half a day.</li>
            <li> because I couldn&#x27;t find my chi treatment anywhere, I&#x27;m very disappointed and please don&#x27;t waste your money on this and get yourself a proper shampoo with a conditioner better than all these harmful formaline packed treatments.</li>
            <li> The wait time was not bad, my hair didn&#x27;t look as bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent about $150 for everything for 2 treatments (the small bottle of keratin lasted through both</li>
            <li> have long, frizzy, thick, color treated and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have long and thick hair get help from someone else to apply this on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I am the only jewish person in my town, so I am sick of standingout with my big, curly, nappy hair.  </li>
            <li> It did burn my eyes a little when i was doing the peices close to my face.</li>
            <li> My eyes burned a little bit, but it wasn&#x27;t anything unbearable.  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;d like to relax it permanently a little and then put the keratin in it to help that.</li>
            <li> and I have to use little to no heat.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take away my curls, but just made them a little looser and a lot easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> I straightened it a little bit (10 minutes) every day that it was in my hair.</li>
            <li> u cannot use it from the bottle, washed my hair, dried 90% with a blower and a brush, separated my hair into 4 sections, I started with one section of hair and spread the treatment little by little with a tail comb until I had placed the product in all my hair.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that because I can&#x27;t really section it out, that is screw this up.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait longer, but I got impatient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> When I use a round brush to blow it out</li>
            <li> Blowdry your hair carefully and slowly, get it into the style you want.</li>
            <li> I watched the video on Keratin Research&#x27;s website a few times.  </li>
            <li> please dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> I washed twice with clarifying shampoo, dried my hair</li>
            <li> over again I let it sit for  20 minutes then blow dried it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again.  </li>
            <li> but just a few passes</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t messy</li>
            <li> It is really harsh.</li>
            <li> It is really harsh.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched heavily and decided on Keratin Research.</li>
            <li> and I just ran my fingers through as I dried.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> however it looks limp, greasy, and stringy.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m loosing that much everyday.</li>
            <li> three times as indicated, towel dried, and blow dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> Let it sit for 30 minutes or so (whatever the instructions say), and then blow dried again (</li>
            <li> Then I blow dried it, painted this onto my hair with the brushes they use for hair color at salons.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dried it again, sectioned it off, and straightened 3 cm sections at a time about 10 times each.</li>
            <li> It felt funny, but it didn&#x27;t look bad or weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept with it overnight and proceeded with the moment of truth.</li>
            <li> It felt funny, but it didn&#x27;t look bad or weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept with it overnight and proceeded with the moment of truth.</li>
            <li> So even after reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> i did it in my very small bathroom with the door closed and vent on and didn&#x27;t have any issues with the chemicals smelling it up at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is course, curly (tight about 3b/3c) reaching about two inches past my bra-strap.</li>
            <li> My hair length is a little bit past my collarbone.  </li>
            <li> When applying the cream it stinks to high heaven burning my eyes, nose and throat&lt;</li>
            <li> No more spring $150 every few months.</li>
            <li> My nose feels absolutely raw inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a bit less time since my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick or curly</li>
            <li> The application process might be a little tedious and hard, you have to be very careful with your eyes once you are drying it, do it in an open place, otherwise the air is also hard to breath, don&#x27;t do this often,</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Other than my neighbors thinking I was crazy, my hair was dry, but still fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I did have my daughter do the straightening for me, because it is difficult to do the back of your hair by yourself.  </li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 7- 10 times each in small peices.</li>
            <li> A rattail comb to get small sections of hair, and a medium thickness comb for combing the product on your hair.</li>
            <li> I put mine into a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Tried this twice within the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> it usually is so</li>
            <li> No more frizz.</li>
            <li> :-/  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;dlikw how it would look sir dryied.</li>
            <li> Worked well to manage my usually ou tof control hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> usually hair color burns my eyes and nose</li>
            <li> I have gone to the salon 5x over the past 5 years to get the Brazillian hair straightening treatment done.</li>
            <li> Very harsh smell</li>
            <li> You should definitely wear a mask, use rubber gloves, and have a fan blowing in your face as the chemicals are very irritating to your throat and eyes.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure how to operate around it and once when I wasn&#x27;t careful I had got sick with chest pains and soar throat.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure how to operate around it and once when I wasn&#x27;t careful I had got sick with chest pains and soar throat.</li>
            <li> With this treatment, I hardly have to do any styling in between washes.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> : It is a must that you wash hair with clarifying shampoo at least three times, and please wash it like you are trying to take out a stain from clothes ( delicate clothes though)</li>
            <li> It sucks to say the least.</li>
            <li> The shampoo i used is Keratin Complex  keratin color shampoo by coppola.</li>
            <li> but lately I would rather wait a week before washing again.</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair which is thick, course, curly, and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The product is like a thick, milky liquid.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick, medium length</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, Polynesian hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick wavy/curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and I have medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li> Disregard the mean face...</li>
            <li> Disregard the mean face...</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want to set myself up for failure by having unreasonable expectations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was thick, corse, and looked dull!</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
            <li> During that time, you can definitely tell that there is something sticky on your hair, but it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> so naturally I was a tad doubtful.</li>
            <li> I could hardly breathe!</li>
            <li> Well duh!</li>
            <li> Well duh!</li>
            <li> (My one complaint about the transaction - my package was shipped with NO instructions in it!)</li>
            <li> Very hard to put it on.</li>
            <li> I used the Pravana perfection before and was angry at myself for ordering a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to do it myself, but gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> It took me approximately an hour and 45 min, start to finish.</li>
            <li> maybe would have worked if my hair was thin and wavy...</li>
            <li> in mind you&#x27;ll have to disregard the poor grammar  and punctuation in the product directions!**&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Oh and the whole process of doing it takes forever and the fumes are horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> No ponytails, putting hair behind the ears, etc while this is in your hair.</li>
            <li> For those of you giving this a try take the precaution to avoid skin contact seriously!</li>
            <li> It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, and it lasted 1 year!</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about buying the Keratin system online.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> However using goggles and a face mask, while silly looking, would probably be the safer bet.</li>
            <li> Also I suggest leaving the product on (it can be uncomfortable bc</li>
            <li> I threw away the rest, I hated to, but I this time I&#x27;m going to contact the company and ask if I can save the other 1/2 and use again.</li>
            <li> my hair and the fumes made it worst, so my sister helped with half of my hair, I waited 3 days to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I added this one because I was worried that my hair would look dirty or greasy while the product was in, but it didn&#x27;t.).</li>
            <li> Towel dried it and turned on the evil poodle-puffer (blow dryer).  </li>
            <li> Towel dried it and turned on the evil poodle-puffer (blow dryer).  </li>
            <li> However, this summer I became desperate.</li>
            <li> I did the keratin once before and the level of disappointment was at its highest, I was at a salon</li>
            <li> The product itself doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, but the fumes burn my eyes really bad.</li>
            <li> I tear up really bad every time I apply it.</li>
            <li> This product produces lot of fumes and burns eyes badly.</li>
            <li> I saw that some reviews said that the fumes were bad.  </li>
            <li> maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> but over all the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> it is extremely bad for your health.</li>
            <li> I lost faith in the system and went for months and months without a treatment, meanwhile the summer humidity was ruining my life (every day bad hair day).  </li>
            <li> I am almost always disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a perm and hated it</li>
            <li> The heat with the treatment will create an awful smell.</li>
            <li> Straightening worked fall through spring on the east coast of the USA, but summer was horrible.</li>
            <li> The fumes were some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled on any hair product.</li>
            <li> My hair is just terrible</li>
            <li> Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product.</li>
            <li> Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write this review until my 2week Caribbean wedding/honeymoon because the humidity there is insane.</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product did wonders to my hair! It&#x27;s so much easier to deal with and it cut down the time to do my hair in half. My hair was thick, corse, and looked dull! Now it&#x27;s straight and smooth and has life. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. I NEED IT IN BULK!! I&#x27;m middle eastern with frizzy, unruly, half way curls. This smoothed it out just as well as the coppola keratin treatment I got at the salon! Great price, i would buy bottles but I dont know if it expires. I bought the lg size. I have short hair and got it thinned so I can straighten it all the time, I think i have 3 more times to use up the bottle but I totally over did it the first time. Make sure you don&#x27;t oversaturate your hair bc then it takes forever to flat iron it out so follow directions and save the product!!</li>
            <li> I love this Keratin treatment, it leaves your hair smooth and frizz free. Very harsh smell so make sure you wear a mask or apply in an well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten very well</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but this product deserves every star! I have been having my hair straightened at a salon for ten years, and finally I can do it myself at home for a fourth of the price.  This product is the real deal, the same as my hairdresser was using and charging me a fortune for.  My hair is normally super curly and course.  But with this treatment, my hair is silky soft, and straight.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I did have my daughter do the straightening for me, because it is difficult to do the back of your hair by yourself.  The video provides exact instructions, and I followed each step.  This is the same way they do it in the salon.  I did put a fan in the window to suck air out of the room, and I had another fan blowing on our faces while she was using the flat iron because that is pretty much the only time there are any fumes.  You couldn&#x27;t smell it anywhere else in the house.  I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for two days, just to make sure, and it is perfect.  Love this product!! Same as Brazilian Blowout!! EXACT SAME!!</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference in my hair, I have had this treatment professionally done and have done it numerous times at home. I followed the instructions painfully to a t, have the right shampoo but still 2 days later my hair is the exact same, which isn&#x27;t normal. I also didn&#x27;t get booklet shown in pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product before, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results I got from this product that it seemed wrong not to share. My hair varies from wavy to slightly curly with lots of frizz. I followed the directions listed for the product and watched the how to video on the keratin research website. I didn&#x27;t have clarifying shampoo, so I used baking soda. I washed my hair twice, blow dried it, applied the product as instructed (making sure to use a fine tooth comb to get out all excess product), let it sit for 20 minutes, then straightened it with 7-10 passes for each section.  I didn&#x27;t find the fumes to be too overpowering while straightening as some others mentioned, but it did burn my eyes as I was applying the product. I set up a fan to blow on my face and it seemed to help. I waited exactly 24 hours before washing it out. I wanted to wait longer, but I got impatient. I am what I would call a hopeless romantic when it comes to hair products. Anything that promises to strengthen, give more shine, straighten or repair my damaged hair - I buy and try. I am almost always disappointed with the results. So even after reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I was very skeptical. But to my amazement, this product actually works! My hair is soft and shiny - and best of all straight! I added the photos to this review, because I know sometimes you need to see it to believe it. The first photo is my hair after blow drying with no product. The second is how my hair looked after the product was applied and I straightened (I added this one because I was worried that my hair would look dirty or greasy while the product was in, but it didn&#x27;t.). The last photo is after washing my hair for the first time - I did a ten minute blow dry with no product and it looks like I spent the usual hour straightening my hair. I am so happy with the results! I would 100% recommend this product. I will try to update this review after a month or so to mention how theresults have held up.</li>
            <li> This is great for moisture. But my hair starts curling up after a couple washes.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about buying the Keratin system online.  I had the treatment professionally at a salon and they used a different brand, but I wanted to try to see if I could do it at home to save time and money.  This product doesn&#x27;t have the exact same effect at home as at the salon, (it lasts about 4 weeks at the longest, as opposed to a few months at the salon) but it&#x27;s a fraction of the price to purchase the Keratin treatment and then maintain it with the GK Conditioner and Shampoo.  I&#x27;ve noticed if i use other shampoos, it degrades the Keratin a lot quicker and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look the same.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use with great results</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t work at all. and I left on my hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this at home and I&#x27;ve taken it to a salon to straighten my 3B hair. Without salon expertise, this makes my hair shiny and soft and more manageable but not especially straight. At the salon I was able to achieve almost completely straight hair with one application and it&#x27;s still going strong three months later with sulfate free shampoo. If you have strong unmanageable hair, I would give this a try. I don&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will only buy this brand for now on package came faster than expected this my second time purchasing this item so far so good! I&#x27;ve done all together at least 8 keratin treatments with the last bottle I love that I can do a treatment every 4-6 months and not have to worry about my curls being overly preocess with keratin It washes out gradually giving me my natural curl pattern back.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I only use it on my bangs, but it works better than whatever they used when I got it in a salon. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. My bangs still grow at a healthy rate and feel healthy too. I don&#x27;t know if it would fry color-treated hair or not. The product itself doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, but the fumes burn my eyes really bad. I tear up really bad every time I apply it. My bangs will be perfectly straight for about a month or two. You need to use sulfate-free shampoo afterwards (every wash) or it will come out sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been getting the original Brazillian Blowout every four months for a few years now. I love it but not too crazy how flat my hair gets. After they removed the formeldahyde from the product it didn&#x27;t last as long either.I decided to try to do it myself at home so I could only do the top portion of my hair to keep some volume. I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $300 to experiment. So I purchased this product. The smell of this product, the way it burned my eyes a little, reminded me of the original Brazilian Blowout product. Sure enough it worked as well! I used a clarifying shampoo, followed directions and purchased a flat iron that heats up to 450 degrees to do this. I am over two months in and my hair is still straight and shiny. LOVE IT!  Just be sure to wear a face mask..</li>
            <li> This product is the first thing that has ever worked on my hair.  I do not have actual curls.  You could describe my hair texture as deep-fried straw with a fresh &amp;#34;I just stuck my finger in a light-socket&amp;#34; style.  My daily routine for work involves be getting out of the shower, towel drying my hair, and throwing that sucker up in a tucked under pony tail.  Voila! Elegant style for my life as a hard working RN. However, when I want to get fancy shmancy it takes a little more work.  Blow drying my hair takes about 20 minutes. When I use a round brush to blow it out I wind up with the perfect look...in the 80&#x27;s. Then I load on gobs of anti-frizz serum and go at it with the fiery death of a flat iron. Straightening my hair takes nearly 1 hour to get the puff out. By then my hair is a little crunchier and my lungs are sufficiently filled with the essence of freshly smoked anti-frizz serum.  After all that work I walk outside in the Southeast humidity to have my hair rebel against me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after that brief overview of my hair, here&#x27;s how the product worked out.  Putting it on was pure torture. My eyes were pouring like I had just watched Titanic for the first time at the right time of the month.  I stuck my head out of the bathroom window while a fan blew directly at me causing my newly drenched locks to splatter on my cheeks.  New idea! I decided to finish the process on my back porch. Next time I will buy pool goggles and a gas mask.  That should fix that problem. After complete application I still have over half of a bottle left.  Blow drying my hair was the same issue. I did that on my back porch as well, but still didn&#x27;t get much relief from the fumes even in the open outdoors.  I should have added a fan.  Other than my neighbors thinking I was crazy, my hair was dry, but still fluffy.  I then broke out my handy-dandy flat iron to commence the ritual hair frying.  I started with small little sections like a good girl, but by hour 4 I was getting sloppy with it.  I finished in just over 4.5 hours. And guess what!  My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  Well duh! I just straightened it with my burning heat-stick. It looks like that anytime I straighten it. Big whoop.  The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined. It felt funny, but it didn&#x27;t look bad or weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept with it overnight and proceeded with the moment of truth. The real test...the first wash!  I only waited 24 hours because I&#x27;m impatient like that and the product claims that you only need to wait overnight so I put it to the test.  I washed my hair with ion keratin shampoo and conditioner. Towel dried it and turned on the evil poodle-puffer (blow dryer).  I used no product, only a paddle brush for detangling. I then dried my hair only with my fingers for less than 5 minutes and it was miraculously straight!  No puff! No Fluff!  I took 3 more minutes to quickly blow it out with a round brush and a tiny bit of anti-frizz serum.  My hair looks just like it would after I burn it to a crisp with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures provided. Disregard the mean face...I&#x27;m not mean...always.  The pictures are only before treatment, after washing and blow-drying, and after adding a bit of serum and a round brush quick blow-out. No flat iron was necessary. I did not see a purpose in taking a picture after applying the product and straightening because, as I said, of course it&#x27;s straight after I &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it.ppy with it.  I finished in just over 4.5 hours. And guess what!  My hair was straight just like the before and after pictures on the manufacturer website!  Well duh! I just straightened it with my burning heat-stick. It looks like that anytime I straighten it. Big whoop.  The surprising part is that my hair didn&#x27;t look grungy like I would have imagined.

            <li> As I mentioned before, its a perfect product. Couldnt change anything about it. I hope they stick around forever.</li>
            <li> Got here on time and seems to work as expected</li>
            <li> I truly cant live without this. I&#x27;ve use it in my hair 4 times already and always come back for more. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I have had this treatment in a salon before. It cost me $350.00 dollars &amp; I had to wait 3 days to wash it. The first time I used Brazilian Keratin Treatment 300 ml I did it exactly how the directions said. The second time I used it I did a quick job not sure how it was going to turn out. Both times I have used it , my hair looks better then the treatment I had done in a profession salon. I get complements on my hair daily now. My hair is so shiny a extremely soft. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Incrediable, works as if u got it done at the salon. Your hair will turn out straight once done. Also an important tip; while putting the product in hair and geting ready to flatiron it continue to flatiron until that waxy feeling is gone and when ur hair feels super duper soft ur all set! U wont get the same results completly if that waxy texture is there.</li>
            <li> Better than what I thought. Looks amazing. I just love it.</li>
            <li> It finally occurred to me that I could do my own Brazilian blow-out, and this product lasts the same as if I had gone to the salon. I think it is the same product. This can be done at home for a fraction of the cost of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Great product. I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to live without it now!</li>
            <li> Amazing results but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 months,  it really controls the frizz &amp; you can style your hair any way without the limp effects  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> is ok my hair look pretty</li>
            <li> This product produces lot of fumes and burns eyes badly. Very hard to put it on.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!!!! YAY!!!!  My curly/frizzy hair is quite manageable during the Fall, Winter &amp; Spring months. But every May/June, I have to go to my salon to have a keratin treatment done for the summer. And even when done in the salon, it only lasts about 2 - 2.5 months leaving me with the last few weeks of August into September looking like Gilda Radnor. I&#x27;ve tried both the non-formaldehyde and the kind with formaldehyde, and the kind with formaldehyde is the ONLY kind that works for me. I figure if I only have this done once (maybe twice a year, I&#x27;m fine...) THIS STUFF WORKS - JUST AS GOOD AS IN THE SALON - PERIOD! I am so happy! My recommendations are to follow: Shampoo hair 2-3 times. Do not use conditioner. Dry hair (Yes, you will now have the exact look you are trying to avoid...) Apply the treatment to your dry hair and comb through throughly. NOW - GO OUTSIDE ON TO A PORCH, DRIVEWAY, DECK - ANYWHERE THAT&#x27;S OUTSIDE, with an extension cord and blow dry your hair. The heat with the treatment will create an awful smell. Then section off your frizzy, sticky hair and flat iron it. I use the Remington S9520 2&amp;#34; Flat Iron and I love it. I kept the treatment in my hair for 3 days (just for good measure) and washed it. The results are the exact to when I&#x27;ve had it done in the salon. I can easily get 2-3 treatments in this 1 bottle, and it was easier to do to myself than I thought! I&#x27;m one happy camper! (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you with words how fantastic this product really is... I know this product has a lot of reviews therefor my review may not seem necessary but I have to tell you that this is the best keratin treatment you&#x27;ll ever come by. After applying the treatment my hair is extremely soft my curls are almost gone and my hair is just ...did I say SOFT??? And super shiny. If you read the bottle it says you&#x27;ll wake up with beautiful hair everyday... Well let me tell you that it is absolutely true! I wake up with beautiful beach waves that I can&#x27;t stop touching... I&#x27;m like a teenager on a first date...cannot stop touching my new soft shiny, freeze free hair. Now I can style my hair straight and it&#x27;ll stay that way no matter how humid and hot the day may be. And if you are wondering... No I did not get paid to post this review nor I am a robot. If you have questions do ask me. I know what it like to blow dry your hair pin straigh just to see it like that until you think about humidity. How I applied the treatment: It is a must that you wash hair with clarifying shampoo at least three times, and please wash it like you are trying to take out a stain from clothes ( delicate clothes though) after that, blow dry hair straigh and then devide hair into three sections.  Take the product and pour about three ounces (for just past shoulder lengh hair) into a container, Then  start by taking very very small sections of hair and then wearing gloves dip three fingers in the product and work it into hair from top to bottom, now use the small thoothed comb and comb the section a few times making sure it&#x27;s saturated but almost no product it&#x27;s coming out infront of the comb, if more than half a penny size it&#x27;s coming out you are applying too much product, do this with the whole head and then blow dry hair using a brush to dry it straigh... This will help tremendously when you start flat ironing. When flat ironing make sure that you take very small sections of hair as this will ensure amazing results, make sure that sections are not more than a quarter inch thick and Definately make sure that they are smaller than the width of your flat iron. Ps make sure you blow our your hair outside of your house an use a fan when flat ironing the hair. Enjoy your new hair.</li>
            <li> First, about me:  I&#x27;m a 50yr old white woman of German descent.  I&#x27;ve always had thick, wavy/curly hair, but not in a way that was attractive. I always had to either perm it and go full curly, or straighten it. Straightening worked fall through spring on the east coast of the USA, but summer was horrible. My hair would turn to frizz at the first sign of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser told me about this treatment about 5yrs ago. As I was about to go on a cruise to the Caribbean in July, I jumped at it. OMG! I loved it!  My hair staid straight. It was shiny, healthy and luxurious. It lasted way longer than 6 months, and i got so many compliments on how great my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2yrs ago I got it done again. This time, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed. It didn&#x27;t last as long. However, this summer I became desperate. I couldn&#x27;t afford the $350 price tag at the salon this time, so I decided to try it for myself. My hair is short and has a lot of layers and I was afraid that because I can&#x27;t really section it out, that is screw this up. I ended up putting it on like hair color, then combed out the excess. I left it on for 3 days before washing it out, and it came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shiny and smooth!!!! I paid a lot for a professional keratin and this does the same for a lot less in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The fumes were some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled on any hair product. My eyes burnt and I coughed and felt like I was choking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I left it on overnight like it said, but the texture on my hair was really gross. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair. After a couple of shampoos, the coarse, thick coating went away and my hair was left nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I&#x27;m pleased with the results. My hair is now soft, silky and straight.</li>
            <li> It took me about 3 hours to do the treatment. The results have been comparable to the salon treatments I&#x27;ve had done before. There has been some humid and rainy weather and my hair seems to stay smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  However, I bought their shampoo and conditioner because I think each person just has to try different brands of home keratin to find the one or ones that work best for her individual hair.</li>
            <li> Worked really well. It was more liquid than a previous one I used that was thicker so it was easier to work with. Has lasted quite a while now. No damages. My ends ended up dry because I had bleach but I doubt it was the product - my hair is fragile and I wasn&#x27;t surprise. All I had to do was cut the tips. Love the product !</li>
            <li> Love Love Love. This stuff is amazing. I left it on 2 days as my hair is very fizzy. I color my hair very 4- 6 weeks as I&#x27;m going grey early. I also live in south florida. My hair is 100% fizzy free. I will have to see how long it last. I took me about 3 hour from start to finish. I blow dryer my hair in a bedroom with the ceiling fan on. Than I flat ironer it. 7- 10 times each in small peices. It did burn my eyes a little when i was doing the peices close to my face. Overall it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t to bad.I will be ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product I just must. I have VERY frizzy, curly, unmanageable hair and nothing works for me besides flat ironing of course. My morning routine consisted of annoyance, frustration, and plenty of meltdowns. I did the keratin once before and the level of disappointment was at its highest, I was at a salon all day $150 later beautiful hair but it lasted 2 weeks. I was back to my morning frustration. Recently I was looking into a new salon to try it again but that price tag had me reconsidering. So I went online and started researching. I found this product! Was I amazed with the results. At only $59 it was a great price cut. The process took about 3 hrs and I was able to do it myself. And the greatest part? I have left overs!!! So in a few months when I need a touch up its free! No more spring $150 every few months. I recommend this product to anyone it is the best $59 you can spend on any hair product. Make sure to read all the instructions and follow them to the letter for best results. I substituted the clarifying shampoo that they recommend  with Suave daily clarifying shampoo which I purchased at my local drugstore for only $1.19.</li>
            <li> Im pregnant and it was a great solution for my crazy hair and frizz my hair looks more controlled and healtier</li>
            <li> I think I read every single review on here before purchasing this product. I felt encouraged by the positive reviews and immediately applied the product upon its arrival a mere two days after ordering.  I have curly thick hair that I like to wear straight...but after struggling to tame it I normally give into throwing it into a pony tail curly and frizzy. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process was somewhat grueling, I have a lot of hair and I also have human hair extensions so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m thrilled. The fumes are no joke! Lots of tears flowing, nose blowing, burning nostrils and throat, ack.  It sucks to say the least. After washing, drying, applying, 20 minutes of waiting, drying and flat ironing ad nauseum, it finally looked smooth but with the teensiest amount of poof on the ends. If I&#x27;d spent the same amount of time on it without the keratin I&#x27;d have had the same results so naturally I was a tad doubtful. I waited about 36 hours and washed and the poof on the ends is literally gone.  I use Lanza Keratin oil sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I touch the ends up with Moroccan oil and they&#x27;re gone.  My hair is bouncy and smooth and takes so much less time to dry and style.  I can even curl my hair (the kind of curls I want...not the ones I naturally have) without the frizz and tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would also like to add that I work out...a lot...which means I have to wash my hair...a lot...and while I don&#x27;t expect this will last as long as the bottle says it has been a week since application and about five washes and my hair is beautiful.  Extensions and all.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007IZZ2KS Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment 300ml Professional Complex Bottle Free Shipping Available Worldwide]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start out by saying that if you do this treatment properly, you will have fantastic results! I have had numerous keratin treatments on my hair, I&#x27;ve done several myself as well as having them done in the salon. The product by keratin research is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and is better than the treatment i received in the salon (coppola). To start, make sure you allow yourself enough time to do the treatment properly. Because i colored my hair immediately before starting the keratin, the entire process took approximately 4 hours, including time to color. My hair is medium length just touching the shoulder. My hair used to have a beautiful curl, but after 2 babies and hormone changes its become a coarse, brittle frizzy mess that would start to frizz up as soon as I stepped out into any sort of humidity. make sure you have the proper tools you need. The best flat iron is one that will heat up to 450 degrees. Anything less than 430 degrees will not give you lasting result. You will need 2 pairs of gloves. A cheap plastic pair (like the kind that come in the boxed haircolor),use these to apply the product. You will also need a heavier pair of gloves when flat ironing your hair because the hair gets extremely hot1 I used a pair of heavy cotton gardening gloves, the kind that have little grippers on the palm area. These worked fine. You will also need 2 combs. A rattail comb to get small sections of hair, and a medium thickness comb for combing the product on your hair. Have clips for sectioning.First color your hair as you normally would. When washing out color, use a clarifying shampoo. I used neutrogena anti-residue. I also mixed a tablespoon of baking soda in with the neutrogena shampoo to remove all excess color residue and any build up on the hair. Do not use any conditioner! Next blowdry the hair with medium heat. You don&#x27;t need to blowdry into a style, just get the hair dry. It will be the most unsightly frizzy, dry mess you have ever seen! Don&#x27;t be alarmed. It will look fabulous when you&#x27;re done the treatment. When hair is dry apply the product. I put mine into a small spray bottle. Go close to the roots without actually touching the roots. Start from the back nape area and work in small sections. Spray the product close to the roots, work it through to the shaft and the ends with your hands, and comb through so its even. when all product is applied. comb through again and remove any excess product that the comb is picking up. Blowdry your hair carefully and slowly, get it into the style you want. Make sure you blowdry as smoothly as possible. Use your round brushes and make sure the top is dried to the side and style you want because it will stay that way! Next put on your other gloves for flat ironing. Start in the back taking 1-2 inch sections. make sure your iron is hot enough. I did 10 passes for each strand. You should see vapors/steam coming from the hair. This is the product sealing into your hair. If you have any crazy flyaways when the ironing is complete, take a small amount (Just a dab) of the keratin and smooth down the hairs as you would with a styling product and your fingers.Don&#x27;t use any clips or ponytail holders or get the hair wet or sweaty! If you do, you&#x27;ll need to fix those with the flat iron BEFORE you wash your hair out the next day. I did my hair in the morning and washed it the very next day. Make sure you use a sodium-free shampoo. Do NOT use the neutrogena anti-residue on your hair after a keratin treatment!!! It will remove the keratin. The shampoo i used is Keratin Complex  keratin color shampoo by coppola. its available at cvs for $20 and probably cheaper on amazon. You can use any sodium free shampoo but you must use sodium free if you want the product to last. My hair was immediately super shiny and easy to blowdry. Its straight but still has some body to it. I absolutely love the product. i used about 4 ounces on my hair so i will have more than enough for another treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this product was great. Although it&#x27;s only been a couple of days (don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the long run), um very pleased. It took me approximately an hour and 45 min, start to finish. I waited over 24 hours before washing the first time. The blow dry time after the treatment was like 3-4 min!! So much faster. I actually didn&#x27;t use any product and my hair was so soft. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is all I use. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a year and a half every 2-3 months and my hair has never looked so flawless. I wish it lasted longer but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why this product didn&#x27;t work good  my hair is not even curly and I never color my hair before  i just have some waves and I got the keratin treatment on Thursday and I wash my hair today Sunday and I still not have straight hair.really sad about it, because I paid someone to come home and apply the keratin on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Really good product I love it!</li>
            <li> Product if fabulous and the results of a Brazilian Blow-out are fantastic.  Protects the hair and makes it so much more manageable and smooth...you won&#x27;t believe it.  No need for a flat iron.  Blow dry the hair and it is straight and smooth!  Love this product and the results!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Keratin Research Forte (which is good for 1a-3c curls).  I have 3b hair which is thick, course, curly, and frizzy.  I bought it on eBay because it was a little bit cheaper and free shipping.  I think I paid about 28 dollars for a smaller bottle.  My hair length is a little bit past my collarbone.  It took me about five hours to do.  My mom and sister helped me out in our bathroom.  We had a floor fan going and the window open.  My eyes burned a little bit, but it wasn&#x27;t anything unbearable.  It didn&#x27;t even smell badly; it actually smelled like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work, to be honest.  I watched the video on Keratin Research&#x27;s website a few times.  My hair just never looked -- I don&#x27;t want to say saturated because you don&#x27;t want it to be saturated -- but it just didn&#x27;t have the same covered-in-solution look.  My hair didn&#x27;t really become any more manageable to blow dry or straighten either.  Some people have noted that during the process, they saw and felt an immediate change in their hair texture.  That didn&#x27;t happen for me, so I had my reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I washed my hair around Day 3 or Day 4 with salon-quality products (be sure to avoid sulfates!), and I felt the silkiness in my hair right in the shower.  While washing my hair, I noticed my hair was getting curly again.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect it to straighten my hair.  So when I am done washing my hair, I notice my hair isn&#x27;t frizzing up, tangling, or doing any of the normal things it usually does.  It was silky, soft, and I could run my fingers right through it.  I even took a hairdryer to it on high heat, medium speed and ran my fingers through it for a little bit while it was wet for a minute or so.  I have such loose and shiny waves now.  I have only washed it once.  Next time, I won&#x27;t take a dryer to it to see how it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 23 years, I have had unruly hair.  I am the only jewish person in my town, so I am sick of standingout with my big, curly, nappy hair.  It really is so manageable now.</li>
            <li> Salon results at home ! :) no other product worked for me until i discovered this :)</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME! So much less expensive than hair dresser. Brought product to my hair dresser and is same directions that they use. I made sure to follow directions exactly on my daughter and so far 3 months later her hair is still straight.</li>
            <li> It ok, if work on hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked well. Did have a slight smell but the results are fantastic. Not sure how long it will last but will definitely be reusing. Gentle on the hair.. It didn&#x27;t make hair stick straight or limp. It really eliminated frizz.</li>
            <li> This works great! Brazilian blowouts are so expensive, so I was really happy to find this product. And it actually works! It did take a lot of time &amp; elbow grease (4 hours) and also made my eyes and nose burn, but it was definitely worth it. Also had a funny smell, but that went away as soon as I washed it out (3 days later). I have long hair but still only used about 1/3 the bottle. My frizzy hair that used to take forever to dry is now smooth and dries in no time.</li>
            <li> I love this keratin treatment. I have naturally very curly/coarse/frizzy hair. I live in the southeast where it gets extremely humid in the warmer months. I have done this treatment twice now and I have well over half the bottle left. I will say that i do not see immediate results. The day that I do complete the treatment and style my hair - I see no change. However, after about 24 hours my hair becomes very smooth, and it lasts like that until I wash it again. I blow-dry/straighten my hair 2x a week. With this treatment, I hardly have to do any styling in between washes. It stays straight. It use to take me almost an hour to style my hair after washing, now it takes about 20 minutes. My hair stays smooth and shiny, and I get compliments daily. I will say there is a ingredient in this treatment that really burns my eyes during the initial application, but goes away once I dry my hair. I had a professional coppolla keratin treatment in a salon ($150), and this home treatment lasts WAY longer. I only have to do it once every couple of months. If you have coarse/dry/curly/frizzy hair like me, buy this product! You wont regret it! Make sure you read the instructions!!</li>
            <li> Great results which lasts about a month. Tried this twice within the past 3 months. The softness and shine only lasts for about 30 days (wash my hair every other day to every 3 days with sulfate free products). Due for another treatment but don&#x27;t want the breakage. - from a salon keratin treatment regular of 4+ years / every 4 months</li>
            <li> this product is amazing i dont have to blow dry my hair for an hour to get it straight 10 minutes top and it is nice and straight love it!!!</li>
            <li> please dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> Was great fumes are just too strong</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottles to try first. First of all I was expecting to wait about a week or week and a half for the product to arrive but it arrived in literally 2 days... Thank you!!! So I am half black and half white and always wear my hair straight, also live in Florida... My hair is just terrible and I did this treatment to myself, as grueling as it was, and I waited 2 days before I washed it out. The wait time was not bad, my hair didn&#x27;t look as bad I thought it would, and besides I put my hair back and up anyway...don&#x27;t know if we are supposed to do that or not but I did cause I had work. So I washed my hair, with regular shampoo btw, my hair curls were much looser.... I blow dried and the hair was so straight already and nowhere near the puff ball it usually is so then I straightened and it was done. Cut down on drying time and strAightening time to about half. And my hair is bouncy and soft... It looks great, way better than it usually does after I blow dry and straighten. I think I might wanna put a relaxer in my hair for a bit and then do the keratin treatment again. I have no relaxer in my hair this time so this worked awesome. But I really never wear my hair curly so I think I&#x27;d like to relax it permanently a little and then put the keratin in it to help that. I am very pleased with the purchase. Really happy about my hair !!</li>
            <li> I love this brand as it does not have that funky smell like the other keratin treatments and it works</li>
            <li> For approximately $80 and an hour of my time, I got the same smooth, straight(er) hair that would cost me at least $350 in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product because it had good reviews, and the at-home professional-quality keratin treatment I&#x27;d used in the past, QOD Happy Hair, was no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the QOD, but I&#x27;m very happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine caucasian hair that is curly underneath and wavy on the top.  If your hair is as curly as mine, don&#x27;t expect your hair to be stick straight all throughout from this product or any other keratin treatment, but it will be much more manageable from doing this.</li>
            <li> As the keratin treatment i used to use is no longer available for purchase, ive been looking for years for a new one. this has been the closest in quality to my favorite one. theres a certain product ingredient in this one and in the good one i used in the past that makes it smell significantly worse than other treatments however it also works significantly better. personally id go for this one simply for the quality. and it is SOOOOOOOO much cheaper than getting it done at the salon (as it should be done every 4-6mo minimum) and its pretty easy to do yourself.</li>
            <li> The 1st time I got my hair done was in Thailand in a salon and they had a hair straightener just for wet hair! They did that &amp; washed out my hair blow dryed it and straightened it again, they did great it took 10 hours!! My hair is very thick, and it lasted 1 year! But this product is also great for temporary use for when I don&#x27;t go to Thailand!</li>
            <li> This is the best product to buy if you want to own manageable beautiful hair. It performs beautifully straight from application to finish. And your hair is, essentially, perfect for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle in March 2013; my second in November. That&#x27;s how long each bottle has lasted. My hair is long; to the middle of my back and one length. I color it, too. And I live in a hot humid area of the United States. My hair is protected from weather elements in using Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment. Humidity cannot penetrate and frizz my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year was the best that my hair has performed in the nearly three decades of living in this hot humid climate. Worth every penny. Cuts down drying time. Cuts down maintenance time. Eliminates the need for other products. I find that I, now, simply don&#x27;t need any other products other than argan oil. I use argan oil on the ends; however, since incorporating this particular product, I don&#x27;t need as much argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the product owns a strong smell when dispensed but will not linger. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it gives my hair great shine and instant body</li>
            <li> Worked really well, easy to use, smell wasnt horrible however I didnt know it had formaldehyde in it so I threw it away after I found out.  I will be researching for a treatment that does not contain formaldehyde in it.</li>
            <li> followed the instruction, easy to apply,  the smell is not bad as i imagine it would be, stings eyes a bit. My hair has never felt so soft and shiny afteeeerwards. Its&#x27; been weeks and my hair feels and look softer, shinier and no frizz. I wonder how long this will last, but Im really  happy with the results and i don&#x27;t have the need to use any of the heated hair appliance, hair is indeed healthier in the long run. Great product!</li>
            <li> Before I begin, you should know I’m not being paid to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, frizzy, thick, color treated and unruly hair.  I like to do my hair myself.  I call it my “me time”.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to get my hair done by others and I’ve saved a lot of money over the years!  And, if there’s a product I’m interested in, I will put it to the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different keratin smoothing treatments and this is one of my favorites!  I just love this treatment and Keratin Research products.  For a full review on this product, please watch my video &amp;#34;Keratin Hair Treatment by Keratin Research, Inc. Review&amp;#34; on my YT Channel (StyleByZaza - no spaces).  It lasted about 3 1/2 - 4 months.  It would have lasted a lot longer, but I workout 6 days a week and I sweat A LOT!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently did a review on their other treatment, Inverto Revolution Keratin Hair Treatment, [[ASIN:B008F8DZCY Keratin Hair Treatment Formaldehyde Free with Inverto 120ml Includes Mask  and Clarifying Shampoo]].  You can also watch it on my Channel as well.  If you have any questions, please leave them on my YT Channel and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to answer them.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a fabulous day!  StyleByZaza</li>
            <li> Good for first timers, after trashy different story. Not a fan here</li>
            <li> hmm i do not even hav that much curly hair, it just kept my hair straight and smooth for a day. not worth the money. and time</li>
            <li> I am one week post treatment and have straight, soft, smooth hair even after washing three times and swimming once.  I have had two keratin treatments in a salon, one Copolla and one Chocolate keratin treatment. I have also purchased a couple of at home treatments that had OK results. The Copolla treatment had the best results.... But cost me $300 after tip in the salon. That was until I used this product. My hair is almost too straight. But I have been using a large barrel curling iron to add some body waves to it before work and it seems to work well and look very similar to the style that would take me 1 hour to achieve before.  I have left it air dry and it was still smooth.  For anyone who has struggled with frizzy hair you will know that washing and going without tons of product is asking for a frizzy mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the treatment itself, I followed the directions on Amazon. I washed twice with clarifying shampoo, dried my hair (it was a huge frizzy mess) then I applied the product, coming it through with a fine tooth comb over and over again I let it sit for  20 minutes then blow dried it again. Then I began flat ironing small sections, making several passes. I didn&#x27;t wash it for two dayside  flat ironed it each day.  My only negative observation is that it did burn my eyes while applying the product, but not while flat ironing. It does contain an aldehyde, but so does many of the household  products we use daily.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Just wish I had another pair of hands to help me put it on in the back of my head.  It works like it says it does.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly/frizzy hair. This is the best product I have ever used. It was easy to use and do yourself, saving the huge cost of salon treatment. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is sick of spending so much time with products that claim &amp;#34;straight for 3-4 days&amp;#34; only to have the frizz back as soon as the humidity goes up or it rains. I won&#x27;t ever go without keratin again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the low price- this is the good stuff. I have been doing my own BKT for several years now, after trying out most of the major brands in salons. Until now my brand of choice has been Coppola, but I found myself out of product and without enough time to order more and wait three days for it to cure. After reading the description and reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try. Application is easy, it just takes patience. I agree with other reviewers about the fumes- they were worse than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, so make sure you have good ventilation and take breaks if you need to. I washed after about 36 hours. My hair is wavy and frizzy without treatment.  After treatment it is like a soft curtain of hair straight down my back; exactly what I wanted. I cut my drying time from 35 minutes to about 10. No need for flat iron. My hair is blonde with heavy highlights and I did not experience any issues with color change. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to get this Brazilian treatment after having my hair professionally done.  I loved the professional one, but this doesn&#x27;t hold up compared to that.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again.  I applied it as directed and my hair is still just as curly.  I even still have my bottom half professionally done, so I can tell the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a salon to get a keratin treatment done on my hair with no luck. Everywhere I asked, the stylist kept on telling me &amp;#34;nobody does that anymore.&amp;#34; My hair is real curly and coarse so I need to get one done in order to get a nice, smooth blow dry and ironed straight hair. I started &amp;#34;googling&amp;#34; myself and I found this product. It works amazing. No more frizz. Hair looks healthy. I followed the instructions on the container. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely straighten, but makes  hair very silky and manageable.  I had gotten a perm and hated it and when i flat ironed it the ends looked frazzled. My hair afterwards is much less curly and very healthy.</li>
            <li> This product makes exactly the same than other cheaper products. The seller tells you that the product works &amp;#34;express&amp;#34; but it is not true, since you need to to exactly the same than other products (and the results remain in your hair about 2 or 3 weeks if you are lucky). Do not waste your time and your money paying almost $60 for this product if you can buy three of them with the same results.</li>
            <li> This is a worthwhile product if you are OK with it only lasting 4 weeks.  For reference, I have long, semi-wavy, healthy Asian hair, with a small amount of frizz that pops up if I don&#x27;t dry and straighten my hair every day.  Each hair is fine in diameter, but I have a ton of it.  I&#x27;ve had both Japanese thermal reconditioning and Brazilian blowout treatments done many times in the salon, but was looking for something more affordable that could be done at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment about 4 weeks ago---it was easy to do by myself, and the fumes were not that bad.  I followed the instructions on the website, and left the treatment in for 48 hours.  During that time, you can definitely tell that there is something sticky on your hair, but it&#x27;s not that bad.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would have noticed but me.  After the 48 hours, I was happy to find that my hair was noticeably straighter. It felt &amp;#34;denser&amp;#34; if that makes sense---so instead of having a head full of fine flyaways blowing around all the time, my hair hung better---as if each strand was more solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past month, I&#x27;ve probably washed my hair every other day--alternating with sulfate free shampoo, and cleansing conditioner.  While my hair still hangs nicely if I blowdry and straighten right after my shower, you can still tell that the frizz and puff is coming back, mostly on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, so I used half the bottle the first time---and its probably time to do another treatment.  Apart from the fact that it only lasted a month, the other main drawback is the fact that it SIGNIFICANTLY lightens your hair.  Everything online suggests that you can just color your hair a shade darker initially, but that&#x27;s not very helpful advice for people who are already using the darkest blue-black.  You can&#x27;t go any darker than that!  So the bottom line is, you&#x27;ll have to weight the benefits of having smooth hair vs dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have been getting keratin treatments in salons for about 5 years now.  I was a little afraid to do it myself, but gave it a try.  This is EXACTLY the same stuff that has been used in my salon....the smell is exactly the same.  My hair came out PERFECT!!!!!  I saw that some reviews said that the fumes were bad.  I used a fan to blow the fumes away from me and didn&#x27;t suffer a bit!  One word of caution ...this is a long process (well worth it though).  It&#x27;s much easier if you can convince a friend to do your hair....hard to do it correctly on your own head.  Make sure you have the right tools and don&#x27;t be afraid that you are burning your hair when you see the steam come off the flat iron.....it really is the product burning off.  If you don&#x27;t do it completely, your hair will be sticky until you wash it and it probably won&#x27;t last as long since it won&#x27;t be fully sealed.  Watch the video online....very helpful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused at all the positive reviews. This stuff straightened my hair for exactly ONE WASH.  Doesn&#x27;t straighten curly hair like the other keratin treatments I&#x27;ve gotten. It&#x27;s supposed to last 3-6 months. Definitely not for people with curly hair that want it to be straighter. Who knows... maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for not reading the ingredients before buying, this product contains formaldehyde. I found out the hard way. My eyes started stinging because of the fumes during the flat ironing process. There should have been a health safety warning like using masks or goggles. But it definitely works tho. I wash my hair daily and it&#x27;s still straight after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It worked just as well as a salon treatment.  Couple hundred dollars cheaper!</li>
            <li> I used to have it done at the salon. Now my mom and I split this bottle. We get 4 treatments out of it. Same results as the salon. I actually think it is better than the salon because they skimp on the product at the salon to save money and don&#x27;t spend as much time sealing it in. I have to redo about every 3 months.</li>
            <li> This treatment is excellent. If you&#x27;re looking to make your hair look AND feel healthier get this product. Not only this, but if you have very curly/wavy hair like me that can get very kinky and annoying to manage, this treatment will relax your curls a good amount while keeping it looking slightly curly and beautiful. I kept the product on for four days instead of three without washing my hair since my hair is Curlier than most. I wanted to relax my curls and I tried getting texturizers and everything, but I think I finally found the best product for my hair. I highly recommend getting this keratin treatment.. Don&#x27;t bother spending $300 in the salon because this does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, shoulder-length, bleached and dyed. It has a natural wave to it, but not much curl. After following the instructions to a T, my hair felt sticky and kinda hard. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 days. I&#x27;ve been using Organix Brazilian keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner since then, and I haven&#x27;t needed to straighten my hair for a month.</li>
            <li> I love, luv, love this stuff!  I am a natural curly girly gurl (a mix of 3c/4a) and was great with maintaining my hair until I moved to super humid 365 a year South Fl. :-/  Once I moved, managing my curls became a battle, so I went on a hunt for something that would allow me to take back control of my curls.  And, this product is IT ... the bomb diggity, the shiznit, and so on so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I did not want to take out my curl at all, I just wanted to make it more manageable in the humidity. It was love at first use. I am now on my second bottle and am a forever fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using, I follow the directions to the letter and I leave it on for about 2 days.  Again, I did not want to take my curl out, so I keep an eagle eye on it.  After I wash it out, I have 3b/3c curls all over and win every battle with humidity -- even the humidity in the Dominican Republic in July couldn&#x27;t win against this product. Yea!  I&#x27;ve also used on my mom&#x27;s 3c hair and she gets stopped all the time regarding her beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you are wondering whether I have a straightened my hair after using the treatment, yes, I have and my hair straightens like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up ... I have super heavy color in my hair and when I touch up my roots, the keratin treatment does fade.  No biggie since I just redo the treatment a couple of weeks after I redo the color since the bottle lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy curls! :-)</li>
            <li> Worked well. I have thick, medium length hair and only used about 1/3 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for damaged hair especially if you have wavy/curly hair that you straighten.</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Daughter has long hair and there is probably enough in this bottle for three treatments.  We did one treatment about four weeks ago and she wanted to do another one right before school started so we just did another one.  The results are even better after the second treatment.  She still runs a flat iron over it if she wants it to be really straight but just a few passes and it only takes a couple of minutes. Before the treatment it took forever to get it straight and she would often still have some places that didn&#x27;t look totally straight.  Now she can get it to look perfectly straight with minimal effort and the straightness lasts.  She is so much happier with her hair now and the daily complaining about how much she hates her curly hair has finally stopped! :)</li>
            <li> Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later. Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy. It simply did not work for us, now my head itches every day and I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product. We had all the windows open, fan blowing and we were sitting near the open door. Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat. It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend products from this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> I waited 4 weeks after my first treatment to review.  I&#x27;m a bit of a cynic and have never had a hair product really change my hair for the better,  so I kept my expectations low and took a gamble on a product that for me, was not cheap!  I&#x27;m a 40 year old caucasian with semi-fine color treated, hair (red, which I usually do myself, but go to the salon about 4 times a year) about to collar bone length and my texture is.......Bad! My hair was kind of wavy until I had kids, and then it turned weird, with curl at the nape of my neck, straight but FRIZZY. I read all the reviews, and followed the instructions I saw in many of them. (My one complaint about the transaction - my package was shipped with NO instructions in it!) I didn&#x27;t buy any special clarifying shampoo - I used baking soda paste, then dish liquid - did it twice and my hair was squeaky clean. The product is like a thick, milky liquid.  I poured some into a cheap, travel size 1 oz spray bottle. (I ended up pouring a little bit back into the original container when I was done) Sectioning off my hair, I started at the nape and got a very small section at a time, sprayed a few squirts on there, and combed through with a very fine tooth comb. It took about 20-25 minutes to get my whole head soaked, I waited a bit and blow dried, then waitied a bit more before I ironed.  I have a pretty hot iron, about 420-430 degrees, so I wore a glove on the hand that was holding the hair.  I ironed each section 10 times - it took about 30 or so minutes to do it all.  My hair felt a teeny bit weighed down, but sooooo soft.  I waited about 30 hours before washing again, and WOW I was blown away....It was dry in about 3-4 minutes my hair was almost frizz free!! If my frizz level was 100% before the treatment, it was cut down to about 7% after.  And here, about 4 weeks later, I can see a little frizz starting to return, I&#x27;m maybe at 20%.  Still, this morning, I blew my hair out (took maybe 5-6 minutes) and ran the iron through it for maybe 2 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go.  This treatment did NOT make my hair pin straight, but maybe its my cut, I have ends that just want to flip up - I&#x27;m okay with that. The only negative about the treatment was it lightened my color, made it a little coppery.  My biggest praise is how SOFT and practically frizz free my hair is.  I&#x27;ll probably do another treatment in a couple of weeks.  I am IN LOVE with this product!!</li>
            <li> Because I have a personal vendetta against unreasonable pricing, I refuse to pay for any type of beauty service that I can do myself. I live in New York City, and even with a deep discount I was paying $150+ for a single Keratin treatment. So when I realized I could buy professional grade keratin treatment for $60 off Amazon I figured it would be a great thing to add to my at-home beauty arsenal.  Even with the good reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect this treatment to work as well as the ones I&#x27;d gotten at the salon (I didn&#x27;t want to set myself up for failure by having unreasonable expectations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this treatment worked BETTER than the salon treatments I&#x27;ve had. I have very curly hair, and so my stylist warned me several times that the salon treatment would only eliminate frizz, but not relax my curls very much. Of course she was right; the first salon treatments I had made my hair slightly less curly (i.e. very wavy), but not straight by any means. So, assuming this stuff would be less potent than the salon treatment, I overcompensated by leaving it on for 48, rather than 24 hours (don&#x27;t worry, the directions specifically say people with very curly hair could should try this). I rinsed and styled normally this morning and my hair is MUCH straighter than (a) it is naturally (b) it was after the salon treatment. Basically the treatment both eliminated my frizz AND relaxed my curls. To be honest, they&#x27;re a little TOO relaxed for my liking, so I advise you not to underestimate the strength of the treatment! In conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Better than salon quality (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to comb into hair&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant smell (better than salon version)&lt;br /&gt;- Wasn&#x27;t messy&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair super smooth&lt;br /&gt;- Noticeably relaxes/straightens curly hair&lt;br /&gt;- One treatment uses about 1/6 of the bottle, so comes out to about $10 per treatment (I have thick, medium length hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions (but you can findthem online if you search the brand)&lt;br /&gt;- Must buy supplies separately (mask, gloves, clarifying shampoo etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNINGS/RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;br /&gt;- Be extremely careful not to drip any solution onto bare skin; I got a few drops on my neck and the skin became red, dry and&lt;br /&gt;  itchy even though I immediately wiped it off with a wet paper towel (resolved after 2-3 days)&lt;br /&gt;- Try to flatiron in a well-ventilated or outdoor area if possible (e.g. porch, patio, balcony) because flat-ironing released copious&lt;br /&gt;  fumes&lt;br /&gt;- Directions recommend a flatiron capable of reaching at least 410 degrees; mine only goes up to 400 and it worked just as well</li>
            <li> My hair is course, curly (tight about 3b/3c) reaching about two inches past my bra-strap. I bought this product on ebay two years ago and have been using regularly every 4-6 months. At first I was repeating use every other month feeling that my hair would be curly again. Over time the effects seem to last longer with every use.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- But expect to see loss of curl when you let the treatment wash out of your hair completely if you have been using it like I have. I&#x27;m not trying to be natural at the moment so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but it doesn&#x27;t look nice either. When I feel my hair has become unmanageable I repeat the BKT process.&lt;br /&gt;- The fumes are unbearable at first. When applying the cream it stinks to high heaven burning my eyes, nose and throat&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Have a fan, turn on your vent, open your window and door. Also helpful to suck on a throat lozenge or hard candy and drink plenty of water during the application process to keep your throat from completely drying out. Take a break for some fresh air too. This really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;- Shedding happens I think because there&#x27;s a lot of protein that makes up these treatments. Keratin is a protein and I&#x27;ve seen similar shedding when doing deep conditioning treatments pack full of it too. Thankfully the shedding stop after all is done.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Try a moisturizing deep conditioning treatment overnight before doing this BKT. This time around I used a protein treatment like a baka...don&#x27;t do that! Hahah.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a looooong process.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Listen to some music!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- My hair even damaged (in some parts) looks AMAZING! I couldn&#x27;t get my hair this straight without come parts looking fried before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;- It lasts me around two months. It will be wavy on the third month and starting to feel like it needs to be redone on months four.&lt;br /&gt;- I dont have to wait 3 days to wash my hair. I&#x27;ve washed 24 hours after with good results but lately I would rather wait a week before washing again. I may co-wash after day three however.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve tried a relaxer and nothing compares to BKTs especially since you can still dye and bleach your hair as long as it is BEFORE doing a BKT and after the BKT has left the hair. I&#x27;ve dyed and bleach and dyed my hair again and my hair is in good shape considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because of the fumes. It is really harsh. It took me a few tries to figure how to operate around it and once when I wasn&#x27;t careful I had got sick with chest pains and soar throat. So you really need to be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my blog @ http://myfasthair.com- I&#x27;ve tried a relaxer and nothing compares to BKTs especially since you can still dye and bleach your hair as long as it is BEFORE doing a BKT and after the BKT has left the hair.

            <li> Followed the directions step by step.... I&#x27;m very happy with the results!! The smell was not bad compared to what I experienced at the salon, my eyes did sting a little when doing the hair strands closer to them but that&#x27;s it. Will buy it again but the bottle should last a long time :)</li>
            <li> Works amazing if you follow directions</li>
            <li> I never did a keratin treatment before but it took well to my hair. I lovee the results!! It did make my eyes water when I blew it dry but over all the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad. I left it in two days before I washed my hair and it was fabulous. Love it. Great price and a great product</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!!!! maybe would have worked if my hair was thin and wavy... but my hair is super frizzy and course. I applied it and it was SO greasy. I left it in for three days and washed it out- it was okay, but not super straight like when I had the GK treatment done. Literally one week later my hair is thick and frizzy. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> I have previously had about 5-6 keratin treatments at salons that were specified to last 3 months, and 1 keratin treatment that was specified to last 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with the ones that last 3 months or even longer.  I&#x27;ve always followed the protocol of no sodium, no SLS shampoos, I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one started out okay, but only lasted about 3 weeks and was not nearly as good as the salon, even when I held off washing for 3 days. My hair frizzes up again within a month, and while I like the price, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as healthy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the salon</li>
            <li> I have really curly frizzy hair. This product could be better but im not complaining. Maybe it depends on the hair type you have. It did turn out really straight after the process and i left it in for two days just to be sure it stays straight, but it didnt. It turned out wavy but not that frizzy. Its still smooth and easier to straighten, but i wish it would of stayed really straight after i washed it out. I would use it again just because it makes my hair more managable and way easier to straighten!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome... My hair was so dry and frizzy and now became so soft and shiny. ❤️</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money for my Keratin at the Salon and was getting so hopeless with my hair until I tried this one! I&#x27;ve already bought twice. Just one bottle is good for me and my 2 daughters. Thanks for this product! I&#x27;m buying another one soon for my sister!</li>
            <li> Excellent , very easy to used .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hair dresser  I recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I am curious why there are so many positive comments, I have did it twice, and my hair going to worse. The whole process takes long long time, I don&#x27;t recommend it to others, waste time and money and damage hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write this review until my 2week Caribbean wedding/honeymoon because the humidity there is insane. Remember on friends when Monica goes to the carribean and her hair is so huge she has to get it in braids? That&#x27;s only a slight exaggeration of what my hair does. This stuff is awesome! Expect to spend at least 3 hours in a well ventilated area, because although this stuff smells fine (coconutty!) It will burn the craps out of your eyes. Have serveral pairs of heavy duty professional latex gloves, as you&#x27;ll want to change them out. Well worth the time and money though. I actually swam on this vacation because I knew I could come back and wash my hair, throw some gloss in there, and let it air dry! Or blow dry it with my fingers and a quick once over with a flat iron if we were going out. That was unheard of before! I have hair to my shoulder blades, medium thickness, and I only used about 1/5th of the bottle, which means I can do it several times again!</li>
            <li> i am not a professional but I&#x27;m pretty sure i followed the instructions very accurately, it only straightened my hair about 40% i have thick hair normal softness I usually do the chi transformation system and it does much better with it, of the only reason why i bought this keratin is because I couldn&#x27;t find my chi treatment anywhere, I&#x27;m very disappointed and please don&#x27;t waste your money on this and get yourself a proper shampoo with a conditioner better than all these harmful formaline packed treatments.</li>
            <li> Excellent, better than paying the hair salon $150 and it actually worked better.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair Saturday so far my hair looks great. Will keep you posted as time goes on. We&#x27;ll just have to see after the first wash</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing, I had some crazy frizzy, dry hair due to a perm gone wrong. I was really skeptical about purchasing this product. I went for it because I thought my hair couldn&#x27;t get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I bought this :)&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it help with the frizz it changed the feel of my hair. My hair is smoother and it feels so much healthier !!! I do advice that wearing gloves is a must, and make sure to clarify your hair before applying the treatment</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually worked great.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to wait 24 hours before you wash your hair.  You&#x27;ll see results after 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> I loved,mt hair was very good!!!</li>
            <li> bought this for my gf and she loves it. I love it cuz it cuts the time I wait for her to prep in half!</li>
            <li> So this product seems to work out thus far definetly left my hair much smother, straighter &amp; easier to manage since my hair is very thick &amp; course, super frizzy since it was fired by a perm. With 100 degree TX heat &amp; humidity its a pain to waste time on your hair if it&#x27;s only gonna lady 2 day. Did want to note that I used my bare hands no gloves &amp; did notice a very dry feeling in my hands some what concerning because if it&#x27;s this drying to my hands what does it do to the scalp &amp; hair?&lt;br /&gt;Any way I&#x27;ve used global keratin &amp; this is comparable to that for a fraction of the cost. Only thing is GK only lasted me a month using the sulfate free shampoos so we will see how long this last I will up date in a month. I&#x27;ve also used Japanese straightining system liscio &amp; loved that left my hair more straight but also didnt last long &amp; that at a salon is $400 &amp; up. Wanted to order that from Amazon but was scared to do my self because if done incorrectly you can have serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a photo black &amp; white one be for treatment, one directly below right after tx applied to hair, &amp; one to the left after hair washed w/ treatment left in for 48 hrs, blow dryied &amp; flat ironed. Not sure if I&#x27;dlikw how it would look sir dryied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how my hair is after doing treatments with this product, but the fumes are bad news. I week after doing my second treatment, my eyes are STILL swollen, red and itching, and I&#x27;ve been having sneezing fits daily! My nose feels absolutely raw inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is especially alarming because I had excellent ventilation going during the treatment and even did it in two parts--half my hair one day and half the next. For ventilation, I had a high-speed fan sucking air out the bathroom window, plus a large fan on high blowing fresh air onto me as I worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end, I had developed some techniques to keep the smoke away from my face while flat ironing (hold the straightener high above the head rather than on the side as usual), but it may have been too late as I had already gotten a couple of potent hits of smoke to the eyes that had made them sting and water like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I reacted more strongly to the fumes this second time--my body knows its enemy now, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine going back to life before keratin, but I&#x27;m shelling out for Coppola next time because I can&#x27;t deal with the consequences of this brand and I&#x27;m concerned for my health! From what I understand, Coppola has formaldehyde-like chemicals, too, but maybe in a lower percentage and they&#x27;re not quite as fumey.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for your face. Large bottle</li>
            <li> Loved it!! I have medium length naturally curly hair and frizzy by nature. I use this as instructed I wash my hair out with an herbal essence shampoo that was sulfate and paraben free. My hair came out so soft and shiny and I barely had to do any touchups with my straightener. To help with the upkeep I bought a satin pillowcase to sleep on and I have really notice the difference. I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I started using this product a year ago after hearing about it from  a T.V. personality. She was going on and on about it and they should her before and after results.  She mentioned that it jad famalduhide in it and that was one of t so I looked it up on Amazon and decided to the main ingredients and if they ever took it out she would be like a crackhhead in an alley looking for it. Well let me tell you I have never made a better decision. Love it, love it.  It has not only made my hair manageable sine I don&#x27;t have any other chemicals in my hair but my hair has grown trumendasly. I color my hair often (the greys) and it still works. I Iove it cause I can still wear my hair non-straight if I want.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  I started doing my own brasilians and tried this formula and another coco one (forget the name).  This one is better so I went back to it.  Honestly works just as good as when I had it done in the salon.  I also like that you don&#x27;t have to wait to wash your hair with this.</li>
            <li> As advertised. However, nothing mentioned about the Percentage % of formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> I have biracial hair. From my roots I have about 4 inches of natural hair and then I have hair to my mid back that had been straightened using a Japanese system. I want to grow out my curls but don&#x27;t want to lose the length. I use the keratin treatment on all my hair and it makes it very sleek and manageable. I keep using this product and cut the Japanese treated hair as it goes and will transition back to natural.</li>
            <li> After treating my hair with this product I am glad I gave it a shot! It is MUCH CHEAPER, and MORE EFFECTIVE at taming down frizz, and calming my curls than the Coppola Keratin Treatment I had been using before! I am Brazilian, and have medium size/ beachy curls... My main issue is how puffy my hair gets anytime it air dries. With the help of this product, my curls are CALM and WAVY once air dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Keep in mind you&#x27;ll have to disregard the poor grammar  and punctuation in the product directions!**&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, know that this keratin treatment will leave your hair shiny, healthy and free of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and give this product a try before spending over $100 on another brand.</li>
            <li> The product is okay i didn&#x27;t like that it not come with instructions, it also didn&#x27;t come with a cleansing shampoo. The smell was horrible i could even breath, my eyes were watering and my nose started to be come runny while i was blowdrying my hair. However while i was straightening my hair the smell was gone, my hair did end up smooth  and straight.</li>
            <li> This worked as good as the Rejuvenol product which costs twice as much. Additionally, this one does not require four days of waiting time. My hair is nice and silky.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking my help for my damaged coarse hair for over a year and this keratin treatment was what I was looking for.  My hair has not felt this heathy in many years. Didn&#x27;t make it perfectly straight but it is soft and flows now :). I highly recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail, fairly quickly. The product does have a very strong odor that gave me a headache while I was waiting the 20 minutes and blow drying/ flat ironing it. I only left it on for two days ( I have very curly and dry hair). With this said, the product does work. It&#x27;s only been two weeks but my hair has not frizzed up, dries well and straightens nicely. I will definitely use this again however, I may wait an extra month in between just because it seemed so strong. Overall, good product just be prepared for the smell.</li>
            <li> Wow! Excellent produce~ I used it on myself with fantastic results! Why pay a hair-dresser : )</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly. This definitely looses my curly down. It works for my hair. I know it is not for everyone. I have a friend who did this; it did not do anything for her hair. However, it did mine. Depends on how stubborn your hair is, how your hair&#x27;s reaction to the treatment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  My hair was dull/frizzy/Curley and now it shines and is easy to manage.  I even went to the beach and my did not frizz at all.  A million thanks to the makers of this product!!  It&#x27;s amazing!! The only downside is the strong smell when applying the product.. I will continue to use this wonderfull product😃😃!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, Polynesian hair. Curl level is about a 2b and without product it frizzes easily. I&#x27;ve had an express Keratin treatment done at the salon and I loved it.  However, my hair grows quickly and I don&#x27;t have the money to keep it up.  I researched heavily and decided on Keratin Research. I did the treatment with the window open and two fans, one pointing directly at me head on to blow the fumes away and one to direct fumes to the window.  Despite the fans, the fumes were overwhelming and my eyes did sting a bit. I followed the youtube directions exactly however I did not wash for 2 1/2 days. Today was my first wash and so far so good! Blow drying was quick, the drying time was probably half of what it normally is and I just ran my fingers through as I dried.  My hair dried straight with no frizz. I did a quick run through with the flat iron to touch up and give it the sleek look. My hair looks awesome, it looks like I had a blow out at the salon! Based on other reviews, I&#x27;m curious to see how long this will last.  I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and curly hair. This product is amazing though the effect doesn&#x27;t stay longer than two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> I have really thick wavy/curly frizzy hair. I was hoping that after using this product I could go without the usual blow dry and flat iron that I have to do just to make my hair look normal. I did the treatment according to the directions and I have to say it did make my hair smooth however it looks limp, greasy, and stringy. It is still wavy just really flat. I still have to blow dry and flat iron too so it didn&#x27;t even help with that. It feels like I have a coating on my hair. I can&#x27;t wait until it washes out. I would rather have my natural hair than stringy greasy looking hair. Now my hair is falling out too. If I run my finger through it or when I take a shower there is HANDFULLS of hair that comes out. As much hair as used to get cleaning my hairbrush out after a month or two now I&#x27;m loosing that much everyday. Thank goodness I have a lot of hair but I&#x27;m not sure how much more I&#x27;ll be able to loose before other people start to notice. I wish I would have never touched this stuff. Oh and the whole process of doing it takes forever and the fumes are horrible!!!! It burned my nose and eyes I could hardly breathe!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who wants a keratin treatment, and is willing to go through the time consuming process of doing it while saving yourself hundreds of dollars. I have SUPER thick, curly, frizzy, long hair. It&#x27;s highlighted as well and was in an unmanageable state before I did this. Personally, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $400 at a salon, so instead I bought the full kit (cleansing shampoo, treatment, shampoo &amp; conditioner for after) for about $95 and watched a million YouTube videos to prepare myself. I also bought a new straightener (one that went up to 450 degrees) on here that wasn&#x27;t more than $25, and all the tools id need (hair clips, hair dye brushes, fine tooth comb, plastic gloves &amp; heat resistant comb thing for straightening). I got myself all set up, and mentally prepared and I went for it. It was such a long a grueling process with my type of hair, and in pretty sure I oversaturated it with the product, but after 4 hours my hair was straight as a board. Of course, final results aren&#x27;t until you after you wash your hair -- and these results were absolutely incredible! I had loose beach waves, no frizz. I was in hawaii the next week where it was humid, rained and I spent all day in the pool/ocean and still, no frizz. 2 months later and the effects are still completely obvious, just a few more curls came back, so I&#x27;ve just now done my second one. Took a bit less time since my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick or curly and I&#x27;m excited to see how it looks after a wash with 2 rounds of this in 2 months. The only drawback of doing this yourself is the fumes! You really need to have a fan pointed at your face to keep your eyes from stinging... However using goggles and a face mask, while silly looking, would probably be the safer bet. All in all I&#x27;ve spent about $150 for everything for 2 treatments (the small bottle of keratin lasted through both and I still have some left, and I have A LOT of hair). If you&#x27;re good with at home beauty stuff, want more manageable hair and don&#x27;t wanna break the bank, this is the product for you. Hands down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied from it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is Brazilian or not, and I honestly don&#x27;t care. I have had 2 keratin hair treatments before and none of them worked, my hair was still the same, which was somewhat curly and dry. I applied this treatment myself, I didn&#x27;t believe it was going to work but IT DID! The application process might be a little tedious and hard, you have to be very careful with your eyes once you are drying it, do it in an open place, otherwise the air is also hard to breath, don&#x27;t do this often, it is extremely bad for your health. Anyway, the results were amazing!! I leave the product for 3 days and then I washed it again, I let it dry naturally to see the real results. It was a nice straight and smooth hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It has been almost 3 weeks and my hair just feels like precious. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair now!!</li>
            <li> I bought this while living in a super humid area. Worked well to manage my usually ou tof control hair. Only issue, is that it is so strong that I felt I was burning my eyes. The second time I wanted to use it, I actually took it to a salon for them to put it in for me.</li>
            <li> Best product ever!!!!!!! You will notice a huge huge different . I&#x27;m so so happy with results!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this only because I have frizzy hair. I have nature light wavy hair. I never had any keratin treatment on my hair before this. So I was worried how it will turn out. I have medium length hair and it turned out better than I expected. My hair felt soft, very smooth, shiny and not greasy and zero frizz! I spent a lot of money buying Living Proof anti frizz stuff but it would still look frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;My advice for someone who wants to try this product for the first time would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have long and thick hair get help from someone else to apply this on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a salon cape, proper mixer bowl, and a brush. I bought all the salon products from Amazon too for under $10&lt;br /&gt;3. Do it in a ventilated area. If you can&#x27;t manage that then have a fan on you.&lt;br /&gt;4. Watch the video!!!</li>
            <li> No bad smell or fumes and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to try this based on the reviews! I followed the directions closely, fought the fumes with multiple fans (and eventually some goggles-the eye sting is real!), and even waited beyond the recommended waiting period to wash out my hair with sulfate/sodium-free shampoo and conditioner (per the bottle&#x27;s recommendation for curly/resistant hair). Nothing! I have somewhat fine yet curly/frizzy hair, that&#x27;s dry but not damaged (no coloring, rarely treated with heat) that flat irons easily yet the only thing this treatment accomplished was to make my hair dull and crispy. No smoothness, no straightening, it just looked super damaged. I just got it back to normal with a deep conditioning treatment made for post-keratin treatments (my normal deep conditioners weren&#x27;t fixing the damage). For those of you giving this a try take the precaution to avoid skin contact seriously! I got it on my hands and it dried them out ridiculously fast despite washing them with soap and water immediately after.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my sis and she said very good and pleased for that</li>
            <li> I had been getting keratin treatments done for years by a friend of mine who would charge me $150 a treatment (in the DC area, that&#x27;s pretty cheap).  When she moved away, I went to another stylist who was offering a similar special, and her treatment did nothing for my hair.  I lost faith in the system and went for months and months without a treatment, meanwhile the summer humidity was ruining my life (every day bad hair day).  I read the reviews on this project and studied the application process.  It seemed like it would work so I ordered it, along with a stylist applicator brush and bowl.&lt;br /&gt;I have hair about to my waist that is very thick and would be much more curly at the ends if not for the previous treatments.  My roots consist of a series of cowlicks.  I bought Suave daily clarifying shampoo and washed my scalp and roots (about the length of hair to my ears, as I was only going to apply the treatment to this length of hair) three times as indicated, towel dried, and blow dried my hair.  Clipped my hair up and started applying at the back of my head using the flat applicator brush and combing through to make sure I had an even consistency.  Did the sides and then looked over my head to ensure my roots were all evenly saturated.  I would comb through several times ensuring that just a tiny bit of product collected on the comb.  Let it sit for 30 minutes or so (whatever the instructions say), and then blow dried again (didn&#x27;t really try to style here, just wanted to get it dry, but do brush through so you can run a comb through while flat ironing).&lt;br /&gt;Flat ironing is the most important part above and beyond.  I made somewhere between 4-8 passes on each strand depending on how long it took the steam to dissipate.  Sometimes I would run it through 9-10 times and if it still steamed I just moved on.  You just have to judge it for yourself, don&#x27;t risk burning your hair.  I wore a heat resistant glove I had received with a hot curling iron.  This part took meabout an hour and a half to complete (but again, I was just doing the length from root to ears).  I had a side part and really ensured that I took the thinnest sections up top because my primary issue was fly-aways and frizz.  I waited 48 hours and washed with this L&#x27;oreal shampoo (the best SLS free shampoo you can get for less than $10!!) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HIH67A/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and applied some Wen pomegranate to the ends.  My hair looked EXACTLY like when my original stylist used to do the treatments.  If it doesn&#x27;t hold up like those treatments did I&#x27;ll come back and update, but I am very very optimistic about this treatment.  My only question about the product would be to know what the percentage of formaldehyde is that is used.  I would assume it&#x27;s somewhere between 5-15% just based on the degree to which it irritated my throat/eyes (about as much as the treatment I used to get) but I did it in my bedroom with multiple fans running and a window open and locked my dogs out of the room.</li>
            <li> This is the first at home Keratin treatment I&#x27;ve purchase and I love it. I&#x27;ve had the professional treatment done in the past and started to get annoyed by them not really doing a good job. I had never been a flat iron user and was able to manage getting this treatment done on myself. The second time I did a better job at getting all my roots straightened. It works great. I have done it twice and I now believe I am doing a better job than the salon since I know which areas need the most attention or heat. I will continue to purchase and do the treatment myself. Great money saver and why not learn how to manage your own hair. Since I started doing my own hair it has grown from shoulder length to mid-back. I think having my hair more manageable (after the Keratin) has reduced the breakage since it tangles less and I have to use little to no heat. I only do the Keratin on my roots or new growth and my ends are still very straight. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Helped reduce the frizz off my hair. I had purchased earlier and decided to go for a bigger bottle. I do this treatment every 3 months and helps my hair stay straight.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Results only lasted about 3 weeks in my hair and it didn&#x27;t get my hair 100% straight. But I will keep using what I have left in the bottle. It def helps some</li>
            <li> worked great. used it without the flattening iron. visible difference in the hair texture. made the color look better. received many compliments. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product does the job my hair feels healthy, product reduced my breakage and hair looks and feels great again.</li>
            <li> JUST TO LET YOU KNOW AFTER YOU PUT THIS TREATMENT IN YOUR HAIR YOU MUST, I REPEAT YOU MUST GET THE &amp;#34;Rejuvenol Keratin After Treatment Shampoo to wash your hair with or you will wash the treatment out with the first wash. You should get the conditioner too, it&#x27;s only like 20 dollars for both. You MUST get the shampoo, conditioner is optional, but you can&#x27;t use ANY OTHER conditioner on your hair if you don&#x27;t get the one made by Rejuvenol with this dertin treatment in your hair. I got this treatment done in a salon, and it was WONDERFUL. It made my hair straight and soft, could just get up, comb through, and it was very silky and amazing, I would roll the window down on the car and look in the mirror and just let my hair blow and smile, because my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft and manageable. I was in the PASSENGER seat when I did this just so you know lol. I used the Rejuvenol Shampoo and Conditioner and my hair was great. This is worth it. And the Keratin treatment cost $300 in a salon, so this is well worth it if you are going to be doing all the blow drying and flat ironing yourself. It&#x27;s awesome, but again, you MUST GET THE REJUVENOL SHAMPOO  AND CONDITIONER. You use anything but that, and you will wash this treatment out of your hair. I don&#x27;t know if it wasThis keratin treatment that is being sold here, but I had a keratin treatment and it was simply amazing, you will love your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife love it, now she have the hair beatifull.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable keratin treatment and found this one now these are my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;As directed I poured about 4onz of treatment in a bowl u cannot use it from the bottle, washed my hair, dried 90% with a blower and a brush, separated my hair into 4 sections, I started with one section of hair and spread the treatment little by little with a tail comb until I had placed the product in all my hair. ( WARNING the fumes are very strong and u need to do this outside with a fan on or a room with good windows and the fan), I left the product on for 20 mins, then I go ahead and dried my hair with a blower again sanctioning my hair, last I started flat Ironing my hair with small pieces of hair it too forever to flat iron my hair and the fumes made it worst, so my sister helped with half of my hair, I waited 3 days to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST WASH.&lt;br /&gt;My Hair was very straight I let it air dryed and it was so soft and straight just a little frizzy so I flat ironed it just took me about 20 mins, I usually take 1hr or 1 1/2 to flat iron my hair, by the end of the week I noticed I bouxh of my hair was falling off I&#x27;m not sure if it from the changes my hair is undergoing or is that product. But I see hair eveywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 WASH.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair but my hair this time was a bit more curly it took me longer to straightened about 30 mins, it wasn&#x27;t as straight as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed my hair again, I would only give this product a 3 start because of the fumes and hair lost I&#x27;ve experienced using it, I will see if it last at least 3-5 months, I wasn very happy with my first results, also every time I wash my hair I wash it with keratin shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product worked great !  The process takes time but it is worth it for me to save on the salon price.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver for me and my childrens hair!!!  We use it every 6 months and for those 6 months we all have glossy, shiny hair that is not affected by the Florida humidity!</li>
            <li> I love the results of this keratin. I don&#x27;t love, however, the strong oder when blow drying my hair. Otherwise, It&#x27;s excellent!! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be so good.  I used the Pravana perfection before and was angry at myself for ordering a less expensive product. However, I am thrilled so far. My curly, frizzy, dry hair is straight, smooth, and soft. It has only been a couple of weeks so far. I am not sure how long the result will last. The Pravana lasted 6 weeks. I will try to update my review. I washed with Pantene clarifying shampoo before the treatment and did not wash my hair for 3 days. I am currently using the sulfate free Ion shampoo from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my corse hair, it doesn&#x27;t make it straight by any stretch of the immagination HOWEVER it adds shine and really cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> This works!!! I used to pay over $200 every three months at hair salons. After researching home keratin treatments and reading the reviews for this product I decided to try it. My hair is naturally very curly and frizzy. I applied this product as directed and my hair feels silky, smooth, healthy and super shiny! It looks just like I stepped out of a hair salon! I suggest for very curly hair like mine, to apply flat iron at 450 and atleast 7 passes and in a well ventilated area. Also I suggest leaving the product on (it can be uncomfortable bc you will feel/smell product in the hair) for atleast 48 hours before washing out and touch up w flat iron during that waiting phase of the treatment. Great results. Will definitely use it again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... I have very curly hair... It didn&#x27;t take away my curls, but just made them a little looser and a lot easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I first thought this was a good product because it took rid of all fizziness in my hair. However, after taking the third shower my hair returned to its normal condition!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Honestly I was a little nervous to try it after I received it and saw there were some misspelling in the directions but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk. One piece of advice, get a face mask because the smell really got to me. But the results are amazing and exactly what I wanted. I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair anymore. Hopefully itwill last month&#x27;s like the keratin I&#x27;ve had done in salons. But so far, the results are way better then any I&#x27;ve had done professionally. Happy customer here!!</li>
            <li> This item works for about 3-5 hair washes then it rinses out. It does not necessarily last 30 days. I have tried several brands and this one is not the best. For the price I would not recommend this one. For it to last longer I would not wash it out for two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found the review helpful.</li>
            <li> I love it!! My eyes didn&#x27;t suffer at all.  My hair is blonde and highlighted. The t keratin is fabulous. My hair look beautiful.  The best part I did myself.</li>
            <li> This product worked so well - my hairdresser did it for me -- it made my thick, curly, coarse hair satiny and so easy to blow-dry.  I have used other straightening products over the years, none of which worked as well as this!  It seemed strange to apply, blow-dry, iron it in w a flat iron, THEN wash again and apply hair mask/leaving it in for 15 minutes, THEN rinse and blow-dry AGAIN, but it really really is shiny, silky, manageable.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The first time I completed the application process for this treatment, I declared to my husband: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if this gives me the most wonderful hair ever, I&#x27;m not doing this ever three months. A couple of times a year? Maybe. What a pain in the rear!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that being said, it&#x27;s a little more than three months later and I&#x27;m buying this again. The results were better than I had dreamed. While the straightness of my hair (I have very coarse, frizzy, curly, unruly hair as I am 75% Italian, 25% German) lasted about three weeks before my curls began to creep back into play, the frizz has been kept at bay for a full three months. Styling my hair was easy and a no hassle at all. I loved taking a shower and putting a spritz of mousse in my hair and letting it air-dry. Voila! I was done styling and I looked fabulous. If I felt like using the straight iron-- running it through my hair for five or six minutes and I was DONE! It used to take me a minimum of 20 minutes to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was such a relief and I feel so good about how I looked that now I&#x27;m on the other end of that first statement. Now I&#x27;m all: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if it takes me three hours to finish this smoothing treatment; I&#x27;m ordering it NOW!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s available (hopefully for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing I wanted to say was that I have long hair. when it&#x27;s wet it reaches the middle of my back and I only used 1/2 the bottle the first time. I threw away the rest, I hated to, but I this time I&#x27;m going to contact the company and ask if I can save the other 1/2 and use again. Since there is no &#x27;mixing&#x27; ingredients, like with hair color, I think it would be ok, but I&#x27;m still going to find out for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is now 100% frizz free and 80% curl free. This product will not make your hair 100% straight. So have a reasonable expectation. It only takes 15 minutes to fix my hair now,  instead of an hour.  It is pretty easy to use. I did it myself actually. Just make sure NOT to wash the product out of your hair for at least 72 hours. I also suggest putting a teaspoon baking soda to your shampoo and wash your hair twice before applying the product, instead of buying a clarifying shampoo. Why buy a clarifying shampoo if you can use it only once? Do not use any conditioner before applying the product. I recommend this product. Now I can enjoy the summer and go swimming more often without worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical , but since my last salon treatment didn&#x27;t last very long ... I wanted to try something to offset the cost . I ordered this with the shampoo and conditioner that goes with it . All I can say is WOW!!!! My hair is so soft and it took lmaybe 20 minutes to dry and straighten and it had gotten to where it was taking me 45min to an hour!! The smell is great but you do need to be in a well ventilated room with a fan . The chemicals did irritate my eyes but I positioned the fan to blow in my face and I was fine . I used maybe a third of this bottle --- so I would say $20 for 3 times is an AWESOME deal! I have thick , coarse , wavy hair that dries into a frizzy mess. This worked great for me! Took about 2 total hours , but I left it in a while -- normally takes 4hours when I go  to the salon .  I just followed the directions some of the others posted along with the process my hairdresser uses and I had no problem . I just used latex gloves to put on my hair and then combed it through to distribute evenly. Hope this is useful for those looking for a great alternative that works and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other products and great that you don&#x27;t have to wait three days to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend someone without salon knowledge applying this product to your own hair!  I do possess the knowledge to apply the product as well as researching online and watching videos to make sure it was similar to other keratin treatments i&#x27;d assisted with and it was.  i absolutely love it.  i did it in my very small bathroom with the door closed and vent on and didn&#x27;t have any issues with the chemicals smelling it up at all.  usually hair color burns my eyes and nose but this seemed extremely mild and worked very well.  I can blow-dry my hair in about 5 minutes and only have very very very minor areas where i want to pass the flat iron.  no one would notice those areas but me if i didn&#x27;t though.  I put this in before our very rainy disney vacation and i had no, zero, none, nothing, not a one piece of frizzy hair.  my hair is naturally curly and it is straight now.  still has body but it is very smooth.  i love this product.  love it!</li>
            <li> Had doubts. May not be suitable for exceptionally unruly hair,but I like it.</li>
            <li> I have gone to the salon 5x over the past 5 years to get the Brazillian hair straightening treatment done. Each time I loved the results, although I felt that my hair was a little flat. I did this treatment 3 months ago and it worked very well. It was not quite as effective as the salon treatments, but it certainly made my hair much more manageable without leaving it quite as flat.  I am due for a touchup and I will definitely use this product again. You should definitely wear a mask, use rubber gloves, and have a fan blowing in your face as the chemicals are very irritating to your throat and eyes. This was also my experience in the salon.  Overall, I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cheaper option than the salon, just know that your hair may not come out as straight ( my hair is long and very frizzy/wavy).</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment due to high reviews. I am 60. My hair is very damaged with repeated coloring, bleaching, and overusing hair iron. I think I must have put a bit too much on hair because it felt gummy after drying and ironing.  I waited a few hours short of three days before washing.  It is shiny, silky and smooth.  Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In October 2014 I had a Keratin treatment at the Salon and it was great it cost $80.  I have a daughter with hair all the way down her back that is super curly/frizzy.  I wanted to treat her hair but the cost would be too much at the salon.  I researched many keratin treatments on the web and decided to try out the Brazilian.  My daughters hair turned out great.  I took about 2 1/2 hours to do the entire process but again her hair is super long.  I would say this treatment is not quite as good as from the Salon but almost and for the price difference it is worth it.  I bought the 300ml bottle which is actually enough to do your hair three maybe four times depending on the length. I purchase a small spray bottle at the Dollar Tree and sprayed the product on her hair which made the application process much easier and faster.  My hair was ready for a treatment mid December so I decided to use this product on my hair as well and also had great results.  The product actually smells very good like coconuts.  It does burn your nostrils a bit during the application process due to the Formaldehyde but not worth complaining about.  My hair is normally very hard to keep straight especially with any humidity at all.  Since getting a Keratin treatment my hair is so easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li> I have paid for a Brazilian Blowout, and I will never have to again. This stuff works and it is such a relief to comb through my hair easy breezy, It blow drys faster and my hair looks younger and healthier by 100 percent.  I need to buy googles because when I flat iron while putting in the treatment my eyes water but its worth it. 50 dollars for 2-3 treatments as opposed to 300 bucks. Get this!!! It works!!</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me 2 uses and I have medium length thick hair. It&#x27;s been 2.5 months so far (with daily washing) and it is starting to wear off a little but not very much. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can get close to 4  months out of it. I normally have very frizzy hair. Now, I literally wash it, spray some smoothing cream on it, brush it, and let it air dry and it looks like I just spent an hour straightening it. I save an hour every day now. Who says you can&#x27;t buy time?? I got a &amp;#34;smoothing treatment&amp;#34; at a salon a while ago and it only lasted a month. This stuff is way better. I washed it 1st with Garnier shampoo because I didn&#x27;t have clarifying shampoo. Then I blow dried it, painted this onto my hair with the brushes they use for hair color at salons. Then I blow dried it again, sectioned it off, and straightened 3 cm sections at a time about 10 times each. It took a half a day. Then I left it in my hair for 3 full days. I straightened it a little bit (10 minutes) every day that it was in my hair. No ponytails, putting hair behind the ears, etc while this is in your hair. Supposedly it will leave a permanent crimp if you do that. Also don&#x27;t get your hair wet. Aftercare: Make sure you use sulfate &amp; sodium free shampoo. And don&#x27;t put your hair in pool water or salt water. I use its a 10 with keratin shampoo, conditioner, and smoothing cream and it seems to be the best. Also I sleep on a silk pillowcase. That&#x27;s supposed to help with frizz. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps or not but it can&#x27;t hurt (unless you have acne- then stick with cotton).</li>
