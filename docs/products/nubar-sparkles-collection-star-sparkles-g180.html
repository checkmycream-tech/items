            <li>the product is great.</li>
            <li>This product has a great color with lots of depth.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying as many as I can afford!!</li>
            <li>But whatever color you pick will surely be the best but why not get them all.</li>
            <li>After the 4 coats though, THIS POLISH IS AWESOME and totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li>The prices on Amazon are exceptional and I&#x27;ve compared them to just about anywhere except most places you can&#x27;t even find the beautiful collections that are on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Just love it!</li>
            <li>Love the sparkle and a must have color!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works good as top coat .</li>
            <li>This polish makes a good top coat.</li>
            <li>it does take three to four coats on its own to provide the look in the picture though.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is nice</li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t want to miss out on the great colors offered,and you&#x27;ll find a color that fits you best.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s nice , but too liquid.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and wears well.  </li>
            <li>This polish is not as opaque as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I love it, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>absolutely love how my nails came out.</li>
            <li>My favorite silver Glitter, ever.</li>
            <li>I love and adore bling</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;m certainly glad I did--especially if you love &#x27;bling&#x27;....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it twice! :)</li>
            <li>but it is just ok...</li>
            <li>More Holos please.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on its own, or layered over a solid color for an added effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very pretty color just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;and very easy to apply as well&lt;</li>
            <li>One coat of the OPI was showing some glitter gaps but two coats of it would have too strong on the glitter.</li>
            <li>Love it- super sparkly and multi colored silvers.</li>
            <li>Looks great as a single coat on top of a color.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and can become opaque.</li>
            <li>I did not hate this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this nail polish, the shipment was very fast and</li>
            <li>Was really expecting this to be more holographic, it is not.</li>
            <li>I used three coats and it gave my nails full coverage of glitter.  </li>
            <li>really like a glitter top coat to me..</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>So pretty.!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is so pretty!  </li>
            <li>It really picks up the light and is like a shining star.</li>
            <li>Very pretty alone, or would be pretty over another color.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish because it subtle sparkle is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Very sparkly!</li>
            <li>Still pretty sparkles I guess, just not what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>I love the colour and the different coloured sparkles.</li>
            <li>I just received the product above and it is so pretty that I am ordering two more bottles.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>The shimmer is really pretty though.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I chose this but was a little worried because the pictures do not really give one a good idea of the actual &#x27;sparkle.&#x27;</li>
            <li>This is a clear polish full of holographic glitter.</li>
            <li>It will smooth out with a coat or two (or three) of clear topcoat, but it is definitely not smooth on its own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally bright glitter, very nice.  </li>
            <li>Really fast shipping and</li>
            <li>but I expected a bit more shine and sparkle.</li>
            <li>To get agood coating you need to put about 3 to 4 coats to make it really sparkle.</li>
            <li>With this product the picture is very deceptive.</li>
            <li>The glitter really twinkles and shines too.  </li>
            <li>Need lots of coats to even be seen much</li>
            <li>It is very, very sparkly and pretty holographic glitter at most angles, but it&#x27;s pretty thick, crunchy, crusty glitter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you can use it by itself or on the top of other colors</li>
            <li>It has many little particles inside.</li>
            <li>but all you have to know is that this polish is made up of different sparkly tiny tiny flex and they will sparkle like diamonds over any other product or on their own.</li>
            <li>Not only did it fill in the clear gaps but it gave a soft holographic effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>( I also had equal success when I tried it over Butter&#x27;s black sparkle polish.</li>
            <li>Great polish, I put a plain silver polish on first because this polish has a clear base.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great polish, I put a plain silver polish on first because this polish has a clear base.</li>
            <li> It is a whole lot prettier than my other Holo glitters!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a clear based polish with super silver and random sparkles.</li>
            <li> Last for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you use only the Star Sparkles over a clear base, you get a rich, soft silver grey prismatic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t chip easily, but has a weird rough texture.</li>
            <li> Star Sparkles by Nubar is a great polish and here&#x27;s why... you can use is over a clear base, a colored base or under a light color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives your polish an extra dimension without the heavy glitter look.</li>
            <li> just put it on over an OPI pink and silver glitter polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> the Sparkles collection is just that-it&#x27;s made up of tiny sparkles that you can use with two coats or over another plain of shimmery polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However you decide to use Star Sparkle, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be back for another bottle in a few months!</li>
            <li> so I plan to play with this one mixing it with or using it over some of my other products.</li>
            <li> So with all polishes you usually need 2 coats to achieve the desired shade.</li>
            <li> This polish dries to a dull finish and has no shine nor iridescencent properties whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be serious...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The sparkles bringout the color</li>
            <li> Great polish, I put a plain silver polish on first because this polish has a clear base. Very sparkly! Doesn&#x27;t chip easily, but has a weird rough texture. I love it, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Was really expecting this to be more holographic, it is not. Still pretty sparkles I guess, just not what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> I use this just on the tips of my nails. It&#x27;s beautiful and lasts a long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> Star Sparkles by Nubar is a great polish and here&#x27;s why... you can use is over a clear base, a colored base or under a light color.&lt;br /&gt;It gives your polish an extra dimension without the heavy glitter look. If you use only the Star Sparkles over a clear base, you get a rich, soft silver grey prismatic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put it on over an OPI pink and silver glitter polish. One coat of the OPI was showing some glitter gaps but two coats of it would have too strong on the glitter. I wanted my nails to look summery not disco. That&#x27;s when I decided to try the Star Sparkles over the OPI. Not only did it fill in the clear gaps but it gave a soft holographic effect.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how my nails came out. ( I also had equal success when I tried it over Butter&#x27;s black sparkle polish. It gave the butter polish a holographic sheen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you decide to use Star Sparkle, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping and the product is great. I love the colour and the different coloured sparkles. It goes on smoothly and can become opaque. Last for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> very pretty color just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;and very easy to apply as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can use it by itself or on the top of other colors&lt;br /&gt;it works good as top coat .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this nail polish. After one or two coats my nails looked like I had put on a layer of Elmer&#x27;s Glue and added some glitter. Does NOT go on like picture shows.</li>
            <li> This polish makes a good top coat. It has a real christmas feel to it especially over green or red polish. it does take three to four coats on its own to provide the look in the picture though.</li>
            <li> My favorite silver Glitter, ever. And I have a lot of Glitter polish. Shipped quickly. Was packaged well to avoid breakage. Thank you! Will definitely be back for another bottle in a few months!</li>
            <li> I just received the product above and it is so pretty that I am ordering two more bottles. The prices on Amazon are exceptional and I&#x27;ve compared them to just about anywhere except most places you can&#x27;t even find the beautiful collections that are on Amazon. Anyway (I should be paid for this) the Sparkles collection is just that-it&#x27;s made up of tiny sparkles that you can use with two coats or over another plain of shimmery polish. I love and adore bling so I plan to play with this one mixing it with or using it over some of my other products. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice but all you have to know is that this polish is made up of different sparkly tiny tiny flex and they will sparkle like diamonds over any other product or on their own. I am so happy I chose this but was a little worried because the pictures do not really give one a good idea of the actual &#x27;sparkle.&#x27; In this case RUN don&#x27;t walk to your computer and check out this beautiful polish--I&#x27;m certainly glad I did--especially if you love &#x27;bling&#x27;....you&#x27;ll love this!!!</li>
            <li> Great sparkles! Looks great as a single coat on top of a color.</li>
            <li> So pretty.! Just love it!</li>
            <li> The nail polish is nice but I expected a bit more shine and sparkle. To get agood coating you need to put about 3 to 4 coats to make it really sparkle.</li>
            <li> So with all polishes you usually need 2 coats to achieve the desired shade. It&#x27;s to be expected. With this product the picture is very deceptive. You&#x27;ll need about 4 coats to achieve this shade. It&#x27;s just a clear based polish with super silver and random sparkles. After the 4 coats though, THIS POLISH IS AWESOME and totally worth the buy! Let&#x27;s be serious... when is the last time you&#x27;ve used an entire bottle of polish?! The four coats won&#x27;t kill you!!! I&#x27;d buy it twice! :)</li>
            <li> Im in love with this nail polish, the shipment was very fast and im very happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;I recomended this product &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty!  I used three coats and it gave my nails full coverage of glitter.  The glitter really twinkles and shines too.  Very pretty alone, or would be pretty over another color.</li>
            <li> I did not hate this but it is just ok...really like a glitter top coat to me..it was just so so</li>
            <li> Buyer BEWARE! This polish dries to a dull finish and has no shine nor iridescencent properties whatsoever. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, keep looking!</li>
            <li> Love the sparkle and a must have color! This collection is something to brag about to where you want them all. You definitely don&#x27;t want to miss out on the great colors offered,and you&#x27;ll find a color that fits you best. But whatever color you pick will surely be the best but why not get them all.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s nice , but too liquid. It has many little particles inside. It&#x27;s not solid.&lt;br /&gt;To reach that effect which you see on the picture, you will have to put 3-5 layers. And then it will take time to take it off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this polish!!! It&#x27;s great on its own, or layered over a solid color for an added effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rainbow colors are amazingly beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a clear polish full of holographic glitter. It is very, very sparkly and pretty holographic glitter at most angles, but it&#x27;s pretty thick, crunchy, crusty glitter. It will smooth out with a coat or two (or three) of clear topcoat, but it is definitely not smooth on its own. For what it is, it&#x27;s impressive, but I prefer a finer glitter.</li>
            <li> This product has a great color with lots of depth.  It goes on nicely and wears well.  I am very happy with this polish.</li>
            <li> Love it- super sparkly and multi colored silvers.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Nubar now.  I will be buying as many as I can afford!! More Holos please. whoo hoo</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. It is a whole lot prettier than my other Holo glitters!!! It really picks up the light and is like a shining star.</li>
            <li> Not solid sparkles... Need lots of coats to even be seen much</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish because it subtle sparkle is really nice.  It&#x27;s not totally bright glitter, very nice.  I like this brand.</li>
            <li> This polish is not as opaque as I would have liked.  Definitely must wear over another polish. The shimmer is really pretty though.</li>
