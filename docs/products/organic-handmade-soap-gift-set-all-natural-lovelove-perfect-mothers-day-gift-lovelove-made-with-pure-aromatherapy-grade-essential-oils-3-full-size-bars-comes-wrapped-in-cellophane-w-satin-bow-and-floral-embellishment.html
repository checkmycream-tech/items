            <li>I think any guy can enjoy it too!</li>
            <li>There are so many body soap companies out there today, but are the soaps handmade with love and care for the person who will be using their soaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a great quality soap that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Golden Crown smelled very good, but it&#x27;s scent was more gentle.</li>
            <li>and I thought that Sea Breeze had a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>Best of all, our skin is not in any way dry after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>want to buy more just to be able to enjoy each and</li>
            <li>They smell wonderfully and are gentle for even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>When my favorite home made soap wasn&#x27;t available at the farmer&#x27;s market I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>She loved the scents and said they feel very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I’m about ready to cry because these smell so good.</li>
            <li>But it may be true!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is evident that much care goes in to creating these beautifully scented soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flecks of herbs peek out from within and the soap emits a healthy clean scent.</li>
            <li>It was so strong, but smelt so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t linger strongly after I shower, so I can wear my perfume.</li>
            <li>This is a great, unique gift to give to a busy mom.</li>
            <li>My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good</li>
            <li>However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this is super cute</li>
            <li>and she is enjoying them very much!</li>
            <li>and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent.</li>
            <li>Sea Breeze and Green Tea Goddess felt the best on my skin.</li>
            <li>Free</li>
            <li>just love all these ingredients and every time I take a shower, a smile appears on my face.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  </li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li>you only do one thing in your life that brings your body and soul joy..</li>
            <li>I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors.</li>
            <li>The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I am sure everyone wants healthy skin and it all begins with any of the soaps from Keomi Skincare.</li>
            <li>The soap is also good for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The whole bathroom smelt like I was in a flower field, the soap lathered great and my whole body was bubbly.</li>
            <li>But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin super soft, without drying it out, and it also leaves a pleasant light scent on the skin.</li>
            <li>If you are giving it as a gift it is wrapped up very nicely, with each bar individually wrapped and with an added bow and flowers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, despite the fact I was given an opportunity to receive this free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It was sweet, sour, it was a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The scent was very pleasant and reminded me of a spicy green tea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  </li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law  was excited and said she  was looking forward to  using  the soaps, and the gift card too.</li>
            <li>We recommend them to any one who wants a great natural soap!</li>
            <li>been enjoying using the first one and look forward to trying the others as well.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally intended to give one set as a gift, but after using the soap, my husband and I decided we had to keep them for ourselves to savor.</li>
            <li>Their soaps use a rich blend of over 10 USDA, certified, organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils.</li>
            <li>I just want to say thanks for making a soap that was high quality, great smelling, and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I think they are best fit for normal to dry skin, but then it just my guess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and our little girls think it smells nice and feels good too.</li>
            <li>prefer my soaps to rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li>The suds rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>You feel really clean but your skin is not stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>I felt so clean.</li>
            <li>My journey of sampling countless bars of natural soap was a lengthy and pleasurable one indeed, but after receiving my first order of the beautifully wrapped, lusciously scented Keomi soaps I knew I was in possession of an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This soap takes baths/showers to a whole new level and it&#x27;s truly one of the best natural soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The soap had to possess numerous qualities, like being vegan, not tested on animals, made with organic fair trade ingredients as well as lather, clean and rinse well and be handmade in the USA by artisans of like mind.</li>
            <li>and I could tell it has some amazing goodies in it to keep my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Creamy lather, amazing fragrance, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I sent one set of Keomi&#x27;s beautiful soaps as a birthday gift, another as an anniversary present, and both were appreciated heartily.</li>
            <li>They also leave a nice soft lingering scent on the skin.</li>

            <li>All of those demands are pretty hard to find, and on top of all of that I am also looking for a great quality soap that is not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, it does not bother my sensitive nose, which is a huge problem for me that I usually get from lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in love with Keomi Skincare - Organic All Natural Handmade Soap!</li>

            <li>Since making more mindful choices in my life, I have been on a quest to discover thee exemplary bar of natural, organic soap.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sea Breeze scent which is really fresh and scented with a blend of lavender,  oak moss and fir.</li>
            <li>I have been loving this product for several weeks now.</li>
            <li>That is why the Keomi Skincare Signature Collection is so exciting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two soaps that I received were the Golden Crown and Luscious Lavender.  </li>
            <li>She loved how they left her skin clean and soft with no film residue.  </li>
            <li>I found the scent to be just right.</li>
            <li>I first received the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soap- Set of Two in the box, I knew right away that that box contained soap, because I can smell the amazing scent from outside the box.  </li>
            <li>Its hard not to love a good scented soap that will leave my skin feeling clean, moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very gift worthy.</li>
            <li>personal favorite is the Golden Crown.  </li>

            <li>This one is for me;)</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky and read every ingredient that is on that package.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and came in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more for myself and as gifts.</li>

            <li>She told me that I should actually get some for myself and I would love it too.</li>
            <li>Talk about an all natural fragrance that fills your entire bathroom for many weeks!  </li>
            <li>This is amazing and it tells you how yummy this soap would be, if you could eat it...but do not eat this soap, it is natural and organic, for your body only.</li>

            <li>The letter included is very personable and funny.</li>
            <li>You are left with soft skin, moisturized and smelling fresh and lovely.</li>
            <li>This will help the soap last longer, and help prevent it from becoming a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>It lathers right up and leaves my skin feeling soft and oil free but never dried</li>
            <li>you enjoy high quality natural soaps, do not hesitate to try these.  </li>
            <li>and so is very particular about her soaps.</li>
            <li>The scents did feature the aromatherapy benefits and helped to relax me as I took my shower since the scent was strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>But just because it smells great it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.  </li>
            <li>It is made with Pure Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, Safflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Apricot and Rice Bran.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for sending it so promptly after I ordered.</li>
            <li>They make the cabinet smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Keomi soap is now the gift I give to my whole self and my family.</li>
            <li>It is not too girly or flowery scented so the whole family can use.</li>
            <li>daughter wants to use it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am not sure how I came across this product, but I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Currently Keomi is offering a 2 and 4 bar sample set for FREE.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>love the simple ingredient list that is made from all natural ingredients and some organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not as moisturizing as I was hoping (still need lotion) but much better than using other soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strongly recommended that when using Keomi&#x27;s soaps, that you store them in a dry place away from a stream of water or under a counter with metal pipes.  </li>
            <li>They lather beautifully, *never* irritate sensitive skin, and smell incredibly beautiful.  </li>
            <li>They feel less soapy and more like a moisturiser to the skin.</li>
            <li>Calming fragrances and natural exfoliating elements leave sensitive skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The scents available are Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Luscious Lavender and Green Tea Goddess.</li>
            <li>Since then I have been on active search mode for naturally made soaps, even going to far as to try to make my own.</li>
            <li>Id highly recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so finding the right soap is a big deal for me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I like a little bit more scent for soaps.</li>
            <li>was expecting some cute little bars of soap you know the ones that don&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
            <li>Keomi natural soap lathered very well and stayed lathered on the skin.</li>
            <li>so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also had to smell fresh by incorporating essential oils, not chemically created scent wannabes.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are nice, but not overwhelming, and the feel is soft rather than greasy.</li>
            <li>I first got my mail the day it was delivered I could smell a sweet, sour smell.</li>
            <li>I couldn’t wait to try the soap again and to see what other scents were available.</li>
            <li>every one of these power packed live renewing scents!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you now, If you are reading this review..</li>
            <li>She liked the subtle scent that was not overbearing or offensive.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality, luxurious, natural soap, look to Keomi Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>They smelled great on her and lasted a pretty long time unlike other soaps we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>The scent left behind was light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The next day, I tried the soap for the first time.</li>
            <li>She is interested in essential oils and natural homemade products.</li>
            <li>Green Tea Goddess doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li>That thick rich lather that comes from most moisturizing soaps is due to the inclusion of chemical ingredients – specifically sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>and every soap is created in its own special way with Organic Herbs, Dead Sea Clay and Salt and Seaweed and French Green Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying this product if you are looking for an immensely extravagant new cleaning experience!</li>
            <li>the Pure Aromatherapy-grade Essential Oils began entering my nose and tingling my senses.</li>
            <li>She smelled them and said &#x27;this is definitely pure essential oils they put in there&#x27;.</li>
            <li>All three of these soaps left my skin feeling soft and definitely didn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is so important to me!)</li>
            <li>With lush blends of organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea, cocoa butters and pure aromatherapy-grade essential oils.</li>
            <li>Not only is it natural but very non- offending to others</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift for my step daughter who has began to use all natural body soaps.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my Mom as a Mother&#x27;s Day present and she absolutely loves all of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all three of these soaps and you will definitely be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my step mother as an early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Plus something that looks stylish enough to leave next to my sinks or bathtub is always a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The outside of our body needs as much attention as the inside of our bodies.</li>
            <li>My search is complete.</li>
            <li>Plus, the gift sets are so reasonably priced, several girlfriends on my list are getting Keomi soap this Christmas!</li>
            <li>I can tell that the fragrance is natural and not a chemical scent.</li>
            <li>It is suggested that you do not use the bar directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>I received this Keomi Skincare Natural Luxury handmade soap to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>are it keeps my hands and skin SO soft.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Being an esthetician,  I&#x27;m always in search for a soap that that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>NATURAL by Keomi Skinc</li>
            <li>Help your skin stay young looking.  </li>
            <li>Let your skin become silky soft by using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let your skin become silky soft by using these.  </li>
            <li>The soaps are naturally colored</li>
            <li>it leaves the skin in a soft comfortable feel, not filmy like other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for impressing my future mother in law!</li>
            <li>At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily.</li>
            <li>They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set).</li>
            <li>It’s high glycerin content is obvious and even without applying water this soap is clearly meant to hydrate skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend them to anyone wanting to nurture your body and the environment at the same time...</li>
            <li>The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered these soaps and the order came promptly and was carefully wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Keomi uses only Pure Aromatherapy Grade Essential Oils in their soaps.</li>
            <li>These soaps, by Keomi Skincare, are just amazing because their soaps are carefully crafted in tiny, or small, batches where they use a cold-process method.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>Finally, an organic all natural soap!</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin looking older and dry as it had been before.</li>
            <li>It only makes sense that my skin might be sensitive to it as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  </li>
            <li>She also loves natural products and uses essential oils regularly.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin</li>
            <li>A rich blends of over 10 USDA certified organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea and cocoa butters make up its base with pure essential oils added to each unique batch.</li>
            <li>The soap bar did not feel slimy when wet and dried quickly in the hanging soap dish.</li>
            <li>These are a fantastic alternative to commercial soaps which leave my skin feeling dull and dry in comparison.</li>

            <li> I think any guy can enjoy it too!</li>
            <li> There are so many body soap companies out there today, but are the soaps handmade with love and care for the person who will be using their soaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great quality soap that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Golden Crown smelled very good, but it&#x27;s scent was more gentle.</li>
            <li> and I thought that Sea Breeze had a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> Best of all, our skin is not in any way dry after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> want to buy more just to be able to enjoy each and</li>
            <li> They smell wonderfully and are gentle for even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> When my favorite home made soap wasn&#x27;t available at the farmer&#x27;s market I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> She loved the scents and said they feel very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I’m about ready to cry because these smell so good.</li>
            <li> But it may be true!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is evident that much care goes in to creating these beautifully scented soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flecks of herbs peek out from within and the soap emits a healthy clean scent.</li>
            <li> It was so strong, but smelt so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t linger strongly after I shower, so I can wear my perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a great, unique gift to give to a busy mom.</li>
            <li> My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good</li>
            <li> However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this is super cute</li>
            <li> and she is enjoying them very much!</li>
            <li> and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent.</li>
            <li> Sea Breeze and Green Tea Goddess felt the best on my skin.</li>
            <li> Free</li>
            <li> just love all these ingredients and every time I take a shower, a smile appears on my face.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  </li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li> you only do one thing in your life that brings your body and soul joy..</li>
            <li> I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors.</li>
            <li> The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I am sure everyone wants healthy skin and it all begins with any of the soaps from Keomi Skincare.</li>
            <li> The soap is also good for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The whole bathroom smelt like I was in a flower field, the soap lathered great and my whole body was bubbly.</li>
            <li> But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin super soft, without drying it out, and it also leaves a pleasant light scent on the skin.</li>
            <li> If you are giving it as a gift it is wrapped up very nicely, with each bar individually wrapped and with an added bow and flowers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, despite the fact I was given an opportunity to receive this free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It was sweet, sour, it was a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The scent was very pleasant and reminded me of a spicy green tea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  </li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law  was excited and said she  was looking forward to  using  the soaps, and the gift card too.</li>
            <li> We recommend them to any one who wants a great natural soap!</li>
            <li> been enjoying using the first one and look forward to trying the others as well.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally intended to give one set as a gift, but after using the soap, my husband and I decided we had to keep them for ourselves to savor.</li>
            <li> Their soaps use a rich blend of over 10 USDA, certified, organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils.</li>
            <li> I just want to say thanks for making a soap that was high quality, great smelling, and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I think they are best fit for normal to dry skin, but then it just my guess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and our little girls think it smells nice and feels good too.</li>
            <li> prefer my soaps to rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li> The suds rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> You feel really clean but your skin is not stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> I felt so clean.</li>
            <li> My journey of sampling countless bars of natural soap was a lengthy and pleasurable one indeed, but after receiving my first order of the beautifully wrapped, lusciously scented Keomi soaps I knew I was in possession of an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This soap takes baths/showers to a whole new level and it&#x27;s truly one of the best natural soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The soap had to possess numerous qualities, like being vegan, not tested on animals, made with organic fair trade ingredients as well as lather, clean and rinse well and be handmade in the USA by artisans of like mind.</li>
            <li> and I could tell it has some amazing goodies in it to keep my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Creamy lather, amazing fragrance, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I sent one set of Keomi&#x27;s beautiful soaps as a birthday gift, another as an anniversary present, and both were appreciated heartily.</li>
            <li> They also leave a nice soft lingering scent on the skin.</li>

            <li> was expecting some cute little bars of soap you know the ones that don&#x27;t have a smell...</li>
            <li> Keomi natural soap lathered very well and stayed lathered on the skin.</li>
            <li> so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It also had to smell fresh by incorporating essential oils, not chemically created scent wannabes.</li>
            <li> Fragrances are nice, but not overwhelming, and the feel is soft rather than greasy.</li>
            <li> I first got my mail the day it was delivered I could smell a sweet, sour smell.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t wait to try the soap again and to see what other scents were available.</li>
            <li> every one of these power packed live renewing scents!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you now, If you are reading this review..</li>
            <li> She liked the subtle scent that was not overbearing or offensive.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality, luxurious, natural soap, look to Keomi Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> They smelled great on her and lasted a pretty long time unlike other soaps we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The scent left behind was light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The next day, I tried the soap for the first time.</li>
            <li> She is interested in essential oils and natural homemade products.</li>
            <li> Green Tea Goddess doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li> That thick rich lather that comes from most moisturizing soaps is due to the inclusion of chemical ingredients – specifically sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> and every soap is created in its own special way with Organic Herbs, Dead Sea Clay and Salt and Seaweed and French Green Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying this product if you are looking for an immensely extravagant new cleaning experience!</li>
            <li> the Pure Aromatherapy-grade Essential Oils began entering my nose and tingling my senses.</li>
            <li> She smelled them and said &#x27;this is definitely pure essential oils they put in there&#x27;.</li>
            <li> All three of these soaps left my skin feeling soft and definitely didn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is so important to me!)</li>
            <li> With lush blends of organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea, cocoa butters and pure aromatherapy-grade essential oils.</li>
            <li> Not only is it natural but very non- offending to others</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my step daughter who has began to use all natural body soaps.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my Mom as a Mother&#x27;s Day present and she absolutely loves all of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all three of these soaps and you will definitely be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my step mother as an early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Plus something that looks stylish enough to leave next to my sinks or bathtub is always a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The outside of our body needs as much attention as the inside of our bodies.</li>
            <li> My search is complete.</li>
            <li> Plus, the gift sets are so reasonably priced, several girlfriends on my list are getting Keomi soap this Christmas!</li>
            <li> I can tell that the fragrance is natural and not a chemical scent.</li>
            <li> It is suggested that you do not use the bar directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> I received this Keomi Skincare Natural Luxury handmade soap to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> are it keeps my hands and skin SO soft.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician,  I&#x27;m always in search for a soap that that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> NATURAL by Keomi Skinc</li>
            <li> Help your skin stay young looking.  </li>
            <li> Let your skin become silky soft by using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let your skin become silky soft by using these.  </li>
            <li> The soaps are naturally colored</li>
            <li> it leaves the skin in a soft comfortable feel, not filmy like other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for impressing my future mother in law!</li>
            <li> At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily.</li>
            <li> They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set).</li>
            <li> It’s high glycerin content is obvious and even without applying water this soap is clearly meant to hydrate skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend them to anyone wanting to nurture your body and the environment at the same time...</li>
            <li> The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered these soaps and the order came promptly and was carefully wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Keomi uses only Pure Aromatherapy Grade Essential Oils in their soaps.</li>
            <li> These soaps, by Keomi Skincare, are just amazing because their soaps are carefully crafted in tiny, or small, batches where they use a cold-process method.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Finally, an organic all natural soap!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin looking older and dry as it had been before.</li>
            <li> It only makes sense that my skin might be sensitive to it as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  </li>
            <li> She also loves natural products and uses essential oils regularly.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin</li>
            <li> A rich blends of over 10 USDA certified organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea and cocoa butters make up its base with pure essential oils added to each unique batch.</li>
            <li> The soap bar did not feel slimy when wet and dried quickly in the hanging soap dish.</li>
            <li> These are a fantastic alternative to commercial soaps which leave my skin feeling dull and dry in comparison.</li>
            <li> Other natural ingredients used is shea and cocoa butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike some other soaps, these soaps are organic and you can see the natural ingredients within each soap.</li>
            <li> And when using the soaps, don&#x27;t rub directly on body, but use a washcloth, hands or other material.  </li>
            <li> In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender.</li>
            <li> Plus, I noticed that the next day when I was ready to use the bar of soap again, it tends to stick pretty well to my shower caddy and is hard to pick up and use without trying harder than usual to &amp;#34;un-glue&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Organic All Natural Handmade Soap is 100% vegan, gluten-free, cruelty free and contains no sulfates, petrochemicals, parabens, artificial fragrances or colors.</li>
            <li> One of the benefits of this set over other ones on Amazon is that the soaps are individually wrapped so they maintain their individual fragrances.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be very dry and itchy and I recently had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap.</li>
            <li> Every time I walk around the mall I am looking for that little shop that carries specialty soaps, and I can smell the scent of the soaps from far away, which draws in each and every time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Keomi soaps are cold-pressed and carefully crafted with only the highest quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> It contains Pure Olive Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Avocado, Grape Seed, and Coconut Oil, as well as Cocoa Butter, Dead Sea Salt and Dead Sea Clay, Seaweed.  </li>
            <li> It was a little bit stronger than my other natural soap bars, but it was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Green Tea Goddess ingredients: personified oils of olive, grape seed, coconut, palm, avocado and cocoa butter, organic green tea, nettle, shavegrass, comfrey root extracts, clary sage, orange and clove essential</li>
            <li> Well the Green Tea scented was, that is the only scent I have tried</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my skin since switching to these soaps, no more dry, itchy skin after showers!</li>
            <li> A little soap went a long way.</li>
            <li> the other soaps you will have to view when you go to their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each bar is extremely aromatic.  </li>
            <li> Organic herbs, Dead Sea clay &amp; salt, seaweed and French green clay are among the hand picked ingredients infused into these super-fatted soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you start using them, it&#x27;s hard to go back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a little pouch and every one of these soaps smell AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She told me she has gotten a quite a few compliments on it already.</li>
            <li> I received the Green Tea Goddess scented soap.</li>
            <li> Green Tea Goddess soap is scented with oils of Clary Sage, Orange and Clove.</li>
            <li> and I kept reaching for Green Tea Goddess.</li>
            <li> : I received a sample of the Green Tea Goddess soap to facilitate my review.</li>
            <li> Made with Olive Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Avocado Oil and Cocoa Butter, Organic Green Tea, Nettle, Shavegrass and Comfrey Root.</li>
            <li> Plus you know this company cares when they take the time to create each in small batches.</li>
            <li> Scent is soothing and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I got the Green Tea Goddess soap!</li>
            <li> any of you ever have a hard time gift shopping, this is your solution to your gift giving needs.</li>
            <li> Artificial fragrances</li>
            <li> Artificial colors</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> If you decide to buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap!  Nice lather and great scent!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. What a treat. It smells heavenly. Feels luxurious. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> WOW! This soap is simply amazing. I can&#x27;t believe they have it at this great price, but of course, the affordable price makes it that much better. It smells heavenly. It is luxury in bar soap form. It smells wonderful but not cloying. I accidentally ordered 2 and I was so happy!! I will definitely be buying more of this!!! I get nervous buying any bath or body products on the internet, especially when I have never heard of them, but this experience was just perfect. Now I am going to go see what else they have in store!</li>
            <li> Bought this soap gift set for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves them! They smell great, and are organic which she also loves. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my step daughter who has began to use all natural body soaps.  She was very excited to receive these soaps.  She loved how they left her skin clean and soft with no film residue.  She liked the subtle scent that was not overbearing or offensive.  This is a great quality soap that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The order went swimmingly, and my mother loved the soap bars. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for one of the caregivers for my Mother-in-Law.  Not only is it natural but very non- offending to others you come in contact with. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. Nice clean smell! Thank You.</li>
            <li> was a gift for a friend, very good quality!</li>

            <li> Bought them for mothers day and she loved them.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. Bought it for a gift. Smells great and leaves the skin feeling clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> Bought these soaps as a gift for Grandma.  They&#x27;re very nice and she is enjoying them very much!</li>
            <li> Received as a house warming gift, love them!  I am using one right now, and have placed the other two in my dresser drawers (as they suggest) for adding a beautiful scent to your undergarments and prolonging the life of the soap by keeping it in a cool dry place.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I am going to continue to order for myself and others, as a gift.  It was a nice surprise to like a product so much.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels so fresh &amp; clean after use, and my skin is soft and scented, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The soap was a great gift, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be.  My grandparents loved receiving it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Mom as a Mother&#x27;s Day present and she absolutely loves all of them. Great price and shipping was timely. Highly recommend these as a gift!</li>
            <li> Great soap....wonderful texture and smell.  Quick delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> I was out of this soap for awhile. I had used for a year r longer. I noticed my skin looking older and dry as it had been before. I hadn&#x27;t changed lotions so I knew it was from the Keomi soap I no longer had. Thanks for sending it so promptly after I ordered.</li>
            <li> Great gift  item, was just  what  I  was  looking  for, purchased  a gift  gift card  for  my  daughter-in-law for her  birthday, but didn&#x27;t  want  to  give  her  a card with a gift card inside, so when I  saw this on Amazon and read the  reviews  knew this soap was exactly  what  I  was  looking  for. When it arrived, and checked it out, it looked  exactly  what the picture looks like so I  didn&#x27;t  have to gift wrap it, and the soaps smelled wonderful, so along birthday  card, made a great great gifts. My daughter-in-law  was excited and said she  was looking forward to  using  the soaps, and the gift card too. She also was appreciated  that  I  took the  time  to  be so thoughtful  then to give her just  act card.</li>
            <li> The soap was a present to a friend. She contacted me and was so happy.  She stated the soap smelled too wonderful, and made her feel spoiled.  (That is a bit impressive knowing the woman has been richly spoiled) :-)</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this soap! It smells, feels and works great! Our expectations have been exceeded, it is a 5 star product with out question. I highly suggest buying this product if you are looking for an immensely extravagant new cleaning experience!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She loves the soaps. She says they smell so nice. The packaging is very gift worthy. The letter included is very personable and funny. They give a disclaimer that the soaps are not edible. We laughed, but agreed, the soaps must smell that GOOD that someone must have tried to eat them. ;)</li>
            <li> My wife loved these soaps! They smelled great on her and lasted a pretty long time unlike other soaps we&#x27;ve used in the past. We purchase these soaps almost exclusively now. I can say I was very impressed with them too. We recommend them to any one who wants a great natural soap!</li>
            <li> They feel less soapy and more like a moisturiser to the skin. I think they are best fit for normal to dry skin, but then it just my guess.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good if you are into Aromatherapy. The were wrapped nicely too.</li>
            <li> This soap made the perfect gift to my future mother in law for Christmas! I just want to say thanks for making a soap that was high quality, great smelling, and very pretty. She told me she has gotten a quite a few compliments on it already. A great product at a great price! Id recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BTW it leaves the skin in a soft comfortable feel, not filmy like other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for impressing my future mother in law! Id highly recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered these soaps and the order came promptly and was carefully wrapped.  Upon opening the protective wrapping I was met with the wonderful smell of the 3 bars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been enjoying using the first one and look forward to trying the others as well.  They make the cabinet smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;We need more of these natural products in our homes</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and nice packaging. Shipping on time. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This was a gift, but the recipient said it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all three of these soaps and you will definitely be pleasantly surprised. Sea Breeze and Green Tea Goddess felt the best on my skin. Green Tea Goddess doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and I thought that Sea Breeze had a very clean smell. Golden Crown smelled very good, but it&#x27;s scent was more gentle. All three of these soaps left my skin feeling soft and definitely didn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is so important to me!) I have pretty sensitive skin, so finding the right soap is a big deal for me. I think any guy can enjoy it too! Not just women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received similar soaps in exchange for my honest review. This review was also cross posted to my blog FancyThatBlog.Blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad, and he loves it a lot! He said the scent is nice and not too strong, and it does the job of cleaning the skin well.</li>
            <li> We have ordered two sets of this wonderful and gentle soap.  I originally intended to give one set as a gift, but after using the soap, my husband and I decided we had to keep them for ourselves to savor. They lather beautifully, *never* irritate sensitive skin, and smell incredibly beautiful.  Best of all, our skin is not in any way dry after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy high quality natural soaps, do not hesitate to try these.  They&#x27;re the finest we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this three bar gift set and it came beautifully packaged and the soaps smelled heavenly. The person who received this gift was very pleased with the soaps and said that they are wonderful and make her skin feel so soft. The aroma is very mild and she also appreciated that.</li>
            <li> they look wonderful but are a gift so can&#x27;t rate use.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my step mother as an early Christmas gift. She loved the scents and said they feel very luxurious. Came with pretty gift wrap as well so I didn&#x27;t even have to wrap it!</li>
            <li> The Keomi Handmade Soaps are completely worth the money. They last for awhile and really leave your skin feeling great after washing with them. They also leave a nice soft lingering scent on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try the “Keomi Skincare - Organic All Natural Handmade Soap!” Since when it comes to my personal luxuries this is one of those that I truly adore. Its hard not to love a good scented soap that will leave my skin feeling clean, moisturized and soft. Plus something that looks stylish enough to leave next to my sinks or bathtub is always a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you ever have a hard time gift shopping, this is your solution to your gift giving needs. Plus you know this company cares when they take the time to create each in small batches. With lush blends of organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea, cocoa butters and pure aromatherapy-grade essential oils. This soap is not only healthy for your skin but also better for our planet as well.</li>
            <li> When I received one of their soaps in the mail, I could smell the scent coming through the box! This is amazing and it tells you how yummy this soap would be, if you could eat it...but do not eat this soap, it is natural and organic, for your body only. The outside of our body needs as much attention as the inside of our bodies. There are so many body soap companies out there today, but are the soaps handmade with love and care for the person who will be using their soaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using body soaps, for good, about two years ago and I will probably not go back to liquid body soaps. These soaps, by Keomi Skincare, are just amazing because their soaps are carefully crafted in tiny, or small, batches where they use a cold-process method. Using a cold-process method is good for using living oils. Their soaps use a rich blend of over 10 USDA, certified, organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils. Other natural ingredients used is shea and cocoa butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package sent to me, the Pure Aromatherapy-grade Essential Oils began entering my nose and tingling my senses. There is something wonderful and unique to each bar Keomi Skincare creates. I am sure everyone wants healthy skin and it all begins with any of the soaps from Keomi Skincare. The soaps made are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Vegan&lt;br /&gt;Gluten Free&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;No Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;No Petro-Chemicals&lt;br /&gt;No Parabens&lt;br /&gt;No Artificial fragrances&lt;br /&gt;No Artificial colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a lot of \\&quot;No&#x27;s\\&quot;, but the no&#x27;s that should be in any body type product. Right now, Keomi Skincare created 12 delightful, and healthy, body soaps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Goddess&lt;br /&gt;Luscious Lavender&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal Oasis&lt;br /&gt;The Baby Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus the other soaps you will have to view when you go to their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each and every soap is created in its own special way with Organic Herbs, Dead Sea Clay and Salt and Seaweed and French Green Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love all these ingredients and every time I take a shower, a smile appears on my face. These are the best body soaps you will every use for your body. So, right now is the best time for you to go to their website and purchase as many delightful scents for you, your family and maybe your friends. These would make for great birthday gifts.you will every use for your body.

            <li> I received the Green Tea Goddess scented soap. Green Tea Goddess soap is scented with oils of Clary Sage, Orange and Clove. The scent was very pleasant and reminded me of a spicy green tea. I really enjoyed the scent in the shower. I currently have three bars of soap in the shower and I kept reaching for Green Tea Goddess. I love the scent comes from essential oils. It was a little bit stronger than my other natural soap bars, but it was not overpowering. I found the scent to be just right. What about the rest of the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Goddess ingredients: personified oils of olive, grape seed, coconut, palm, avocado and cocoa butter, organic green tea, nettle, shavegrass, comfrey root extracts, clary sage, orange and clove essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the simple ingredient list that is made from all natural ingredients and some organic ingredients. I would like to see the Keomi soap bars made with 100% organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my soaps to rinse cleanly. Keomi natural soap lathered very well and stayed lathered on the skin. A little soap went a long way. The suds rinsed clean. The soap bar did not feel slimy when wet and dried quickly in the hanging soap dish. My skin felt clean, soft, and moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scents that Keomi Skincare offers for their natural soaps. Sometimes, I like a little bit more scent for soaps. The essential oil combination is perfect to wake me up in the morning. If you are looking for a high quality, luxurious, natural soap, look to Keomi Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of the Green Tea Goddess soap to facilitate my review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and the recipient LOVED it!! They asked me where to buy some as X-Mas gifts and B-Day gifts for family and friends.  It arrived very fast and was wrapped very nicely.  I was very pleased with my purchase.  It smells wonderful and I am told that it leaves your skin smooth and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Scent is soothing and not overwhelming. Moisturizing, worthy of cost, and great as gift to yourself or others.</li>
            <li> Since making more mindful choices in my life, I have been on a quest to discover thee exemplary bar of natural, organic soap. The soap had to possess numerous qualities, like being vegan, not tested on animals, made with organic fair trade ingredients as well as lather, clean and rinse well and be handmade in the USA by artisans of like mind. I know that seems a bit much to expect from a humble bar of soap... but have you ever researched the ingredients in soap or even the practices of the companies that manufacture it? It also had to smell fresh by incorporating essential oils, not chemically created scent wannabes. My journey of sampling countless bars of natural soap was a lengthy and pleasurable one indeed, but after receiving my first order of the beautifully wrapped, lusciously scented Keomi soaps I knew I was in possession of an amazing product. It wasn&#x27;t until after my first bathing experience with Keomi soap that my body, mind and spirit unanimously agreed. I finally found thee quintessential bar soap. The scents enliven and soothe and the soft, voluminous suds felt wonderful and rinsed beautifully. I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to moisturize afterwards. I even washed my hair with Keomi soap. My search is complete. Keomi soap is now the gift I give to my whole self and my family. It is the loveliest soap I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality; excellent ingredients.  This was a gift and the recipient was very happy with the soap!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two sets of these soaps, one for myself and another as a gift - they are exquisite! They smell wonderfully and are gentle for even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better - they are organic and are safe and compassionate to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is evident that much care goes in to creating these beautifully scented soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them to anyone wanting to nurture your body and the environment at the same time... Or to gift to another, they make a lovely gift!</li>
            <li> When I opened up my package, I could smell the soap before I could even see it. It smelled delightful.  Aside from the fact that the soap smelled heavenly, I love that it lathers up so well and feels like silk against my skin. It’s made with the finest ingredients and I could tell it has some amazing goodies in it to keep my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this soap. I am a self professed soap connoisseur and this is one of the best EVER. Creamy lather, amazing fragrance, and all natural ingredients. Plus, the gift sets are so reasonably priced, several girlfriends on my list are getting Keomi soap this Christmas!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.  Not as moisturizing as I was hoping (still need lotion) but much better than using other soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap is great stuff. My wife loves it and our little girls think it smells nice and feels good too. Fragrances are nice, but not overwhelming, and the feel is soft rather than greasy. A great combination.</li>
            <li> I gave these soaps as a gift to my mother in law and she loved them, she said they smell very nice.</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift.I did not hear from the person I sent it to yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great, unique gift to give to a busy mom.</li>
            <li> Organic All Natural Handmade Soap is 100% vegan, gluten-free, cruelty free and contains no sulfates, petrochemicals, parabens, artificial fragrances or colors. It claims to be &#x27;The Best Handmade Soap Ever!&#x27; Big claim. But it may be true! I am in love with Keomi Skincare - Organic All Natural Handmade Soap! I tried the Sea Breeze scent which is really fresh and scented with a blend of lavender,  oak moss and fir. It is not too girly or flowery scented so the whole family can use. I can tell that the fragrance is natural and not a chemical scent. Keomi uses only Pure Aromatherapy Grade Essential Oils in their soaps. It is suggested that you do not use the bar directly on your skin. You will get the most lather and use by using a wash cloth or cleansing pouf and rubbing on that to lather and then on your skin. You feel really clean but your skin is not stripped of moisture. You are left with soft skin, moisturized and smelling fresh and lovely. The scents available are Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Luscious Lavender and Green Tea Goddess. I have a full review on beautybymitchypoo.com</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling soap I have ever used. Well the Green Tea scented was, that is the only scent I have tried yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers up good and does a great job of cleaning. It does not dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is the scent though. It would be great for putting in your linen closet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for my Aunt on her birthday. She got it in the mail with in two days, and said she loved the scents! The soap is also good for her sensitive skin. Thanks Keomi!</li>
            <li> I love handmade soaps and I was recently sent the Keomi Skincare Organic All Natural Handmade Soap for free to try, and let&#x27;s just say it smells just like you&#x27;re at a relaxing spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of this soap, (Sea Breeze) and it&#x27;s not overpowering. It also lathers up very nice! It leaves your skin super soft, without drying it out, and it also leaves a pleasant light scent on the skin. This soap takes baths/showers to a whole new level and it&#x27;s truly one of the best natural soaps I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love it and highly recommend this soap. If you decide to buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried the Green Tea Goddess soap and the scent is amazing.  Not overpowering at all.  It was very moisturizing and my skin was soft and smooth after using.  The scent left behind was light and refreshing.  I highly recommend this soap.  This company also provides excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I received this Keomi Skincare Natural Luxury handmade soap to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my mail the day it was delivered I could smell a sweet, sour smell. I had no idea what it was. When I opened my package, I found where the smell was coming from. It was sweet, sour, it was a very pleasant smell. It wasn’t too over ruling.&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was the cute bag it came in, and the design of the soap cover. Upon, opening the soap I saw how neatly it was made and how the design truly looked like like a luxury handmade soap. I couldn’t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I tried the soap for the first time. The whole bathroom smelt like I was in a flower field, the soap lathered great and my whole body was bubbly. I didn’t want to get out of that moment. After the shower, I could still smell the scent. Even my boyfriend mentioned the smell. It was so strong, but smelt so good.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I could still smell it lingering on me. I felt so clean. I couldn’t wait to try the soap again and to see what other scents were available.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this product for several weeks now. My bathroom and hands smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wants to use it but I am being stingy- use your own soap kid! This one is for me;) I love that it is home made and has no nasty chemical components. This is a great product for your bathroom, or if you are shopping for an organic gift. You cannot go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> Unlike some other soaps, these soaps are organic and you can see the natural ingredients within each soap. The Golden Crown which was rich in a lemon scent, Green Tea Goddess which smelled like green tea and was very earthy, Luscious lavender which smelled like lavender, and sea breeze which was reminiscent of a day at the beach with the ocean-like notes to it.The soaps were fairly smaller in size than those that you can purchase at the grocery store or beauty store and lasted about 7 days each. However, the product smelled so nice and it was a treat each time to use this product. At first, the soap was a little hard to spread on a washcloth but after the first use, it spread so easily. The scents did feature the aromatherapy benefits and helped to relax me as I took my shower since the scent was strong and lasting. I loved that the soaps had a more natural smell and did not smell so generic like store brands tend to. These soaps are great for treating yourself on those stressful days and feeling like you are at the spa.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a nicely wrapped package, and I could smell the scent of it in my mailbox, along with instructions on how to care for your soap (go figure)!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be very dry and itchy and I recently had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap. That thick rich lather that comes from most moisturizing soaps is due to the inclusion of chemical ingredients – specifically sodium lauryl sulfate. I can’t use toothpaste with sodium laurel sulfate. It only makes sense that my skin might be sensitive to it as well. Since then I have been on active search mode for naturally made soaps, even going to far as to try to make my own. That is why the Keomi Skincare Signature Collection is so exciting. Finally, an organic all natural soap! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keomi soaps are cold-pressed and carefully crafted with only the highest quality ingredients. A rich blends of over 10 USDA certified organic vegetable, fruit and seed oils, plus shea and cocoa butters make up its base with pure essential oils added to each unique batch. Keomi soaps are not just for luxury cleansing but are actually good for your skin. Organic herbs, Dead Sea clay &amp; salt, seaweed and French green clay are among the hand picked ingredients infused into these super-fatted soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sample of Green Tea Goddess soap arrived beautifully packaged in a silver drawstring gift bag. At first touch I could tell that Keomi Skincare Signature Collection soaps are something special. It’s high glycerin content is obvious and even without applying water this soap is clearly meant to hydrate skin. Flecks of herbs peek out from within and the soap emits a healthy clean scent. No one skimped on anything in making this beauty! It lathers right up and leaves my skin feeling soft and oil free but never dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for the purposes of review. I was not obligated to leave a positive review and I was not compensated.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift so never actually used it for myself but the person who received it was very pleased - said they smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of soaps!  Every time I walk around the mall I am looking for that little shop that carries specialty soaps, and I can smell the scent of the soaps from far away, which draws in each and every time.  I am constantly on the hunt of a great quality soap,&lt;br /&gt;and I am pretty picky and read every ingredient that is on that package.  Why?  Because I want to make sure that there are no additives, no colors, no preservatives and no artificial scents.  All of those demands are pretty hard to find, and on top of all of that I am also looking for a great quality soap that is not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soap- Set of Two in the box, I knew right away that that box contained soap, because I can smell the amazing scent from outside the box.  But just because it smells great it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.  But I was pretty impressed to find out that not only the Keomi Skincare Organic Handmade Soaps have no preservatives, but they also contain no artificial colors or scents, sulfate free, nut free, and have no animal testing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire shower smelled amazing from the time those two bar of soaps entered my bathroom!  Talk about an all natural fragrance that fills your entire bathroom for many weeks!  Best of all, it does not bother my sensitive nose, which is a huge problem for me that I usually get from lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two soaps that I received were the Golden Crown and Luscious Lavender.  They both smell so delicious, and my sensitive skin absolutely loved them!  They are moisturizing and do not dry my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see these bar of soaps last a little longer, as they seemed to run out quicker than other soaps I have owned before.  Plus, I noticed that the next day when I was ready to use the bar of soap again, it tends to stick pretty well to my shower caddy and is hard to pick up and use without trying harder than usual to &amp;#34;un-glue&amp;#34; them from the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luscious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my review.  All of my opinions are 100% my own.  I hope that this review was helpful in making your purchase decision.ue&amp;#34; them from the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luscious Lavender is my favorite scent of the two because it is so relaxing to the senses, and my skin still smells amazing after the shower for many more hours to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my review.

            <li> I keep coming back for more! These soaps are wonderful! Once you start using them, it&#x27;s hard to go back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> Not only is this soap amazing, but it smells SO good! It&#x27;s not drying like a lot of bar soaps are it keeps my hands and skin SO soft. The packaging on this is super cute and I will be re-buying for Christmas this year!</li>
            <li> I got the Green Tea Goddess soap! The smell reminded me of being at a Spa, and getting a massage! Their fragrance is strong but has a very lovely scent. I love the fact that this soap is made for all skin types and is organic!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. Exactly as described and came in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing!!! Quality and packaging is top notch!!! Gift recipient will absolutely love these soaps!!!    UPDATE: Gift Recipient absolutely loved these soaps!!! She is interested in essential oils and natural homemade products. She smelled them and said &#x27;this is definitely pure essential oils they put in there&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know how she can tell but they smell amazing :)</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my grandmother. She has sensitive skin and so is very particular about her soaps. She also loves natural products and uses essential oils regularly. She loved these soaps, loved the smell, and the way they felt. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> The soaps are packaged very nicely and ready for gift giving.  The wonderful aromatic scent is enjoyed from the time you open the packaging.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom&#x27;s birthday... she LOVES this soap... great product... great customer service!</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician,  I&#x27;m always in search for a soap that that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of Keomi&#x27;s ingredients and the purity of the essential oils. The scent is light and pure. If the hubby likes it,  I know it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
            <li> Calming fragrances and natural exfoliating elements leave sensitive skin feeling soft and clean. These are a fantastic alternative to commercial soaps which leave my skin feeling dull and dry in comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this soap set! The scents are refreshing and delicious but not overbearing. They are gender neutral so the whole family loves using them: we even use them on the baby who has extremely sensitive skin. I have noticed a big difference in my skin since switching to these soaps, no more dry, itchy skin after showers! One of the benefits of this set over other ones on Amazon is that the soaps are individually wrapped so they maintain their individual fragrances. Many of the handmade gift sets arrive with each bar smelling like a combination of all the scents and with these that isn&#x27;t an issue. They are also full size bars that last forever!(many soap sets have smaller sample-sized bars and charge the same amount as this set). This set would make a great gift since it comes decoratively packaged. it overall a great buy! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I came across this product, but I am very glad I did.  The fragrance of the soap is unique and very pleasant.  I will continue to order it regularly.</li>
            <li> The soaps smell wonderful. Love the way my skin feels after using this soap. Highly recommend. Delivery was as promised and feedback from the company us superb.</li>
            <li> Felt great on my skin and I loved the natural scent!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the way the hand soap smells and makes my hands feel every time I use them!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I have sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products I use. This soap is gentle! I will definitely order more for myself and as gifts. Thank-you for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;C.Pruys</li>

            <li> When I first received the package of the Sample Set of Handmade soap by Keomi, I could smell the wonderfulness of them.  Each bar is extremely aromatic.  My husband keeps asking me where  the new diffuser is because they smell so strong, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sample Set contains 4 different scents.&lt;br /&gt;Sea Breeze. Refresh your skin with this bar of soap. It contains Pure Olive Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Avocado, Grape Seed, and Coconut Oil, as well as Cocoa Butter, Dead Sea Salt and Dead Sea Clay, Seaweed.  It is scented with a blend of Lavender, Oakmoss and Fir.&lt;br /&gt;Golden Crown is considered Keomi&#x27;s Most Luxurious Soap.

The sample set is a great way to choose which scent you like best.  Currently Keomi is offering a 2 and 4 bar sample set for FREE.  You just have to pay shipping and handling charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strongly recommended that when using Keomi&#x27;s soaps, that you store them in a dry place away from a stream of water or under a counter with metal pipes.  Keep them in a soap dish that drains, not pools.  And when using the soaps, don&#x27;t rub directly on body, but use a washcloth, hands or other material.  This will help the soap last longer, and help prevent it from becoming a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.  It is not drying at all.  The fragrance will linger on for awhile, so keep that in mind if you plan to use perfume afterwards.  You will smell clean and fresh after using their bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Very strongly scented, which lingers after using.  Skin feels awesome afterwards.  Very moisturizing.  Don&#x27;t be tempted to just stash them away in your dresser drawers or closets, unless you purchase extras to do so.  Let your skin become silky soft by using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I highly recommend this product, despite the fact I was given an opportunity to receive this free in exchange for my honest opinion.skin will feel soft, smooth and silky after using this soap.

            <li> This soap smells great, feels great and lathers up nicely.  If you are giving it as a gift it is wrapped up very nicely, with each bar individually wrapped and with an added bow and flowers.  It&#x27;s very pretty.  When my favorite home made soap wasn&#x27;t available at the farmer&#x27;s market I found this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I sent one set of Keomi&#x27;s beautiful soaps as a birthday gift, another as an anniversary present, and both were appreciated heartily. Packaged beautifully, these quality soaps have that handmade touch that&#x27;s just perfect for gift giving.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing ! I am extra sensitive to artificial fragrance that is in most big box store body wash products. But this soap is beautifully scented and smells naturally wonderful. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger strongly after I shower, so I can wear my perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought the Handmade Soap Gift Set for a friend thinking it was in a nice pretty package and all natural. Something a girl would like. Well she liked it alright! She loved it! She told me that I should actually get some for myself and I would love it too. She said the soaps did not smell like perfume but had a very pleasant light fragrance that a guy would appreciate too! Can&#x27;t wait to try some myself.</li>
            <li> Keomi soap is a delight.  I received 3 cakes of fragrant soap, each with a different scent.  The soap lathers well and feels soothing on the skin.  An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I received a gift set in a cute little silver mesh, drawstring bag from Keomi Skincare in exchange for my honest feedback and opinion. Inside the bag were 4 neatly wrapped soap bars. These soaps are aromatherapy grade and if you smell them, you will see why. They smell so wonderful. I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors. What more could you ask for in a soap? In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender. I’m about ready to cry because these smell so good. I’m not even exaggerating. The soaps are naturally colored and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent. The soaps don&#x27;t over lather by themselves, but I think that&#x27;s because of being sulfate free. However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine. Overall, these are wonderful soaps and this sample set is the perfect introduction to the company and would make a great gift for just about anyone.</li>
