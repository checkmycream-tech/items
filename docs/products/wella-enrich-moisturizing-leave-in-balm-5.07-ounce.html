            <li>I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>but it does make it look better.</li>
            <li>So, I guess I can say this stuff works. :)</li>
            <li>I love the one with tomato pumice.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>have used this product for some time and love how it protects from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased full size ASAP!</li>
            <li>Adds shine to  your hair and helps smooth it on those humid days.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen her hair so smooth and so shiny.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair sooo smooth</li>
            <li>Not bad but</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have fine hair and find that wella makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li>bought this for her because I use the red kind, for color-treated hair and my hair</li>
            <li>good for hot dry summer time</li>
            <li>My daughter has very, very fine (nordic) blonde hair and lots of it, both in length and in volume.</li>
            <li>Super smooth hair, blow-dries straight despite natural wave/curl, although I must add that I mix in one of those anti-frizz oils,</li>
            <li>is also very fine and very long, and it has always worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>will be buying another bottle very soon</li>
            <li>works really well for shine</li>
            <li>I have super thin hair that tangles easy and breaks easy.</li>
            <li>It tangles if she so much as turns her head.</li>
            <li>every girl dreams of having, but that none of them really want to take care of.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be better than other over the counter products because it is &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is &amp;#34;fixing the main problem and making it healthier though</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and managable and the smell is divine!!</li>
            <li>and i got to say it left my hair healthy after a few uses!</li>

            <li> So, she used it the other day upon coming out of the shower, following my instructions to place it only on the ends and very gently comb it through, beginning from the tips to about half way up the shaft.</li>
            <li> Then she patted it dry with the towel and left</li>
            <li> and i like the way my hair feels and looks (not so dry).</li>
            <li> She went through the entire day without brushing it (as usual for her), and yet it never got tangled.</li>
            <li> I often don&#x27;t have time to mess with conditioner after shampoo (I run late a lot)</li>
            <li> Gold, shimmery, thick, lustrous locks.</li>

            <li> ordered this about 3 weeks ago and I love it. it smells great and my hair looks healthier will be buying another bottle very soon</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be better than other over the counter products because it is &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; but it really isn&#x27;t.  Not bad but just okay.</li>
            <li> Love Wella!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Adds shine to  your hair and helps smooth it on those humid days. I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> works really well for shine</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair that tangles easy and breaks easy. I like this because it makes combing easier after shower and i like the way my hair feels and looks (not so dry). I don&#x27;t think it is &amp;#34;fixing the main problem and making it healthier though but it does make it look better.</li>
            <li> good for hot dry summer time</li>
            <li> My daughter has very, very fine (nordic) blonde hair and lots of it, both in length and in volume. It tangles if she so much as turns her head. If she doesn&#x27;t want it to be a bird&#x27;s nest in the mornings, I have to braid it before she goes to sleep. It&#x27;s just one of those mixed blessings kinds of things - it&#x27;s the hair every girl dreams of having, but that none of them really want to take care of. My daughter&#x27;s only ten, so she is unprepared to do the constant brushing, trimming, conditioning, and so forth that it takes to keep it from getting knotted, and let me tell you - some of these knots can break records.&lt;br /&gt;However.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for her because I use the red kind, for color-treated hair and my hair is also very fine and very long, and it has always worked wonders for me. So, she used it the other day upon coming out of the shower, following my instructions to place it only on the ends and very gently comb it through, beginning from the tips to about half way up the shaft. Then she patted it dry with the towel and left it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen her hair so smooth and so shiny.

And when she accompanied me for a hair appointment, my hair dresser told her that she had gorgeous hair. Gold, shimmery, thick, lustrous locks. So, I guess I can say this stuff works. :)</li>

Super smooth hair, blow-dries straight despite natural wave/curl, although I must add that I mix in one of those anti-frizz oils, two pumps, into it. Love the smell, too!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love my hair&#x27;s body, smell and sheen when I use this!!</li>

            <li> it leaves your hair sooo smooth and i got to say it left my hair healthy after a few uses!</li>
            <li> Origanally received in glossy box as sample, immediately noticed difference in my hair. My hair was soft and managable and the smell is divine!! Purchased full size ASAP!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great leave in moisturizer. i need extra moisture all the time, and the fact that&#x27;s leave in helps me a lot! love it</li>
            <li> This produect smells great and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy! This product is awesome! I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> have used this product for some time and love how it protects from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have fine hair and find that wella makes it very manageable.</li>
