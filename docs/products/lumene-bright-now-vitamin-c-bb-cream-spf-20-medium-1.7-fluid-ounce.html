            <li>Good stuff!! :)</li>
            <li>Good color, great consistency, and fabulous smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and well I just love it!</li>
            <li>Lumene is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and liked it</li>
            <li>This moisturizer smells nice, is light feeling on my skin, I like the 20 spf, and the medium coverage is a good color for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I am a medium fair blond with a light tan look.</li>
            <li>Great product and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will repurchase this for sure.</li>
            <li>I love everything I have tried from this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lumene products since this spring, impressed with all of the products, especially like the BB and CC</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This color of Medium was perfect not to light not to Dark.</li>
            <li>It is light and airy (not a corrector).</li>
            <li>I ordered the medium (instead of the light) by mistake, but still recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin color is in between light and Medium.</li>
            <li>Having SPF is also important to me.</li>
            <li>The BB cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, dries matte, but contains oils that make my face look like I&#x27;m in 8th grade again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>oil free version of this product would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I usually add a dab of moisturizer to the amount I squeeze out and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Light coverage, but not too light, just right for summer and rushed days.</li>
            <li>My favorite BB cream very mouturizing, blend with foundation for stronger coverage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage without feeling heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect~ Its lightweight~Stays on super long~Gives my dry skin a dewy finish~Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li>It covers a bit more  than a regular BB cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this moisturizer at my local CVS.</li>
            <li>Pros: works well as a sunscreen and covers most imperfections; price was very low compared to similar products&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>Or use alone for a dewy, sunkissed natural look.</li>
            <li>Other products out there are either to light or to dark,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure out why it is so much cheaper than other BB creams as it goes on smoothly,&lt;br</li>

            <li> : feels and appears heavy on my skin; color is very orangey when applied and does not soften; difficult to for smooth coverage</li>
            <li> look after a couple days, and I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The medium looks slightly darker out of the tube but adds a bit of sheer color to my face.</li>
            <li> I will since it&#x27;s not heavy and the color is subtle but does evenly cover my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is it a bit thicker than some other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else.</li>
            <li> I found no strong fragrance or irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear color on my skin but with Lumene</li>
            <li> Not sure if there will be any improvement in my skin by using it</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  I could tell a difference after about 2 days of using it...which is amazing to me.  It started giving my skin that &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look after a couple days, and I have really dry skin.  My fiance even told me I was glowing!  Good stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it daily as a moisturizer, sunscreen and to even out skin tones. It is light and airy (not a corrector). I ordered the medium (instead of the light) by mistake, but still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have tried. Light coverage, but not too light, just right for summer and rushed days. Will repurchase this for sure. I love everything I have tried from this brand.</li>
            <li> My skin color is in between light and Medium. This color of Medium was perfect not to light not to Dark. Other products out there are either to light or to dark,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lumene products since this spring, impressed with all of the products, especially like the BB and CC (color corrector)&lt;br /&gt;lightweight, yet skin feels moist. Great product and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pros: works well as a sunscreen and covers most imperfections; price was very low compared to similar products&lt;br /&gt;Cons: feels and appears heavy on my skin; color is very orangey when applied and does not soften; difficult to for smooth coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream very mouturizing, blend with foundation for stronger coverage. Or use alone for a dewy, sunkissed natural look.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my face, I do not even need foundation!</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for my face.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect~ Its lightweight~Stays on super long~Gives my dry skin a dewy finish~Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this stuff.  Can&#x27;t figure out why it is so much cheaper than other BB creams as it goes on smoothly,&lt;br /&gt;covers well, has sunscreen and well I just love it!</li>
            <li> It made my eyes water.  Burned from just the fumes.  I guess I have an allergy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It covers a bit more  than a regular BB cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sheer &amp; doesn&#x27;t cover well</li>
            <li> This is a great BB cream. The medium looks slightly darker out of the tube but adds a bit of sheer color to my face. I am a medium fair blond with a light tan look. The cream is it a bit thicker than some other brands I have tried so I usually add a dab of moisturizer to the amount I squeeze out and it is perfect. The bonus of it being thicker it will last longer. Having SPF is also important to me. I found no strong fragrance or irritation. For the price on Amazon I would highly recommend you try it. I use to buy a Lancôme tinted moisturizer at $55 which is way too costly for me.</li>
            <li> Lumene is my favorite!  The BB cream is fantastic.  Great coverage without feeling heavy or oily.  Good color, great consistency, and fabulous smell.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this BB cream.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else.</li>
            <li> Made me look so shiny and orange!</li>
            <li> The best BB cream I&#x27;ve used. Provides moderate coverage with a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth, dries matte, but contains oils that make my face look like I&#x27;m in 8th grade again.&lt;br /&gt;An oil free version of this product would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this moisturizer at my local CVS. I tried it and liked it but when I went back to CVS they did not have it on their shelves. So I ordered from Amazon. Everything went well with my purchase. This moisturizer smells nice, is light feeling on my skin, I like the 20 spf, and the medium coverage is a good color for my fair skin. I don&#x27;t usually wear color on my skin but with Lumene I will since it&#x27;s not heavy and the color is subtle but does evenly cover my skin. Not sure if there will be any improvement in my skin by using it but that&#x27;s okay. I have an evening routine for that.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot.  It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and it does all of the things the reviews said it would.  Great product, great buy.</li>
