            <li>I sport my free bumper sticker proudly.</li>
            <li>Anyone that has tattoos that are visible while working should really consider investing there money in these wonderful products.</li>
            <li>Nice price and covers my sleeves when needed</li>
            <li>But if you get the right size this is a great product its breathable flexes with you and can be worn for hours without irritation.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They fit great, and keep my arms cool.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, if there was a small size it would be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love that they provide SPF.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>When its warm, it wicks moisture away leaving your arm feel cool and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They cover the tattoo, but breathe beautifully and look professional.  </li>
            <li>I am about 5&amp;#34;11 and it fits pretty good on my arm</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>Good fit and even stays cool out in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery keeps cool in summer, I am</li>
            <li>They never roll, they are comfortable, and even keep him cooler.  </li>
            <li>5&#x27;9 medium built and M size was a fit for me.</li>
            <li>A far superior option for those of us that have tattoos and are not allowed to have them exposed at work.</li>
            <li>I have two full sleeves and these are comfortable and easy to wear all day instead of a bulky sweater.</li>
            <li>The TatJacket is easy to care for and keeps you cool while covering up your tattoos.  </li>
            <li>So worth buying!</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Ah, yes, a cover-up, but for all the right reasons!  </li>
            <li>They stay cool</li>
            <li>True to size and comfy...</li>
            <li>now he can just slip these on before entering their home and they are easy and he doesnt get as hot with these on.</li>
            <li>However, even if the product seems too loose at the top, you can sew the top at the seam to fit your arm.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Tatjacket.</li>
            <li>You can see from the photo that it has some of the blue lint from my scrubs as well as its own.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The shipping was right on time, 5 business days.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These hardly budge and feel great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>Exactly every that I wanted...</li>
            <li>For those with tattoos that must be concealed for professional or whatever reasons, this product comfortably does the job.  </li>
            <li>Having to keep my tattoos covered at work can get really hot.</li>
            <li>This is the second type of sleeve I&#x27;ve ordered to cover my tattoos for work and these are by far more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cant see through them and not that hot to wear in summer time.</li>
            <li>Now he does not need to wear two shirts in this hot Florida weather.  </li>
            <li>Many coworkers ended up buying long sleeve shirts to wear under their uniform.</li>
            <li>I did buy a size medium when small would probably fit better.</li>
            <li>I have a pair in another brand which were large but they don&#x27;t stay on my arm as well.</li>
            <li>So this is very helpful to cover my arm while allowing me not to get over heated.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and works as needed</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit someone who has smaller arms.</li>
            <li>I really like this these sleeves.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big guy and these are much better than wearing another shirt, much cooler compared to a full long sleeve shirt.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Will be definitely buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>will order a few more of these.</li>
            <li>Appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;Whats nice about these is that they are not warm at all, in fact, they seem to be much of the same material as used by name brand companies making tactical and sports shirts.</li>
            <li>The diameter of the upper end of the sleeve is a tad to large for my arms.  </li>
            <li>It totally and completely covers up your tattoos</li>
            <li>Love this item - my only teeny tiny complaint is that this material easily attracts those little lint balls from other materials and creates its own (like the little lint peices you can only get rid of by shaving/trimming the garment) after a few washes.</li>
            <li>Be careful in choosing your sizing, you really need to make sure that you get it right because a size up will fall off or not stay on while a size to small you will either rip trying to get into or will be uncomfortable to wear.</li>

            <li> Reiterating what other reviews have communicated, get the smaller size unless you have big arms.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t survive the heat wearing a long sleeve shirt.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a second pair to do less laundry.  </li>
            <li> Only wished you could get them in half sizes.</li>
            <li> Before he recieved these he had to wear a long sleeved button up shirt over his other shirt to cover the tatoos.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing long sleeves under my scrubs to many layers.</li>
            <li> so short sleeves are pointless and since that&#x27;s the purpose...</li>
            <li> It was extremely uncomfortable first, but when I got used to it, it never bothered me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried them on,  feel a little loose but will see after I wash it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slide down and my only complaint is there not very breezy.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; so this is probably not an issue for average sized people.</li>
            <li> Kept rolling down.</li>
            <li> LG are a little big and med are a little small.</li>
            <li> I have a few sets.</li>
            <li> They were snug but not too small snug,</li>
            <li> My order arrived a day late from the 2 day prime delivery option.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i ended up wearing long sleeves instead, i would not recommend these unless you work in a cold enviroment</li>
            <li> During the cold days my arm was noticeably cooler under the sleeve than my other arm with out it.</li>
            <li> the elastic in the material is very uncomfortable, no ventilation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> works just as it is represented. will order a few more of these. It totally and completely covers up your tattoos</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product that would allow me to cover my fore arm tattoo when department policy changed to no exposed tattoos allowed. Many coworkers ended up buying long sleeve shirts to wear under their uniform. I found these on Amazon and promptly ordered them. I had them within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;There are two jackets in the pack, along with a bumper sticker that reads \\&quot;my job does not define me, my ink does.\\&quot; Appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;Whats nice about these is that they are not warm at all, in fact, they seem to be much of the same material as used by name brand companies making tactical and sports shirts. During the cold days my arm was noticeably cooler under the sleeve than my other arm with out it. When its warm, it wicks moisture away leaving your arm feel cool and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This in the end, was a great buy. A far superior option for those of us that have tattoos and are not allowed to have them exposed at work.</li>

            <li> Love this cover up! I hate wearing long sleeves under my scrubs to many layers. So this is very helpful to cover my arm while allowing me not to get over heated. Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works as needed</li>
            <li> My husband is a mechanic and wears these to work every day.  They never roll, they are comfortable, and even keep him cooler.  They cover the tattoo, but breathe beautifully and look professional.  Just ordered a second pair to do less laundry.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband beacause he has forearm tatoos and he works for a company that requires him to cover up when dealing with customers. Before he recieved these he had to wear a long sleeved button up shirt over his other shirt to cover the tatoos. And i might add no matter what the temperature outside. now he can just slip these on before entering their home and they are easy and he doesnt get as hot with these on. Great invention wish I had come up with it sooner.</li>
            <li> These are the best! I have two full sleeves and these are comfortable and easy to wear all day instead of a bulky sweater. They stay cool and I love that they provide SPF. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Exactly every that I wanted... They are very comfortable and very affordable. Anyone that has tattoos that are visible while working should really consider investing there money in these wonderful products. I would wear nothin else</li>
            <li> I have a few sets. Only wished you could get them in half sizes. LG are a little big and med are a little small.</li>
            <li> Very nice sleeve covers. Good fit and even stays cool out in the hot sun. And they stay in place!</li>

            <li> I did buy a size medium when small would probably fit better. But I&#x27;m definitely ordering again soon for another pair. I really like this these sleeves. They&#x27;re better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. I love my new Tatjacket. Will be definitely buying more in the future. Over all great seller and great product.</li>

            <li> Kept rolling down. Only covers up to the biceps so short sleeves are pointless and since that&#x27;s the purpose...its defeats it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> the elastic in the material is very uncomfortable, no ventilation. i ended up wearing long sleeves instead, i would not recommend these unless you work in a cold enviroment</li>

            <li> My husband bought these for me because I have to cover my sleeved out arms. I love them. True to size and comfy... I want more colors!</li>
            <li> So worth buying! They fit great, and keep my arms cool. Now My boss cant complain about my ink! Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice price and covers my sleeves when needed</li>
            <li> Love this item - my only teeny tiny complaint is that this material easily attracts those little lint balls from other materials and creates its own (like the little lint peices you can only get rid of by shaving/trimming the garment) after a few washes. You can see from the photo that it has some of the blue lint from my scrubs as well as its own. Mine has lost that awesome sleekness because of this but I&#x27;m still a fan of the product.</li>
            <li> I got the med and I am a larger guy. They were snug but not too small snug, just right. I have a pair in another brand which were large but they don&#x27;t stay on my arm as well. These hardly budge and feel great.</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery keeps cool in summer, I am 5&#x27;9 medium built and M size was a fit for me.</li>
            <li> Be careful in choosing your sizing, you really need to make sure that you get it right because a size up will fall off or not stay on while a size to small you will either rip trying to get into or will be uncomfortable to wear. But if you get the right size this is a great product its breathable flexes with you and can be worn for hours without irritation.</li>
            <li> I use this sometimes and it does its job. Cant see through them and not that hot to wear in summer time. It was extremely uncomfortable first, but when I got used to it, it never bothered me. I am about 5&amp;#34;11 and it fits pretty good on my arm</li>
            <li> This is a great product, if there was a small size it would be perfect for me.  The diameter of the upper end of the sleeve is a tad to large for my arms.  I am 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; so this is probably not an issue for average sized people.</li>
            <li> I got these for my son from Amazon to cover his tattoos.  Now he does not need to wear two shirts in this hot Florida weather.  He said that he does not even know he is wearing them and that they are coolant does not perspire when wearing them.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to and keep my tattoos covered at work. The only reason why I knocked a star is because by the end of the day, my skin hurts where the creases are. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I thought I would need a large size, but I read the other reviews and ended up buying a medium in black. It fits perfect and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11&#x27;&#x27; 165lbs. The shipping was right on time, 5 business days.</li>
