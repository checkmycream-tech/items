            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my own skin</li>
            <li>and I honestly have to say that I have seen no difference at all in my skin whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>nice product, so far so good!!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how the serum feels and love what it does to my skin!</li>
            <li>The light flakes of skin coming off are a good thing because my palms looked like they were developing some type of scab.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just bought my second bottle of this serum - I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd best product I&#x27;ve found to make a difference, in how my skin looks, not just feels.</li>
            <li>She said you can use to to 4 products, after 4 your skin won&#x27;t absorb much more &amp; you are wasting $.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I can not rave more about this product.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin looks more hydrated</li>
            <li>then ever (I am someone that NEEDS to drink more water) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>Will write more as the results happen.</li>
            <li>Okay, I got this in the mail in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>So I am confident this will work on my face as well</li>
            <li>, I think its safe to say it will work wonders there as well.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>Im trying to eat better, rest more and stay hydrated</li>
            <li>Anyways, will buying again once current bottle is done, cause it is awesome!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li>So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I received the product within a couple of days, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft-so far-very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely believe that this product is helping me to win the battle.  </li>
            <li>Love this product  .</li>
            <li>Lines are looking softer and my skin looks more luminous.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Most importantly my brown spots have faded dramatically.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 week now)My face, oh my gosh, I love what it is doing on my face, it looks radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy formula that goes on easily.</li>
            <li>The 1st, are strong Retinol products.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, light and non-sticky.  </li>
            <li>, I decided (now almost a year and a half ago) that I would put aside all the prescription drugs and do my best to go about treating my skin problems naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly I noticed the work of this magic serum.</li>
            <li>From someone with very sensitive mature skin that is prone to breakouts, I have to say this is a wonderful product that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li>and it made a huge difference in his skin</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft plump and bright.</li>
            <li>I use a dermaroller which helps product get absorbed better.</li>
            <li>I only  use 2-3, &amp; I&#x27;m  happy with results (plus, I don&#x27;t have all nite for a skin care routine).</li>
            <li>Creams help retinol be absorbed, and retinols are pricey, I want to get the most out of them.  </li>
            <li>It is light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>My hands to not appear to have any sort of reaction just some healing where I see the light flakes of skin coming off</li>
            <li>and it feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I started using it two weeks ago, so far so good</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see week 2,3, and so on and so on.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve found this info useful!.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my son thinking it would help him with his acne.</li>
            <li>The first use and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh after using!</li>
            <li>After applying this at night, my skin feels exceedingly soft and smooth in the morning, and it does feel nicely hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and soft and brightens the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is the only product I can use with the roller, that doesn&#x27;t irritate my ski ,and gives good results by itself.</li>
            <li>This is a good product - I use it at night - I&#x27;m quite wrinkled so I have rather low expectations from these products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the natural ingredients, as I was leaning toward the Olay products and found them to be filled with parabens and other toxic ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 with mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>He also prescribed me a mild cortisone cream.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for only 3 days and it has already lightened my old acne scars (b/c I tried to pop my zits), reduced acne and blackheads, made the skin feel incredibly supple and super duper moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Goes on quickly, disappears, weightless.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used products from Kiehls that cost $15-30 more than this product, and they did not do as good of a job as this serum.</li>
            <li>I have struggled for many years with problem skin at 28, I couldn&#x27;t control my breakouts and found my skin to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li>So far so good, actually to early to review it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the try</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used pretty much everything on the market and this is one of the most effective facial treatments EVER at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has natural ingredients, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This was kind of long winded but just wanted to share in hopes of helping anyone else.</li>
            <li>Wasted a lot of money with belief, more $ got better products.</li>
            <li>I am hoping long term use will yield more progress and greater results, but this past week has been amazing.</li>
            <li>no odor, hydrates on first use, no weird reaction</li>
            <li>and I could tell a difference in the first week of use.</li>
            <li>Okay, I tried it on my face, back of hands, and fingertips for what was diagnosed as hand eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to apply more to my neck area as I cant wait for the results on that.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that hydrates my skin without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>Because this blocks androgens, I did notice a reduction in my oil production and even more improvement when I started only drinking coffee every now and</li>
            <li>I wasrecently reading an article on skin care and how even with hormonal acne being a more internal issue</li>
            <li>At first I thought this product was too greasy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old, and my skin is in relatively good condition and tends to run dry.</li>
            <li>Feels very soothing when I put it on and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin already feels a lot healthier, more nourished and in general just looks better with fewer blemishes and has a more even tone to it (less blotchy red)!</li>
            <li>I wore a long review on how I roll, if you want to look up, I worked hard to find ways to get the best benefit from them, When &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the retinol, use cream</li>
            <li>Within a matter of weeks my skin is smoother and fine lines are erased and my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and have told all my friends and family to try it too!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>my palms, absolutely 98% gone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and clearer.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much product.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used a different brand of Niacinamide prior to trying this one, and I must say, this one is by far superior.</li>
            <li>After these adjustments were made my skin was better than back before I started the accutane which I am grateful, but it still wasn&#x27;t completely to the point that I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw this serum and was very happy to see that it not only contained 5% of B3 but it also had the other before mentioned nutrients as well with other beneficial things in there too</li>
            <li>I am very picky with all the products I use because I break out if I don&#x27;t use high quality products.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be  100 % sure that it&#x27;s all down to this product?&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skeptical of most products, but after trying this, within a week my skin began to change; complexion evened out, a healthy sheen, and scarring started to fade.</li>
            <li>I just turned 50, and am at that age where my skincare routine focuses mainly on diminishing the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>then instead of every day since the high amounts of caffeine tend to affect hormonal balances in some cases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s, I have fair skin, I live in an extremely dry climate, and I use lotion daily!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting complements left and right about how vibrant my skin look.</li>
            <li>just started using this about two weeks ago and so far I am very please with how my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>It featured a list of some of the top nutrients that our skin needs including A, D, E, B3...just to name a few.</li>
            <li>This phase only lasted about a week if that, and is now gone and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>A noticable difference in how my skin looks is my goal with a new product.</li>
            <li>Having said this almost all my skincare is new  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately most companies on the internet list all the ingredients present on almost all skincare products, so I spent my spare time searching for new replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never filled that prescription because I had ordered this product and wanted to try something more natural as I&#x27;ve always tried to do.</li>
            <li>Within these few weeks I&#x27;ve seen many of my old scars fade, as well as return a brightness and firmness to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using  this cream every night for about a week and it has made my face very soft.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to treat my hands first anyways before I put it all over my face in case</li>
            <li>Eventually I want to get married and have children and between the birth control and the spiro, which is known to cause birth defects in male children if it is still in your system</li>
            <li>I also have old n new scars</li>
            <li>I finally found the product that completes my daily regimen to keep my skin looking fresh and new!</li>
            <li>The skin seems to really drink this in, and there is no sticky feeling (as long as you don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much).  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in dark spots yet but am hopeful.</li>
            <li>Then after much trial and error and trying different supplements, I started taking an herb that is a natural androgen blocker (beta-sitosterol).</li>
            <li>but this hasnt So far.</li>
            <li>But this stuff so far has been a blessing to my skin</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every product to market and natural remedy to repair/heal damaged skin.</li>
            <li>With this professional skin repair serum, the combination of natural products work synergistically to address both sides of improving health and healing damage.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too early for the scar to fade , I will keep using it</li>
            <li>Hi I&#x27;m 54 and was looking for a serum that was natural and delivered results</li>
            <li>This product was far to sticky.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to target some old acne scars I had on my face.</li>
            <li>I was on accutane a few years back for 7 months and during that time my skin was perfect but it is such a harsh drug on your body not to mention it&#x27;s link to birth defects and about 5 months after stopping it, the same skin problems came back.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on, I woke up the following morning and not only was my skin glowing</li>
            <li>I am very eager to see how it will do long term to help even with acne scars.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be sorry if you give this a try, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet you will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I wonder if I was possibly deficient in Niacin because my skin just loves it and does so much better with it.</li>
            <li>My skin does look much clearer and less irritated now nearly a month after using.</li>
            <li>that you could actually see!&lt;br /&gt;After reading a number of 5 star reviews I was convinced that this was the product that would replace my old one since I was recently alerted to the fact that almost all my skin and haircare products contained a number of toxic ingredients which might have been responsible for other problems that I was experiencing.....</li>
            <li>, that in some cases it needs to be taken care of both internally and externally (Pertaining to the need for our skin’s natural barrier to be nourished to help fight acne).</li>
            <li>Especially from other people, I can&#x27;t always tell myself if my skin looks better, I see myself so often, with gradual effects, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing or not.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and like this very much.</li>
            <li>but I decided to give this approach a try and started looking for a B3 serum with as much of the other above listed nutrients as possible.</li>
            <li>With just a little dab of cream, you get so much coverage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve just bought my second bottle of this serum - I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd best product I&#x27;ve found to make a difference, in how my skin looks, not just feels.</li>
            <li> She said you can use to to 4 products, after 4 your skin won&#x27;t absorb much more &amp; you are wasting $.</li>

            <li> Will write more as the results happen.</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this in the mail in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> So I am confident this will work on my face as well</li>
            <li> , I think its safe to say it will work wonders there as well.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> Im trying to eat better, rest more and stay hydrated</li>
            <li> Anyways, will buying again once current bottle is done, cause it is awesome!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li> So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I received the product within a couple of days, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft-so far-very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely believe that this product is helping me to win the battle.  </li>
            <li> Love this product  .</li>
            <li> Lines are looking softer and my skin looks more luminous.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Most importantly my brown spots have faded dramatically.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 week now)My face, oh my gosh, I love what it is doing on my face, it looks radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy formula that goes on easily.</li>
            <li> The 1st, are strong Retinol products.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, light and non-sticky.  </li>
            <li> , I decided (now almost a year and a half ago) that I would put aside all the prescription drugs and do my best to go about treating my skin problems naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly I noticed the work of this magic serum.</li>
            <li> From someone with very sensitive mature skin that is prone to breakouts, I have to say this is a wonderful product that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li> and it made a huge difference in his skin</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft plump and bright.</li>
            <li> I use a dermaroller which helps product get absorbed better.</li>
            <li> I only  use 2-3, &amp; I&#x27;m  happy with results (plus, I don&#x27;t have all nite for a skin care routine).</li>
            <li> Creams help retinol be absorbed, and retinols are pricey, I want to get the most out of them.  </li>
            <li> It is light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> My hands to not appear to have any sort of reaction just some healing where I see the light flakes of skin coming off</li>
            <li> and it feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I started using it two weeks ago, so far so good</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see week 2,3, and so on and so on.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve found this info useful!.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my son thinking it would help him with his acne.</li>
            <li> The first use and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh after using!</li>
            <li> After applying this at night, my skin feels exceedingly soft and smooth in the morning, and it does feel nicely hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft and brightens the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I can use with the roller, that doesn&#x27;t irritate my ski ,and gives good results by itself.</li>
            <li> This is a good product - I use it at night - I&#x27;m quite wrinkled so I have rather low expectations from these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the natural ingredients, as I was leaning toward the Olay products and found them to be filled with parabens and other toxic ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> He also prescribed me a mild cortisone cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only 3 days and it has already lightened my old acne scars (b/c I tried to pop my zits), reduced acne and blackheads, made the skin feel incredibly supple and super duper moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Goes on quickly, disappears, weightless.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used products from Kiehls that cost $15-30 more than this product, and they did not do as good of a job as this serum.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for many years with problem skin at 28, I couldn&#x27;t control my breakouts and found my skin to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li> So far so good, actually to early to review it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the try</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used pretty much everything on the market and this is one of the most effective facial treatments EVER at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has natural ingredients, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This was kind of long winded but just wanted to share in hopes of helping anyone else.</li>
            <li> Wasted a lot of money with belief, more $ got better products.</li>
            <li> I am hoping long term use will yield more progress and greater results, but this past week has been amazing.</li>
            <li> no odor, hydrates on first use, no weird reaction</li>
            <li> and I could tell a difference in the first week of use.</li>
            <li> Okay, I tried it on my face, back of hands, and fingertips for what was diagnosed as hand eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to apply more to my neck area as I cant wait for the results on that.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that hydrates my skin without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Because this blocks androgens, I did notice a reduction in my oil production and even more improvement when I started only drinking coffee every now and</li>
            <li> I wasrecently reading an article on skin care and how even with hormonal acne being a more internal issue</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was too greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old, and my skin is in relatively good condition and tends to run dry.</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing when I put it on and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin already feels a lot healthier, more nourished and in general just looks better with fewer blemishes and has a more even tone to it (less blotchy red)!</li>
            <li> I wore a long review on how I roll, if you want to look up, I worked hard to find ways to get the best benefit from them, When &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the retinol, use cream</li>
            <li> Within a matter of weeks my skin is smoother and fine lines are erased and my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and have told all my friends and family to try it too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> my palms, absolutely 98% gone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much product.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used a different brand of Niacinamide prior to trying this one, and I must say, this one is by far superior.</li>
            <li> After these adjustments were made my skin was better than back before I started the accutane which I am grateful, but it still wasn&#x27;t completely to the point that I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw this serum and was very happy to see that it not only contained 5% of B3 but it also had the other before mentioned nutrients as well with other beneficial things in there too</li>
            <li> I am very picky with all the products I use because I break out if I don&#x27;t use high quality products.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be  100 % sure that it&#x27;s all down to this product?&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of most products, but after trying this, within a week my skin began to change; complexion evened out, a healthy sheen, and scarring started to fade.</li>
            <li> I just turned 50, and am at that age where my skincare routine focuses mainly on diminishing the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> then instead of every day since the high amounts of caffeine tend to affect hormonal balances in some cases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s, I have fair skin, I live in an extremely dry climate, and I use lotion daily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting complements left and right about how vibrant my skin look.</li>
            <li> just started using this about two weeks ago and so far I am very please with how my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> It featured a list of some of the top nutrients that our skin needs including A, D, E, B3...just to name a few.</li>
            <li> This phase only lasted about a week if that, and is now gone and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> A noticable difference in how my skin looks is my goal with a new product.</li>
            <li> Having said this almost all my skincare is new  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately most companies on the internet list all the ingredients present on almost all skincare products, so I spent my spare time searching for new replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never filled that prescription because I had ordered this product and wanted to try something more natural as I&#x27;ve always tried to do.</li>
            <li> Within these few weeks I&#x27;ve seen many of my old scars fade, as well as return a brightness and firmness to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this cream every night for about a week and it has made my face very soft.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to treat my hands first anyways before I put it all over my face in case</li>
            <li> Eventually I want to get married and have children and between the birth control and the spiro, which is known to cause birth defects in male children if it is still in your system</li>
            <li> I also have old n new scars</li>
            <li> I finally found the product that completes my daily regimen to keep my skin looking fresh and new!</li>
            <li> The skin seems to really drink this in, and there is no sticky feeling (as long as you don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much).  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in dark spots yet but am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Then after much trial and error and trying different supplements, I started taking an herb that is a natural androgen blocker (beta-sitosterol).</li>
            <li> but this hasnt So far.</li>
            <li> But this stuff so far has been a blessing to my skin</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every product to market and natural remedy to repair/heal damaged skin.</li>
            <li> With this professional skin repair serum, the combination of natural products work synergistically to address both sides of improving health and healing damage.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too early for the scar to fade , I will keep using it</li>
            <li> Hi I&#x27;m 54 and was looking for a serum that was natural and delivered results</li>
            <li> This product was far to sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to target some old acne scars I had on my face.</li>
            <li> I was on accutane a few years back for 7 months and during that time my skin was perfect but it is such a harsh drug on your body not to mention it&#x27;s link to birth defects and about 5 months after stopping it, the same skin problems came back.</li>
            <li> The first night I put it on, I woke up the following morning and not only was my skin glowing</li>
            <li> I am very eager to see how it will do long term to help even with acne scars.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you give this a try, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet you will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I wonder if I was possibly deficient in Niacin because my skin just loves it and does so much better with it.</li>
            <li> My skin does look much clearer and less irritated now nearly a month after using.</li>
            <li> that you could actually see!&lt;br /&gt;After reading a number of 5 star reviews I was convinced that this was the product that would replace my old one since I was recently alerted to the fact that almost all my skin and haircare products contained a number of toxic ingredients which might have been responsible for other problems that I was experiencing.....</li>
            <li> , that in some cases it needs to be taken care of both internally and externally (Pertaining to the need for our skin’s natural barrier to be nourished to help fight acne).</li>
            <li> Especially from other people, I can&#x27;t always tell myself if my skin looks better, I see myself so often, with gradual effects, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and like this very much.</li>
            <li> but I decided to give this approach a try and started looking for a B3 serum with as much of the other above listed nutrients as possible.</li>
            <li> With just a little dab of cream, you get so much coverage.</li>
            <li> I will say that I think I did experience a little bit of an initial break out in the form of tiny whiteheads scattered about, but they were very small, hardly red, and came and went very quickly.</li>
            <li> Even then, the natural products only addressed one side of a host of skin care concerns, such as maintaining health and shine, but doing little to heal scarring, or vice versa.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> So cream, wait 30 (not longer don&#x27;&#x27;t want skin to dry out) then retinol (on &amp; off equal amount of time with them) them 30 minutes later the Nia........, then roll.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s long enough) then apply my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> T-zone oily and dry cheek skin, starting to see wrinkles because of the dryness.</li>
            <li> , he has less and less break outs his skin is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like to be away long when I&#x27;m expecting something.</li>
            <li> Having dealing with oily sensitive skin for so long, I was always hesitant about putting anything on my face (especially since I had tried creams in the past before accutane and none of them seemed to work)</li>
            <li> I put a little dab of this Niacinamide cream on these spots and just last night (Ive only dabbed it twice)</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry skin and</li>
            <li> No new acne as of now ...</li>
            <li> No more chaffing on fingertips (all is completely resolved)</li>
            <li> Just some small residual, but nearly resolved.</li>
            <li> After using it for only a week I think my skin looks brighter, and the dark circles under my eyes look lighter.</li>
            <li> short, I started from the inside by improving my eating habits, including trying to drink the recommended amount of water per day which is half your body weight in oz</li>
            <li> I have very dry and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a little over a week</li>
            <li> my late 30 n have sensitive n acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will also work in the winter &amp; help protect against the harsh cold winds.</li>
            <li> This is money well spent and also, cheaper than the prescription my derm gave me.    </li>
            <li> red hair/fair skinned with oily, acne prone skin that tends to have reddish uneven tones.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure where it came from, as manufacturer&#x27;s website has a bunch of unclickable links with only one product page.</li>
            <li> but I now only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few days and have only dabbed a little here</li>
            <li> The active acne I had is clearing up</li>
            <li> I just figured it was a step in the right direction because my skin was purging, plus I am use to big painful pimples</li>
            <li> After trying for years with synthetic products, that did little or made my condition worse, I resorted to all natural products.</li>
            <li> Not true, I use the Eurcerian.</li>
            <li> Does leave skin a little sticky.</li>
            <li> but I am also putting a little tea tree oil on my face.</li>
            <li> but this little bottle has lasted 3 months already</li>
            <li> * it&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use this 1st, wait 15 minutes and then roll every few nites.</li>
            <li> Just in a few spots, not all over.</li>
            <li> and again it worked wonders, however after a few years of being on that routine, I had to come to the reality that this isn&#x27;t something I can do forever.</li>
            <li> everyday</li>
            <li> but my dark spots were slightly faded!!</li>
            <li> I tend to use it in the AM as well, but am not sure if that is maybe a bit of overkill, so think that I&#x27;ll start using it just in the PM.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that always look dull.</li>
            <li> I just gave the serum to my mom for her to try too (in her late 50s)</li>
            <li> (at the risk of sounding shallow.)</li>
            <li> (if you want specifics, go to www.ewg.org for the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s breakdown of ingredients and poor ratings).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results yet</li>
            <li> Not an expensive routine and</li>
            <li> Everything that was wrong with my skin is now looking healthier.</li>
            <li> Sadly... I am 44 y.o. woman with problematic hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> ( I know, awful isn&#x27;t it?)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft and brightens the look of my skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in dark spots yet but am hopeful. Does leave skin a little sticky.</li>
            <li> just started using this about two weeks ago and so far I am very please with how my skin looks and feels.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just bought my second bottle of this serum - I&#x27;m very happy.  I&#x27;ve also recently used Vitamin C serum and a retinol serum and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> changed the texture of my skin. LOVE it. I&#x27;m so happy. I have a &amp;#34;glow now&amp;#34;. I have acne prone skin that always look dull. Now I feel like prettier (at the risk of sounding shallow.)</li>
            <li> nice product, so far so good!!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly nice: no odor, hydrates on first use, no weird reaction</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week now. I&#x27;m 34 with mild acne breakouts. T-zone oily and dry cheek skin, starting to see wrinkles because of the dryness. I wanted this for my breakouts and to help with the dryness. Everything seems to break me out but this hasnt So far. My skin is brighter, smoother, softer. I have never seen my face so bright looking. The active acne I had is clearing up but I am also putting a little tea tree oil on my face. But this stuff so far has been a blessing to my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update** it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I&#x27;m still loving this. Use it morning and night. Keeps my skin soft plump and bright. Still has not caused breakouts. I will continue to buy when I run out</li>
            <li> One pump covers my entire face and neck.  It is easy to apply, light and non-sticky.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but it appears to be reducing the redness associated with my life-long experience of acne (over 50 at this point and still dealing with breakouts, even with prescription medications to reduce acne).  I&#x27;m really impressed with the natural ingredients, as I was leaning toward the Olay products and found them to be filled with parabens and other toxic ingredients (if you want specifics, go to www.ewg.org for the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s breakdown of ingredients and poor ratings).</li>
            <li> Bought a while ago, waited to review to SEE results. I have. I use a dermaroller which helps product get absorbed better. Get those on Amazon too. I like Melody Susie rollers. I use this 1st, wait 15 minutes and then roll every few nites. I use Niacinamide nightly. Isn&#x27;t greasy, does leave a kind of residue on my skin. But only use at nite anyway. It is the only product I can use with the roller, that doesn&#x27;t irritate my ski ,and gives good results by itself. This is the 2nd best product I&#x27;ve found to make a difference, in how my skin looks, not just feels. I want to SEE results. The 1st, are strong Retinol products. I use a retinol for a peroid, than stop &amp; and use this and face cream after. Using retinol w/o a break doesn&#x27;t work. At some point I stop seeing results with them, then I know it&#x27;s time take a break. I use the Nia......,  whether I&#x27;m on or off  retinol. I use this nightly. When not using retinol I use this 1st and then Eucerian co Q 10 after.  Was told by an excellent derm nurse, you can layer products, and get full benefits from each,  IF you wait 30 minutes between, for products to fully absorb. She said you can use to to 4 products, after 4 your skin won&#x27;t absorb much more &amp; you are wasting $. I only  use 2-3, &amp; I&#x27;m  happy with results (plus, I don&#x27;t have all nite for a skin care routine). I always use a face cream (found Eucerian Co Q 10, works best). Best for me anyway &amp; no matter what price I pay. Have tried a lot, and paid a lot. Wasted a lot of money with belief, more $ got better products. Not true, I use the Eurcerian.CoQ 10 cream(the only product from their line I like), under the retinol. Creams help retinol be absorbed, and retinols are pricey, I want to get the most out of them.  So cream, wait 30 (not longer don&#x27;&#x27;t want skin to dry out) then retinol (on &amp; off equal amount of time with them) them 30 minutes later the Nia........, then roll. I wore a long review on how I roll, if you want to look up, I worked hard to find ways to get the best benefit from them, When &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; the retinol, use cream then this procdut. Not an expensive routine and people have commented on the difference in my skin. A noticable difference in how my skin looks is my goal with a new product. Especially from other people, I can&#x27;t always tell myself if my skin looks better, I see myself so often, with gradual effects, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing or not.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and after a week I like the result. I like the ingredients. It works great as a moisturizer. Great customer service follow up.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Besides all of the yummy stuff it has in it that I could go on and on about, it also made my skin glow after just a week. I just gave the serum to my mom for her to try too (in her late 50s) and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I can not rave more about this product. The first night I put it on, I woke up the following morning and not only was my skin glowing but my dark spots were slightly faded!! I was amazed at how quickly I noticed the work of this magic serum. I have struggled for many years with problem skin at 28, I couldn&#x27;t control my breakouts and found my skin to be super sensitive. I got an organic face wash and lotion and now this! I finally found the product that completes my daily regimen to keep my skin looking fresh and new! I feel my skin looks more hydrated then ever (I am someone that NEEDS to drink more water) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I don&#x27;t wanna skip a day or night as I am beyond pleased with this product! I highly recommend it and have told all my friends and family to try it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s, I have fair skin, I live in an extremely dry climate, and I use lotion daily! Once I started using this stuff- I was amazed! I use it on my hands, face, and neck and I could tell a difference in the first week of use. My skin looks hydrated and younger! I will order again when this runs out but this little bottle has lasted 3 months already and I&#x27;m still not close to being out!</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.  Within a matter of weeks my skin is smoother and fine lines are erased and my pores look smaller.  Most importantly my brown spots have faded dramatically.</li>
            <li> Great product! From someone with very sensitive mature skin that is prone to breakouts, I have to say this is a wonderful product that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. It is light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well. I will continue to purchase this serum.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with all the products I use because I break out if I don&#x27;t use high quality products. I absolutely love how the serum feels and love what it does to my skin! I&#x27;ve been getting complements left and right about how vibrant my skin look. Thank you thank you for this wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry skin and this serum has helped my face become so moisturized and healthy! I am so happy with this product and can&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I have had this for about a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. I am loving this product.  I am excited to see week 2,3, and so on and so on.  Will write more as the results happen.</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this in the mail in a timely manner. I like that because packages are left at my front door step and I don&#x27;t like to be away long when I&#x27;m expecting something. I&#x27;ve had it a few days and have only dabbed a little here and there, so I don&#x27;t have the greatest of reviews right now. HOWEVER..I had just visited my dermatologist who diagnosed me with some hand eczema. Its on my fingertips and the perimeter of my palm, I thought it was a fungal infection, but he said no. He told me to put emollient creams on my hands up to 10 times per day and wear cotton gloves at night for added protection until I&#x27;ve healed. He also prescribed me a mild cortisone cream. I never filled that prescription because I had ordered this product and wanted to try something more natural as I&#x27;ve always tried to do. I put a little dab of this Niacinamide cream on these spots and just last night (Ive only dabbed it twice) I saw it healing. I had to do a double take because I thought that is not possible, I haven&#x27;t even been diligent about it yet and I&#x27;ve noticed some healing. I actually wanted to treat my hands first anyways before I put it all over my face in case I had some sort of reaction to this. My hands to not appear to have any sort of reaction just some healing where I see the light flakes of skin coming off and it feels really smooth. My fingertips are not peeling like they were, nor chapped. The light flakes of skin coming off are a good thing because my palms looked like they were developing some type of scab. ( I know, awful isn&#x27;t it?) Just in a few spots, not all over. So I am confident this will work on my face as well and Im going to use it there as soon as Im done posting, I think its safe to say it will work wonders there as well. My face is sensitive to most products. This is money well spent and also, cheaper than the prescription my derm gave me.    11/25/2014 Update. Okay, I tried it on my face, back of hands, and fingertips for what was diagnosed as hand eczema. Allis well. I love the results. No more chaffing on fingertips (all is completely resolved) my palms, absolutely 98% gone. Just some small residual, but nearly resolved. (I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 week now)My face, oh my gosh, I love what it is doing on my face, it looks radiant and smooth. I apply it and wait about 10 minutes (that&#x27;s long enough) then apply my mineral makeup. What an awesome finish. I&#x27;m starting to apply more to my neck area as I cant wait for the results on that. This is a very good product. I wonder if I was possibly deficient in Niacin because my skin just loves it and does so much better with it. Everything that was wrong with my skin is now looking healthier. Im trying to eat better, rest more and stay hydrated but my lifestyle hasn&#x27;t always made that the simplest of things to do. So thankful for this product as it helps me to look healthier while Im in the process of trying to be. Will keep it in my routine for good.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for two months now and absolutely love it! I use it around my eyes as well, let it absorb for about 5 minutes before applying moisturizer. Not sure where it came from, as manufacturer&#x27;s website has a bunch of unclickable links with only one product page. Anyways, will buying again once current bottle is done, cause it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every product to market and natural remedy to repair/heal damaged skin. After trying for years with synthetic products, that did little or made my condition worse, I resorted to all natural products. Even then, the natural products only addressed one side of a host of skin care concerns, such as maintaining health and shine, but doing little to heal scarring, or vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;  With this professional skin repair serum, the combination of natural products work synergistically to address both sides of improving health and healing damage. I am praising God for gems like this, as I almost can&#x27;t believe it is working. I&#x27;m skeptical of most products, but after trying this, within a week my skin began to change; complexion evened out, a healthy sheen, and scarring started to fade. I am hoping long term use will yield more progress and greater results, but this past week has been amazing. Thank you for creating products like this and please continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Also, their policies for customer concern and sales feedback are excellent.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  This stuff takes the place of everything else in my drawer!  So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product - I use it at night - I&#x27;m quite wrinkled so I have rather low expectations from these products.</li>
            <li> So far so good, actually to early to review it. I am in my late 30 n have sensitive n acne prone skin I also have old n new scars n redness on both my cheeks, but this cream has remove the redness fr my face ,but the marks r still there , it&#x27;s too early for the scar to fade , I will keep using it n let&#x27;s see how it does.... Also after using this cream I have no break out... No new acne as of now ... So it&#x27;s good ... I don&#x27;t know if it is because of this cream or I have started using lemon juice with lukewarm water 1st thing in morning , but both seems like working for me .... So I m happy .. It is worth the try</li>
            <li> I received the product within a couple of days, and I just love it. It makes my skin feel very soft-so far-very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My skin looks so healthy! I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing when I put it on and melts right into my skin. I can see a glow after only using it abut a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and like this very much.</li>
            <li> Hi I&#x27;m 54 and was looking for a serum that was natural and delivered results that you could actually see!&lt;br /&gt;After reading a number of 5 star reviews I was convinced that this was the product that would replace my old one since I was recently alerted to the fact that almost all my skin and haircare products contained a number of toxic ingredients which might have been responsible for other problems that I was experiencing.....&lt;br /&gt;After disposing of almost all of my make-up, moisturizers &amp; shampoos I went in search of organic products that didn&#x27;t contain a list of the&#x27; baddies&#x27; that I was now familiarizing myself with.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately most companies on the internet list all the ingredients present on almost all skincare products, so I spent my spare time searching for new replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found with Avah Skin:&lt;br /&gt;- I use it at night (straight after cleansing) as it does take a few minutes to absorb into the skin as stated.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin does look much clearer and less irritated now nearly a month after using. Having said this almost all my skincare is new  so I can&#x27;t be  100 % sure that it&#x27;s all down to this product?&lt;br /&gt;Hope you&#x27;ve found this info useful!.</li>
            <li> I started using it two weeks ago, so far so good</li>
            <li> This product was far to sticky. I used it twice and the stickiness only went away by washing this product off of my skin. If you don&#x27;t mind being sticky this product might work for you. I wish I had not purchased.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. This product is amazing! It does everything that is promised. My skin is much softer and clearer. This is the first moisturizer that hydrates my skin without clogging my pores. I&#x27;m on my second order and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used a different brand of Niacinamide prior to trying this one, and I must say, this one is by far superior. I notice a definite difference in the way my skin feels, especially when I use it at night, after my toner.  I tend to use it in the AM as well, but am not sure if that is maybe a bit of overkill, so think that I&#x27;ll start using it just in the PM.  After applying this at night, my skin feels exceedingly soft and smooth in the morning, and it does feel nicely hydrated.  The skin seems to really drink this in, and there is no sticky feeling (as long as you don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much).  I just turned 50, and am at that age where my skincare routine focuses mainly on diminishing the signs of aging.  I absolutely believe that this product is helping me to win the battle.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you give this a try, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet you will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  I put this on at night &amp; in the morning &amp; have noticed the GLOW!  My skin just soaks this up.  I&#x27;m sure it will also work in the winter &amp; help protect against the harsh cold winds. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using  this cream every night for about a week and it has made my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my son thinking it would help him with his acne. Well I used for a week before I could get him to try it, needless to say I fell in love with it got him to try it and it made a huge difference in his skin, he has less and less break outs his skin is so much smoother. When I stopped using it I could tell a difference in my own skin so I ordered another bottle for myself. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I definitely will be a repeat purchaser.  I have very dry and acne prone skin.  This facial cream solves both problems.  You don&#x27;t have to use much product. With just a little dab of cream, you get so much coverage.</li>
            <li> The first use and I am pleased. Non-greasy formula that goes on easily.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product.  I love that it has natural ingredients, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  After using it for only a week I think my skin looks brighter, and the dark circles under my eyes look lighter.</li>
            <li> I love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly... I am 44 y.o. woman with problematic hormonal acne. I have used this product for only 3 days and it has already lightened my old acne scars (b/c I tried to pop my zits), reduced acne and blackheads, made the skin feel incredibly supple and super duper moisturized.  My skin looks and feels &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I have used pretty much everything on the market and this is one of the most effective facial treatments EVER at a reasonable price.  Thank you Avah Skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product  . Works great</li>
            <li> Added this to my home made shampoo. Great results</li>
            <li> It has only been a little over a week and I can tell a difference in my skin! Just to give some background to hopefully help anyone else in the same boat, I am 26, red hair/fair skinned with oily, acne prone skin that tends to have reddish uneven tones. I have been dealing with my acne, which is hormonal, for years. I was on accutane a few years back for 7 months and during that time my skin was perfect but it is such a harsh drug on your body not to mention it&#x27;s link to birth defects and about 5 months after stopping it, the same skin problems came back. My dermatologist at the time then put me on a birth control and spironolactone which has an anti-androgen effect to it and again it worked wonders, however after a few years of being on that routine, I had to come to the reality that this isn&#x27;t something I can do forever. Eventually I want to get married and have children and between the birth control and the spiro, which is known to cause birth defects in male children if it is still in your system, I decided (now almost a year and a half ago) that I would put aside all the prescription drugs and do my best to go about treating my skin problems naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I started from the inside by improving my eating habits, including trying to drink the recommended amount of water per day which is half your body weight in oz (ex: 145lbs &#x3D; 70.25 oz per day). Then after much trial and error and trying different supplements, I started taking an herb that is a natural androgen blocker (beta-sitosterol). Because this blocks androgens, I did notice a reduction in my oil production and even more improvement when I started only drinking coffee every now and then instead of every day since the high amounts of caffeine tend to affect hormonal balances in some cases. After these adjustments were made my skin was better than back before I started the accutane which I am grateful, but it still wasn&#x27;t completely to the point that I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I wasrecently reading an article on skin care and how even with hormonal acne being a more internal issue, that in some cases it needs to be taken care of both internally and externally (Pertaining to the need for our skin’s natural barrier to be nourished to help fight acne). It featured a list of some of the top nutrients that our skin needs including A, D, E, B3...just to name a few. Having dealing with oily sensitive skin for so long, I was always hesitant about putting anything on my face (especially since I had tried creams in the past before accutane and none of them seemed to work) but I decided to give this approach a try and started looking for a B3 serum with as much of the other above listed nutrients as possible. I saw this serum and was very happy to see that it not only contained 5% of B3 but it also had the other before mentioned nutrients as well with other beneficial things in there too so I decided to give it a try. My skin already feels a lot healthier, more nourished and in general just looks better with fewer blemishes and has a more even tone to it (less blotchy red)! The serum absorbs well and doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily. A little goes a long way. I will say that I think I did experience a little bit of an initial break out in the form of tiny whiteheads scattered about, but they were very small, hardly red, and came and went very quickly. I just figured it was a step in the right direction because my skin was purging, plus I am use to big painful pimples so it wasn’t a big deal for me. This phase only lasted about a week if that, and is now gone and totally worth it. I am very eager to see how it will do long term to help even with acne scars. I am also taking a 20% vitamin C facial serum in conjunction with this. Thank you for reading. This was kind of long winded but just wanted to share in hopes of helping anyone else. Love this product and will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I am seeing great improvement in the look of my skin since I started using this serum. Lines are looking softer and my skin looks more luminous. I like what I am seeing in the mirror, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Moisturizes my skin without being oily. No smells to bother my nose. My skin looks fresh after using!</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter. I have had no issues using this. Goes on quickly, disappears, weightless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to target some old acne scars I had on my face. I&#x27;m 30 years old, and my skin is in relatively good condition and tends to run dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and it is fantastic. Within these few weeks I&#x27;ve seen many of my old scars fade, as well as return a brightness and firmness to my skin. In the past I&#x27;ve used products from Kiehls that cost $15-30 more than this product, and they did not do as good of a job as this serum. I am truly impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for two months and I like it and feel that there has been some improved results. Based on my experience, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it! Iam not faithful with it everyday but it healed my eczema that I had on each side of nose and above lip area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream serum for almost a month and I honestly have to say that I have seen no difference at all in my skin whatsoever.  I would not recommend this product or buy again for myself.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was too greasy but I now only use a small amount. It goes on easily and will last a long time. I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> gave it to my daughter...she says it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream now for several months and I cannot do without it!  THANK YOU!!</li>
