            <li>OTHERS MY HAPPY EXPERIENCE AND DIRECT OTHERS TO THIS SITE.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>This product contains \\&quot;Hydroquinone-1.9&amp;\\&quot; which is strongly advised by doctors to avoid when deciding on a skin bleaching cream.</li>

            <li>Fabulous product to even your complexion.</li>
            <li>I would more recomend the fair and white serum and glycerin.</li>
            <li>wow this is amazing really works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li>I see you complexion will get a liller darker so it best to keep use a small amount of it</li>
            <li>The stores are selling the exact product for $3 more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been one month applying this twice a day with clean skin</li>
            <li>This was nice as a moisturizer, but as far as fading spots, it didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, the only fading cream that seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>I have been use fair &amp;white for 2months</li>
            <li>Fair and white gel creme works on fading spots as for pigmented skin</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my skin feel soft and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product, this is the second time I have ordered.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and tried a free sample and the product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>In reading more about it, it may very well be treatable to a certain extent (costly--laser therapy, etc), but not curable.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found something that works, and was not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I think we are getting our money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
            <li>OMG is the best product I never had for dark spot, it really works been using this cream for about a year and just feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I did some research and it sounds very akin to a condition called Ochronosis (look it up) which is supposed to be very rare.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome thing to have, I have already bought 3 other tubes for back up</li>
            <li>My wife uses this mixed with a similar product to maintain her beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>However the cream does smell a bit funny after you use it for a while.</li>
            <li>This is the first cream that work as well as a prescription cream.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any positive result.</li>
            <li>I purchased this fair and white cream for relatives in other country, they like it, they said they used it every day at night for dark spots in the skin and worked good.</li>
            <li>At the start of use, I had many, many dark blotches and spots now, a full 3 months later, my skin is COMPLETELY clear.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes we focus a bit too much on something that is really very minor in the grand scheme of things, but hindsight is, as they say, 20/20.</li>
            <li>Did not realize that it had so much Hydroquinone (sp?)</li>
            <li>I am a caramel colored (light brown) African-American female.</li>
            <li>Thanks, everyone, for reading my review.</li>
            <li>I believe it has too much hydroquordine (sp?)</li>
            <li>and is much cheaper than any cream , prescription or non prescription.  </li>
            <li>it really work</li>
            <li>But in any case thanks..</li>
            <li>She found this product to work very well and will order again when needed.  </li>
            <li>thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li>I am veryyyyyy happpppy very quickkk resultsss.</li>
            <li>I mixed this product with the cream from fair white and put it directly on my darkspots with a week</li>
            <li>but my skin is back to normal and looks cool and me likey lots!</li>
            <li>This is strong, so be careful in how much and where you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been exercising for almost a year, losing more than 40 lbs, I&#x27;ve learned somehow my weight sometimes are sources of my dark spots.</li>
            <li>my face is not even I manily work on the dark spot in my face now</li>
            <li>I love this producet only reason I gave it a 4 star was because it gave me a red rash on my face</li>
            <li>I purchased the products for a fairly decent price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Amazon and thought that it would be great for getting rid of dark marks that were on my cheeks, between my eyes on forehead, and on my chin from previous acne.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want someone to pass up trying this low priced, amazing product due to an improbable reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe it could be little bit better.  </li>
            <li>Those of you that don&#x27;t have as many dark spots as I did will work wonders!</li>
            <li>I normally MIX this in my lotion and it helps even out my skintone and give a spark to my complexion...</li>
            <li>, as it&#x27;s very effective and has no undesired effects on the large majority of users, I think it worth sharing that it has worked on my African-American skin to remove dark spots left by past acne.  </li>
            <li>This is the honest to goodness truth that I am about to tell anyone interested: I used a Q-tip so that I could apply it only to the tiny dark spots on my face and not accidentally put it on any normal areas of my face.</li>
            <li>She is Filipina and has used a whitening cream before to smooth out dark spots the sun makes on her face.  </li>
            <li>I love gardening and thus have several black spots on my face, and hands and arms.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And so far, no skin peel, no rashes or any after effects.</li>
            <li>price was fairly reasonable but I imagine the only resolution will be a visit to a dermatologist to thoroughly remove these spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, this product did not irritate my sensitive areas at all.</li>
            <li>I therefore would advise anyone to test on a small section of their arm prior to use and wait a day to make sure there&#x27;s no rash or etc.</li>
            <li>My black spots are fading fast and my original skin color is coming back, not only that</li>
            <li>My under arms have not been like this since jr. high or younger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m re-ordering for my mother who has a similar problem with sunspots and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I believe that after a few more weeks of use, my private areas will finally match the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I am only reviewing this as I think the rating is unfairly low due to the extremely rare adverse reaction (admittedly of importance) by those allergic to the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I am of asian descent and this product seemed to have shown improvement in a short time without irritation to sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>Just a little amount, if massaged in thoroughly into the desired area will yield the right resuts overnight.</li>
            <li>some reason the rash only showed on my face not down there)</li>
            <li>He said it really does lighten the dark areas on his skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with dark spots around my face and particularly my neck since I was a kid.</li>

            <li> I therefore would advise anyone to test on a small section of their arm prior to use and wait a day to make sure there&#x27;s no rash or etc.</li>
            <li> My black spots are fading fast and my original skin color is coming back, not only that</li>
            <li> My under arms have not been like this since jr. high or younger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m re-ordering for my mother who has a similar problem with sunspots and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I believe that after a few more weeks of use, my private areas will finally match the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I am only reviewing this as I think the rating is unfairly low due to the extremely rare adverse reaction (admittedly of importance) by those allergic to the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I am of asian descent and this product seemed to have shown improvement in a short time without irritation to sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> Just a little amount, if massaged in thoroughly into the desired area will yield the right resuts overnight.</li>
            <li> some reason the rash only showed on my face not down there)</li>
            <li> He said it really does lighten the dark areas on his skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with dark spots around my face and particularly my neck since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Have not use it long enough to make a decision of whether  it will work or not.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne for years and this cream is the only one one keep my skin without dark spot I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> With no natural improvement I decided to browse for some bleaching creams and bought this one to give it a try.</li>
            <li> As long as it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> He uses it every single day after his shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple things to try to get to lighten the dark spots on my face from acne..</li>
            <li> Recommend this product for anyone who needs to lighten up dark spots, actually evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li> My face is much clearer and the dark spots, which was very bad, is barely visable, easily covered with make up which I could not do before.</li>
            <li> Just dab and rub a little on the spots you need and you will finally have that even skin tone!</li>
            <li> My skin is very thick in these areas, very unattractive and sometimes itchy.</li>
            <li> It did not lighten my skin overall (which I did NOT want) but just caused the dark spots to fade and the overall tone to be unbelievably even and look as if I had makeup on at all times.</li>
            <li> I was very careful in doing this.</li>
            <li> and, I thought, very carefully.</li>
            <li> Ladies and Gents, be very careful when putting things on your skin.</li>
            <li> Please guys, be very careful.</li>
            <li> recommendation - not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I would rather have the dark spots on my face that I could cover with makeup than areas of thickened skin that may not ever go away.</li>
            <li> It got rid of lots of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> She and I are both fair-skinned Caucasians who used to have lots of dark spots.</li>
            <li> Get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simply not worth</li>
            <li> Now I have red irrated thick skin,mixed in with the discoloration that I was trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I still have little bit of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> and I see my dark spots clearing!</li>
            <li> I see my skin brightening little by little</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to help my darkened area, and only made it worse.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do, wash thoroughly and use heavy sun block if you are using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots on my face are slowly disappearing.  </li>
            <li> guess it wasnt for me :/</li>
            <li> it broke me out in an angry red rash in 2 days.</li>
            <li> but I am doubtful that it will have much effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s false advertisement I have used this in the past and know the difference when it has hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> I ordered two items from them and this one never showed up and the other item had a broken seal and spilled in the mail!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with dark spots around my face and particularly my neck since I was a kid. I have sensitive skin and if I&#x27;m exposed to sunlight for 20 minutes my skin begins to bleed a bit. I&#x27;ve been exercising for almost a year, losing more than 40 lbs, I&#x27;ve learned somehow my weight sometimes are sources of my dark spots. With no natural improvement I decided to browse for some bleaching creams and bought this one to give it a try. It&#x27;s been one month applying this twice a day with clean skin and I see my dark spots clearing! I see my skin brightening little by little but it&#x27;s definitely working. I am now ordering another tube! And so far, no skin peel, no rashes or any after effects. However the cream does smell a bit funny after you use it for a while. As long as it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that really work for anyone!!</li>
            <li> This was nice as a moisturizer, but as far as fading spots, it didn&#x27;t do the job.  I am disappointed that I wasted my money and time.  My search for an effective fading cream continues.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m  sorry but an ingredient like hydroquinone should be disclosed before purchase. very disappointed. will toss.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied  with this product, I use it in the mornings and evenings.</li>
            <li> A lot of people tend to complain about this cream but it does work for me...I don&#x27;t rub the cream itself on my skin cos that could maybe cause irritation or might be too harsh,you never know so i don&#x27;t risk that. I normally MIX this in my lotion and it helps even out my skintone and give a spark to my complexion...mind you this does not happen OVERNIGHT. It takes a while, sadly I can&#x27;t upload a pic to prove this but my skin is back to normal and looks cool and me likey lots!</li>
            <li> I am of asian descent and this product seemed to have shown improvement in a short time without irritation to sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> Based on the promo information, I bought the product certainly hoping to lighten some sun spots on my fair skin.  The promo says it will lighten the spots with regular use in six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is six weeks later and I see no visible difference in the appearance of my sun/age spots.  I&#x27;ll keep using it but I am doubtful that it will have much effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was fairly reasonable but I imagine the only resolution will be a visit to a dermatologist to thoroughly remove these spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation - not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon and thought that it would be great for getting rid of dark marks that were on my cheeks, between my eyes on forehead, and on my chin from previous acne. I wish that I had never heard of this product. Did not realize that it had so much Hydroquinone (sp?) in it either. This is the honest to goodness truth that I am about to tell anyone interested: I used a Q-tip so that I could apply it only to the tiny dark spots on my face and not accidentally put it on any normal areas of my face. I was very careful in doing this. So after I applied it to about 5 areas of my face, tiny amounts, I went to bed. The next morning I had what looked like a red abrasion on my chin area. Thought maybe I had slept on my hand or something and figured it would go away later. No. The next day, I also had what looked like thickened skin on both cheeks and forehead as well. It has been almost a week now and they are still there. My skin is very thick in these areas, very unattractive and sometimes itchy. I did some research and it sounds very akin to a condition called Ochronosis (look it up) which is supposed to be very rare. I thought: how could this be when I only used this stuff once and, I thought, very carefully. In reading more about it, it may very well be treatable to a certain extent (costly--laser therapy, etc), but not curable.   I am a caramel colored (light brown) African-American female. Ladies and Gents, be very careful when putting things on your skin. Sometimes we focus a bit too much on something that is really very minor in the grand scheme of things, but hindsight is, as they say, 20/20. Please guys, be very careful. I would rather have the dark spots on my face that I could cover with makeup than areas of thickened skin that may not ever go away. I will def. report back at a later date after I see the dermatologist. Thanks, everyone, for reading my review.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream that work as well as a prescription cream.  My face is much clearer and the dark spots, which was very bad, is barely visable, easily covered with make up which I could not do before.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL AND SHOULD BE BANNED.    This product did nothing to help my darkened area, and only made it worse. Now I have red irrated thick skin,mixed in with the discoloration that I was trying to get rid of. I cant believe they sell this to people, this should be banned!!!And now that Im doing research I believe it has too much hydroquordine (sp?) over the recommended dose.       THANK FOR NOTHING!!!</li>
            <li> OMG is the best product I never had for dark spot, it really works been using this cream for about a year and just feel like I can&#x27;t live without it. I suffered from acne for years and this cream is the only one one keep my skin without dark spot I totally recommend it you will be impressed with the results.....</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  I was more impressed then not.  It got rid of lots of my dark spots.  Don&#x27;t spend lots of money on whitening cream.  Believe me I used and tried lots of different products.  I spend lots of money.  This works the best.  I believe it could be little bit better.  I still have little bit of dark spots.  Got rid of most.  BUY THIS!  My skin was pretty bad.  Those of you that don&#x27;t have as many dark spots as I did will work wonders!</li>
            <li> This cream really works its great I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND WILL DEFINETLY RETURN.I WILL SHARE&lt;br /&gt;WITH OTHERS MY HAPPY EXPERIENCE AND DIRECT OTHERS TO THIS SITE.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it actually worked.  My under arms have not been like this since jr. high or younger.  It&#x27;s an awesome thing to have, I have already bought 3 other tubes for back up</li>
            <li> Being a Physician, I don&#x27;t have time to go to Docotr&#x27;s for my own issues. I love gardening and thus have several black spots on my face, and hands and arms. I started using this cream, ( once in last 6 years i also tried retinoic acid oinment as chemical peeling)..I saw a dramatic difference...My black spots are fading fast and my original skin color is coming back, not only that, it glows ( healthy)..and is much cheaper than any cream , prescription or non prescription.  I have been using Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Prevag, serum , and ointment and was effecitve but not this good. This is outstanding product. I am also using St Ive&#x27;s collagen cream and its making my wrinkles disappear..skin is more moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> This product really has changed my life because I no longer need to wear heavy makeup to hide discoloration on my face. Since I started using it  have received numerous compliments on my beautiful skin, even one from a doctor who specializes in skin care! I apply the cream twice a day and would buy stock in the company if it was publicly traded. My pigmentation problems are gone. A friend of mine recommended this product to me. She and I are both fair-skinned Caucasians who used to have lots of dark spots. This is one of the best products I have ever used in my entire life and I would give it 1000-star review if I could!</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift for my dad.  He&#x27;s been using this cream for many many years and swears by it.  He uses it every single day after his shower.  He said it really does lighten the dark areas on his skin.  I will be purchasing some for myself to lighten up my elbow, knee and scar areas.  Seems to work like a charm according to dad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this does not work. The ingredients are very weak.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product</li>
            <li> i ordered this one time and when i used this i started getting hives....guess it wasnt for me :/</li>
            <li> Second order of this cream.  I use this cream every night before bed.  Dark spots on my face are slowly disappearing.  I did notice that when I stopped using the cream my skin darkened. Recommend using continuously to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my skin feel soft and leaves it smooth. I&#x27;ve passed it on to family members and they love it also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for five months now and have seen a dramatic differnce in my complexion and all my age spots have vanished. My wife who has some mollasma spots on her face used it as well and she loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy &amp; Use with confidence !!</li>
            <li> Do not ordered this product it states it contain hydroquinone but they removed it.  It&#x27;s false advertisement I have used this in the past and know the difference when it has hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> Ive been plagued with acne since my teens (I&#x27;m 21) I&#x27;ve tried multiple things to try to get to lighten the dark spots on my face from acne.. None have worked like this have! I can see the difference with using this and it is amazing. Just dab and rub a little on the spots you need and you will finally have that even skin tone!</li>
            <li> Used it twice a day and I seen results in about 2 weeks. Good stuff, the only fading cream that seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> Have not use it long enough to make a decision of whether  it will work or not. Ask me again later.</li>
            <li> There are lots of side effects</li>
            <li> It work, but i stop using it gave me rash</li>
            <li> Happy and great wonderful  and best thanks to your for everything I love if so much  I am happy to see it was on time</li>
            <li> wow this is amazing really works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> Fade cream for scars works well</li>
            <li> I have been use fair &amp;white for 2months I can see a different in my complexion I love it  my face look more brighter I give this suff a 10 it really work grate I&#x27;m a darkskin women my face is not even I manily work on the dark spot in my face now I have a beautiful complexion people tell me all the time I have a pretty complexion I have went to doctors about my face the stuff what I was use from my doctor some of the same stuff is in this cream I goog it to see before I order it I&#x27;m  one happy person save a lot of money what I was paying one thing is once u stop use it I see you complexion will get a liller darker so it best to keep use a small amount of it you be fine</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten my vagina and anus. I&#x27;ve been using for 1 week and those areas have already become 1-2 shades lighter. I believe that after a few more weeks of use, my private areas will finally match the rest of my body. I recommend this product over Dr. Pinks (which did nothing for me at all).  Yes this product does contain a potentially harmful chemical, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m just glad I found something that works, and was not a waste of money. Also, this product did not irritate my sensitive areas at all.</li>
            <li> I love this producet only reason I gave it a 4 star was because it gave me a red rash on my face but I use it for my hoo haa and it has lightened up 2 shades in just 3 days(for some reason the rash only showed on my face not down there)</li>
            <li> Amazing results within two weeks. Used along with SPF 100 by neutragena . 4 stars for the smell makes me feel nausea.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any positive result.</li>
            <li> Not effect to me and I don&#x27;t know why.. But in any case thanks..</li>
            <li> finished it &amp; didn&#x27;t work at all ........</li>
            <li> This product is swift on results !!</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Recommend this product for anyone who needs to lighten up dark spots, actually evens out skin tone.  Very pleased with this product, this is the second time I have ordered. For me this product worked better than 100.00 products I have purchased.... Thank You.</li>
            <li> I like it because its not a jel or flaky cream its the texture of Vaseline</li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to order this product for her.  She is Filipina and has used a whitening cream before to smooth out dark spots the sun makes on her face.  She found this product to work very well and will order again when needed.  Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I read the reviews and tried a free sample and the product does exactly what it says it does. Get rid of dark spots. Great product for price. It has helped my darkd spots tremedously.</li>
            <li> I purchased the products for a fairly decent price. The stores are selling the exact product for $3 more. Received shipment on-time.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I saw results quickly! I have tried others and I don&#x27;t that they work as well as this one. Although, I would NOT order it from the company BYPLE!! I ordered two items from them and this one never showed up and the other item had a broken seal and spilled in the mail!! They would not return my e-mails either!</li>
            <li> This is strong, so be careful in how much and where you use it. Just a little amount, if massaged in thoroughly into the desired area will yield the right resuts overnight. Whatever you do, wash thoroughly and use heavy sun block if you are using this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product to even your complexion. Visible results within weeks.</li>
            <li> Products is working already within a week. I mixed this product with the cream from fair white and put it directly on my darkspots with a week I could see the difference</li>
            <li> This product contains \\&quot;Hydroquinone-1.9&amp;\\&quot; which is strongly advised by doctors to avoid when deciding on a skin bleaching cream. Hydroquinone is extremely dangerous and may lead to the development of cancer. It has already been banned in several countries. Dermatologist have recommended that we use products which include the safer lightening agent: \\&quot;Alpha Arbutin\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been said that \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot; contains: mutagenic, clastogenic, and immunotoxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply not worth the health risks just to have a lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my wife. And since she received it, she has been satisfied with it and has been showering it with praises. I think we are getting our money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
            <li> BEST Whitening cream ever for face and those parts as well.. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My wife uses this mixed with a similar product to maintain her beautiful skin. She loves it so that makes me happy. She&#x27;s in her fifth decade but looks fifteen years younger. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are nothing bit the best to lighten skin. Kojic acid mulberry root extract, licorice and best but not last retinyl palmitate. I cant lie I am veryyyyyy happpppy very quickkk resultsss. Thank the Lord!!!</li>
            <li> I can not tell you if this works or not, I used it a few times but could not get pass the horrible smell of it. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works bc it broke me out in an angry red rash in 2 days. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great seller. Fair and white gel creme works on fading spots as for pigmented skin I would more recomend the fair and white serum and glycerin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fair and white cream for relatives in other country, they like it, they said they used it every day at night for dark spots in the skin and worked good.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to lighten my armpits and in one week they were about 2 shades lighter..</li>
            <li> I am only reviewing this as I think the rating is unfairly low due to the extremely rare adverse reaction (admittedly of importance) by those allergic to the main ingredient.  I therefore would advise anyone to test on a small section of their arm prior to use and wait a day to make sure there&#x27;s no rash or etc. that develops.  But I didn&#x27;t want someone to pass up trying this low priced, amazing product due to an improbable reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as it&#x27;s very effective and has no undesired effects on the large majority of users, I think it worth sharing that it has worked on my African-American skin to remove dark spots left by past acne.  At the start of use, I had many, many dark blotches and spots now, a full 3 months later, my skin is COMPLETELY clear.  I look like a skin care model and get compliments all the time!  It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle but with continuous use you will see increasingly satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m re-ordering for my mother who has a similar problem with sunspots and I highly recommend this product. It did not lighten my skin overall (which I did NOT want) but just caused the dark spots to fade and the overall tone to be unbelievably even and look as if I had makeup on at all times.</li>
            <li> I like it it does what it promote and thats perfect by me, I don&#x27;t know if this is for everyone but i know is good for me.</li>
