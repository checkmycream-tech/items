            <li>This is the best beard balm so far that I have used.</li>
            <li>Beard balm smells good and makes the beard feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft and manageable, plus it smells great!</li>

            <li>My beard came in much better, and the problem hairs that would stand up before fell nicely in line with the rest.</li>
            <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and it seems to calm the itch and discomfort greatly.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>your beard does it too, and this helps keep it manageable, soft, and awesome.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells like an honest days&#x27; work, which is sort of satisfying and manly, but not how I want to smell all the time.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm leaves you with a nice glistening beard and ever since I started using Beard Balm my beard has become more manageable and has the appearance of being fuller.</li>

            <li>I love Beard Balm, it does an excellent job conditioning my beard and giving me some control in taming some of my wild hairs.</li>
            <li>This product is &#x27;Honest&#x27;ly vastly superior to any of its competitors that it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with it, though, and after about a week of use I can honestly say I&#x27;ll be ordering another tin when this one starts to run low.</li>
            <li>Great product, simple to use and great on the look.</li>
            <li>main issue with the stuff is that it&#x27;s incredibly greasy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is real nice, very manly and girls love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves the beard looking more full, better shaped, better looking and smelling great</li>
            <li>Otherwise the stuff is amazing and very amusing if you bother to read the instructions (which we were gloriously not deprived of thanks to my feminine intuition and the fact that I just like to read).</li>
            <li>Just use a fingernail amount and rub gently between your palm followed by massaging into your beautiful mane.</li>
            <li>Great product, has a &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; smell at first</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that this stuff does a great job of softening and conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li>A great product that does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>If you have a beard &amp; are interested in keeping it looking &amp; smelling great</li>
            <li>Great product that does exactly what it promises with no bs.</li>
            <li>This is my first time growing a beard, and I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>but surprisingly my wife has asked me to let it grow in full again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a baby face and it took a good amount of time to get the full growth in.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Good product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell by any means, and I find it to be kind of nice, but it&#x27;s by no means scented like some sort of hair product or aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, easy to use balm.  </li>

            <li>and I have to say that most of the glory and compliments should be directed to Beard Balm.  </li>

            <li>Simple but perfect for my needs.</li>

            <li>give me more control over my beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, now does it?</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I will be continuing to use it daily, and the scent is alotta awesome.</li>
            <li>I can already tell, however, that this balm is going to work better.</li>
            <li>my beard feels better, looks better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and has really softened my beard.</li>
            <li>now i love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this before I got a tin of beard balm my beard would grow but after a month or so would just get tangled knotted</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This just worked ok for my husband.</li>
            <li>It might have worked better if we used it longer.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Balm is OK.</li>
            <li>One of the better beard products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Still my favorite after trying others</li>
            <li>BTW, I just reordered some more.  </li>
            <li>The lid was able to stay on and even if the package got to 100 degrees, I feel the content would have remained inside the can and not all over the box, and me.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off putting olive oil in your beard than this s</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I recommend to all who wish to grow a healthy beard</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but here&#x27;s what</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so plush and more manageable than ever before.</li>
            <li>It turns out it was more than just a gag gift.  </li>
            <li>Ehh, I never tried anything like this before and it turned out to just be something that smells ok and makes my beard bushy.</li>
            <li>My son had the most out of control beard.</li>
            <li>Once he started using the beard balm brush his beard was healthier looking, fuller, and even the parts of his beard that grew in all different directions looked perfect after 3 weeks using just this Beard Balm and  boars</li>
            <li>Anyone wanting to grow a healthy beard should use this.</li>
            <li>The smell was okay</li>
            <li>Feels more like a coating than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>One of the best personal grooming products I have purchased in some time.</li>
            <li>I love this company, I wish these fellas were in my group of friends</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>After I used it for about two weeks my beard was noticeably more heathy and manageable, I turned two of my buddies to beard balm as well</li>
            <li>so it makes more sense for me to apply Beard Balm after work.</li>
            <li>The detritus in your now-glowing beard will mostly be sticking to your comb rather than your face.</li>
            <li>i love it......</li>
            <li>I landed a date tonight, you better believe Beard Balm played a part in that.</li>
            <li>Here is why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my beard feel</li>
            <li>It gives my beard a more fuller and shinier looked.</li>
            <li>Made my beard feel so much better:</li>
            <li>fuller, cleaner, all around better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to love it now, but it does take time.</li>
            <li>It makes his beard softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Husband Love this Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll kill the itch and the flakes and have a softer, more manageable beard.</li>
            <li>It was great, bit of a learning curve for how much should be used on your beard.</li>
            <li>I started getting more attention from ladies as well.</li>
            <li>I love how the product doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell to it.</li>
            <li>Ok, the smell...</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>What more do you need</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love love this stuff</li>
            <li>The scent takes a bit of getting used to, but seems OK now, a bit outdoorsy may be one way to describe it.</li>
            <li>It works so much better when applied to a moist beard.</li>
            <li>I also love this for travel because it is easier to transport than oil.</li>
            <li>My beard looks healthy and shiny, not over done though...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this balm, and it has helped my beard feel softer and thicker.</li>

            <li>I love the scent of this beard balm.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and that it is made in america.</li>
            <li>Smells good and keeps my beard smooth and manageable and my skin free of dandruff.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have and hold for my mustache, but I guess this is meant to be more of a conditioner than a beard holder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li>but to help the hairy guys maintain a healthy style.</li>
            <li>Also love the bees&amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Depending on your beard, you may need to apply it more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m very happy and on my second tin.</li>
            <li>Love the smell on my husband&#x27;s beard.  </li>
            <li>though there is another I like better).  </li>
            <li>It has brought my beard to its best potential no doubt.</li>
            <li>He gets so many compliments and gets asked what he uses all the time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a gag gift for my best whose beard is approaching wizard status.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay balm.</li>
            <li>I have to say, i&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>, I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I decided to give them a try, even after reading reviews of many complaints regarding the not-so-nice smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the beards that need that extra bit of control.</li>

            <li>This will help you beard better than you have ever bearded before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard</li>
            <li>My beard and I truly enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>My beard had a patchy area and this helps it grow, one of my favorite beard products, will continue to use for a while.</li>
            <li>My hubby and I are in LOVE with this Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that this is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any sort of beard products before, so I have nothing to compare this product to, but after a couple months of using it I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my beard.</li>

            <li>I like how it controls the hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love it as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The gel itself is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t feel gross when I apply it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and really aids in the health of my beard.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But when I buy more it will be Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be patient this isn&#x27;t magic it doesn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, I like how plyable it is.</li>

            <li>My beard is much more well-behaved</li>
            <li>I found I was losing more hairs when I would brush while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using Beard Balm, my life has undoubtedly improved for the better.</li>
            <li>Love the balm.</li>
            <li>Pleasant aroma and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li>I use pine tar soap, I use oil conditioner, I serenade it with love songs, I bathe in milk and honey, but nothing softens it like Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>Plus, as a Michigan native, I love that it&#x27;s made in Detroit.</li>
            <li>My wife also approves :)</li>
            <li>if you buy a can, be sure to follow their Instagram.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hilarious</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my whiskers feel.  </li>
            <li>His beard looks fantastic!</li>

            <li>beard seems to be fuller and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the way my husband&#x27;s beard feels and smells age using this consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Should get more for the price.</li>
            <li>Be sure you get a boar bristle brush to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, been using it for about five months now and its really done a great job at giving my beard a healthy sheen and giving just enough hold to help get my moustache out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>basically does a great job and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Love it, smells great, leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 days, and I&#x27;ve made many attempts at opening it, but still I&#x27;m unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>Hair conditioner works better for softening your beard up.</li>
            <li>This was worth it though because it smells so good and does keep the hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li>You just might like it :)</li>
            <li>I love it and will be purchasing again.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Have you ever wondered how you can smell more like your mechanic?</li>
            <li>So, if you want your beard to be sniffed and scruffed by potential lovers, this may not be the perfect balm for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used much better beard conditioners.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and so does my wife...</li>
            <li>Nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Would buy again to cultivate my face with manliness once more.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>and I really think this balm is great.</li>
            <li>The balm is ok -</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>but the smell is better than most.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over most beard balms</li>
            <li>My beard is now more manly than ever.</li>
            <li>This would be my top pick for a beard balm.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the flyaways are under control now (somewhat).  </li>
            <li>Much more than I did without it in.</li>
            <li>When this happens, I just make sure to wipe this out.</li>
            <li>I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and the shine it gives my beard.</li>
            <li>Geranium smell is interesting.  </li>
            <li>Love that it comes from</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Better then beard oil.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Looks like the top fell off during delivery.</li>
            <li>Check them out for sure.  </li>
            <li>It makes my beard look healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it, thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>For a bit, I procrastinated about getting the right tools together to make sure I kept it in good shape.</li>
            <li>Great scent, easy to apply and works really well!</li>
            <li>Good, workable texture that works right in to my beard.  </li>
            <li>Good product, just not quite right for my needs.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased and was hoping it would have a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>You now have an awesome looking beard and a clean comb, soft hands and a spring in your step.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this perfect for anybody with a nice full beard.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and smells good too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves a nice shine to my beard and makes it look and feel very healthy.</li>
            <li>The best time to apply in my opinion is fresh out of the shower at giving the beard a good towel dry.</li>
            <li>I teach in a high school and compete with the kids each year for &amp;#34;No Shave November.&amp;#34; I am usually happy to shave on Dec. 1st.</li>
            <li>surprisingly enough it was very pleasant.</li>
            <li>but now I am a believer with a full nicely groomed beard.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>My beard is becoming softer and more groomed looking.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you are a rebel of the razor, I highly recommend checking out this awesome, straight outta Detroit, beard balm!  </li>
            <li>Works great for the guy or bearded lady who is fairly new to having a beard.  </li>
            <li>Application and use is an easy and enjoyable experience that I look forward to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, healthy looking and it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as wax, but I didn&#x27;t want that much anyway, so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Smells great, very masculine yet not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The Original Scent Beard Balm has a refreshing aroma - there&#x27;s a very light eucalyptus aroma that disappears almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, but make sure to pick up a brush as well!</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, not too strong but still present, and a nice feel after being applied.</li>
            <li>Great smell, but it literally does nothing for your beard other than smell good.</li>
            <li>After some convincing he finally tried it out and loved it!</li>
            <li>I have since trimmed it (happens so often) and the resulting new beard is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a 6-foot-4, 220 pound barrel chested love machine with a bank full of gold bars, more friends than the captain of the football team in an 80&#x27;s movie, I date not one, but two supermodels</li>
            <li>Showed up a couple days early, great stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my beard soft</li>
            <li>love how smooth and silky it makes beard feel.</li>
            <li>Even my girlfriend said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re becoming the mountain man</li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive skin like my husband, this product is great for you.  </li>
            <li>Beard feels soft, also takes care of fly aways.</li>
            <li>As it came the day before Christmas, I was creative and found another lid that would fit it.</li>
            <li>Its important to me that my beard make good first impressions and not look unkempt.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many beard balms/glosses and have found that along with Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard gloss this is a fantastic balm.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard feeing soft and looking great.</li>
            <li>It smells great once you get used to it, and it always makes my beard looking lush after a shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li>This is nice stuff – and comes from the Motor City, which is fun.</li>
            <li>I would consider using it on your beard if you would to have a nice smile.</li>
            <li>It creates a good shine and really does soften your beard.</li>
            <li>Beard always looks good and is much softer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, any kind of conditioner is subjective but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product and say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good and does add a bit of sheen to your beard, but doesnt soften it up much.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many balms and oils on my beard and this product is hands down the best!  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering just right!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, plus leaves my beard feeling soft and smelling great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>For my first time growing a beard (beyond 5:00 shadow) I knew I needed a good product to maintain my beard and keep a clean look.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this balm, the smell is very pleasant and the application is short while leaving your beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>He uses it every other day or so on his beard and it tames it beautifully!  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm (this exact product) for over two years now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>Easy to use as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a non-greasy beard balm that melts easily at your touch, somewhere between the consistency of butter and vegetable shortening.</li>
            <li>It keeps the beard hydrated/shining and makes combing and brushing really easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it does control the beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to carry around when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Though the delivery was very quick, it didn&#x27;t come with directions.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to work with, and it makes you feel manly.  </li>
            <li>It likes to curl and tangle and isn&#x27;t easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product :) and really works.</li>
            <li>Getting the product into your beard is easy...</li>
            <li>The balm itself easily melts in your palms, so you can apply it to your beard.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard shiny and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend loves it keeps things easy outta the shower.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and made my beard hair softer and healthier appearing.</li>
            <li>If your beard is of a more substantial length, stick with oils which are more readily absorbed and beneficial to your hair.</li>
            <li>so the smell doesn&#x27;t get that strong.</li>
            <li>lot of people seem to complain about the aroma, but neither my girlfriend nor I find it offensive or strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, though, and you do smell it all day.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell, but oils my beard nicely so i can live with it.</li>
            <li>The product is highly recommended smells so good</li>
            <li>With a pair of trimming scissors and mild application of this wondrous concoction, I was transformed from &#x27;the noble savage&#x27; into true nobility.  </li>
            <li>I bought Beard Balm at the advice of a friend who uses it, and I have been very satisfied with how much easier it is to keep my beard in check.</li>
            <li>and at first I was worried about the finer details of beard care with this kind of product.</li>
            <li>To each their own, but I believe balm like this is far better than oil in that the balm allows you to work in and distribute the product more evenly.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice beard balm.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty effectively to soften up my whiskers but within an hour it seemed like it had disappeared</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any kind of beard conditioner</li>
            <li>This one feels and stays on your hair and skin like baseline&lt;br /&gt;Smell is okay not bad, but I&#x27;ll wait</li>
            <li>Hands down the best Amazon purchase ever from An Amazon addict.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and this is hands down the best balm for your beard.  </li>

            <li>I apply the balm every morning, and comb it through with a fine toothed comb.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for my guy&#x27;s beard, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell of it.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not too light or too strong.</li>

            <li>Comb with Kent beard comb (available on Amazon)</li>
            <li>But overall I think it is a great product.</li>

            <li>Greasy and basically a cheap hand salve.</li>

            <li>At first my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent but has started to really dig it after about a week.</li>
            <li>It smells great and you&#x27;re supporting a local (to me) /</li>
            <li>So far its amazing.</li>
            <li>The beard-envy is clearly evident, as the clean-shaven colleagues of the office stroke their naked baby&#x27;s-bottom jaws wishing they had the ability to summon the great wisdom of the burl.</li>
            <li>and I still have a good amount left, so you get a lot of value and longevity per tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good and my beard is starting to feel softer.</li>
            <li>I Loved the product, I needed it for no shave November last month, and along with genetics Beard Balm was a wondering aid.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like a foot or a flower - just a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li>I love the honey smell and how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li>I woke up, took a shower, washed my beard and thought in this sweet, sweeeeet balm.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel soft and have a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My beard is nice and soft and the skin under the hair is no longer flakey.</li>
            <li>but once I figured out how much to put in it looked a lot better.</li>
            <li>Instead it looks full of life, shiny, and</li>
            <li>Overall a good beard product.</li>
            <li>Remember your beard is a lighthouse to lost, beardless souls, seeking true manhood.  </li>
            <li>My girl also loves the smell, super clean.</li>
            <li>It makes his beard soft and smell really nice.  </li>
            <li>thanks mostly to Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>but this was a good starting point for me.</li>
            <li>Good solid scent (</li>
            <li>My beard feels good and it actually makes it feel fuller.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from all my friends and family about how nice it looks and how it shines in the sun, how soft it feels.</li>
            <li>I grow my beard out in the winter to full and cant wait to see how it helps things along this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some reviews say it goes away after 20 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that I would likely buy again, but I will also try others to compare it with.</li>
            <li>My lady likes it, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Because now my beards nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but they both seem have about the same consumption rate, so I would say they are on par price wise.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of not shaving and using Beard Balm my beard finally grew into a good shadow with out any patches.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm has made my beard much smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It has a different smell, but thats good.</li>
            <li>good overall quality though and</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it is make in Detroit USA and is all natural.</li>
            <li>this is much easier and works better.)</li>
            <li>Product overall is good.</li>
            <li>Overall it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>but then it really grew on me and now I love it.  </li>
            <li>It stopped my beard dandruff and made my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It kept my mustache nice and soft and I&#x27;d reapply it mid-day.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is also good with an immediate follow-up and definitely personalized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a mild, fresh scent and helps my hands tremendously!</li>
            <li>Not bad, but throughout the day you might catch it and wonder what it is you&#x27;re smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s nothing you&#x27;d ever want put into a spray bottle to use before...</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not bad) and fades within a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not bad</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not obtrusive, it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>my face-jacket has grown significantly more burly; it looks and smells extraordinary thanks to our pals at Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>The scent, while being strong and slightly different than what I&#x27;m accustomed to, is really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but this is the best so far!!</li>
            <li>By the tits, I mean it is wonderful to massage into your beard.</li>
            <li>The smell is super manly and made me feel like a true lumbersexual.</li>
            <li>At first the smell was somewhat strong, but I got used to it already.</li>
            <li>At first, the smell of Beard Balm was strong to me, and I found myself getting irritated by the smell.</li>
            <li>Clean and crisp scent -- heavier on the lemon, and then a light note of geranium</li>
            <li>BUT I do want my beard to be healthy, soft, and well taken care of because it&#x27;s a fine line between robust mountain man beard and hobo who sleeps in a rail yard and heats up a can of beans over a barrel fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and awesome.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly after i purchase it</li>
            <li>and I started dating super models.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>I suggest you apply it while your whiskers are still mildly damp.  </li>
            <li>if you dont care about the smell (keep in mind the aroma of all 3 products goes away rather quickly once applied)</li>
            <li>Love it too because it&#x27;s one of the few things I order here in Atlanta that is from my beloved Detroit home.</li>
            <li>Since switching to this product I&#x27;ve been able to better shape and control my beard while at the same time conditioning it.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super quick shipping....</li>
            <li>The person sitting next to me asked if she could touch my beard, then more and more.</li>
            <li>dose build up quickly.</li>
            <li>As someone with a curly beard, I was struggling with the dreaded beard dandruff and the super itchiness that goes along with that.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be mainly, but it makes you smell like you made love to a skunk in pine tree.  </li>
            <li>And his beard looks even more sexy, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>customer service is top notch and even includes a personal note with your order :)</li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor and it reminds me of a old musty building.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this balm to anyone who needs just a smudge more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; than a oil can do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li>: I keep my hair long and he doesn&#x27;t go clean shaven), he doesn&#x27;t always have time for proper grooming and mainenance, so his normally awesome beard can take on</li>
            <li>I have been using Beard Balm for several months, and have been very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>On the drive there multiple hunnies (women), honked there horns and started getting very pleased whenever they saw my beard.</li>
            <li>I normally use beard oils and this was what I needed to help give me better control and some hold to keep the beard looking spot on all day.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products and by far this is the best thing.</li>
            <li>The packaging (tin) is nice, the smell is fragrant but not overpowering, and I think it does a better job of conditioning the hair and skin underneath my beard than other products.</li>
            <li>and if you have a long bread it takes a fair amount per application.</li>
            <li>The price is good for how long the product lasts.</li>
            <li>The scent is a sophisticated aroma with a natural cleanly man smell.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and would recommend both this product and the seller, really fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Really love this new Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my brother (one day I&#x27;ll be able to grow a full, epic beard) and he loves it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good on the beard as well as on dry hands.</li>
            <li>But very quickly I started to really like the smell.</li>
            <li>First time using a beard balm!</li>
            <li>This product added control to his beard (to reduce those fluffy/frizzy tufts that look unruly), as well as left his beard looking healthy, shiny, and softer (but still manly!).</li>
            <li>, I am going to assume is original flavor), so I&#x27;d advise buying just one at first to see if that&#x27;s a deal breaker for you.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it!</li>
            <li>Run it through with a small comb or brush and you are good to go!</li>
            <li>If you have coarse or unruly man beard issues, this stuff will help make it much more manageable!</li>
            <li>The only entity that loves this stuff more than I do is my beard!</li>
            <li>It makes my beard soft and smooth and easy to manage.    </li>
            <li>The scent is gentle and pleasant and I&#x27;ve had no complaints from anyone who has gotten close enough to get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the mild scent, and the just right amount of shine it gives the beard.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your quick delivery!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really detect any aroma, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>the only one worth using on my beard, keeps it soft, and smooth, with a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li>I tried the Honest Amish brand, but it was too hard and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
            <li>I used to have dry skin underneath the beard but this has help to moistureize and make my beard soft and smell good!</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients used in this product, but nonetheless I love that it keeps my beard far from itching, somewhat shiny, and overtime straightens the hair.</li>
            <li>Fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, been using this for a few months now (about 3-4 times a week).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this balm for my fiancés amazing beard.</li>
            <li>The product has a light scent that isn&#x27;t really that noticable after application.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t overstate this point enough, the smell is amazing), all without appearing greasy.</li>
            <li>, I use it just about everyday and my beard looks great with a softness from &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This balm isn&#x27;t heavy at all, and works as a great conditioner after the thorough washes I&#x27;ve given it.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep the hairs straight and makes my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The beard Balm and Honest Amish are similar in how they make your beard feel but Beard Balm excels in smell.  </li>
            <li>and it is soon absorbed (no greasy look or feel).</li>
            <li>I was prompted to write this review by the promise of another tin, but the above is an honest opinion</li>
            <li>My beard feels softer since using the product, but more importantly I have noticed a big difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, Beard Balm Natural Leave In Conditioner may be more valuable than water, air or Mike Trout in your fantasy baseball league.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Being a deodorant and minimal grooming kind of guy, I was looking for something that would make me look presentable and smell good at the same time.</li>
            <li>love the smell and does the job quite well keeping mustache soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a masculine scent for sure just not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I can style it with some success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He loves how soft and healthy his beard is now</li>
            <li>It makes it manageable and  so far I&#x27;m glad I chose it over others.</li>
            <li>, Has a nice luster that seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>Bring in Beard Balm, just a finger tips amount combed through a damp freshly washed beard and PRESTO</li>
            <li>It makes my beard shiny and soft and I get many compliments on the condition of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife appreciates how soft it makes my beard, she told me she doesn&#x27;t feel like she is kissing a wire brush any more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because a scent would be nice.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm is a great, all natural product that makes my usually wild goatee soft and civilized.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it makes my beard soft</li>
            <li>I tried Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm, which smells like a spicy gum drop in the beginning, but it kept leaving a hint of a fruity scent later on - leaving me to look for rotten fruit somewhere in the vicinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars</li>
            <li>and I honestly couldn&#x27;t imagine starting my day without it!</li>
            <li>Just a couple of nice people trying to market an idea that I personally think is under-utilized.</li>
            <li>After using this balm, I can&#x27;t foresee myself ever going back to oils of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s made with natural oils and bees wax, it leaves my beard healthy and the skin under it well moisturized</li>
            <li>Women love a soft beard.</li>
            <li>Not awkwardly sticky like hair gel products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest going with The Fresh Man beard oils over this stuff.</li>
            <li>WOW,  My beard is soft, it glistens, and looks really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice to have the product in a container where you could actually get into trying the  product.  </li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted $16 on this because now I&#x27;m going to throw it away and order some more Honest Amish beard balm.</li>
            <li>As far as the fragrance: the Lanolin odor is prominent (oily/waxy smell).  </li>
            <li>Secondly, this balm does a nice job softening up the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>It makes my beard nice and soft and helps keep the hairs straight.  </li>
            <li>... makes your face smile.  </li>
            <li>If I go bald on my cheeks and chin, I will (reluctantly) purchase another popular hair-growing product to bring the hair back</li>
            <li>; that is soft as a gentle breeze on a warm summer day.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, left my beard soft, shiny, and comfortable........</li>
            <li>Keeps it soft and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Also it has a bonus, after using all the balm, you have a pretty cool tin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many oils and balms and this is by far my go to choice.</li>
            <li>It definitely seems to make my beard more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>This balm seems to have really moisturized my skin like no other product of this nature has been able to do for me!</li>
            <li>I got this product and another Amish type one (not naming any names) at the same time, well my can of Beard Balm is almost gone, time to get some more and the other one got given away, it was nowhere as good as Beard Balm which makes my beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I will use other products in conjunction with this one on weekends when I&#x27;m looking for more hold and a more aggressive look.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other beard conditioners/balms and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>It goes away pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>Best bearld balm out, holds my scraggly hairs down and keeps them straight,its smells good, very soft.can&#x27;t wait for my second batch, instant buy!!!</li>
            <li>Some say its over powering or too much, personally I find it to be refreshing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>but the other two IMO smell good.</li>
            <li>Conditions moistens and gives a nice flat shine after it sets in.</li>
            <li>The smell was pretty strong and a bit gross when I first got it, but after a week or so the scent has dissipated and it&#x27;s much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this if you are trying to keep it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Once you rub a bit together in your hands you will see how the balm softens right up.</li>
            <li>order this right now, maybe get 3.</li>
            <li>In fact she sniffed it right out of the can and said &amp;#34;ok...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;beard\\&quot; right on the front.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>This Beard Balm is not greasy, not oily, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were all right.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was right</li>
            <li>The scent of the balm is good, too, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it, but now I find it to be a rather masculine, natural scent, fragrant, but not overwhelming or chemical-smelling.</li>
            <li>: I rub it in morning and night and my beard is juuuuussssst right.</li>
            <li>This stuff right here needs to be in every beard sporting mans shelf.</li>
            <li>Beard balm is the right product to compliment this freedom beard, and it&#x27;s made in the USA</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IMO if you are getting this for itchy beard, stop right there.</li>
            <li>This product pretty much lived up to what it said it was, far as making your beard easy to comb, nice scent &amp; shine also the reduce of hair shedding,  but far as beard growth!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;All natural, easy to use, essential for the modern man.&lt;br /&gt;Our popular original scent - a blend of lemon peel, eucalyptus leaf, and geranium flower</li>
            <li>i first used it on my 3 month old growth, it took a bit more than what I use now to get it conditioned.  </li>
            <li>At first the balm seems like it might leave your beard greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t at all - just leaves you with a soft and healthy looking beard.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this back in April, along with a tin of Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soft blend, it melts easily as soon as your fingers touch it.  </li>
            <li>The consistency seems perfect, it is soft enough to apply with ease, but not so soft that too much comes off at once, and it is not grainy or</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to soften and smooth your beard I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>It also gave my beard a nice sheen and is slightly moldable, almost like a light hair gel.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, very natural, and keeps his beard soft and tamed.  </li>
            <li>and it will most definitely approve the appearance and feel if you&#x27;re not using any kind of leave in conditioner currently.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells unbelievable.</li>
            <li>To make beard even better, after a few minutes brush with Diane&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Palm Brush (100% boar hair – also available from Amazon for nice low price) for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps my ample beard looking nice through a long day at the office as well.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that stated that the smell was a little overpowering, but I found it pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, makes my beard a little shiny.</li>
            <li>I also live in a fairly arid region, and this stuff helps to keep my beard from becoming dried out.  </li>
            <li>(an interesting but undefinable odour which does not linger too long), and is easy to apply – just rub a couple of fingers around the tin, transfer to beard and rub in, continue until whole beard is done.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is a little oldschool and while I do like it, it&#x27;s not the most appealing.  </li>
            <li>I have used just about everything on the market in my beard and enjoy trying new things....</li>
            <li>i use this Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm daily to hope to get the nice thick and strong beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>Left my beard shimmering, smelling wonderful, and got quite a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Straight out of Detroit; this product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is mainly good at keeping your beard soft, I personally use it in combination with jojoba oil</li>
            <li>The balm (you shouldn&#x27;t need much) smooths into his beard rather quickly without leaving any clumps or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Through sheer force of will I was able to grow a virile manscape the likes of which this world has rarely seen before.  </li>
            <li>Great product, solid performance essential for any beard growing gent!!</li>
            <li>This beard balm helps tremendously with making those thorny whiskers much softer.</li>
            <li>Lanolin is actually very beneficial for the skin, but carries with it a mild sheepy smell.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li>shipping was quick and fast..</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It does have a similar odor to popular diaper cream so the smell leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant eucalyptus aroma that goes away after a few minutes after you put it in.</li>
            <li>Works very well to give your beard a nice soft smooth feel, smells great, and helps to keep any stray whiskers laying flat and your whole beard looking sharp!  </li>
            <li>Expected more!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this (plus a boar&#x27;s hair brush) is a great purchase for guys interested in keeping and properly maintaining a beard.</li>
            <li>This is the scent a woman wants to smell because it makes her feel like you just got back from wrestling a full grown grizzly bear out in Canada in your favorite plaid shirt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell but it fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li>The fragrance takes some getting used to, but we both agree that his beard looks more lush and the hairs are smoothed down nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put very much on</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and has a nice but subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the past year trying to tame my beard - this is the best!</li>
            <li>The smell was strange the first time I used it, but just suck it up and enjoy your new awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have found it best to slip the teeth of my comb over the rim of the can and scrape out a little bit of Balm, then combing it into the hairs.</li>
            <li>Smell is very strong and stay for long time.</li>
            <li>Apply the balm immediately after showering and drying your beard, a little damp is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Use a little beard brush and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>My beard looks full, a little bit shiny, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It helps tame your beard, also making it soft and the smell is good!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I keep it really short.</li>
            <li>Lotion, while nice, just isn&#x27;t enough to keep my hands normally hydrated, never mind soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Plus, it helps fight beard itch and beard dandruff - two thing that you most definitely do not need in your life!</li>
            <li>I tried this for like the first week</li>
            <li>I use it daily and my beard looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Beard wax is the only hair product I use and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I had no friends.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely LOVES this balm!  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and is always consistent.</li>
            <li>First review,and it is well deserved.</li>
            <li>exactly what you</li>
            <li>using my first tin of this, i am now dependent on it.</li>
            <li>it even brings out the red in it a bit more.</li>
            <li>This specific product gives me beard moisture and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Used it first thing this morning and could immediately feel a difference in the softness of it.</li>
            <li>Would rate higher if I could.</li>
            <li>First Beard Balm I&#x27;ve ever bought/owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through my first tin of this stuff.</li>
            <li>He likes it too ;)  </li>
            <li>and this was the first product I tried.  </li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this balm now for 2 months, the smell was \\&quot;off putting\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li>His beard is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This was the first beard balm/oil that I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.</li>
            <li>First time buying something to put on my beard.</li>
            <li>I started using it just to see if it&#x27;d actually do anything notable.</li>
            <li>After the first application I could feel and see the difference-</li>
            <li>I think I put too much in on my first use</li>
            <li>Just recently started growing a beard again after many attempts.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>but I bought this as a birthday gift and they love this product; especially the way it smells.</li>
            <li>First off, the product description made me giggle.</li>
            <li>I first tried to scrape some out with a fingertip and wipe it on, but that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I first bought this product to soften the beard, I was using it with stubble basically(not</li>
            <li>At first I was sceptic to buy this product from all the reviews.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because the can is pretty small; although one could argue a good product is worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I had to youtube the directions on applying (my first beard).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure an essential oil could be added to help alleviate the grandma-odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So instead of shaving or changing my wardrobe I tried this, and on the first day of use I had zero flakes.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a beard balm but decided to go with this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>First application and my beard was gleaming, felt softer, and was manageable.  </li>
            <li>Makes your beard soft and smooth and controllable.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I initially bought it to help with beard dandruff and soon found that it seemed to also make my beard softer and more manageable while also shortening the &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; stage shorter/easier to get through.  </li>
            <li>My first beard balm.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell based on some of the reviews that I read, but it&#x27;s definitely grown on me.</li>
            <li>or my age does most of growing, but I am a teen</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is exactly as described, no tricks here.  </li>
            <li>I pealed it open just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t used or something.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes a big difference for sure.    </li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s not something you can screw up, but for a first time user some pointers would be helpful.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that it smells almost exactly like Vaseline, with a hint of lemon.  </li>
            <li>and I was unsure about the scent at first,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used beard oils before (not balms) and some have worked better to improve the softness and feel of my beard, but don&#x27;t provide the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; or taming qualities of Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;d be an absolute knock-out!</li>
            <li>so...the opposite of sexy.</li>
            <li>really like it!</li>
            <li>As a guy who normally has a face full of stubble, i decided it was time to give the beard a shot.</li>
            <li>I grew a beard for the first time this summer and was told I should get a balm for it.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a beard balm and this one happen to be one of the first results.</li>
            <li>Really like this beard balm!</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever buying a product for my beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again, and I have no hesitations recommending it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care too much for the smell!</li>
            <li>Love following the instagram page.</li>
            <li>First time beard grower</li>
            <li>It Does exactly what it Describes.</li>
            <li>Those white whiskers seem to be stiffer and more prickly.  </li>
            <li>First beard product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the first beard balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered, the tin was $10.95.</li>
            <li>Apart from my sensibilities, when I showed this to potential customers during market research it was never selected as the favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil seems to be light-bodied and I&#x27;m guessing that lanolin makes up about 75% of the overall mix, possibly more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing more in the future now</li>
            <li>THANKS BEARD BALM!</li>
            <li>im definitely getting more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the easiest balms to work into a beard, and leaves the hair soft and smooth without feeling overly oily.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, definitely makes my beard look healthier.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first tin</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on the shine and shape my beard was in after starting to use Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>; big beard... need more per container</li>
            <li>First beard balm I have used</li>
            <li>Wife didnt like it (or my beard for that matter) at first, but I put the goo in anyways and my beard told her to shush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though-I will most likely keep using it.</li>
            <li>First time using a balm</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first about honey-like aroma, but I am liking it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>A bit medicinal, but enjoyable overall.  </li>
            <li>It helps control your beard, helps condition it and keeps it healthy all at the same time.</li>
            <li>This was my first</li>
            <li>is the first beard product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>thanks beard balm!</li>
            <li>I bought my first can of Beard Balm a couple of months ago and it has become part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>My wife hates when I have first applied it because she states it smells like diaper ointment.</li>
            <li>You put it on and run a comb through it a few times and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>I like how good it smells and it looks less frizzy!</li>
            <li>Purchased this as the first product to tame my beard a bit and it has turned out to be a good product that has softened up and smoothed out my beard a bit.  </li>
            <li>While both balms do a fantastic job, I haven&#x27;t even used much of the other tin, and find myself using Beard Balm more often.</li>
            <li>Pleasant and not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>After work I comb in the Balm and all of the tangles and wild hairs are very easily tamed with the bare minimum of pulled hairs.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Beard Balm for a little over a week and so far it is great.  </li>
            <li>This may not be a wonder all product, but I am pleased thus far, and will update when the first can is complete if for any reason I am displeased.</li>
            <li>Honestly I haven&#x27;t tried other beard balms to see how they compare to beard balm.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique, but much like other reviews, I found it to be not offensive and ultimately enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering like other products can be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, definitely leaves the beard softer and more manageable, and the tin has been long lasting.  </li>
            <li>like, it&#x27;s a clean natural scent.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a light hold type product sort of between a conditioner and a heavy balm.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard and skin feeling soft and with a natural healthy sheen that I cannot get any place else.</li>
            <li>most of the people on here have reviewed, the smell is strange at first but as you use the product it grows on you.</li>
            <li>However on a recent trip to Detroit one of my friends suggested that I start taking better care of my beard, an after much thought and consideration</li>
            <li>One of the first tools I picked up, pretty much on a lark, was a tin of Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>If you want to get a good present for the bearded man in your life, look no further</li>
            <li>I tried the honest Amish brand wax and to be it was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also married, so there&#x27;s a certain amount of the &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>His face is silky smooth and my hubby has a major grin on his face.  </li>
            <li>I live in very hot, humid weather where your hair is always getting frizzed.</li>
            <li>First off, the shipping was SUPER quick, I got it way earlier than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a desert and use more than a pea sized amount of this product, but it is super dry here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thought about gifting these balms to other bearded brethren simply to spread the joy of a well kept beard.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face has cleared up, the beard looks better, lays flat and is much softer.  </li>
            <li>He was very hesitant to use it at first.</li>
            <li>I think I love this stuff and plan on using it for as long as I can.  </li>
            <li>Their website has an instructions page, but it&#x27;s pretty much a joke about put it on any time you want to feel like a man.    </li>
            <li>First beard balm I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at first</li>
            <li>I have now almost made it through my first tin of Beard Balm and much to my satisfaction it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have a long goatee and this stuff makes it softer, more manageable, and helps prevent split ends.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping item arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I had a full, wild and woolly heard for 15 years and then stopped for another 15 because people started calling me &#x27;gramps&#x27;.</li>
            <li>what I know so far, it appears to work just about as good any other beard balm, however I knocked 2 stars because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I have had a full beard ever since I was a young man.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard full and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other similar products and this is by fa the best of them all...</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than massaging your beard after a long day!</li>
            <li>The mild, but manly scent took some getting used to because it puts me in mind of an old fashioned apothecary.</li>
            <li>This has a great natural smell to it, and is not too slick.</li>
            <li>Once applied, the balm gave my beastly grizzle a slight glint; which my wife liked.</li>
            <li>I apply this every day when I get out of the shower while the beard is still warm and slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>the dry skin I have in the winter under my beard has gotten better.  </li>
            <li>Has a slight hold to it which is nice.</li>
            <li>Using it on a dry beard makes your beard a bit sticky and clumpy, whereas application to a damp beard yields much better results.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really like the smell and neither did my fiancé,  but after using if for awhile I really started to like the smell</li>
            <li>far as it performs, it&#x27;s adequate.  </li>
            <li>I like this brand because it comes in a wax form ( thicker but similar to lip balm ) and is easily applied to the mane on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not actually that strong unless you put it on your moustache.    </li>
            <li>as if I have it constantly in my nostrils it does get too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>At first it seems a little greasy, but it gets absorbed into the hair, making it feel healthier and more lustrous.</li>
            <li>Pure man awesomeness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great product for smoothing out thick beard hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not personally a fan of the smell (it almost smells a bit buttery when first applied), but it fades into a more natural, earthy/floral scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Can was open and dented,but product fine.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of hold and gives my beard a nice scent and shine.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice aroma to it that lasts a little bit.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard softer and gives a nice little shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives your beard a nice shine with a little hold.</li>
            <li>It can get dry and flaky pretty easily.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend who doesn&#x27;t like the small of my Honest Amish very much</li>
            <li>This was the first beard balm I ever purchased, and I definitely know I made the right choice!</li>
            <li>The balm is of above average to high quality, it really does great conditioning and taming my beard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this product will help slightly more w. a hold, although minimal, thanks to the bees wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been indulging in this poduct for a few weeks now havent experienced anything different as of yet.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple versions of &amp;#34;Honest Amish&amp;#34; which work well, but the Beard Balm brand has a smooth finish and is much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of different balms before I found this amazing american made product.</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;s crazy too) smelled this and said it was awesome!</li>
            <li>This product has really helped me to contain my beard as well as soften it.  </li>
            <li>Smells very industrial like used motor oil or a machine tool shop.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a waxier product based on the opaque color on the image but its very shiny &amp; greasy.  </li>
            <li>Really helps from where I shave my neck line from itching.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how well and how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li>Works really well at keeping my beard in check.</li>
            <li>It smells very manly.</li>
            <li>and it makes my beard much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer and easier to shape.  </li>
            <li>And thanks to the Coconut oil that is in beard balm, i don&#x27;t have to worry about having an itchy chin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li>I promising this beard balm will change your life?&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Delivered very promptly.</li>
            <li>Works well, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was ready to tackle the day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,good product</li>
            <li>Shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li>It got here on time but really didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting</li>
            <li>women REALLY like</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really care&amp;#34; in my day-to-day grooming and appearance.</li>
            <li>Really conditions</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it will almost have a jehri curl effect.</li>
            <li>this product really</li>
            <li>Just really upset that I had to receive it, melted and all over the place...</li>
            <li>You do not need much to get the job done</li>
            <li>I not only enjoy the smell, but I also like the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>I must say I can not use much on my mustache though</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really notice the eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Beard Balm (insert thumbs up).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this stuff to do much, but after a bearded friend of mine recommended some type of conditioning oil I started doing some research and landed on this product.</li>
            <li>Since my order was fulfilled by Amazon, I can&#x27;t really fault the manufacturer for this, but Amazon had tossed the tin of Beard Balm in a padded envelope with another item I had ordered.</li>
            <li>anything really.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, just like everyone else and the directions state, all you need is about the size of a pea to coat a 2&amp;#34; beard.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a calming of my beard.</li>
            <li>and I could really tell the difference in my beard.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the Mrs thought that is was much softer, so that was a plus.    </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in Detroit by a company that seems very committed to the craft.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I use this product on my beard and it really darkens, shines and softens the manly feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply it while the beard is a real beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the razor blade rebels!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My beard thanks you, as does my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very neutrally scented.</li>
            <li>to mention the fact that it&#x27;s priced very reasonably...$4</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others that leave me greasy and don&#x27;t really condition my beard which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable how much softer and fluffier</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>My beard is naturally very bristly.  </li>
            <li>Has a consistency much like Chapstick that&#x27;s been in your pocket all day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say there is a lingering scent either.</li>
            <li>It does not have much hold but does help in keeping the hair on your beard&lt;</li>
            <li>better than expected.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample tin at a party by a very bearded hipster.</li>
            <li>It really does have a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>Do not use too much though or your beard will feel greasy for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li>Positives: It really makes my beard softer, and gives it a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li>It was much softer too.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t care for that one much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of shaping.</li>
            <li>Really pricey, but it does soften the beard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>the whole can(just got another).</li>
            <li>Smell is very homey/outdoors/</li>
            <li>This made my skin breakout and my beard feel really greasy as opposed to moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this beard balm.</li>
            <li>Has really help strengthen my beard and promote volume.</li>
            <li>That being said, I really like this Beard Balm conditioner.</li>
            <li>delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a very barky/outdoorsy type of scent.</li>
            <li>They really seem to know what works.  </li>
            <li>What they chose to include really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes being close to my beard.  </li>
            <li>Not as much control as I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Beard balm made my beard very manageable and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>Thanks beard balm</li>
            <li>; I much prefer my beard with Bear Balm.</li>
            <li>and this really helped whip it into shape.  </li>
            <li>I think I get used to the smell after an hour or so, but she says its still there and very pungent.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care too much for the smell and neither does anyone else around me.</li>
            <li>no frizzy&#x27;s, lots of control, just a real joy.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>it a try and let the gentle breeze massage your beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can tell a difference much softer...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It really helps with all the knots and tangles.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice much difference in softness, either.</li>
            <li>It really conditions my beard</li>
            <li>Thanks again for your professionalism.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to it, its a part of me as much as my deodorant scent is.  </li>
            <li>the only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from looking like a caveman is this fantastic balm.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and you have the amount of stars I really give it- Fifty.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for anyone who wants to enhance their beard.</li>
            <li>And I really want a beard</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m bearding, I&#x27;ve ordered several beard balms available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>others either have too much eucalyptus scent or are too oily.</li>
            <li>thats how much</li>
            <li>use it on your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lighter conditioner, not as heavy as the Honest Amish Beard balm.</li>
            <li>One complaint: it doesn&#x27;t taste too good, so avoid getting it in your mustache.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Not only did it leave my beard feeling soft, and silky, but I personally really enjoyed the scent of said beard balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with Honest Amish heavy duty for my taming needs.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer was kind to send the same product with a redesigned container and a personal email apologizing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this beard balm a few months ago and am still loving it.</li>
            <li>Some may complain about a smell, but as a female I actually quite liked it.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, breaking down to an oil with a few quick rubs in between my fingers and it lasts longer than the pure oils you can find out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking when they first manufacture this the smell is strong as the product is fresh but mellows out over a few days.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but the makers of beard balm offered me a free tin for writing a review.</li>
            <li>This one has a great scent that my wife enjoys and it helps tame my coarse beard</li>
            <li>This is super useful for when your beard gets long and unruly.</li>
            <li>I saw a bunch of recommendations for beard balm and WOW, were they right.</li>
            <li>Their product website is pretty much the same way, which leads me to believe that many of the reviews were left by the manufacturers.    </li>
            <li>You know when you start wearing a new cologne and the smell seems extra strong until your sense get used to it?</li>
            <li>I have a very large bushy beard, so I have to use a decent amount every time, but after a few months of using this, I still haven&#x27;t really used more than 1/4 of the tub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products, but I find myself using this more than others.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have pointed out, the smell is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love if this company offered other scents.</li>
            <li>other users have mentioned, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have tried many oils and other products, but beard balm is my go to product when I want my beard looking its best.&lt;br /&gt;jason</li>
            <li>I like the scent of other products much better.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm is a great product because even just a small amount provides a deep shine to the beard and allows you to shape the beard very well with a fine-toothed comb after you apply it.</li>
            <li>Yes eight two zero&#x27;s on top of each other making some kinda snowman</li>
            <li>So for this beard I bought two of the other top reviewed balms.</li>
            <li>I, unlike the other reviewers apparently, love the smell.</li>
            <li>My beard is pretty big right now, but I don&#x27;t have to use much to see the benefit.</li>
            <li>Smells decent and makes combing out tangles so much easier.</li>
            <li>This is the first balm I have tried for my beard and it really keeps the hair soft and in place.</li>
            <li>I am growing out a mustache and so far with this product, the stache is coming in more full and the hairs are softer and easier to tame.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my wild beard mostly down which is nice for work</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get this stuff, but now I&#x27;m pretty let down.</li>
            <li>Tried this on my goatee today for the first time and was very pleased with how only a little bit of this balm softened the hairs.  </li>
            <li>On the few days I didn&#x27;t think I needed it and got an itch fit in the afternoon, a quick hit of this</li>
            <li>I have a pretty wild beard, so I was hoping Beard Balm would be the solution to my woes.</li>
            <li>Husband likes it, but doesn&#x27;t use it enough to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and it isn&#x27;t as oily as some others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily when I get out of the shower and now sport a full man beard.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the desired effect, so I&#x27;m sure this tin will last me quite a while; I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another when the time comes!</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard pretty soft.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is pretty neutral, but maybe smells most like lanolin (not sure if I really know what that smells like).  </li>
            <li>only issue is the smell, it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just different, but I think the smell could grow on a person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recommending this to friends left and right and have heard nothing but positive reviews in return.</li>
            <li>a little oily, be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>There are 2 main reasons I love this stuff, aside from being made down the street.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Odd smell, but other than that great.</li>
            <li>New to having a real beard</li>
            <li>(I  quite like the smell but not so much, nor the consistency, as it is softer and probably less economical); and Grave Before Shave (which smells more lemony but is very similar to Beard</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know if you need more,  so start of with less using this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the more he uses it, the softer and less bristle it becomes.</li>
            <li>that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>+  per tin less that most others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I got the better end of the interaction on that corner in front of Star Bar half a year ago.</li>
            <li>Do you want random men and women to cry from the sheer beauty of your magnificent beard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>However, it does have somewhat of a medicinal smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li>This particular balm is made in Detroit.</li>
            <li>I love this beard balm works wonders on my beard only thing I wish they would do is a bigger can.</li>
            <li>Definitely been seeing some results and definitely a product i will be purchasing more of.</li>
            <li>Decent shuttle smell.</li>
            <li>As I grow older my whiskers have become more salt and less pepper.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first foray into beard balms, I would recommend trying another brand first, if only because the scent is unquestionably divisive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m lucky enough to work in a place that doesn&#x27;t care if I look like an out of work lumberjack</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard hydrated and healthy and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite increase in overall softness.</li>
            <li>A strong citrus fragrance, almost citronella-esk, is a little overbearing at first, but lightens over time.  </li>
            <li>At first the beeswax was something I was not use to, after a few months and a couple tins in I really quite enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li>The customer support is top notch, they don&#x27;t mess around.  </li>
            <li>The heat it experienced in shipping caused the Beard Balm to melt a little and some of the oils leaked out all over the other product in the envelope.</li>
            <li>this right here was worth money spent on.</li>
            <li>The product smells a little funky at first, but you get used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>beard products are concern I highly recommended  it</li>

            <li>i highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>The Beard Balm was highly reviewed, so I took a leap and it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to any beard enthusiast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you pick up some BeardBalm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product comes highly recommended, and heartily approved by a man that has not cut nor trimmed his beard in almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any fellow bearders.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps keep his beard strong, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>The only other conditioner I&#x27;ve used is Honest Amish, and I have to say this stuff (Beard Balm) does a little better job of leaving the hairs smoother longer.</li>
            <li>Also, I thought I was gonna rail through this little tin can of balm real quick, but</li>
            <li>Other balms have too strong of a scent, or make my beard to shiny.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smooths down all the fly away beard hairs and does make it feel a little smoother than without.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, it didn&#x27;t look like much in terms of amount but a little does go a long way and will last a good bit.</li>
            <li>My beard doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, as if I may have applied too much, rather it is soft and</li>
            <li>So far I really like the product.</li>
            <li>and it really feels soft to the touch and well nourished.</li>
            <li>makes my beard shiny and soft but leaves a bit of waxy residue which can be controlled by how much you put in your beard.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard much, much softer and alive looking.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but after about 6 months of fairly frequent use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used few different beard balms, and while this one doesn&#x27;t help shape the beard as much as the others, it makes my beard and my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>The tin lasts me about three to four months with daily application and is worth every penny of the price paid.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it makes my beard look magical....</li>
            <li>and my dad used Top Brass everyday.</li>
            <li>This is the most similar thing to human sebum, the natural conditioner for your beard, found in nature.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that it does have a powerful scent to it (or at least the kind I bought</li>
            <li>I have tried several different beard balms, and this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>Barely notice the spell its pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>The initial smell reminds me of an old gym, it is harder to apply out of the can than Honest Amish (which seems to melt easier).</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not used for a few days in a row, beard is noticeably dryer and more tangled.</li>
            <li>my nose, the overwhelming scent here is geranium oil and the lanolin, which is a fatty oil</li>
            <li>Love this stuff use it everyday.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous for dry skin!!</li>
            <li>It smells like lemony honey but masculine enough and dissipates rather quickly like they alluded to.</li>
            <li>Some said the product didn&#x27;t smell quit right while others said it simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>go to your local pharmacy, get some regular old body lotion (green bottle vaseline with aloe smells great and applies without greasiness) and just use that.</li>
            <li>It actually has helped my facial hair grow longer, be softer, and generally look better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I am new to Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>Also live the smell of the balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to having a beard</li>
            <li>The smell is different but it&#x27;s definitely more pleasant than bad.</li>
            <li>The conditioners penetrate my coarse facial hair and make it feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>without it, my beard is super wiry and dry and flies out all over the place.  </li>
            <li>And they are totally active on social media and love to give shout outs to people.</li>
            <li>People have commented on the smell, but I actually find it to be a good smell, and my wife hasn&#x27;t complained at all.</li>
            <li>but so far it has given me a decent hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sent it subtle, the balm absorbs and applies nicely with no carry off onto clothes.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It does dry out and flake out of my beard fairly quickly in the day, though.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm has kept my face itch free through a very dry cold winter and I have what I have been told is a pretty good beard.</li>
            <li>My beard feels very soft using this.  </li>
            <li>It smells very masculine.  </li>
            <li>I actually like how it smells very much.</li>
            <li>The packaging it came in was very professional.  </li>
            <li>it is very masculine.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy it; I wish it was a little less smoky/rubbery, but the overall scent is nice.</li>
            <li>It keeps my large beard soft ,neat and tidy, I&#x27;m addicted to the scent,and I even use some on my lips to keep them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li>It does wonders for texture and control of my half-yeard, smells like muscles and chopping wood, last a long time, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm makes your beard soft, tame and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t as strong as I need it to be to keep those wild stray beard hairs down -</li>
            <li>This is actually the first beard balm I used, about 4 months in growing.</li>
            <li>It is made from natural oils and beeswax that comes from Michigan!</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this again, but it has left oily stains on the neck part of some of my favorite white shirts.</li>
            <li>Oh yea, and all natural ingredients made in &#x27;MERICA!</li>
            <li>I was totally against using this stuff at first.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using both cans, the other is larger and cost more</li>
            <li>My first balm I&#x27;ve tried and probably my last cause it does the job so well.</li>
            <li>Not only do I walk around with a soft, lush beard, I also smile with confidence knowing that I have eliminated any and all beard dandruff that used to scare off womenfolk.</li>
            <li>If you are man enough to grow a beard, you are man enough to bear the light, natural smell of this product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>While smell is totally subjective, I can tell you that this captures the exact smell of my grandfather after a day of working on his industrial machinery out in his shop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my first can, daily, for about 4 months now</li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle scent and leaves your beard feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Wish they had one with Peppermint, or some other clean smelling oils.</li>
            <li>As a newly bearded man I was looking for something to deal with wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>this stuff feels really good as long as you dont mind a bit of an oily feeling on your face (at least for me).  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant (faint) odor.</li>
            <li>It makes me think of an old barbershop from the 50&#x27;s, like I said originally it&#x27;s a very masculine scent which I grew to enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much more tame it looks!</li>
            <li>Sure, the smell was a little weird at first but by the 3rd day I was loving it, it&#x27;s earthy and manly.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other gents on here, I was a little unsure of the smell of the beard balm at first, but I have grown to like it.</li>
            <li>after using 3 other brands I pretty much stuck with beard balm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It makes my beard hair less coarse and more soft to the touch</li>
            <li>Both products I&#x27;ve used certainly condition my beard, make it softer and such.</li>
            <li>Yep a little product from my finger to my hand, rub my hands together and then smooth on an in beard..  </li>
            <li>The only aspect I don&#x27;t like, is if you don&#x27;t rub the wax fully into a more liquid state, sometimes little clumps will show on the end of the hairs and can be unsightly, so always apply thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little off putting at first , but you learn to injoy it after the first couple of treatments.</li>
            <li>Most beard balms are hard and do not work into your beard evenly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re serious about your beard and want something that won&#x27;t weigh it down, just leave it shiny, soft and smelling great, you have to treat yourself to Beard Balm guys.</li>
            <li>It has a better hold than other balms that I&#x27;ve tired and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, makes my beard soft and keeps it from looking all crazy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now about 2.5&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; long and can get pretty wild at times.</li>
            <li>Clearly, they put some research into this product.  </li>
            <li>Does not help beard grow and only leaves it really shiny</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft , shinny and keeps those unrulie whiskers in check.</li>
            <li>The all natural balm was created to condition the beards of men, well, and women if they so choose.</li>
            <li>And the masculine scent of this balm is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If for some reason you feel this happened, then you simply used too much.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not greasy at all and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>It tames my beard the day I use it and keeps it soft for a couple days after.</li>
            <li>It really does make the beard quite a bit softer and easier to manage, especially after sleeping on it all night.</li>
            <li>so I looked like a fourteen year old girl with a sea urchin on my face.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell of this balm, and it keeps my beard soft, moisturized, and controlled.  </li>
            <li>Think of a lumberjack with a torn flannel shirt, holding a chainsaw will riding a  wild bull in the snow.</li>
            <li>It has also made my beard quite soft, which my girlfriend loves.</li>
            <li>Now my beard is soft and shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my epic beard epic.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard feeling as soft as Panda bear.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, it lasts through much of the day, and it provides a moderate hold for unruly hairs.</li>
            <li>it made my beard soft and silky.</li>
            <li>at least that&#x27;s what my wife says :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and maybe one or two knots that comb or brush out with no issue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer itchy and is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Small amount goes a long way and it leaves my beard nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have an almost completely gray beard and it didn&#x27;t discolor it and could reign in those wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>My brother said, this is absolutely the only product out, that has made his Beard.</li>
            <li>The only beard conditioner I&#x27;ve really used, but I see no reason to look into others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Beard Balm daily; my beard is now capable of transcending from metal shows into meeting rooms.</li>
            <li>Started using this balm for my 3 week old beard, can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s going to continue to work well as my beard grows</li>
            <li>I ordered this Beard balm as a gift for my brother who has a wild unruly beard.  </li>
            <li>Been using on my 8 month old beard.</li>
            <li>I must say that I initially chose this product over some of its competitors because I, much like this product, was made in Detroit.</li>
            <li>When something is chemical/medicine smelling you tend to get irritated when it&#x27;s directly under your nose.</li>
            <li>That may be why it&#x27;s so wild.</li>
            <li>I said how much the description cracked me up, but the back is even cuter and funnier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service is spot-on, and shipping is seamless.</li>
            <li>it does what i need to to do for my beard and that is make it soft and managable.....</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your beard and underlying skin really soft.</li>
            <li>so I can keep that professional look with my beard.</li>
            <li>Not too loud ...</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard soft while controlling any stragglers or rebellious hairs.</li>
            <li>My beard is a bit unruly, especially on the cheeks, and this balm really helps with combing and keeping the hairs in line.  </li>
            <li>Returning and buying directly from beard balm.</li>
            <li>There was a problem with my order through Amazon and the folks at Beard Balm took care of me directly and promptly.</li>
            <li>it is balmy....</li>
            <li>, the ingredients are all natural and non-exhaustible for all you environment conscious peoples.</li>
            <li>As far as conditioning the hair, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li>My beard is now soft to the touch and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The balm makes it soft as babies hair.  </li>
            <li>How soft my beard was was the talk of the night.</li>
            <li>I tried using some standard conditioners and while they made the hair softer, it was still very unmanageable.</li>
            <li>it has a natural smell without being too earthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get it again to keep my beard soft and my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>I know he is going to be using this everyday since it makes his face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is masculine, but not overpowering, and can be calming.</li>
            <li>I use it in addition to a natural shampoo and conditioner for beards.</li>
            <li>Fast forward almost 4 months later</li>
            <li>the skin never dried out.</li>
            <li>was also a fan of how minimalistic the ingredients were, and the fact they were all natural.</li>
            <li>The smell of Beard Balm is really masculine.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I used it to shape my curly beard and keep it soft.</li>
            <li>Im 19 years old</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t feel complete if I do not smell it.  </li>
            <li>Bonus points for being all natural and made in Detroit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how neat and controlled it looked.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like a wild man.</li>
            <li>Does soften my beard &amp; my wife can tell when I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days because my beard is more coarse and wild.</li>
            <li>No itch, soft bread now.  </li>
            <li>It works but it doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test of my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to say the least.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands feeling soft</li>
            <li>It keeps it manageable and soft, isn&#x27;t overly scented -</li>
            <li>if that doesn&#x27;t sell you on how soft it makes it, I don&#x27;t know what will.  </li>
            <li>While I am unsure if I purchased this during a sale of some sort, a 46% price increase over 6 weeks is unexpected.</li>
            <li>I use it after showering and it keeps my beard hairs soft and in place.</li>
            <li>My wife refuses to go near my face when I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard is quite coarse and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this product will continue to allow my beard to reach epic lengths.</li>
            <li>Used it twice, so far.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s beard is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for four weeks now and my beard stays soft</li>
            <li>But overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>; I have very curly facial hair and this</li>
            <li>We are talking about a silky soft, majestically flowing beard...</li>
            <li>It is soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s frizzed out, wild, and probably too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now it shines and is soft.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the smell is gone by the time I drive to work, and after a few weeks I stopped noticing the smell.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in how soft, and manageable</li>
            <li>also appreciate that this product is manufactured in Detroit, which is near where I grew up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was afraid that it would be too oily but after a good couple of gentle rubbings</li>
            <li>I have trouble growing facial hair, yet this product has made my baby beard much more manageable.</li>
            <li>My beard is thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>hair beard brush.he loves the smell too and has very rysensitive skin and will breAk out to most any product you put on his farce.</li>
            <li>showed my boss and she bought some for her bf, she loved the natural smell.cant go wrong beard balm and its imported from Detroit</li>
            <li>When unruly fans, faulty tour buses, and drunk carnies at the county fair aren&#x27;t threatening your life, irresponsible pyrotechnics are setting your face on fire.</li>
            <li>Great balm, I melt it between my fingers and rub it into my beard following a shower, it creates just enough cohesion to brush it down and it stays down.</li>
            <li>We love that it&#x27;s a Detroit made product, we like to support local small businesses, wherever we live.</li>
            <li>, then pretty much said WTF, easy to try and according to reviews</li>
            <li>But it only took one application upon my return to get my beard right back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard pretty soft in dry climates as well.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of trying out other balms, so I will likely have more to add later.</li>
            <li>can say that this balm is not like the type of wax you would use to style a crazy mustache, but it is perfect for any other application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands as well as homemade balms, but always come back to this genuine product.</li>
            <li>It does smell like bees wax (not unpleasant), but as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply the smell goes away shortly after application.</li>
            <li>As men, we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to perfumey type of scents that can be sweet or relatively bland so that women won&#x27;t be &amp;</li>
            <li>I love the natural smell like they say a little bit of balm goes a long way .I</li>
            <li>Long lasting, the can is ample enough to last many moonturns, and smells of man.  </li>
            <li>It made my beard SUPER SOFT and also has a slight styling ability.</li>
            <li>As mad as I am, still need this stuff to make my beard happy.  </li>
            <li>Have this to my husband for Christmas and he&#x27;s excited to user this almost everyday.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s blended well with other flavors to give it a Manly, earthy aroma (but not dirty hippie) and has no obnoxious perfume smell period.  </li>
            <li>While I absolutely love my husband&#x27;s beard (seriously we have an agreement</li>
            <li>and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li>There is a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not a fragrance and once applied disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>The stuff works well, only giving 4* because I feel the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this USA made product to anyone with any amount of facial hair!</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for the right balm for a long time, and finally found it with this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the beard over the long term.</li>
            <li>Now I think my only complaint now is that so many ladies want to feel how soft my beard is.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and agreeable, and I usually don&#x27;t go for fragranced products</li>
            <li>With a quick trim with hair clippers and a little beard balm</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference in the days that I use it, and I started getting compliments at work on my new found furry beauty.</li>
            <li>only is the itching gone, my new found beard looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>My beard used to be as dry as the Mojave, and at any moment an errant spark could have lit the whole thing ablaze.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to take their beard to the next level.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so you are really getting your money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>Really helps tame down my beard and leaves it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>When my under-beard facial hair started becoming frustrated this year, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do.</li>
            <li>Left my boyfriend&#x27;s beard feeling soft!</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews said, the smell is something to get used to at first.</li>
            <li>however mine are very stringy and loose and needed tending all the time.  </li>
            <li>First, a thyroid condition causes dry skin, second my job requires a lot of cleaning and tons of hand washing.</li>
            <li>I tend to get pretty dry skin and facial hair and this product has taken care of both those issues.</li>
            <li>beard, long may it live!</li>
            <li>I actually went to a fast food restaurant and there was a young kid with a goatee that actually complimented me on my beard and gave me an extra scoop of food!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can leave a bit of residue behind if you use too much, which is easy, since it only takes about a dime-sized amount to get desired</li>
            <li>It never overpowers you competing with the fifteen-year old next store dowsed in a gallon of aftershave before his first prom like some other products.</li>
            <li>the beard balm makes my beard super relaxed, way less wirey, and smells terrific..</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so go lightly, rub it between your hands until it melts, then apply.  </li>
            <li>This can take the most drab sad and dry looking beard and give it a whole new life.</li>
            <li>But I was wrong, this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Balms in general help keep his skin conditioned below and the strays from getting too prickly.</li>
            <li>It is slightly strange that Beard Balm decided to go with Lanolin instead of the more commonly used shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough to calm the wild hairs.</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredient list includes essential oils and beeswax.  </li>
            <li>Lasted longer than I expected considering you don&#x27;t need much for your beard.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m old enough to be a gramps (and my beard is white), I have started again but this time it&#x27;s no longer wild and woolly because I have discovered beard maintenance, part of which is this beard balm.</li>
            <li>Do you want your display of manliness that is your facial hair to be soft and shiny?</li>
            <li>Instead it simply suggests a natural hint of cultivation</li>
            <li>Definitely helps control wild beard hair.</li>
            <li>I was eager to peel it out of the box and apply it to the 6-week extension of my face that I am currently calling \\&quot;my natural wolfman.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My beard is beyond soft now, my girlfriend never complains about it anymore as she did before I began using this product and conditioning my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Upon attempting to give my masculine patronage to a local tavern, I was mistaken for a vagrant and promptly asked to leave.  </li>
            <li>This was a low point in my life, but the epic levels of testosterone coursing through my veins ensured that defeat was not an option.  </li>
            <li>The people who have invaded my personal space in an attempt to grab ahold of my whiskers have all commented on how soft it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m goin&#x27; back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li>This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected</li>
            <li>The beard balm just made my beard like an Afro, not very manageable unless Much product was used.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the reviews and to be honest I am skeptical about product reviews in general.</li>
            <li>It will coat your comb like paint coats a brush, so if you want a thin coat, brush more than you dip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have roughly a 10inch beard so needless to say when I wake up it&#x27;s everywhere, but just a quick brush &amp; a little BeardBalm &amp; my beard is neat, controlled, &amp; looking good.</li>
            <li>One tin has lasted me 3 months, and it&#x27;s only about half done, and my beard is pretty epic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my fairly long beard soft, manageable, and looking clean and slick, but not shiny or gunky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, very faint.  </li>
            <li>I find the smell to be fine and my only complaint is that it can get a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>The smell is very natural and kind of eucalyptus/camphor -ish, but subtle if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount (very little).</li>
            <li>Received my second can and it came in a nice small yellow padded envelope, inside a larger box (with other items I ordered).  </li>
            <li>One of my main reasons for growing my beard out initially was because I started getting dry skin on my lower face.</li>
            <li>But the balm can actually wrangle it back under control and make it cuddlably soft.  </li>
            <li>, my only problem now is that I&#x27;m constantly running my fingers through my beard because it feels so soft</li>
            <li>Upon opening the can, the smell was reminiscent of an old gym - that musky and manly odor mixed with a hint of rust and sweat.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm is not waxy, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, and it&#x27;s produced in small batches in the town of my longtime-favorite hockey team - the Detroit Redwings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin under said mane is not nearly as dry anymore now too.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only about half way through my first can - after 2 months.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better in other areas but its hard for me to quantify.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I use it everyday to tame my beard.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I must go carve a canoe... out of a tree that fell to the ground at the near sight of my glorious beard.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the softness of my beard after use, and I will keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s offered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft all day long</li>
            <li>It makes my beard soft, shiny, and even hides some of the grey hairs.</li>
            <li>I just got the balm, and applied my first round.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that makes it worth it or not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown my beard out a few times but this is the first time that I have done it with the help from Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>After the first few uses my bearded looked healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell was the first thing that killed me.</li>
            <li>I have a full, thick beard.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a thick, full beard</li>
            <li>I have noticed a large increase in black hairs on my face.</li>
            <li>Softens wily facial growth and provides a subtle shine that feels smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Really calmed down my beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and I enjoy the faint fragrance.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this product, and it makes his beard so much nicer and much less prickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to and it has made my beard a lot less unruly.</li>
            <li>All my previous attempts at growing a beard ended when the itching got to be too much.</li>
            <li>My beard is only about 1-inch long, but I have to keep it well groomed for professional reasons.</li>
            <li>I conducted some internet research and saw a few positive reviews for Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have had nothing but positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product I actually like the smell, but I find it is a little expensive for me as my beard is fairly long</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, it&#x27;s just a subtle smell that goes away after an hour.</li>
            <li>I have not use it everyday, but am close to running out and will certainly place another order when I do.</li>
            <li>I just take a little bit out, rub it together in my hands, work it into my beard, &amp; I&#x27;m ready to conquer the world.</li>
            <li>I notice that if I put too much in or don&#x27;t massage it in well that I get little drops of conditioner in my beard.  </li>
            <li>I can live with the other, it smells like I have been working on a machine or something</li>
            <li>It really helps to tame a dry beard and wild hairs.</li>
            <li>I live in the city, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like a campfire (like other brands of balm) unless I&#x27;m actually camping, but</li>
            <li>A little bit will go a long way, it just takes more comb strokes to evenly apply small amounts.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This beard balm is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner/moisturizer, it probably won&#x27;t work as well as a styling product per se, but for what it is it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The balm goes on nicely and softens your beard or goatee up while providing a bit of hold.</li>
            <li> It also gives your beard / goatee a nice sheen.</li>

            <li> Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> the Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my fianc&amp;eacute; who loves his beard dearly, but just needed some added control to help keep his beard looking nice.</li>
            <li> Aside from the smell, it made my scraggly beard way softer and keeps it looking quite tidy.</li>
            <li> My beard is nice and manageable, though I have found that I need to apply it twice a day to maintain the feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s, Honest Amish and this one, Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> boyfriend liked it</li>
            <li> Beard balm holds nicely all day with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> I do not have a nice trimmed neat beard, but beard balm keeps it well under control.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> I have tried three: this one; also Honest Amish</li>
            <li> It does make the beard feel really really nice, but I find that the effect starts to wear off after a day of work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of eucalyptus-rubber-wax-smokey.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lime scent that isn&#x27;t too perfumy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been tried Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm for almost a year, my beard start to get in thicker and stronger, they are look so coor as every morning i applies the Beard Palm on them</li>
            <li> Puts a nice sheen on your face as well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice</li>
            <li> An excellent, reasonably priced grooming aid for beards.</li>
            <li> It works well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too.  </li>
            <li> It sort of helps with keeping my beard tidy</li>
            <li> I will compare this product to honest amish and dr ganix since i have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep my beard around 3/4&amp;#34; in length and Beard Balm softens and conditions quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard groomed nicely.</li>

            <li> and this is coming from a guy who does not like any kind of \\&quot;product\\</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, I don&#x27;t have an idea what are people here</li>
            <li> Also the face feels nice after using it, no itch or whatever</li>

            <li> Gives my beard a nice shine and stopped the itching..</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased honest review</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal, my buddy at work uses Honest Amish and a guy at the beer store</li>
            <li> When I started growing my beard almost six months ago, I kind of stumbled through learning what to do.</li>
            <li> It also keeps my beard looking good and work appropriate.</li>
            <li> I tried Beard Balm based on the reveiws and really liked it.</li>
            <li> In short, this is an awesome product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I liked it .</li>
            <li> I looked at all the products on Amazon and ultimately settled on Beard Balm because of the great reviews as well as awesome name.  </li>

            <li> This stuff smells kind of like a can of Copenhagen.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> It makes his beard so much softer and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Honest Amish product and thought I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and comes as advertised.</li>
            <li> I also like the texture of this balm compared to Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> I have used a few cans of this wonderful beard product and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my beard feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was using the Crux beard oil before this and that had a nice, manly smell.</li>
            <li> the smell is quite nice once you get used to it</li>
            <li> and it does give my beard a nice look</li>
            <li> Although it would be nice if they could add some scented types to the lineup.</li>
            <li> and I really liked this.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it&#x27;s growing on me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice woodsy smell, while not being too off-putting.</li>
            <li> Also, it has helped to keep my skin nice and conditioned.</li>
            <li> However, this product is great, and as long as there is hair on my face I will own a can of this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product with a unique scent that gradually grows on you.</li>
            <li> So this was the first product of many that I tried and it&#x27;s the best of all.</li>
            <li> It worked as advertised and had a very mild smell, which I found to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm makes my wiry beard very easy to sculpt, and gives it a nice shine without it looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> It adds a nice light shine and a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s necessarily great either.</li>
            <li> It has kind of strong smell, though!</li>
            <li> Strong smell but good</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and keeps my beard looking good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a nice manly smell and gives beard a nice healthy shine</li>
            <li> I just put it on after trimming and washing, and I get a nice, smooth, good smelling beard.  </li>
            <li> and I think their scent was very strong, even though it went away after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to use and not sticky either.  </li>
            <li> great stuff very easy to apply smells great and definitely makes the beard look awesome would recommend and we&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing again</li>

            <li> smells fine good product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my beard feeling overwhelming greasy or dense, and it&#x27;s great for keeping my beard looking neat and clean in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, makes my beard look nice and clean...</li>
            <li> Very good product for keeping beard very conditioned.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect for how I want my beard to smell, manly and natural.  </li>
            <li> Best product have use thus far regarding  </li>
            <li> its a learn as you go kind of thing, but I absolutely love this balm.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best balm I&#x27;ve used in my beard.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and made in the greatest country in the world, the USA.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard balm so far that I have used.</li>
            <li> Beard balm smells good and makes the beard feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard soft and manageable, plus it smells great!</li>
            <li> (mostly) in check and leaves a nice shine to things.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm also gives my beard a nice healthy shine and my wife loves the luxurious feel of my beard.  </li>
            <li> My beard came in much better, and the problem hairs that would stand up before fell nicely in line with the rest.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and it seems to calm the itch and discomfort greatly.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> your beard does it too, and this helps keep it manageable, soft, and awesome.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it smells like an honest days&#x27; work, which is sort of satisfying and manly, but not how I want to smell all the time.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm leaves you with a nice glistening beard and ever since I started using Beard Balm my beard has become more manageable and has the appearance of being fuller.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and makes my husband&#x27;s beard soft...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look any further, THIS is THE BEST PRODUCT for growing a clean, smooth, and healthy beard!!!</li>
            <li> I love Beard Balm, it does an excellent job conditioning my beard and giving me some control in taming some of my wild hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is &#x27;Honest&#x27;ly vastly superior to any of its competitors that it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with it, though, and after about a week of use I can honestly say I&#x27;ll be ordering another tin when this one starts to run low.</li>
            <li> Great product, simple to use and great on the look.</li>
            <li> main issue with the stuff is that it&#x27;s incredibly greasy.  </li>
            <li> The smell is real nice, very manly and girls love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves the beard looking more full, better shaped, better looking and smelling great</li>
            <li> Otherwise the stuff is amazing and very amusing if you bother to read the instructions (which we were gloriously not deprived of thanks to my feminine intuition and the fact that I just like to read).</li>
            <li> Just use a fingernail amount and rub gently between your palm followed by massaging into your beautiful mane.</li>
            <li> Great product, has a &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; smell at first</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that this stuff does a great job of softening and conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li> A great product that does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard &amp; are interested in keeping it looking &amp; smelling great</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what it promises with no bs.</li>
            <li> This is my first time growing a beard, and I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> but surprisingly my wife has asked me to let it grow in full again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a baby face and it took a good amount of time to get the full growth in.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Good product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell by any means, and I find it to be kind of nice, but it&#x27;s by no means scented like some sort of hair product or aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, easy to use balm.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, and goes on a tad greasy but with a great shine, then absorbs quickly, leaving my beard soft.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review, but this company has found a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Now its more lovable lumberjack.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will be getting more</li>
            <li> This is one of the balms on Amazon with the best reviews, so I went for it and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that most of the glory and compliments should be directed to Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a beard oil, I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> a beard softer and more manageable...</li>
            <li> Out of the three this is the one that gets dipped into most mornings.  </li>
            <li> This Beard Balm really does work great.</li>
            <li> It tames my beard and makes it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>

            <li> It keeps the hair and the skin underneath healthy.</li>
            <li> but I like it better.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard and want a better beard buy this.</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time to be the favorite part of my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more unfounded in my fears.</li>

            <li> I will be continuing to use it daily, and the scent is alotta awesome.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>

            <li> Love this before I got a tin of beard balm my beard would grow but after a month or so would just get tangled knotted</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This just worked ok for my husband.</li>
            <li> It might have worked better if we used it longer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Balm is OK.</li>
            <li> One of the better beard products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Still my favorite after trying others</li>
            <li> BTW, I just reordered some more.  </li>
            <li> The lid was able to stay on and even if the package got to 100 degrees, I feel the content would have remained inside the can and not all over the box, and me.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off putting olive oil in your beard than this s</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I recommend to all who wish to grow a healthy beard</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but here&#x27;s what</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so plush and more manageable than ever before.</li>
            <li> It turns out it was more than just a gag gift.  </li>
            <li> Ehh, I never tried anything like this before and it turned out to just be something that smells ok and makes my beard bushy.</li>
            <li> My son had the most out of control beard.</li>
            <li> Once he started using the beard balm brush his beard was healthier looking, fuller, and even the parts of his beard that grew in all different directions looked perfect after 3 weeks using just this Beard Balm and  boars</li>
            <li> Anyone wanting to grow a healthy beard should use this.</li>
            <li> The smell was okay</li>
            <li> Feels more like a coating than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> One of the best personal grooming products I have purchased in some time.</li>
            <li> I love this company, I wish these fellas were in my group of friends</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> After I used it for about two weeks my beard was noticeably more heathy and manageable, I turned two of my buddies to beard balm as well</li>
            <li> so it makes more sense for me to apply Beard Balm after work.</li>
            <li> The detritus in your now-glowing beard will mostly be sticking to your comb rather than your face.</li>
            <li> i love it......</li>
            <li> I landed a date tonight, you better believe Beard Balm played a part in that.</li>
            <li> Here is why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my beard feel</li>
            <li> It gives my beard a more fuller and shinier looked.</li>
            <li> Made my beard feel so much better:</li>
            <li> fuller, cleaner, all around better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to love it now, but it does take time.</li>
            <li> It makes his beard softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Husband Love this Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll kill the itch and the flakes and have a softer, more manageable beard.</li>
            <li> It was great, bit of a learning curve for how much should be used on your beard.</li>
            <li> I started getting more attention from ladies as well.</li>
            <li> I love how the product doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell to it.</li>
            <li> Ok, the smell...</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> What more do you need</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff</li>
            <li> The scent takes a bit of getting used to, but seems OK now, a bit outdoorsy may be one way to describe it.</li>
            <li> It works so much better when applied to a moist beard.</li>
            <li> I also love this for travel because it is easier to transport than oil.</li>
            <li> My beard looks healthy and shiny, not over done though...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this balm, and it has helped my beard feel softer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this beard balm.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and that it is made in america.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps my beard smooth and manageable and my skin free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have and hold for my mustache, but I guess this is meant to be more of a conditioner than a beard holder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li> but to help the hairy guys maintain a healthy style.</li>
            <li> Also love the bees&amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Depending on your beard, you may need to apply it more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m very happy and on my second tin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell on my husband&#x27;s beard.  </li>
            <li> though there is another I like better).  </li>
            <li> It has brought my beard to its best potential no doubt.</li>
            <li> He gets so many compliments and gets asked what he uses all the time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gag gift for my best whose beard is approaching wizard status.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay balm.</li>
            <li> I have to say, i&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> , I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I decided to give them a try, even after reading reviews of many complaints regarding the not-so-nice smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the beards that need that extra bit of control.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the product and the fact that it&#x27;s made and comes from Detroit, MI.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating shaving, so glad I found Beard Balm and saved my beard.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 6 more cans.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your beard nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This will help you beard better than you have ever bearded before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard</li>
            <li> My beard and I truly enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> My beard had a patchy area and this helps it grow, one of my favorite beard products, will continue to use for a while.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I are in LOVE with this Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> I also love the fact that this is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any sort of beard products before, so I have nothing to compare this product to, but after a couple months of using it I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love my beard.</li>
            <li> And I love my beard balm.</li>
            <li> and I have a healthy beard.</li>
            <li> This beard balm did everything I wanted it to do, and more.</li>
            <li> The Beard balm does an excellent job of softening my beard while making it more manageable at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I actually love the smell-</li>
            <li> Smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I like how it controls the hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love it as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The gel itself is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t feel gross when I apply it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great and really aids in the health of my beard.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> But when I buy more it will be Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be patient this isn&#x27;t magic it doesn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, I like how plyable it is.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall with Bear Balm.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My beard is much more well-behaved</li>
            <li> I found I was losing more hairs when I would brush while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using Beard Balm, my life has undoubtedly improved for the better.</li>
            <li> Love the balm.</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li> I use pine tar soap, I use oil conditioner, I serenade it with love songs, I bathe in milk and honey, but nothing softens it like Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Plus, as a Michigan native, I love that it&#x27;s made in Detroit.</li>
            <li> My wife also approves :)</li>
            <li> if you buy a can, be sure to follow their Instagram.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hilarious</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my whiskers feel.  </li>
            <li> His beard looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more</li>
            <li> It has softened my beard and made it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> The balm also makes my beard behave much better and soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> beard seems to be fuller and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the way my husband&#x27;s beard feels and smells age using this consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Should get more for the price.</li>
            <li> Be sure you get a boar bristle brush to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, been using it for about five months now and its really done a great job at giving my beard a healthy sheen and giving just enough hold to help get my moustache out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> basically does a great job and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great, leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 days, and I&#x27;ve made many attempts at opening it, but still I&#x27;m unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> Hair conditioner works better for softening your beard up.</li>
            <li> This was worth it though because it smells so good and does keep the hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> You just might like it :)</li>
            <li> I love it and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The colors in my beard are more noticeable too.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Have you ever wondered how you can smell more like your mechanic?</li>
            <li> So, if you want your beard to be sniffed and scruffed by potential lovers, this may not be the perfect balm for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used much better beard conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and so does my wife...</li>
            <li> Nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Would buy again to cultivate my face with manliness once more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> and I really think this balm is great.</li>
            <li> The balm is ok -</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> but the smell is better than most.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over most beard balms</li>
            <li> My beard is now more manly than ever.</li>
            <li> This would be my top pick for a beard balm.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the flyaways are under control now (somewhat).  </li>
            <li> Much more than I did without it in.</li>
            <li> When this happens, I just make sure to wipe this out.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and the shine it gives my beard.</li>
            <li> Geranium smell is interesting.  </li>
            <li> Love that it comes from</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Better then beard oil.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Looks like the top fell off during delivery.</li>
            <li> Check them out for sure.  </li>
            <li> It makes my beard look healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it, thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> For a bit, I procrastinated about getting the right tools together to make sure I kept it in good shape.</li>
            <li> Great scent, easy to apply and works really well!</li>
            <li> Good, workable texture that works right in to my beard.  </li>
            <li> Good product, just not quite right for my needs.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased and was hoping it would have a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> You now have an awesome looking beard and a clean comb, soft hands and a spring in your step.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this perfect for anybody with a nice full beard.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and smells good too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves a nice shine to my beard and makes it look and feel very healthy.</li>
            <li> The best time to apply in my opinion is fresh out of the shower at giving the beard a good towel dry.</li>
            <li> I teach in a high school and compete with the kids each year for &amp;#34;No Shave November.&amp;#34; I am usually happy to shave on Dec. 1st.</li>
            <li> surprisingly enough it was very pleasant.</li>
            <li> but now I am a believer with a full nicely groomed beard.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> My beard is becoming softer and more groomed looking.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you are a rebel of the razor, I highly recommend checking out this awesome, straight outta Detroit, beard balm!  </li>
            <li> Works great for the guy or bearded lady who is fairly new to having a beard.  </li>
            <li> Application and use is an easy and enjoyable experience that I look forward to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, healthy looking and it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as wax, but I didn&#x27;t want that much anyway, so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very masculine yet not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The Original Scent Beard Balm has a refreshing aroma - there&#x27;s a very light eucalyptus aroma that disappears almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it, but make sure to pick up a brush as well!</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, not too strong but still present, and a nice feel after being applied.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but it literally does nothing for your beard other than smell good.</li>
            <li> After some convincing he finally tried it out and loved it!</li>
            <li> I have since trimmed it (happens so often) and the resulting new beard is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great and keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a 6-foot-4, 220 pound barrel chested love machine with a bank full of gold bars, more friends than the captain of the football team in an 80&#x27;s movie, I date not one, but two supermodels</li>
            <li> Showed up a couple days early, great stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my beard soft</li>
            <li> love how smooth and silky it makes beard feel.</li>
            <li> Even my girlfriend said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re becoming the mountain man</li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive skin like my husband, this product is great for you.  </li>
            <li> Beard feels soft, also takes care of fly aways.</li>
            <li> As it came the day before Christmas, I was creative and found another lid that would fit it.</li>
            <li> Its important to me that my beard make good first impressions and not look unkempt.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many beard balms/glosses and have found that along with Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard gloss this is a fantastic balm.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard feeing soft and looking great.</li>
            <li> It smells great once you get used to it, and it always makes my beard looking lush after a shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff – and comes from the Motor City, which is fun.</li>
            <li> I would consider using it on your beard if you would to have a nice smile.</li>
            <li> It creates a good shine and really does soften your beard.</li>
            <li> Beard always looks good and is much softer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, any kind of conditioner is subjective but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product and say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good and does add a bit of sheen to your beard, but doesnt soften it up much.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many balms and oils on my beard and this product is hands down the best!  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering just right!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, plus leaves my beard feeling soft and smelling great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> For my first time growing a beard (beyond 5:00 shadow) I knew I needed a good product to maintain my beard and keep a clean look.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this balm, the smell is very pleasant and the application is short while leaving your beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> He uses it every other day or so on his beard and it tames it beautifully!  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm (this exact product) for over two years now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a non-greasy beard balm that melts easily at your touch, somewhere between the consistency of butter and vegetable shortening.</li>
            <li> It keeps the beard hydrated/shining and makes combing and brushing really easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does control the beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to carry around when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Though the delivery was very quick, it didn&#x27;t come with directions.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to work with, and it makes you feel manly.  </li>
            <li> It likes to curl and tangle and isn&#x27;t easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product :) and really works.</li>
            <li> Getting the product into your beard is easy...</li>
            <li> The balm itself easily melts in your palms, so you can apply it to your beard.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard shiny and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it keeps things easy outta the shower.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and made my beard hair softer and healthier appearing.</li>
            <li> If your beard is of a more substantial length, stick with oils which are more readily absorbed and beneficial to your hair.</li>
            <li> so the smell doesn&#x27;t get that strong.</li>
            <li> lot of people seem to complain about the aroma, but neither my girlfriend nor I find it offensive or strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, though, and you do smell it all day.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, but oils my beard nicely so i can live with it.</li>
            <li> The product is highly recommended smells so good</li>
            <li> With a pair of trimming scissors and mild application of this wondrous concoction, I was transformed from &#x27;the noble savage&#x27; into true nobility.  </li>
            <li> I bought Beard Balm at the advice of a friend who uses it, and I have been very satisfied with how much easier it is to keep my beard in check.</li>
            <li> and at first I was worried about the finer details of beard care with this kind of product.</li>
            <li> To each their own, but I believe balm like this is far better than oil in that the balm allows you to work in and distribute the product more evenly.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice beard balm.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty effectively to soften up my whiskers but within an hour it seemed like it had disappeared</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any kind of beard conditioner</li>
            <li> This one feels and stays on your hair and skin like baseline&lt;br /&gt;Smell is okay not bad, but I&#x27;ll wait</li>
            <li> Hands down the best Amazon purchase ever from An Amazon addict.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and this is hands down the best balm for your beard.  </li>
            <li> Hands Down the Best Beard Product Money Can Buy!    </li>
            <li> Women laughed at my jokes, angels sang when I entered the room, people thought I was special forces, and people started getting out of my way in the fast lane.  </li>
            <li> Balm).&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is fine stuff</li>
            <li> I apply the balm every morning, and comb it through with a fine toothed comb.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for my guy&#x27;s beard, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> but I was impressed from first popping the can open.  </li>
            <li> The balms effects on the beard are fine.</li>
            <li> The smell is just fine.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It was fine.</li>
            <li> I work Beard Balm between my fingers and into my beard, then comb through with a fine toothed beard comb.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 2 more cans, as I can&#x27;t scrape any more out of the first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too light or too strong.</li>
            <li> of all I like the smell; it is pleasantly floral but in a masculine acceptable way.</li>
            <li> I got it quickly!  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs, without a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is made in the good old USA is another plus for me!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face drape super soft.</li>
            <li> My face pet is soft, smooth, and smells manly yet pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Beard Balm spreads easy and evenly, smells great, and tames my unruly beard, especially the curly parts of my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product, love the smell, love the natural ingredients, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> He  found it was best to use after taking a shower when his beard was a little damp.  </li>
            <li> Will be a stocking stuffer so I can&#x27;t give an accurate review of how it works</li>
            <li> Huge difference after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent....</li>
            <li> All in all, a great product, especially when combined with a wash-out conditioner, and I will continue to support the Beard Balm crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would smear on my face again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this beard oil.  </li>
            <li> They will be a great test and I will let you know how it works next week.</li>
            <li> importantly the wife didn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all.</li>
            <li> Comb with Kent beard comb (available on Amazon)</li>
            <li> But overall I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Instead, it will make your moustache buttery smooth, and give you a mouthful of buttery smooth moustache.</li>
            <li> A fantastic beard growing product.</li>
            <li> Greasy and basically a cheap hand salve.</li>
            <li> but I got used to it and actually enjoy it now.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the smell, it fades away after awhile though</li>
            <li> it went from wiry to silky smooth immediately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly cheap for the amount you&#x27;re getting</li>

            <li> No manly fellow worth his salt should ever leave the house without a healthy application of the miracle mixture that is Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Just comb it into your face fur and enjoy.</li>
            <li> your fingers over the balm, then rub in your fingers, then rub lightly onto the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me as well as my wife enjoy the smell and for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and the balm kept me blemish free.</li>

            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical that any of them were genuine.</li>

            <li> container fits comfortably into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it spreads on smooth.</li>
            <li> teach college classes, and I knew Beard Balm was working when one of my students told me that my beard was distractingly shiny when I stood in the light of the projector.</li>
            <li> feels really smooth without that greasy/oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, Don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, Seems to get all the hairs going in the same direction to fend off wirey sum-bishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not trolling this product, just giving an insider&#x27;s point of view from someone who has tried all the balms, oils, and waxes available on the market and providing some insight into how their recipe compares to others.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent.</li>

            <li> Leaves my beard smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I get out of the shower and it keeps my beard shiny and smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smalls like my middle school band room that was carpeted and everyone emptied their spit valves on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s function is great, but the odor is not.</li>
            <li> There were girls walking around handing out free tins of the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; balm.....</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, I will definitely buy another again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find something locally produced, as well.</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural, so you can feel good about putting the stuff on your face.</li>
            <li> Hands-down Beard Balm is far superior.</li>
            <li> Smells good (Though my wife was not a fan) And leaves your beard supple and soft.</li>
            <li> It is in a semi solid state, so you may need to warm it up in your pocket or run it under warm water for about a minute before using it.</li>
            <li> It really conditioned his beard and made it much more healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Good smell and keeps beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> For the good:  It definitely does its job with respect to softening, and gives your beard a more finished/groomed appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tames my beard and leaves it soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> makes it soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off my beard because it smelled so good and was incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> This one is much softer coming out of the tin than many others and it has a more &amp;#34;mechanic in the workshop&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Great product, natural smelling fresh</li>
            <li> good brush is essential to get the most out of this product.</li>
            <li> Right now, Honest Amish is the best beard balm that I have used so far, and may go back to it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I enjoyed the scent right off the bat.</li>
            <li> verses others due to the fact that it contains eucalyptus , which is great for healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your beard/stache greasy or shiny, just full and strong.</li>
            <li> Spreads very nice and evenly through the beard, especially when paired with a beard brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my significant other and he loved how amazing his beard felt afterwards</li>
            <li> and I love the look it gives my beard and feel but enjoy the smell very much</li>

            <li> This one is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Very effective beard tamer and promoter through some of the first couple of months during the wild times.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the balm dalt calm!</li>
            <li> It softens up quickly and goes in evenly with a fine toothed comb.</li>
            <li> The container travels well, and is a TSA friendly size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Smelled great, not greasy, controlled my wild hairs and left my beard with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I love supporting folks who produce things in the US and create jobs.  </li>
            <li> It smells ok at first</li>
            <li> Hubby is excited to try.</li>
            <li> It does have a unique scent, which is not for everyone</li>
            <li> After the first application I was told that his beard was much more manageable and softer.</li>
            <li> For the first time I was able to run my fingers through my husbands beard without yanking on his hair.</li>
            <li> It works great on beardruff and makes your beard very shiny, which are about the only two things most men care about when choosing a balm.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has a unique smell</li>
            <li> I tried it and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> My hair grows full and even and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, however I find it is much more oily than many other beard balms and oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it will make your beard grow in any faster or more fully, but it definitely keeps it nice and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Fantastic earthy, organic scent that quickly dissipates but maintains its effect.</li>
            <li> My wife appreciates the softness and the Beard Balm has a clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best I&#x27;ve used to far.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands with some soap and use some of the lather to clean the oils from the comb.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm keeps your beard hair straight, soft, and smelling great all day.</li>
            <li> , it is great product, it keeps my facial hair shinny and fresh, I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> After a good washing and rinsing, the second application hailed even better results than the first.</li>
            <li> Of the other products in this arena that I&#x27;ve tried, this has the most pleasing scent and it does a good job at taming my beard.  </li>
            <li> This balm is better than no balm, but certainly wouldn&#x27;t be a recommendation of mine.</li>
            <li> does, which since it doesn&#x27;t have any special name on it</li>
            <li> Very good quality product that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> The odor of the balm is unique, but I quickly came to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff to anybody who wants their beard to smell as good as it looks...</li>
            <li> At first my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent but has started to really dig it after about a week.</li>
            <li> It smells great and you&#x27;re supporting a local (to me) /</li>
            <li> So far its amazing.</li>
            <li> The beard-envy is clearly evident, as the clean-shaven colleagues of the office stroke their naked baby&#x27;s-bottom jaws wishing they had the ability to summon the great wisdom of the burl.</li>
            <li> and I still have a good amount left, so you get a lot of value and longevity per tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good and my beard is starting to feel softer.</li>
            <li> I Loved the product, I needed it for no shave November last month, and along with genetics Beard Balm was a wondering aid.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like a foot or a flower - just a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li> I love the honey smell and how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li> I woke up, took a shower, washed my beard and thought in this sweet, sweeeeet balm.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel soft and have a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My beard is nice and soft and the skin under the hair is no longer flakey.</li>
            <li> but once I figured out how much to put in it looked a lot better.</li>
            <li> Instead it looks full of life, shiny, and</li>
            <li> Overall a good beard product.</li>
            <li> Remember your beard is a lighthouse to lost, beardless souls, seeking true manhood.  </li>
            <li> My girl also loves the smell, super clean.</li>
            <li> It makes his beard soft and smell really nice.  </li>
            <li> thanks mostly to Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> but this was a good starting point for me.</li>
            <li> Good solid scent (</li>
            <li> My beard feels good and it actually makes it feel fuller.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from all my friends and family about how nice it looks and how it shines in the sun, how soft it feels.</li>
            <li> I grow my beard out in the winter to full and cant wait to see how it helps things along this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some reviews say it goes away after 20 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that I would likely buy again, but I will also try others to compare it with.</li>
            <li> My lady likes it, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Because now my beards nice and soft.</li>
            <li> but they both seem have about the same consumption rate, so I would say they are on par price wise.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of not shaving and using Beard Balm my beard finally grew into a good shadow with out any patches.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has made my beard much smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It has a different smell, but thats good.</li>
            <li> good overall quality though and</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it is make in Detroit USA and is all natural.</li>
            <li> this is much easier and works better.)</li>
            <li> Product overall is good.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> but then it really grew on me and now I love it.  </li>
            <li> It stopped my beard dandruff and made my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It kept my mustache nice and soft and I&#x27;d reapply it mid-day.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is also good with an immediate follow-up and definitely personalized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a mild, fresh scent and helps my hands tremendously!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but throughout the day you might catch it and wonder what it is you&#x27;re smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s nothing you&#x27;d ever want put into a spray bottle to use before...</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not bad) and fades within a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not bad</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not obtrusive, it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> my face-jacket has grown significantly more burly; it looks and smells extraordinary thanks to our pals at Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> The scent, while being strong and slightly different than what I&#x27;m accustomed to, is really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but this is the best so far!!</li>
            <li> By the tits, I mean it is wonderful to massage into your beard.</li>
            <li> The smell is super manly and made me feel like a true lumbersexual.</li>
            <li> At first the smell was somewhat strong, but I got used to it already.</li>
            <li> At first, the smell of Beard Balm was strong to me, and I found myself getting irritated by the smell.</li>
            <li> Clean and crisp scent -- heavier on the lemon, and then a light note of geranium</li>
            <li> BUT I do want my beard to be healthy, soft, and well taken care of because it&#x27;s a fine line between robust mountain man beard and hobo who sleeps in a rail yard and heats up a can of beans over a barrel fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and awesome.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly after i purchase it</li>
            <li> and I started dating super models.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> I suggest you apply it while your whiskers are still mildly damp.  </li>
            <li> if you dont care about the smell (keep in mind the aroma of all 3 products goes away rather quickly once applied)</li>
            <li> Love it too because it&#x27;s one of the few things I order here in Atlanta that is from my beloved Detroit home.</li>
            <li> Since switching to this product I&#x27;ve been able to better shape and control my beard while at the same time conditioning it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super quick shipping....</li>
            <li> The person sitting next to me asked if she could touch my beard, then more and more.</li>
            <li> dose build up quickly.</li>
            <li> As someone with a curly beard, I was struggling with the dreaded beard dandruff and the super itchiness that goes along with that.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be mainly, but it makes you smell like you made love to a skunk in pine tree.  </li>
            <li> And his beard looks even more sexy, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> customer service is top notch and even includes a personal note with your order :)</li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor and it reminds me of a old musty building.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this balm to anyone who needs just a smudge more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; than a oil can do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li> : I keep my hair long and he doesn&#x27;t go clean shaven), he doesn&#x27;t always have time for proper grooming and mainenance, so his normally awesome beard can take on</li>
            <li> I have been using Beard Balm for several months, and have been very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> On the drive there multiple hunnies (women), honked there horns and started getting very pleased whenever they saw my beard.</li>
            <li> I normally use beard oils and this was what I needed to help give me better control and some hold to keep the beard looking spot on all day.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products and by far this is the best thing.</li>
            <li> The packaging (tin) is nice, the smell is fragrant but not overpowering, and I think it does a better job of conditioning the hair and skin underneath my beard than other products.</li>
            <li> and if you have a long bread it takes a fair amount per application.</li>
            <li> The price is good for how long the product lasts.</li>
            <li> The scent is a sophisticated aroma with a natural cleanly man smell.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and would recommend both this product and the seller, really fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Really love this new Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother (one day I&#x27;ll be able to grow a full, epic beard) and he loves it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels good on the beard as well as on dry hands.</li>
            <li> But very quickly I started to really like the smell.</li>
            <li> First time using a beard balm!</li>
            <li> This product added control to his beard (to reduce those fluffy/frizzy tufts that look unruly), as well as left his beard looking healthy, shiny, and softer (but still manly!).</li>
            <li> , I am going to assume is original flavor), so I&#x27;d advise buying just one at first to see if that&#x27;s a deal breaker for you.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it!</li>
            <li> Run it through with a small comb or brush and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> If you have coarse or unruly man beard issues, this stuff will help make it much more manageable!</li>
            <li> The only entity that loves this stuff more than I do is my beard!</li>
            <li> It makes my beard soft and smooth and easy to manage.    </li>
            <li> The scent is gentle and pleasant and I&#x27;ve had no complaints from anyone who has gotten close enough to get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the mild scent, and the just right amount of shine it gives the beard.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your quick delivery!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really detect any aroma, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> the only one worth using on my beard, keeps it soft, and smooth, with a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> I tried the Honest Amish brand, but it was too hard and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry skin underneath the beard but this has help to moistureize and make my beard soft and smell good!</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients used in this product, but nonetheless I love that it keeps my beard far from itching, somewhat shiny, and overtime straightens the hair.</li>
            <li> Fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, been using this for a few months now (about 3-4 times a week).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this balm for my fiancés amazing beard.</li>
            <li> The product has a light scent that isn&#x27;t really that noticable after application.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t overstate this point enough, the smell is amazing), all without appearing greasy.</li>
            <li> , I use it just about everyday and my beard looks great with a softness from &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This balm isn&#x27;t heavy at all, and works as a great conditioner after the thorough washes I&#x27;ve given it.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep the hairs straight and makes my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The beard Balm and Honest Amish are similar in how they make your beard feel but Beard Balm excels in smell.  </li>
            <li> and it is soon absorbed (no greasy look or feel).</li>
            <li> I was prompted to write this review by the promise of another tin, but the above is an honest opinion</li>
            <li> My beard feels softer since using the product, but more importantly I have noticed a big difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, Beard Balm Natural Leave In Conditioner may be more valuable than water, air or Mike Trout in your fantasy baseball league.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Being a deodorant and minimal grooming kind of guy, I was looking for something that would make me look presentable and smell good at the same time.</li>
            <li> love the smell and does the job quite well keeping mustache soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a masculine scent for sure just not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I can style it with some success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He loves how soft and healthy his beard is now</li>
            <li> It makes it manageable and  so far I&#x27;m glad I chose it over others.</li>
            <li> , Has a nice luster that seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> Bring in Beard Balm, just a finger tips amount combed through a damp freshly washed beard and PRESTO</li>
            <li> It makes my beard shiny and soft and I get many compliments on the condition of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife appreciates how soft it makes my beard, she told me she doesn&#x27;t feel like she is kissing a wire brush any more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because a scent would be nice.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is a great, all natural product that makes my usually wild goatee soft and civilized.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it makes my beard soft</li>
            <li> I tried Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm, which smells like a spicy gum drop in the beginning, but it kept leaving a hint of a fruity scent later on - leaving me to look for rotten fruit somewhere in the vicinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> and I honestly couldn&#x27;t imagine starting my day without it!</li>
            <li> Just a couple of nice people trying to market an idea that I personally think is under-utilized.</li>
            <li> After using this balm, I can&#x27;t foresee myself ever going back to oils of any kind.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s made with natural oils and bees wax, it leaves my beard healthy and the skin under it well moisturized</li>
            <li> Women love a soft beard.</li>
            <li> Not awkwardly sticky like hair gel products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest going with The Fresh Man beard oils over this stuff.</li>
            <li> WOW,  My beard is soft, it glistens, and looks really good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice to have the product in a container where you could actually get into trying the  product.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted $16 on this because now I&#x27;m going to throw it away and order some more Honest Amish beard balm.</li>
            <li> As far as the fragrance: the Lanolin odor is prominent (oily/waxy smell).  </li>
            <li> Secondly, this balm does a nice job softening up the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> It makes my beard nice and soft and helps keep the hairs straight.  </li>
            <li> ... makes your face smile.  </li>
            <li> If I go bald on my cheeks and chin, I will (reluctantly) purchase another popular hair-growing product to bring the hair back</li>
            <li> ; that is soft as a gentle breeze on a warm summer day.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, left my beard soft, shiny, and comfortable........</li>
            <li> Keeps it soft and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Also it has a bonus, after using all the balm, you have a pretty cool tin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oils and balms and this is by far my go to choice.</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to make my beard more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> This balm seems to have really moisturized my skin like no other product of this nature has been able to do for me!</li>
            <li> I got this product and another Amish type one (not naming any names) at the same time, well my can of Beard Balm is almost gone, time to get some more and the other one got given away, it was nowhere as good as Beard Balm which makes my beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I will use other products in conjunction with this one on weekends when I&#x27;m looking for more hold and a more aggressive look.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other beard conditioners/balms and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> It goes away pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> Best bearld balm out, holds my scraggly hairs down and keeps them straight,its smells good, very soft.can&#x27;t wait for my second batch, instant buy!!!</li>
            <li> Some say its over powering or too much, personally I find it to be refreshing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> but the other two IMO smell good.</li>
            <li> Conditions moistens and gives a nice flat shine after it sets in.</li>
            <li> The smell was pretty strong and a bit gross when I first got it, but after a week or so the scent has dissipated and it&#x27;s much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this if you are trying to keep it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Once you rub a bit together in your hands you will see how the balm softens right up.</li>
            <li> order this right now, maybe get 3.</li>
            <li> In fact she sniffed it right out of the can and said &amp;#34;ok...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;beard\\&quot; right on the front.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> This Beard Balm is not greasy, not oily, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They were all right.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was right</li>
            <li> The scent of the balm is good, too, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it, but now I find it to be a rather masculine, natural scent, fragrant, but not overwhelming or chemical-smelling.</li>
            <li> : I rub it in morning and night and my beard is juuuuussssst right.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here needs to be in every beard sporting mans shelf.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is the right product to compliment this freedom beard, and it&#x27;s made in the USA</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMO if you are getting this for itchy beard, stop right there.</li>
            <li> This product pretty much lived up to what it said it was, far as making your beard easy to comb, nice scent &amp; shine also the reduce of hair shedding,  but far as beard growth!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;All natural, easy to use, essential for the modern man.&lt;br /&gt;Our popular original scent - a blend of lemon peel, eucalyptus leaf, and geranium flower</li>
            <li> i first used it on my 3 month old growth, it took a bit more than what I use now to get it conditioned.  </li>
            <li> At first the balm seems like it might leave your beard greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t at all - just leaves you with a soft and healthy looking beard.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this back in April, along with a tin of Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft blend, it melts easily as soon as your fingers touch it.  </li>
            <li> The consistency seems perfect, it is soft enough to apply with ease, but not so soft that too much comes off at once, and it is not grainy or</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to soften and smooth your beard I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> It also gave my beard a nice sheen and is slightly moldable, almost like a light hair gel.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, very natural, and keeps his beard soft and tamed.  </li>
            <li> and it will most definitely approve the appearance and feel if you&#x27;re not using any kind of leave in conditioner currently.</li>
            <li> It works great and smells unbelievable.</li>
            <li> To make beard even better, after a few minutes brush with Diane&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Palm Brush (100% boar hair – also available from Amazon for nice low price) for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keeps my ample beard looking nice through a long day at the office as well.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that stated that the smell was a little overpowering, but I found it pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, makes my beard a little shiny.</li>
            <li> I also live in a fairly arid region, and this stuff helps to keep my beard from becoming dried out.  </li>
            <li> (an interesting but undefinable odour which does not linger too long), and is easy to apply – just rub a couple of fingers around the tin, transfer to beard and rub in, continue until whole beard is done.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is a little oldschool and while I do like it, it&#x27;s not the most appealing.  </li>
            <li> I have used just about everything on the market in my beard and enjoy trying new things....</li>
            <li> i use this Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm daily to hope to get the nice thick and strong beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Left my beard shimmering, smelling wonderful, and got quite a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Straight out of Detroit; this product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is mainly good at keeping your beard soft, I personally use it in combination with jojoba oil</li>
            <li> The balm (you shouldn&#x27;t need much) smooths into his beard rather quickly without leaving any clumps or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Through sheer force of will I was able to grow a virile manscape the likes of which this world has rarely seen before.  </li>
            <li> Great product, solid performance essential for any beard growing gent!!</li>
            <li> This beard balm helps tremendously with making those thorny whiskers much softer.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is actually very beneficial for the skin, but carries with it a mild sheepy smell.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and fast..</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> It does have a similar odor to popular diaper cream so the smell leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant eucalyptus aroma that goes away after a few minutes after you put it in.</li>
            <li> Works very well to give your beard a nice soft smooth feel, smells great, and helps to keep any stray whiskers laying flat and your whole beard looking sharp!  </li>
            <li> Expected more!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this (plus a boar&#x27;s hair brush) is a great purchase for guys interested in keeping and properly maintaining a beard.</li>
            <li> This is the scent a woman wants to smell because it makes her feel like you just got back from wrestling a full grown grizzly bear out in Canada in your favorite plaid shirt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell but it fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li> The fragrance takes some getting used to, but we both agree that his beard looks more lush and the hairs are smoothed down nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put very much on</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and has a nice but subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the past year trying to tame my beard - this is the best!</li>
            <li> The smell was strange the first time I used it, but just suck it up and enjoy your new awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have found it best to slip the teeth of my comb over the rim of the can and scrape out a little bit of Balm, then combing it into the hairs.</li>
            <li> Smell is very strong and stay for long time.</li>
            <li> Apply the balm immediately after showering and drying your beard, a little damp is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Use a little beard brush and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> My beard looks full, a little bit shiny, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It helps tame your beard, also making it soft and the smell is good!</li>
            <li> Most of the time I keep it really short.</li>
            <li> Lotion, while nice, just isn&#x27;t enough to keep my hands normally hydrated, never mind soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Plus, it helps fight beard itch and beard dandruff - two thing that you most definitely do not need in your life!</li>
            <li> I tried this for like the first week</li>
            <li> I use it daily and my beard looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Beard wax is the only hair product I use and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I had no friends.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVES this balm!  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day and is always consistent.</li>
            <li> First review,and it is well deserved.</li>
            <li> exactly what you</li>
            <li> using my first tin of this, i am now dependent on it.</li>
            <li> it even brings out the red in it a bit more.</li>
            <li> This specific product gives me beard moisture and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Used it first thing this morning and could immediately feel a difference in the softness of it.</li>
            <li> Would rate higher if I could.</li>
            <li> First Beard Balm I&#x27;ve ever bought/owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first tin of this stuff.</li>
            <li> He likes it too ;)  </li>
            <li> and this was the first product I tried.  </li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this balm now for 2 months, the smell was \\&quot;off putting\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li> His beard is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This was the first beard balm/oil that I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.</li>
            <li> First time buying something to put on my beard.</li>
            <li> I started using it just to see if it&#x27;d actually do anything notable.</li>
            <li> After the first application I could feel and see the difference-</li>
            <li> I think I put too much in on my first use</li>
            <li> Just recently started growing a beard again after many attempts.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> but I bought this as a birthday gift and they love this product; especially the way it smells.</li>
            <li> First off, the product description made me giggle.</li>
            <li> I first tried to scrape some out with a fingertip and wipe it on, but that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I first bought this product to soften the beard, I was using it with stubble basically(not</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptic to buy this product from all the reviews.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because the can is pretty small; although one could argue a good product is worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I had to youtube the directions on applying (my first beard).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure an essential oil could be added to help alleviate the grandma-odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So instead of shaving or changing my wardrobe I tried this, and on the first day of use I had zero flakes.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a beard balm but decided to go with this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> First application and my beard was gleaming, felt softer, and was manageable.  </li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft and smooth and controllable.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I initially bought it to help with beard dandruff and soon found that it seemed to also make my beard softer and more manageable while also shortening the &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; stage shorter/easier to get through.  </li>
            <li> My first beard balm.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell based on some of the reviews that I read, but it&#x27;s definitely grown on me.</li>
            <li> or my age does most of growing, but I am a teen</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is exactly as described, no tricks here.  </li>
            <li> I pealed it open just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t used or something.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes a big difference for sure.    </li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s not something you can screw up, but for a first time user some pointers would be helpful.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that it smells almost exactly like Vaseline, with a hint of lemon.  </li>
            <li> and I was unsure about the scent at first,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used beard oils before (not balms) and some have worked better to improve the softness and feel of my beard, but don&#x27;t provide the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; or taming qualities of Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;d be an absolute knock-out!</li>
            <li> so...the opposite of sexy.</li>
            <li> really like it!</li>
            <li> As a guy who normally has a face full of stubble, i decided it was time to give the beard a shot.</li>
            <li> I grew a beard for the first time this summer and was told I should get a balm for it.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a beard balm and this one happen to be one of the first results.</li>
            <li> Really like this beard balm!</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying a product for my beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again, and I have no hesitations recommending it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care too much for the smell!</li>
            <li> Love following the instagram page.</li>
            <li> First time beard grower</li>
            <li> It Does exactly what it Describes.</li>
            <li> Those white whiskers seem to be stiffer and more prickly.  </li>
            <li> First beard product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered, the tin was $10.95.</li>
            <li> Apart from my sensibilities, when I showed this to potential customers during market research it was never selected as the favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil seems to be light-bodied and I&#x27;m guessing that lanolin makes up about 75% of the overall mix, possibly more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be purchasing more in the future now</li>
            <li> THANKS BEARD BALM!</li>
            <li> im definitely getting more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the easiest balms to work into a beard, and leaves the hair soft and smooth without feeling overly oily.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, definitely makes my beard look healthier.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first tin</li>
            <li> I got many compliments on the shine and shape my beard was in after starting to use Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> ; big beard... need more per container</li>
            <li> First beard balm I have used</li>
            <li> Wife didnt like it (or my beard for that matter) at first, but I put the goo in anyways and my beard told her to shush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though-I will most likely keep using it.</li>
            <li> First time using a balm</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first about honey-like aroma, but I am liking it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> A bit medicinal, but enjoyable overall.  </li>
            <li> It helps control your beard, helps condition it and keeps it healthy all at the same time.</li>
            <li> This was my first</li>
            <li> is the first beard product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> thanks beard balm!</li>
            <li> I bought my first can of Beard Balm a couple of months ago and it has become part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> My wife hates when I have first applied it because she states it smells like diaper ointment.</li>
            <li> You put it on and run a comb through it a few times and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I like how good it smells and it looks less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as the first product to tame my beard a bit and it has turned out to be a good product that has softened up and smoothed out my beard a bit.  </li>
            <li> While both balms do a fantastic job, I haven&#x27;t even used much of the other tin, and find myself using Beard Balm more often.</li>
            <li> Pleasant and not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> After work I comb in the Balm and all of the tangles and wild hairs are very easily tamed with the bare minimum of pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Beard Balm for a little over a week and so far it is great.  </li>
            <li> This may not be a wonder all product, but I am pleased thus far, and will update when the first can is complete if for any reason I am displeased.</li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t tried other beard balms to see how they compare to beard balm.</li>
            <li> The scent is unique, but much like other reviews, I found it to be not offensive and ultimately enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering like other products can be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, definitely leaves the beard softer and more manageable, and the tin has been long lasting.  </li>
            <li> like, it&#x27;s a clean natural scent.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a light hold type product sort of between a conditioner and a heavy balm.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard and skin feeling soft and with a natural healthy sheen that I cannot get any place else.</li>
            <li> most of the people on here have reviewed, the smell is strange at first but as you use the product it grows on you.</li>
            <li> However on a recent trip to Detroit one of my friends suggested that I start taking better care of my beard, an after much thought and consideration</li>
            <li> One of the first tools I picked up, pretty much on a lark, was a tin of Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> If you want to get a good present for the bearded man in your life, look no further</li>
            <li> I tried the honest Amish brand wax and to be it was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also married, so there&#x27;s a certain amount of the &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> His face is silky smooth and my hubby has a major grin on his face.  </li>
            <li> I live in very hot, humid weather where your hair is always getting frizzed.</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was SUPER quick, I got it way earlier than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a desert and use more than a pea sized amount of this product, but it is super dry here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thought about gifting these balms to other bearded brethren simply to spread the joy of a well kept beard.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face has cleared up, the beard looks better, lays flat and is much softer.  </li>
            <li> He was very hesitant to use it at first.</li>
            <li> I think I love this stuff and plan on using it for as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> Their website has an instructions page, but it&#x27;s pretty much a joke about put it on any time you want to feel like a man.    </li>
            <li> First beard balm I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at first</li>
            <li> I have now almost made it through my first tin of Beard Balm and much to my satisfaction it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have a long goatee and this stuff makes it softer, more manageable, and helps prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I had a full, wild and woolly heard for 15 years and then stopped for another 15 because people started calling me &#x27;gramps&#x27;.</li>
            <li> what I know so far, it appears to work just about as good any other beard balm, however I knocked 2 stars because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard ever since I was a young man.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard full and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other similar products and this is by fa the best of them all...</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than massaging your beard after a long day!</li>
            <li> The mild, but manly scent took some getting used to because it puts me in mind of an old fashioned apothecary.</li>
            <li> This has a great natural smell to it, and is not too slick.</li>
            <li> Once applied, the balm gave my beastly grizzle a slight glint; which my wife liked.</li>
            <li> I apply this every day when I get out of the shower while the beard is still warm and slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> the dry skin I have in the winter under my beard has gotten better.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight hold to it which is nice.</li>
            <li> Using it on a dry beard makes your beard a bit sticky and clumpy, whereas application to a damp beard yields much better results.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really like the smell and neither did my fiancé,  but after using if for awhile I really started to like the smell</li>
            <li> far as it performs, it&#x27;s adequate.  </li>
            <li> I like this brand because it comes in a wax form ( thicker but similar to lip balm ) and is easily applied to the mane on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not actually that strong unless you put it on your moustache.    </li>
            <li> as if I have it constantly in my nostrils it does get too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> At first it seems a little greasy, but it gets absorbed into the hair, making it feel healthier and more lustrous.</li>
            <li> Pure man awesomeness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great product for smoothing out thick beard hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not personally a fan of the smell (it almost smells a bit buttery when first applied), but it fades into a more natural, earthy/floral scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Can was open and dented,but product fine.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of hold and gives my beard a nice scent and shine.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice aroma to it that lasts a little bit.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard softer and gives a nice little shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives your beard a nice shine with a little hold.</li>
            <li> It can get dry and flaky pretty easily.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend who doesn&#x27;t like the small of my Honest Amish very much</li>
            <li> This was the first beard balm I ever purchased, and I definitely know I made the right choice!</li>
            <li> The balm is of above average to high quality, it really does great conditioning and taming my beard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this product will help slightly more w. a hold, although minimal, thanks to the bees wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been indulging in this poduct for a few weeks now havent experienced anything different as of yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple versions of &amp;#34;Honest Amish&amp;#34; which work well, but the Beard Balm brand has a smooth finish and is much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different balms before I found this amazing american made product.</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;s crazy too) smelled this and said it was awesome!</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me to contain my beard as well as soften it.  </li>
            <li> Smells very industrial like used motor oil or a machine tool shop.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a waxier product based on the opaque color on the image but its very shiny &amp; greasy.  </li>
            <li> Really helps from where I shave my neck line from itching.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well and how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> Works really well at keeping my beard in check.</li>
            <li> It smells very manly.</li>
            <li> and it makes my beard much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much softer and easier to shape.  </li>
            <li> And thanks to the Coconut oil that is in beard balm, i don&#x27;t have to worry about having an itchy chin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> I promising this beard balm will change your life?&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Delivered very promptly.</li>
            <li> Works well, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was ready to tackle the day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good product</li>
            <li> Shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li> It got here on time but really didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting</li>
            <li> women REALLY like</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really care&amp;#34; in my day-to-day grooming and appearance.</li>
            <li> Really conditions</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it will almost have a jehri curl effect.</li>
            <li> this product really</li>
            <li> Just really upset that I had to receive it, melted and all over the place...</li>
            <li> You do not need much to get the job done</li>
            <li> I not only enjoy the smell, but I also like the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> I must say I can not use much on my mustache though</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t really notice the eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very greasy.</li>
            <li> Thanks Beard Balm (insert thumbs up).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this stuff to do much, but after a bearded friend of mine recommended some type of conditioning oil I started doing some research and landed on this product.</li>
            <li> Since my order was fulfilled by Amazon, I can&#x27;t really fault the manufacturer for this, but Amazon had tossed the tin of Beard Balm in a padded envelope with another item I had ordered.</li>
            <li> anything really.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, just like everyone else and the directions state, all you need is about the size of a pea to coat a 2&amp;#34; beard.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a calming of my beard.</li>
            <li> and I could really tell the difference in my beard.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the Mrs thought that is was much softer, so that was a plus.    </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in Detroit by a company that seems very committed to the craft.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I use this product on my beard and it really darkens, shines and softens the manly feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply it while the beard is a real beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the razor blade rebels!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My beard thanks you, as does my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very neutrally scented.</li>
            <li> to mention the fact that it&#x27;s priced very reasonably...$4</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that leave me greasy and don&#x27;t really condition my beard which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable how much softer and fluffier</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> My beard is naturally very bristly.  </li>
            <li> Has a consistency much like Chapstick that&#x27;s been in your pocket all day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say there is a lingering scent either.</li>
            <li> It does not have much hold but does help in keeping the hair on your beard&lt;</li>
            <li> better than expected.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample tin at a party by a very bearded hipster.</li>
            <li> It really does have a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> Do not use too much though or your beard will feel greasy for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li> Positives: It really makes my beard softer, and gives it a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> It was much softer too.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t care for that one much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of shaping.</li>
            <li> Really pricey, but it does soften the beard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the whole can(just got another).</li>
            <li> Smell is very homey/outdoors/</li>
            <li> This made my skin breakout and my beard feel really greasy as opposed to moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm.</li>
            <li> Has really help strengthen my beard and promote volume.</li>
            <li> That being said, I really like this Beard Balm conditioner.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a very barky/outdoorsy type of scent.</li>
            <li> They really seem to know what works.  </li>
            <li> What they chose to include really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes being close to my beard.  </li>
            <li> Not as much control as I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Beard balm made my beard very manageable and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Thanks beard balm</li>
            <li> ; I much prefer my beard with Bear Balm.</li>
            <li> and this really helped whip it into shape.  </li>
            <li> I think I get used to the smell after an hour or so, but she says its still there and very pungent.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care too much for the smell and neither does anyone else around me.</li>
            <li> no frizzy&#x27;s, lots of control, just a real joy.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> it a try and let the gentle breeze massage your beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can tell a difference much softer...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It really helps with all the knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much difference in softness, either.</li>
            <li> It really conditions my beard</li>
            <li> Thanks again for your professionalism.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m used to it, its a part of me as much as my deodorant scent is.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from looking like a caveman is this fantastic balm.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and you have the amount of stars I really give it- Fifty.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for anyone who wants to enhance their beard.</li>
            <li> And I really want a beard</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m bearding, I&#x27;ve ordered several beard balms available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> others either have too much eucalyptus scent or are too oily.</li>
            <li> thats how much</li>
            <li> use it on your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lighter conditioner, not as heavy as the Honest Amish Beard balm.</li>
            <li> One complaint: it doesn&#x27;t taste too good, so avoid getting it in your mustache.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Not only did it leave my beard feeling soft, and silky, but I personally really enjoyed the scent of said beard balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with Honest Amish heavy duty for my taming needs.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer was kind to send the same product with a redesigned container and a personal email apologizing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this beard balm a few months ago and am still loving it.</li>
            <li> Some may complain about a smell, but as a female I actually quite liked it.</li>
            <li> The texture is great, breaking down to an oil with a few quick rubs in between my fingers and it lasts longer than the pure oils you can find out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking when they first manufacture this the smell is strong as the product is fresh but mellows out over a few days.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but the makers of beard balm offered me a free tin for writing a review.</li>
            <li> This one has a great scent that my wife enjoys and it helps tame my coarse beard</li>
            <li> This is super useful for when your beard gets long and unruly.</li>
            <li> I saw a bunch of recommendations for beard balm and WOW, were they right.</li>
            <li> Their product website is pretty much the same way, which leads me to believe that many of the reviews were left by the manufacturers.    </li>
            <li> You know when you start wearing a new cologne and the smell seems extra strong until your sense get used to it?</li>
            <li> I have a very large bushy beard, so I have to use a decent amount every time, but after a few months of using this, I still haven&#x27;t really used more than 1/4 of the tub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products, but I find myself using this more than others.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have pointed out, the smell is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love if this company offered other scents.</li>
            <li> other users have mentioned, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oils and other products, but beard balm is my go to product when I want my beard looking its best.&lt;br /&gt;jason</li>
            <li> I like the scent of other products much better.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is a great product because even just a small amount provides a deep shine to the beard and allows you to shape the beard very well with a fine-toothed comb after you apply it.</li>
            <li> Yes eight two zero&#x27;s on top of each other making some kinda snowman</li>
            <li> So for this beard I bought two of the other top reviewed balms.</li>
            <li> I, unlike the other reviewers apparently, love the smell.</li>
            <li> My beard is pretty big right now, but I don&#x27;t have to use much to see the benefit.</li>
            <li> Smells decent and makes combing out tangles so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is the first balm I have tried for my beard and it really keeps the hair soft and in place.</li>
            <li> I am growing out a mustache and so far with this product, the stache is coming in more full and the hairs are softer and easier to tame.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my wild beard mostly down which is nice for work</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this stuff, but now I&#x27;m pretty let down.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my goatee today for the first time and was very pleased with how only a little bit of this balm softened the hairs.  </li>
            <li> On the few days I didn&#x27;t think I needed it and got an itch fit in the afternoon, a quick hit of this</li>
            <li> I have a pretty wild beard, so I was hoping Beard Balm would be the solution to my woes.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it, but doesn&#x27;t use it enough to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and it isn&#x27;t as oily as some others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily when I get out of the shower and now sport a full man beard.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the desired effect, so I&#x27;m sure this tin will last me quite a while; I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another when the time comes!</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard pretty soft.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is pretty neutral, but maybe smells most like lanolin (not sure if I really know what that smells like).  </li>
            <li> only issue is the smell, it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just different, but I think the smell could grow on a person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending this to friends left and right and have heard nothing but positive reviews in return.</li>
            <li> a little oily, be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li> There are 2 main reasons I love this stuff, aside from being made down the street.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Odd smell, but other than that great.</li>
            <li> New to having a real beard</li>
            <li> (I  quite like the smell but not so much, nor the consistency, as it is softer and probably less economical); and Grave Before Shave (which smells more lemony but is very similar to Beard</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know if you need more,  so start of with less using this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the more he uses it, the softer and less bristle it becomes.</li>
            <li> that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> +  per tin less that most others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I got the better end of the interaction on that corner in front of Star Bar half a year ago.</li>
            <li> Do you want random men and women to cry from the sheer beauty of your magnificent beard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> However, it does have somewhat of a medicinal smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li> This particular balm is made in Detroit.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm works wonders on my beard only thing I wish they would do is a bigger can.</li>
            <li> Definitely been seeing some results and definitely a product i will be purchasing more of.</li>
            <li> Decent shuttle smell.</li>
            <li> As I grow older my whiskers have become more salt and less pepper.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first foray into beard balms, I would recommend trying another brand first, if only because the scent is unquestionably divisive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky enough to work in a place that doesn&#x27;t care if I look like an out of work lumberjack</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard hydrated and healthy and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite increase in overall softness.</li>
            <li> A strong citrus fragrance, almost citronella-esk, is a little overbearing at first, but lightens over time.  </li>
            <li> At first the beeswax was something I was not use to, after a few months and a couple tins in I really quite enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li> The customer support is top notch, they don&#x27;t mess around.  </li>
            <li> The heat it experienced in shipping caused the Beard Balm to melt a little and some of the oils leaked out all over the other product in the envelope.</li>
            <li> this right here was worth money spent on.</li>
            <li> The product smells a little funky at first, but you get used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>

            <li> i highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> The Beard Balm was highly reviewed, so I took a leap and it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to any beard enthusiast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you pick up some BeardBalm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product comes highly recommended, and heartily approved by a man that has not cut nor trimmed his beard in almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any fellow bearders.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps keep his beard strong, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> The only other conditioner I&#x27;ve used is Honest Amish, and I have to say this stuff (Beard Balm) does a little better job of leaving the hairs smoother longer.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought I was gonna rail through this little tin can of balm real quick, but</li>
            <li> Other balms have too strong of a scent, or make my beard to shiny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smooths down all the fly away beard hairs and does make it feel a little smoother than without.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, it didn&#x27;t look like much in terms of amount but a little does go a long way and will last a good bit.</li>
            <li> My beard doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, as if I may have applied too much, rather it is soft and</li>
            <li> So far I really like the product.</li>
            <li> and it really feels soft to the touch and well nourished.</li>
            <li> makes my beard shiny and soft but leaves a bit of waxy residue which can be controlled by how much you put in your beard.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard much, much softer and alive looking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but after about 6 months of fairly frequent use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used few different beard balms, and while this one doesn&#x27;t help shape the beard as much as the others, it makes my beard and my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> The tin lasts me about three to four months with daily application and is worth every penny of the price paid.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my beard look magical....</li>
            <li> and my dad used Top Brass everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the most similar thing to human sebum, the natural conditioner for your beard, found in nature.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that it does have a powerful scent to it (or at least the kind I bought</li>
            <li> I have tried several different beard balms, and this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> Barely notice the spell its pretty neutral.</li>
            <li> The initial smell reminds me of an old gym, it is harder to apply out of the can than Honest Amish (which seems to melt easier).</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not used for a few days in a row, beard is noticeably dryer and more tangled.</li>
            <li> my nose, the overwhelming scent here is geranium oil and the lanolin, which is a fatty oil</li>
            <li> Love this stuff use it everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous for dry skin!!</li>
            <li> It smells like lemony honey but masculine enough and dissipates rather quickly like they alluded to.</li>
            <li> Some said the product didn&#x27;t smell quit right while others said it simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> go to your local pharmacy, get some regular old body lotion (green bottle vaseline with aloe smells great and applies without greasiness) and just use that.</li>
            <li> It actually has helped my facial hair grow longer, be softer, and generally look better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I am new to Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> Also live the smell of the balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to having a beard</li>
            <li> The smell is different but it&#x27;s definitely more pleasant than bad.</li>
            <li> The conditioners penetrate my coarse facial hair and make it feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> without it, my beard is super wiry and dry and flies out all over the place.  </li>
            <li> And they are totally active on social media and love to give shout outs to people.</li>
            <li> People have commented on the smell, but I actually find it to be a good smell, and my wife hasn&#x27;t complained at all.</li>
            <li> but so far it has given me a decent hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sent it subtle, the balm absorbs and applies nicely with no carry off onto clothes.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It does dry out and flake out of my beard fairly quickly in the day, though.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has kept my face itch free through a very dry cold winter and I have what I have been told is a pretty good beard.</li>
            <li> My beard feels very soft using this.  </li>
            <li> It smells very masculine.  </li>
            <li> I actually like how it smells very much.</li>
            <li> The packaging it came in was very professional.  </li>
            <li> it is very masculine.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy it; I wish it was a little less smoky/rubbery, but the overall scent is nice.</li>
            <li> It keeps my large beard soft ,neat and tidy, I&#x27;m addicted to the scent,and I even use some on my lips to keep them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for texture and control of my half-yeard, smells like muscles and chopping wood, last a long time, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm makes your beard soft, tame and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t as strong as I need it to be to keep those wild stray beard hairs down -</li>
            <li> This is actually the first beard balm I used, about 4 months in growing.</li>
            <li> It is made from natural oils and beeswax that comes from Michigan!</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this again, but it has left oily stains on the neck part of some of my favorite white shirts.</li>
            <li> Oh yea, and all natural ingredients made in &#x27;MERICA!</li>
            <li> I was totally against using this stuff at first.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using both cans, the other is larger and cost more</li>
            <li> My first balm I&#x27;ve tried and probably my last cause it does the job so well.</li>
            <li> Not only do I walk around with a soft, lush beard, I also smile with confidence knowing that I have eliminated any and all beard dandruff that used to scare off womenfolk.</li>
            <li> If you are man enough to grow a beard, you are man enough to bear the light, natural smell of this product.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> While smell is totally subjective, I can tell you that this captures the exact smell of my grandfather after a day of working on his industrial machinery out in his shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my first can, daily, for about 4 months now</li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle scent and leaves your beard feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Wish they had one with Peppermint, or some other clean smelling oils.</li>
            <li> As a newly bearded man I was looking for something to deal with wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> this stuff feels really good as long as you dont mind a bit of an oily feeling on your face (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant (faint) odor.</li>
            <li> It makes me think of an old barbershop from the 50&#x27;s, like I said originally it&#x27;s a very masculine scent which I grew to enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much more tame it looks!</li>
            <li> Sure, the smell was a little weird at first but by the 3rd day I was loving it, it&#x27;s earthy and manly.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other gents on here, I was a little unsure of the smell of the beard balm at first, but I have grown to like it.</li>
            <li> after using 3 other brands I pretty much stuck with beard balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It makes my beard hair less coarse and more soft to the touch</li>
            <li> Both products I&#x27;ve used certainly condition my beard, make it softer and such.</li>
            <li> Yep a little product from my finger to my hand, rub my hands together and then smooth on an in beard..  </li>
            <li> The only aspect I don&#x27;t like, is if you don&#x27;t rub the wax fully into a more liquid state, sometimes little clumps will show on the end of the hairs and can be unsightly, so always apply thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off putting at first , but you learn to injoy it after the first couple of treatments.</li>
            <li> Most beard balms are hard and do not work into your beard evenly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re serious about your beard and want something that won&#x27;t weigh it down, just leave it shiny, soft and smelling great, you have to treat yourself to Beard Balm guys.</li>
            <li> It has a better hold than other balms that I&#x27;ve tired and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, makes my beard soft and keeps it from looking all crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now about 2.5&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; long and can get pretty wild at times.</li>
            <li> Clearly, they put some research into this product.  </li>
            <li> Does not help beard grow and only leaves it really shiny</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft , shinny and keeps those unrulie whiskers in check.</li>
            <li> The all natural balm was created to condition the beards of men, well, and women if they so choose.</li>
            <li> And the masculine scent of this balm is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If for some reason you feel this happened, then you simply used too much.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not greasy at all and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> It tames my beard the day I use it and keeps it soft for a couple days after.</li>
            <li> It really does make the beard quite a bit softer and easier to manage, especially after sleeping on it all night.</li>
            <li> so I looked like a fourteen year old girl with a sea urchin on my face.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of this balm, and it keeps my beard soft, moisturized, and controlled.  </li>
            <li> Think of a lumberjack with a torn flannel shirt, holding a chainsaw will riding a  wild bull in the snow.</li>
            <li> It has also made my beard quite soft, which my girlfriend loves.</li>
            <li> Now my beard is soft and shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my epic beard epic.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard feeling as soft as Panda bear.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it lasts through much of the day, and it provides a moderate hold for unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> it made my beard soft and silky.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what my wife says :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and maybe one or two knots that comb or brush out with no issue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer itchy and is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way and it leaves my beard nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have an almost completely gray beard and it didn&#x27;t discolor it and could reign in those wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> My brother said, this is absolutely the only product out, that has made his Beard.</li>
            <li> The only beard conditioner I&#x27;ve really used, but I see no reason to look into others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Beard Balm daily; my beard is now capable of transcending from metal shows into meeting rooms.</li>
            <li> Started using this balm for my 3 week old beard, can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s going to continue to work well as my beard grows</li>
            <li> I ordered this Beard balm as a gift for my brother who has a wild unruly beard.  </li>
            <li> Been using on my 8 month old beard.</li>
            <li> I must say that I initially chose this product over some of its competitors because I, much like this product, was made in Detroit.</li>
            <li> When something is chemical/medicine smelling you tend to get irritated when it&#x27;s directly under your nose.</li>
            <li> That may be why it&#x27;s so wild.</li>
            <li> I said how much the description cracked me up, but the back is even cuter and funnier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service is spot-on, and shipping is seamless.</li>
            <li> it does what i need to to do for my beard and that is make it soft and managable.....</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your beard and underlying skin really soft.</li>
            <li> so I can keep that professional look with my beard.</li>
            <li> Not too loud ...</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard soft while controlling any stragglers or rebellious hairs.</li>
            <li> My beard is a bit unruly, especially on the cheeks, and this balm really helps with combing and keeping the hairs in line.  </li>
            <li> Returning and buying directly from beard balm.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with my order through Amazon and the folks at Beard Balm took care of me directly and promptly.</li>
            <li> it is balmy....</li>
            <li> , the ingredients are all natural and non-exhaustible for all you environment conscious peoples.</li>
            <li> As far as conditioning the hair, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> My beard is now soft to the touch and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The balm makes it soft as babies hair.  </li>
            <li> How soft my beard was was the talk of the night.</li>
            <li> I tried using some standard conditioners and while they made the hair softer, it was still very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> it has a natural smell without being too earthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get it again to keep my beard soft and my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I know he is going to be using this everyday since it makes his face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is masculine, but not overpowering, and can be calming.</li>
            <li> I use it in addition to a natural shampoo and conditioner for beards.</li>
            <li> Fast forward almost 4 months later</li>
            <li> the skin never dried out.</li>
            <li> was also a fan of how minimalistic the ingredients were, and the fact they were all natural.</li>
            <li> The smell of Beard Balm is really masculine.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I used it to shape my curly beard and keep it soft.</li>
            <li> Im 19 years old</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t feel complete if I do not smell it.  </li>
            <li> Bonus points for being all natural and made in Detroit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how neat and controlled it looked.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like a wild man.</li>
            <li> Does soften my beard &amp; my wife can tell when I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days because my beard is more coarse and wild.</li>
            <li> No itch, soft bread now.  </li>
            <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test of my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to say the least.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling soft</li>
            <li> It keeps it manageable and soft, isn&#x27;t overly scented -</li>
            <li> if that doesn&#x27;t sell you on how soft it makes it, I don&#x27;t know what will.  </li>
            <li> While I am unsure if I purchased this during a sale of some sort, a 46% price increase over 6 weeks is unexpected.</li>
            <li> I use it after showering and it keeps my beard hairs soft and in place.</li>
            <li> My wife refuses to go near my face when I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is quite coarse and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this product will continue to allow my beard to reach epic lengths.</li>
            <li> Used it twice, so far.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four weeks now and my beard stays soft</li>
            <li> But overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> ; I have very curly facial hair and this</li>
            <li> We are talking about a silky soft, majestically flowing beard...</li>
            <li> It is soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frizzed out, wild, and probably too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now it shines and is soft.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the smell is gone by the time I drive to work, and after a few weeks I stopped noticing the smell.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in how soft, and manageable</li>
            <li> also appreciate that this product is manufactured in Detroit, which is near where I grew up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would be too oily but after a good couple of gentle rubbings</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing facial hair, yet this product has made my baby beard much more manageable.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> hair beard brush.he loves the smell too and has very rysensitive skin and will breAk out to most any product you put on his farce.</li>
            <li> showed my boss and she bought some for her bf, she loved the natural smell.cant go wrong beard balm and its imported from Detroit</li>
            <li> When unruly fans, faulty tour buses, and drunk carnies at the county fair aren&#x27;t threatening your life, irresponsible pyrotechnics are setting your face on fire.</li>
            <li> Great balm, I melt it between my fingers and rub it into my beard following a shower, it creates just enough cohesion to brush it down and it stays down.</li>
            <li> We love that it&#x27;s a Detroit made product, we like to support local small businesses, wherever we live.</li>
            <li> , then pretty much said WTF, easy to try and according to reviews</li>
            <li> But it only took one application upon my return to get my beard right back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard pretty soft in dry climates as well.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of trying out other balms, so I will likely have more to add later.</li>
            <li> can say that this balm is not like the type of wax you would use to style a crazy mustache, but it is perfect for any other application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands as well as homemade balms, but always come back to this genuine product.</li>
            <li> It does smell like bees wax (not unpleasant), but as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply the smell goes away shortly after application.</li>
            <li> As men, we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to perfumey type of scents that can be sweet or relatively bland so that women won&#x27;t be &amp;</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell like they say a little bit of balm goes a long way .I</li>
            <li> Long lasting, the can is ample enough to last many moonturns, and smells of man.  </li>
            <li> It made my beard SUPER SOFT and also has a slight styling ability.</li>
            <li> As mad as I am, still need this stuff to make my beard happy.  </li>
            <li> Have this to my husband for Christmas and he&#x27;s excited to user this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s blended well with other flavors to give it a Manly, earthy aroma (but not dirty hippie) and has no obnoxious perfume smell period.  </li>
            <li> While I absolutely love my husband&#x27;s beard (seriously we have an agreement</li>
            <li> and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not a fragrance and once applied disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> The stuff works well, only giving 4* because I feel the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this USA made product to anyone with any amount of facial hair!</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for the right balm for a long time, and finally found it with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the beard over the long term.</li>
            <li> Now I think my only complaint now is that so many ladies want to feel how soft my beard is.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and agreeable, and I usually don&#x27;t go for fragranced products</li>
            <li> With a quick trim with hair clippers and a little beard balm</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference in the days that I use it, and I started getting compliments at work on my new found furry beauty.</li>
            <li> only is the itching gone, my new found beard looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> My beard used to be as dry as the Mojave, and at any moment an errant spark could have lit the whole thing ablaze.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to take their beard to the next level.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so you are really getting your money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Really helps tame down my beard and leaves it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> When my under-beard facial hair started becoming frustrated this year, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do.</li>
            <li> Left my boyfriend&#x27;s beard feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews said, the smell is something to get used to at first.</li>
            <li> however mine are very stringy and loose and needed tending all the time.  </li>
            <li> First, a thyroid condition causes dry skin, second my job requires a lot of cleaning and tons of hand washing.</li>
            <li> I tend to get pretty dry skin and facial hair and this product has taken care of both those issues.</li>
            <li> beard, long may it live!</li>
            <li> I actually went to a fast food restaurant and there was a young kid with a goatee that actually complimented me on my beard and gave me an extra scoop of food!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can leave a bit of residue behind if you use too much, which is easy, since it only takes about a dime-sized amount to get desired</li>
            <li> It never overpowers you competing with the fifteen-year old next store dowsed in a gallon of aftershave before his first prom like some other products.</li>
            <li> the beard balm makes my beard super relaxed, way less wirey, and smells terrific..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so go lightly, rub it between your hands until it melts, then apply.  </li>
            <li> This can take the most drab sad and dry looking beard and give it a whole new life.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong, this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Balms in general help keep his skin conditioned below and the strays from getting too prickly.</li>
            <li> It is slightly strange that Beard Balm decided to go with Lanolin instead of the more commonly used shea butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to calm the wild hairs.</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredient list includes essential oils and beeswax.  </li>
            <li> Lasted longer than I expected considering you don&#x27;t need much for your beard.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m old enough to be a gramps (and my beard is white), I have started again but this time it&#x27;s no longer wild and woolly because I have discovered beard maintenance, part of which is this beard balm.</li>
            <li> Do you want your display of manliness that is your facial hair to be soft and shiny?</li>
            <li> Instead it simply suggests a natural hint of cultivation</li>
            <li> Definitely helps control wild beard hair.</li>
            <li> I was eager to peel it out of the box and apply it to the 6-week extension of my face that I am currently calling \\&quot;my natural wolfman.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My beard is beyond soft now, my girlfriend never complains about it anymore as she did before I began using this product and conditioning my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Upon attempting to give my masculine patronage to a local tavern, I was mistaken for a vagrant and promptly asked to leave.  </li>
            <li> This was a low point in my life, but the epic levels of testosterone coursing through my veins ensured that defeat was not an option.  </li>
            <li> The people who have invaded my personal space in an attempt to grab ahold of my whiskers have all commented on how soft it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m goin&#x27; back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li> This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected</li>
            <li> The beard balm just made my beard like an Afro, not very manageable unless Much product was used.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews and to be honest I am skeptical about product reviews in general.</li>
            <li> It will coat your comb like paint coats a brush, so if you want a thin coat, brush more than you dip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have roughly a 10inch beard so needless to say when I wake up it&#x27;s everywhere, but just a quick brush &amp; a little BeardBalm &amp; my beard is neat, controlled, &amp; looking good.</li>
            <li> One tin has lasted me 3 months, and it&#x27;s only about half done, and my beard is pretty epic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves my fairly long beard soft, manageable, and looking clean and slick, but not shiny or gunky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, very faint.  </li>
            <li> I find the smell to be fine and my only complaint is that it can get a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is very natural and kind of eucalyptus/camphor -ish, but subtle if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount (very little).</li>
            <li> Received my second can and it came in a nice small yellow padded envelope, inside a larger box (with other items I ordered).  </li>
            <li> One of my main reasons for growing my beard out initially was because I started getting dry skin on my lower face.</li>
            <li> But the balm can actually wrangle it back under control and make it cuddlably soft.  </li>
            <li> , my only problem now is that I&#x27;m constantly running my fingers through my beard because it feels so soft</li>
            <li> Upon opening the can, the smell was reminiscent of an old gym - that musky and manly odor mixed with a hint of rust and sweat.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is not waxy, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, and it&#x27;s produced in small batches in the town of my longtime-favorite hockey team - the Detroit Redwings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin under said mane is not nearly as dry anymore now too.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only about half way through my first can - after 2 months.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better in other areas but its hard for me to quantify.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I use it everyday to tame my beard.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I must go carve a canoe... out of a tree that fell to the ground at the near sight of my glorious beard.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the softness of my beard after use, and I will keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s offered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft all day long</li>
            <li> It makes my beard soft, shiny, and even hides some of the grey hairs.</li>
            <li> I just got the balm, and applied my first round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that makes it worth it or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my beard out a few times but this is the first time that I have done it with the help from Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> After the first few uses my bearded looked healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell was the first thing that killed me.</li>
            <li> I have a full, thick beard.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a thick, full beard</li>
            <li> I have noticed a large increase in black hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Softens wily facial growth and provides a subtle shine that feels smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Really calmed down my beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and I enjoy the faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product, and it makes his beard so much nicer and much less prickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to and it has made my beard a lot less unruly.</li>
            <li> All my previous attempts at growing a beard ended when the itching got to be too much.</li>
            <li> My beard is only about 1-inch long, but I have to keep it well groomed for professional reasons.</li>
            <li> I conducted some internet research and saw a few positive reviews for Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have had nothing but positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product I actually like the smell, but I find it is a little expensive for me as my beard is fairly long</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, it&#x27;s just a subtle smell that goes away after an hour.</li>
            <li> I have not use it everyday, but am close to running out and will certainly place another order when I do.</li>
            <li> I just take a little bit out, rub it together in my hands, work it into my beard, &amp; I&#x27;m ready to conquer the world.</li>
            <li> I notice that if I put too much in or don&#x27;t massage it in well that I get little drops of conditioner in my beard.  </li>
            <li> I can live with the other, it smells like I have been working on a machine or something</li>
            <li> It really helps to tame a dry beard and wild hairs.</li>
            <li> I live in the city, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like a campfire (like other brands of balm) unless I&#x27;m actually camping, but</li>
            <li> A little bit will go a long way, it just takes more comb strokes to evenly apply small amounts.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of how it smells, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty grizzly, coarse beard that is pretty hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Just the right consistency, not runny and not too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, really: It&#x27;s not greasy, allows for a little shaping but doesn&#x27;t get stiff like stache wax, has a pleasantly subtle smell, and my wife has been turning away women who wanna run their fingers through my beard&#x27;s illustriousness in droves at all</li>
            <li> It gives my dark beard a little shine and since I started using it a few months ago, my beard is definitely softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of it&#x27;s ability to tame my scraggly beard into submission while also making it much softer.  </li>
            <li> Stuff really is liquid gold and has helped tame my mane.</li>
            <li> I just finished a can and ordered a couple other brands to explore my options, but so far it&#x27;s not even a contest.</li>
            <li> As noted by some other reviewers, the smell is &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; and my beard does feel oily rather than soft.</li>
            <li> It is clearly obvious that this balm get my beard shinier and softer, last but not the least i really like how it smell !</li>
            <li> i appreciate that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, unlike shampoo and other hair care products.  </li>
            <li> As a man, I do not want to smell like anything other than my natural smell.</li>
            <li> but no matter how I apply this I&#x27;m not satisfied enough to use very often.</li>
            <li> far as balms go, this one is slighty above average</li>
            <li> I really like randomly smelling honey throughout the first couple minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty big beard as you can see in the picture provided, but I only had to use a very small amount of this product.</li>
            <li> Only after trying a few other products first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a prime choice for this type of product and is high in fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I use a small brush to comb it in..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used beard  oil in the past, but I much prefer the beard balm after trying this product.  </li>
            <li> A small dab in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and apply to your beard and the gentle breeze of beard balm goes to work,</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any man with a beard, short or long.</li>
            <li> Long story short: if you have an allergy or aversion to lanolin or sheep&#x27;s wool, this product is not for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So its not great for holding your beard in place (though I have a full beard)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell per say, just unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It make by beard softer and got all the frizzy strays to go down but with a natural look.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s going to be hard to get through this whole tin of balm before I bail on it for something different</li>
            <li> managed to make it manageable enough for me to grow a beard that is now almost five inches long now, and it doesn&#x27;t look like a bush!</li>
            <li> but you learn something new everyday.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only (very very minor) issue.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help the hair, but it seems to reduce the amount of dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty subtle and doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard really soft and gives it a slight shine.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the smell, it is neither offensive nor strong in presence.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not manly, certainly not the smell of someone with a beard big enough to justify using a balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same with this stuff except now my neck is covered in grease which I can feel during the day - not a particularly pleasant feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Indian guy with a rather thick full black beard.</li>
            <li> I may try a competing brand due to a larger size for a similar price.</li>
            <li> My beard grows very wild but with beard balm I can tame it</li>
            <li> I noticed my beard looks fuller and softer and gives the beard a little shine to it, makes the beard come alive.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a little bit directly to the skin there and it takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my beard shiny and soft, and gives it a little bit of hold for stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a particularly snaggly beard (which I love) but hate to comb.</li>
            <li> It went on quite easily, and didn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> I think if it works as well as I have found it to, Beard Balm will be a LONG TIME product of mine.</li>
            <li> produce itself goes a long way; a dab will do.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re a rough looking Navy Seal blending in with the locals, a &amp;#34;Brawny&amp;#34; spokesmodel selling paper towels, or a competitor heading to some international beard tournament, Beard Balm is for you.</li>
            <li> It has a medicine smell like neosporin that sticks with you all day long.</li>
            <li> The balm is a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I have a rather long beard.</li>
            <li> As a long time hair farmer, I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> beard is fairly long at about 4 inches, so I usually dip the comb twice but be careful not to use too much Balm or your beard will be shiny and have a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Just long enough.&lt;br /&gt;(Mic drop)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work its a waste of money and time unless you have a beard and want to  make it soft</li>
            <li> Received Product earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The smell, as others noted, was a bit getting used to, however, now I don&#x27;t notice it and never really bothered me, just different.  </li>
            <li> How long does it take for the product to show that it is working?</li>
            <li> And for how long a tin lasted me it&#x27; put me on the fence of wanting to continue purchase.</li>
            <li> My beard has gotten long and can become quite unruly.  </li>
            <li> The list of ingredients isn&#x27;t long.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all beards.&lt;br /&gt;i plan on continuing to use Beardbalm For as long as i can...</li>
            <li> I have a long goatee and had split ends.</li>
            <li> I was running an untamed beard about 4-5 inches long</li>
            <li> It goes quite a long ways, even on a bushy beard.</li>
            <li> Aroma has been mentioned as a possible problem but for me I never really noticed</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t recommend this as something for long term use, the cons outweigh the pros for me</li>
            <li> how long will it take I bought this in September. ...</li>
            <li> Will try a few other beard balms and revisit this review to update.&lt;br /&gt;About the balm - Decent smell.</li>
            <li> you just wiped down a pizza from a mall food court with your bare hands.</li>
            <li> It keeps my long beard soft and tame.</li>
            <li> my beard feels so soft and keeps my hairs tame</li>
            <li> I apply it every day after a shower and use a boars hair brush to tame my wild beard.</li>
            <li> To sum it up: It keeps your beard soft and tame.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for something to make my beard soft and to tame it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay greasy like some other balms and doesn&#x27;t wash off the second</li>
            <li> Use this often, typically daily or every other day, depending upon my mood or how my beard is looking that day.</li>
            <li> The 1.6oz container goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s currently trying a different brand that has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> I gave it only 3 stars due to the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product is cheaper than the other 2 by a couple bucks and is prime which is a big pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only thing that takes this to a 4 compared to the 5 i gave the other two is the smell.</li>
            <li> Do not let other users&#x27; reviews about the smell hold you back from purchasing Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what I do have is exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li> Before I got it, my beard was dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> His beard was dry and this didn&#x27;t change that.</li>
            <li> You can apply this to a dry beard or a damp beard.</li>
            <li> Softens whiskers, relieves dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> I apply it after I shower and dry the pride that is my beard and it</li>
            <li> It also helps reduce itching from dry skin under all the growth.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry beard skin and itch at bay.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out like it use to</li>
            <li> Even in this dry South Korean winter.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried out quite a few different beard oils, waxes, and balms.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t detect any beeswax smell and it doesn&#x27;t give my beard that characteristic &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; hold that comes with beeswax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently grown out my beard to the point where I need to control a few unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to beards</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not new to being a man.</li>
            <li> Loose hairs are put in line, and the itch of a dry, scraggly face is</li>
            <li> This may be my fault due to using too much or using it in the morning rather than at night and letting it dry, but still a negative effect.</li>
            <li> I would anticipate one tin to last an average person 4-6 months depending on the size of the foliage.    </li>
            <li> small amount makes my beard feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> i mentioned that I&#x27;d been using Beard Balm for the past week, and he commented on how he used it when he had a beard, saying that it made it soft and majestic.</li>
            <li> The box was about 7&amp;#34; long, 5&amp;#34; wide, and 3&amp;#34; tall.  </li>
            <li> but am kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not to mention its not very costly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging from Amazon was for the first time, not great.</li>
            <li> And with a short beard a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> i recently decided to grow my beard for a year without trimming and it didnt take long before it got a little unkempt.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 months now and still have about half a can left after daily use.</li>
            <li> I am not going to be a jerk and say the name of my brand because it isn&#x27;t kosher to steal sales that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are nothing special compared to anything else on the market, so really you have to base it on smell.</li>
            <li> I am new to the art of beard growing and my beard grows quite slowly.</li>
            <li> I apply just as I&#x27;m getting out of a steamy shower while the hair follicles are open and slightly damp.</li>
            <li> random questioning of female friends didn&#x27;t express any opinion that my beard smelled funny.  </li>
            <li> I bought a can of beard balm, and within ten days my goatee was noticeably longer and fuller and less tangled.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a lesser lemon smell, but my girlfriend prefers this over my previous balm which she said smelled like licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The container did start to rust around the inside edges when it melted and got a bit messy, but I&#x27;ll totally buy him another one when he runs out (lasts long, use sparingly like palmade)</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is that it seems to wear off after half a day or so.</li>
            <li> it was still rough in dry</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old now, and I have watched it slowly turn grey with the passing years.</li>
            <li> I normally use a little every day to tame my fly-aways that I&#x27;m too stubborn to trim.</li>
            <li> #34;offended&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is very very masculine to say the least.</li>
            <li> My beard is really curly and unruly and it did very little to tame it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not true anymore, but it&#x27;s an entirely different product review if I were to make scalp-cream shame-based purchases).</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the scent being strange or off putting, but I found it quite pleasing.</li>
            <li> I can play &amp;#34;Sharp Dressed Man&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Cheap Sunglasses&amp;#34; with confidence, and the other members of La Strange have noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a pretty bushy beard and beard balm allows me to tame the bushy down enough to look presentable without looking overly manicured, and the smell is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought my Beard Balm about three months into growing my beard when it was starting to get a little gnarly.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it feels a little oily if you touch it but</li>
            <li> If you are just cultivating a little scruff or  encouraging a massive beard-god altar on your face, this product is</li>
            <li> He only needed a little bit.  </li>
            <li> actually keeps those little beasts tamed and straighter than tgey would be without any product.</li>
            <li> You really only need a little to get the job done.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, the beard is noticeably softer and lays a little differently on my face.  </li>
            <li> Many people seem to be put off by the smell, but to me it is not that bad</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried to grow and maintain facial hair until a few months ago.</li>
            <li> It also gives your beard a shine almost like a wet look but doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a glob of grease</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give 4 starts because I expected the blam to be like others I have used.</li>
            <li> Having accumulated a minimal amount of stubble everywhere my goatee wasn&#x27;t, I began to peruse the &amp;#34;beard product section&amp;#34; here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> the odor took some getting used to but not much.</li>
            <li> wide.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let that be a deal breaker though since the scent only lasts a few minutes and will probably be gone well before you head out of the door to start your day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It smells(good), don&#x27;t rub too much or you&#x27;ll get tired of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;*Lastly, buy a Boars hair brush.</li>
            <li> It smells like I&#x27;m applying a product designed for my grandmother and not a modern bearded gentleman.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and Im definitely be buying more!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting my second round of Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Now maybe I am partial because I am from Michigan</li>
            <li> Am not a very hairy person</li>
            <li> Maybe this is not really meant to do just that</li>
            <li> The can is made of tin and will rust if you get it too wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a beard before and started one a few months back.  </li>
            <li> , I never really noticed an improvement in the feel of my beard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband a few months back as he started growing his beard out.</li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t have to smell it for the roughly 6 hours it takes for the smell to wear off.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problem opening the replaced container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been roughly around a week that I have been beard balming</li>
            <li> I was getting flaky skin irritations and dander that had me reconsidering my aged beard of wisdom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is quite rough and Beard Balm has no problem softening and conditioning it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I traveled to Austin TX for Come and Shave it #9, a beard competition hosted by the Austin Facial Hair club.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had absolutely no issues with it</li>
            <li> Few people understand the dangers a tribute artist faces on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I could only worry that the balm would be too thick for my now short (trimmed under an inch) beard.</li>
            <li> It kept my beard soft no matter how thick I let it grow.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a huge difference overall.</li>
            <li> But alas, my macho mansage was wild and barbarous.  </li>
            <li> also works good as kiss repellent because its so stinky</li>
            <li> In the past I would simply wash and condition it like the hair on my head,but always had issues with dry skin and flaking.</li>
            <li> Not overbearing and certainly not feminine.</li>
            <li> I found it similar to car grease or plain vaseline.  </li>
            <li> The unpleasant smell was so strong that I had to return it.</li>
            <li> On average I think I had to use it four times a day or my beard would dry out</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m given 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the fact it took a few days to get used to the scent.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to any bearded fella who is looking to tame his face.</li>
            <li> This balm definitely helps tame it into a semblance of respectability and professionalism.  </li>
            <li> For anyone looking to add natural moisture  to beard, I seriously recommend this product....</li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as you are overzealous or have a 5ft long beard this small 1.6oz tin lasts ages, so for $16 its a steal.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not saying this product claims to be a fire retardant, but it did make my beard softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> scent is very pine-ish and lemony, but very subtle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it but for smoothness you could probably buy any leave in conditioner and get the same effect for a little less money.</li>
            <li> When applying, remember that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a product where a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and lasts for hours on end.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> others have described, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard looking sharp.</li>
            <li> Provided you don&#x27;t go overboard, your face and/or beard aren&#x27;t going to get all greasy/oily and gross.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is required, otherwise your beard can become over shiny/wet looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, from other balms to beard oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike some other products I have tried that seem to attempt to bathe you in the smell of spearmint gum, orange juice, or in one case cotton candy</li>
            <li> Simply applying a small amount to a finger by &#x27;digging&#x27; in the balm and then rubbing it between my hands is all the prep needed to use this product on my burly man-scruff.</li>
            <li> This morning was like any other morning.</li>
            <li> i use this beard balm about 4 days of the week, using oils the other times.</li>
            <li> and if you have not been disappointed you should try it and see how much better</li>
            <li> The 1-Star is due to the way this one (1) item was packaged and sent to me.  </li>
            <li> if the smell is a difference maker go w. one of the other 2.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty skeptical about whether or not this stuff would work, but I have to say it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Though the smell didn&#x27;t bother me like some other reviewers, it did ruin the collars of a couple of my dress shirts, leaving a greasy ring that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
            <li> After about a week of liberal use to help nourish and soften the scrub, I now only use a small pea sized</li>
            <li> /&gt;My other gripe is about the tin that the product comes in.</li>
            <li> I may try other products</li>
            <li> The smell is like any other hair product...</li>
            <li> Fellas, there is no better product for your illustrious facial hair.</li>
            <li> Cured my beard dandruff and keepsake beard looking sharp.</li>
            <li> Wish they would come out with some other scents.</li>
            <li> He prefers it to other products he&#x27;s tried, and so do I.</li>
            <li> Using a bit everyday or every other day goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The hairs are.stronger and longer than dome of my other beard buddies.</li>
            <li> I decided to try other products when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed and love it.  </li>
            <li> ; smell than some of the other citrusy ones.</li>
            <li> other words, if you are at this point in life where you are growing a beard</li>
            <li> My beard was suffering due to the humidity and extreme heat and weather changes here in Florida.</li>
            <li> but I like other products for a nicer scent.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how this compares to other products</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I tried other beard products and</li>
            <li> Order arrived quicker than I expected!  </li>
            <li> I have been using oils for a long time and had little to no success.  </li>
            <li> You will waste less balm and the balm still in the can stays neat and flat.</li>
            <li> Im new to the beard product game and a friend told me about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little Beard Balm every day for the past few months, and my beard has completely stopped itching.  </li>
            <li> Can feel a little bit greasy if over applied, so remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I just wet it and rubbed a little balm in</li>
            <li> My advice if you do buy it, is to use a little after a shower while your beard is still wet.</li>
            <li> Like others here, I recommend putting it in while your beard is still a little wet from the shower.  </li>
            <li> Little oily if you are a beard fidgeter, but thats expected when you put oil in your beard.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks of using it the tin started to rust which makes it really hard to open.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that its a little pricey for a small tin</li>
            <li> Unlike other beard products I&#x27;ve used this one usually lasts very long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is not with the product.</li>
            <li> Having discovered Beard Balm, a self-described badass product from Detroit (which could totally use everyone&#x27;s support), I had to get some for my husband to at least try it out,</li>
            <li> has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the common talks about any leave in conditioner for facial hair is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but whatever they put in this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> The only negative I saw in the reviews I read discussed the smell of Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I went so long without</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually recommend that you only use a balm if your beard is quite young (say, less than 6 weeks) since the main benefit to a balm is that it conditions the face and reduces the terrible itchy beard phase.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it arrived opened.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the odor.</li>
            <li> I would rate this balm 2 stars based on smell, but using lanolin as the base is a more gutsy choice than others and this balm might provide additional benefits if used with a shea butter based balm in rotation--I bumped it up to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> but I hate touching my beard all day because my hands get greasy and beeswaxy.</li>
            <li> that you out down the razor, grow a beard and buy and use this product...</li>
            <li> I have trimmed it down</li>
            <li> It would stick out and look all unkempt, but now when I comb it down, it stays.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t put it down</li>
            <li> I have struggled to keep stray hair down for awhile now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and was given this for a gift, but don&#x27;t have a beard...except ya know, down there.</li>
            <li> just cut down a tree and built a cabin with it while I tamed a wolverine.</li>
            <li> My beard can wield an axe to help chop down trees, flannel not included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Bald Eagles swoop down and adorn my face.   </li>
            <li> Between being a mom, volunteering, working in a kitchen and being a CNA...hand washing, sanitizing and extreme dryness is par for the course!</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is I&#x27;ve added time to my lean and mean grooming regimen (no hair on my head means no hair product needed).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found the smell to be overpowering or unpleasant, and it dissipates rather quickly after applied.</li>
            <li> Usually in the winter I have itchy dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find myself wanting to re-apply it when I get home, and sometimes it seems like it makes my beard a little flaky when it dries, but to be fair, that might just be that I am disgusting.    </li>
            <li> still feels conditioned, whereas with the other product I&#x27;ve used it had to be everyday</li>
            <li> I have had some time to grow a manly beard and also compare it with a few other beard balms.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good, but don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either</li>
            <li> I have a small beard that is just starting out (about a month into it) and usually it starts itching or feels like hay</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used coconut oil, which didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well, if that&#x27;s the word for it.  </li>
            <li> The Beard Balm can is probably less than 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Does have a slight antiseptic smell though.</li>
            <li> and I saw results less than a week after using it.</li>
            <li> Overall, the scent is subtle, and my wife didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard feeling softer, and with a slight glow.</li>
            <li> I wish the cost was less.</li>
            <li> and brushing seems easier with less tangles and pulling.</li>
            <li> but it also smells odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to apply that way, and you use less of the product.</li>
            <li> In the four months that I have had my tin, I have used about half of it.</li>
            <li> My previous review:  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using Beard Balm they have been much less of an issue (although they do still happen from time-to-time.)</li>
            <li> The tin lasted me about a month and a half, and I am considering reordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say they have about 15% beeswax in the mix, possibly less.</li>
            <li> I probably am going to look for another brand with a less pungent smell.</li>
            <li> As a newly bearded person, I was looking for something to soften it down, make it less itchy and keep those random hairs in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps keep your beard shaped and conditioned without leaving a greesey mess.  </li>
            <li> At first I was afraid.</li>
            <li> This stuff turned my beard from a stinking mess of hair into a well coiffed set of impervious chin armor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will leave you a stinking greasy mess, i dont know how anyone could stand smelling like this all the time.</li>
            <li> i also use for my mustache, they&#x27;re also works and get in thick and long.</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and the product helps protect a beard from the cold dry winters we have up here.</li>
            <li> A slight hint of honey scent will linger a little while after as you go about your day.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little odd though,</li>
            <li> They were wondering where a certain place was and while they said they didn&#x27;t want a ride (which left me a tad disappointed), they did offer me two cans of this Beard Balm as a way to thank me for the help and to promote the product.</li>
            <li> Opposed to beard oil, which soaks in quite quickly, this product remains &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; throughout the day (which I don&#x27;t consider to be a bad thing).</li>
            <li> I have a curly, thick, and sometimes dry beard</li>
            <li> balm really helps to keep stray hairs down and devolumize my beard, avoiding that awkward puffy beard look.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab, rub it in your hand/fingers, run it through your beard/mustache and viola.</li>
            <li> It has little smell, if I had to place any</li>
            <li> but it caused him to break out a little around the mouth</li>
            <li> After my wife convinced me to grow my beard out, it started to get a little &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; searched online for a product and found this.</li>
            <li> I also like to apply a little to each finger and work it into my mustache to help moisterize and train it as well.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little overpowering and not my taste subjectively.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of control, but it does soften my beard and make it sit a little nicer.</li>
            <li> It does have a little odor to it.</li>
            <li> Adds a little volume.</li>
            <li> I was using coconut oil, but it did little to control my mane.  </li>
            <li> It just took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> A little turns my comb into a friend, not weapon to be feared.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> All the little hairs submit to this goo over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may seem like a little thing but it does when I choose products.</li>
            <li> A little bit of product goes along way.</li>
            <li> Scent takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other options are like</li>
            <li> I use a little every day.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of an oily/waxy scent.</li>
            <li> I brush it in with a little eyebrow comb I stole from my wife.  </li>
            <li> A little bit to greasy</li>
            <li> The oils help soften and condition your beard while the little bit of wax helps with control and training thought beard how to lay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> your beard may be a little greasy feeling for a few hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> but this smooths it down like a charm!  </li>
            <li> My beard is at that awkward stage of growing and doing whatever the hell it wants...</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> it make you beard irresistible to women and make grizzly bears offer you a firm handshake?&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This product will not manage your beard like a heavy wax</li>
            <li> i use it during the winter when i&#x27;m dried out, but not during the summer</li>
            <li> forgot to bring it with me while traveling and didn&#x27;t use it for a few days</li>
            <li> I tried a few difference applications styles since it is a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> maybe not for everyday use and not for a scent for everyone</li>
            <li> A bit greasy, but I might be applying too heavily.</li>
            <li> However the lid was off and product may have dried out.</li>
            <li> Started using BeardBalm last week after having the privilege of meeting the people behind it at a coffee bar in Austin, Texas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months.</li>
            <li> The tin lid was under the tin can and looked like someone had took a few finger</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;d do without a can.  </li>
            <li> Hoping that this product may help me in a few problem areas of my beard still in growth mood...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have been growing beards for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time reading all these reviews, be a man and buy Beard Balm...</li>
            <li> My Beard Balm came in a few days ago, and every day since I&#x27;ve put about a dime sized amount in</li>
            <li> I let my beard grow for a few months, but I had no idea how to care for it.</li>
            <li> I bought beard balm a few months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I received my beard balm but it came missing the lid.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard from feeling dried out and keeps everything in place.</li>
            <li> I apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> I start crying because the amount of freedom is over whelming, and thank God for this county, the U.S. Marine Corps, Ed Sheeran, Bald Eagles, and Made in Detroit Beard Balm.   </li>
            <li> I used it and never had any of the itch that stopped me from growing a beard before in the few times I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm for a few months now</li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, though I&#x27;ve gotten used to and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore, but some of the ladies like it.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent though.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is sticky and provides some control and hold to your hair, helps tame those random wild hairs and keeps you looking sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other creams are just too hard, over priced or just plain didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had a little left in a can and started using this stuff during the winter, as my beard has been getting dry from being out in the elements all day, and it helps battle the cold wind to block out the dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too stiff to rub in to your beard.</li>
            <li> However, after using it the smell grew on me and is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I decided to try beard balm to tame my beard and it worked.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep my beard tame even in my travels in the deserts of Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> i bought beard balm to try and tame it a bit</li>
            <li> I have no doubt this product will help keep my skin well-conditioned beneath the curl of the burl, and will do well to tame my beast.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to tame it</li>
            <li> Being in Afghanistan, I needed something to help tame the ever glorious gift of the gods to man, my beard.  </li>
            <li> It helps tame fly-away hairs in your flavor savor and does it in a not too greasy way.</li>
            <li> It helps tame my beard as well as make it look well</li>
            <li> I tried Beard Balm as a way to tame the &amp;#34;afro&amp;#34; effect I was getting while growing out my beard.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package and I saw the product and how small the little jar was  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a bit overpowering at first, but not because it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> only real complaint was with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I usually apply the balm after a shower once it has mainly dried.  </li>
            <li> my beard usually grows in with a few patches.</li>
            <li> * research in finding product that would moisturize, calm and outright tame my angry beard and angry beard skin.</li>
            <li> I use it down there, you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> use VERY VERY LITTLE.</li>
            <li> If your new to the beard balm game you need to pick you up some of this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> Past week or two beard was getting scruffy looking.</li>
            <li> No more frizzy ends going every which way.  </li>
            <li> I have been growing a beard every year for the past decade.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it after I shower.</li>
            <li> Support small business and feel rad doing so.</li>
            <li> A lot of punch is packed into a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just rub a small amount between the palms and apply.</li>
            <li> A small application goes along way.</li>
            <li> I normally like unscented beard products, but this one has a very faint citrus smell, which I believe is from the lemon oil used in the making of it.</li>
            <li> I cant get past the smell</li>
            <li> His beard was immediately &amp;#34;contained&amp;#34; when the product was applied, which means he didn&#x27;t have random hairs going in different directions.  </li>
            <li> I usually regret letting my beard grow after about a week.</li>
            <li> feels like its doing something, not sure though</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in quality of my beard and my girlfriend personally enjoys the faint smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering, and when you happen to get a small bit in your mouth, it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming or perfume</li>
            <li> Serving me well thus far during a cold Chicago winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only knock I&#x27;ve got is the tin it came in is difficult to open, seems bent or something.</li>
            <li> As for the balm itself, the application is a breeze, usually taking no more than a minute for my medium-length beard.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not very good.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been looking for a product to condition and tame his beard..winner!</li>
            <li> Tame that hairy beast!</li>
            <li> take your unruly, burly mountain man beard and tame it!</li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Once i got past the itch I entered a weird stage where I had a ton of flyaways and a rough looking beard.</li>
            <li> and they could be using refined coconut oil, but it&#x27;s hard to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do meet a lot of people who compliment my beard and say they don&#x27;t grow one because it&#x27;s hard to manage.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s a little sparse and thin in my opinion, but I like it</li>
            <li> The smell takes a bit getting used to (not in a bad way), but other than that, beard Balm helped me with my dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> The last oil I used was this awkward pine scent that I felt like I should use before hunting or something.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the scent off-putting at all, and I&#x27;ve never heard a complaint from those who get close to my beard.</li>
            <li> To say the least, buy this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it ALL the time, but try and use it at least 2 out of 3 days.</li>
            <li> but I always have at least 1/2 a tin of Beard balm on hand.  </li>
            <li> Go read the negative reviews which at the time of this writing is 8.</li>
            <li> anyways finished reading the Negative reviews?</li>
            <li> It also helps relieve itching that is commonly associated with having a beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resorted to cutting those hairs short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my beard several times, but my wife has always banished it after a few months -- scratchy, ugly, smelly.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have anyone say anything negative about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The end result was a beard so thick, neat, and gleaming that women everywhere in its line of sight now swoon uncontrollably.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was a little shocked that the tin was so small, but I should have expected it.</li>
            <li> This balm is one mean product.</li>
            <li> and i already have to fight women off me everyday!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my 2 &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; balms (the other is also a Michigan based brand which shall remain nameless for this review).</li>
            <li> Needless to say,  I&#x27;m gonna try some other products and see what&#x27;s up</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bearded boyfriend who has a crazy long wizard-like beard.</li>
            <li> At first, I HATED the smell.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I notice how dry and unhappy my beard feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done before and after photos and this product seriously brings my beard to another level when I use it</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very thick, making it very difficult to comb and maintain.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that when we wake up the next day before he showers it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> The next day it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I also learned that stealing your wifes eyebrow comb is not a good idea.  </li>
            <li> But to me, it smells just like Vaseline, even though the base ingredients are nowhere near close to petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t walk around with a weak zen master beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to describe, I can smell the lemon and a bit of the eucalyptus</li>
            <li> recently started to grow mine out and found it to be stupidly itchy, girlfriend got me a tin of this</li>
            <li> I really hate to rate Bear Balm so low.  </li>
            <li> Very greesy and smells awful</li>
            <li> Then the brush gets sticky and starts collecting crap that then gets transferred to your beard the next time you useit.</li>
            <li> And I never experienced the itchy phase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, you ARE going to be confused by the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Getting addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Helps straighten and tame my crazy hairs, and helps hide my thin patches.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Not that the other brands were bad but this one&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> If you have been disappointed with other products you should give Beard Balm a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated facial beard itch.  </li>
            <li> my black heavy metal t-shirts weren&#x27;t doing anything to hide this awful flakage.</li>
            <li> while i dont hate the smell its def not something i like to smell like the other 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom</li>
            <li> But since this is a wax base balm it puts them down with no problem.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight smell for about 45 minutes, but it&#x27;s not a smell that I hate</li>
            <li> My wife likes it too, but she&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it has a faint lemony type smell,</li>
            <li> When the box arrived, I could tell something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Part of the reason is its inclusion of lanolin, a type of purified wool &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;, and lanolin is sold as a moisturizing ingredient (an expensive one, though) for a number of uses.</li>
            <li> It is softer, has fewer weird curls in random places, fewer runaway hairs, and it smells nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this stuff works and it is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I was but a baby-faced lad with mere aspirations to manliness.  </li>
            <li> do not get the wrong idea...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m obsessed with what this does to my beard.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with a trimmed beard and acceptance of the mainstream.</li>
            <li> After seeing a lot of the silly reviews about lumberjacks and manliness</li>
            <li> As is, you can&#x27;t go wrong and</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pick up the lemon at all, and the eucalyptus is quite faint.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong here</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a greaser or a gearhead you may dig this, but I found the smell to have a faint note of motor oil or WD-40, which is not my scene.</li>
            <li> Hated the other brand after using this....</li>
            <li> Well I was skeptical to say the least, I figured it was just some crap shoved in a can and sold.</li>
            <li> I hated waking up in the morning to find my beard flattened and half way up my nose.  </li>
            <li> To my relief, it was still in tack, even after my gruesome fight with a polar bear.</li>
            <li> Worst $16 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, it doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li> I was at work and my balm was too cold to use when I got home.</li>
            <li> pesky hairs that poke out all awkward..</li>
            <li> But it helps with the itchiness like crazy</li>
            <li> Too oily and it stinks.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still in that awkward phase.  </li>
            <li> I stopped cutting the hair on both my head and my face for some time now.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> My daughter tells me my beard stinks when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Billions of whiskers can&#x27;t be wrong !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s an unpleasant smell, like garbage</li>
            <li> (yes it does leave a smell albeit very faintly).</li>
            <li> buts its not that bad.</li>
            <li> They must have known how badly my whiskers needed to be tamed.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt as bad as some may say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple days now, and I can tell you that the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned the smell as if it were a bad thing, to me, it is not.</li>
            <li> it does have an aroma to it, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses either.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> My beard is stupid.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate the smell, but my wife didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li> a woman, I HATE products that men use that make them STINK.</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> Basically all that crap that girls whine about with split ends and stuff...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I always hated how his stubble on his face felt whenever I touched it</li>
            <li> My gf hated the smell, she said I smelt like medicine!</li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell and it doesn&#x27;t do anything besides my your beard greasey sticky and smelly</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t soften my beard at all.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this stuff, I had a pathetic, peach-fuzz of a beard.  </li>

            <li> My husband no longer has crazy-hobo-beard. Now its more lovable lumberjack. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is the hit get it wish it was cheaper but the best</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be. Does not help beard grow and only leaves it really shiny</li>
            <li> First time using a beard balm! I&#x27;ve had a beard for the past 15 years. Most of the time I keep it really short. But this fall I decided to let it grow . Past week or two beard was getting scruffy looking. But then I decoverd beard balm! Makes my beard soft , shinny and keeps those unrulie whiskers in check. And smells good too! Would def recommend this product . And I&#x27;m a master barber by trade so that should say something !</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has created this, well, Beard Balm. The all natural balm was created to condition the beards of men, well, and women if they so choose. I don&#x27;t have a beard and I didn&#x27;t purchase this to use on one, but what I do have is exceptionally dry skin. First, a thyroid condition causes dry skin, second my job requires a lot of cleaning and tons of hand washing. Lotion, while nice, just isn&#x27;t enough to keep my hands normally hydrated, never mind soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is awesome. It&#x27;s got a mild, fresh scent and helps my hands tremendously! It doesn&#x27;t stay greasy like some other balms and doesn&#x27;t wash off the second it comes in contact with water. I&#x27;m happy the tin is a generous size, because this is something I don&#x27;t EVER want to run out of! Between being a mom, volunteering, working in a kitchen and being a CNA...hand washing, sanitizing and extreme dryness is par for the course! If keeping Beard Balm on hand prevents cracking and bleeding- then that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to continue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to have purchased this product for review. All opinions and experiences are my own and not influenced in any way! While this product is geared and sold for beard care- it&#x27;s fabulous for dry skin!!</li>
            <li> If you are a rebel of the razor, I highly recommend checking out this awesome, straight outta Detroit, beard balm!  It is 100% natural, so you can feel good about putting the stuff on your face. The all natural ingredient list includes essential oils and beeswax.  Once you rub a bit together in your hands you will see how the balm softens right up. When applying, remember that a little bit goes a long way. The balm goes on nicely and softens your beard or goatee up while providing a bit of hold. It also gives your beard / goatee a nice sheen. Plus, it helps fight beard itch and beard dandruff - two thing that you most definitely do not need in your life! And the masculine scent of this balm is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Great scent, easy to apply and works really well! Leaves my beard looking sharp. Highly recommend this Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> If you are reading the comments about the smell IGNORE THEM! My girlfriend who doesn&#x27;t like the small of my Honest Amish very much (although yeah, I think she&#x27;s crazy too) smelled this and said it was awesome! It&#x27;s kind of like fresh lemons. My beard doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, as if I may have applied too much, rather it is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who aren&#x27;t good with process I find it&#x27;s best to&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply the balm immediately after showering and drying your beard, a little damp is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rub a dab of the Balm between your until it&#x27;s liquid&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub into the beard and rush througout with a boar bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;4. Amazing Beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just order this right now, maybe get 3. Or 30...</li>
            <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost a year now. I have not use it everyday, but am close to running out and will certainly place another order when I do. I noticed that I was having some beard dandruff this winter and went into proactive mode and started using this balm every day.The dandruff cleared up within a few days of just gently rubbing it in every morning. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Use this often, typically daily or every other day, depending upon my mood or how my beard is looking that day. This can take the most drab sad and dry looking beard and give it a whole new life. Just a little dab, rub it in your hand/fingers, run it through your beard/mustache and viola. Use a little beard brush and you&#x27;ll be good to go. My wife always seem to notice and compliment whenever I use it. Provided you don&#x27;t go overboard, your face and/or beard aren&#x27;t going to get all greasy/oily and gross. If for some reason you feel this happened, then you simply used too much. I use my face wash and shampoo my beard, finishing off with not even a pea-sized smear of this. A slight hint of honey scent will linger a little while after as you go about your day. Love the product and will be getting more (whenever I need it - seems to be lasting me forever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re just starting out with growing a beard or are just having one of those itchy beard days, this WILL do the trick. I had to shave off the beard a handful of times to start over and dealt with the beard itch. On days I used this, never had a problem. On the few days I didn&#x27;t think I needed it and got an itch fit in the afternoon, a quick hit of this and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this, I also got the Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner to try. Hands-down Beard Balm is far superior. I found it too grainy and it never gave me the same look that beard balm does. Get beard balm!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my fianc&amp;eacute; who loves his beard dearly, but just needed some added control to help keep his beard looking nice. This product added control to his beard (to reduce those fluffy/frizzy tufts that look unruly), as well as left his beard looking healthy, shiny, and softer (but still manly!).</li>
            <li> Great product for those with beards! Smells great and makes the beard look great too!</li>
            <li> Best of the best. As a dedicated San Francisco urbanite I&#x27;ve tried tons of different beard balms, oils, and waxes and this one tops them all. The smell is super manly and made me feel like a true lumbersexual. At first my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent but has started to really dig it after about a week. The smell complements Dior Fahrenheit perfectly BTW. Aside from the smell, it made my scraggly beard way softer and keeps it looking quite tidy. This Beard Balm is the perfect complement for design crits, shawl collar sweaters, film photography, and listening to Mazzy Star vinyl on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this balm, the smell is very pleasant and the application is short while leaving your beard shiny and smooth. I&#x27;ve thought about gifting these balms to other bearded brethren simply to spread the joy of a well kept beard.</li>
            <li> I had never tried to grow and maintain facial hair until a few months ago. This is one of the balms on Amazon with the best reviews, so I went for it and haven&#x27;t looked back. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I use a small brush to comb it in.. Definitely best to apply when damp, as it absorbs much more and the hair feels smoother and healthier. I haven&#x27;t found the smell to be overpowering or unpleasant, and it dissipates rather quickly after applied. My beard is nice and manageable, though I have found that I need to apply it twice a day to maintain the feel. All in all, a great product, especially when combined with a wash-out conditioner, and I will continue to support the Beard Balm crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would smear on my face again.</li>
            <li> Out of the beard products I have tried, this is the standby I keep coming back to.  The scent is perfect for how I want my beard to smell, manly and natural.  The texture is great, breaking down to an oil with a few quick rubs in between my fingers and it lasts longer than the pure oils you can find out there.  I have used this for myself and given it as a gift, always well recieved.</li>
            <li> I am rocking a 4 month beard and I have to say that most of the glory and compliments should be directed to Beard Balm.  This product has really helped me to contain my beard as well as soften it.  I usually apply the balm after a shower once it has mainly dried.  Only a small amount is required, otherwise your beard can become over shiny/wet looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm really helps to keep stray hairs down and devolumize my beard, avoiding that awkward puffy beard look.  It also does wonders against dandruff.  I have used the balm basically every day for a month and I still have a good amount left, so you get a lot of value and longevity per tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this balm is not like the type of wax you would use to style a crazy mustache, but it is perfect for any other application.  Love the product, love the smell, love the natural ingredients, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Smells very industrial like used motor oil or a machine tool shop.  I was expecting a waxier product based on the opaque color on the image but its very shiny &amp; greasy.  I think you could get the same result from any bag balm from a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Coming from a beard oil, I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect. The last oil I used was this awkward pine scent that I felt like I should use before hunting or something. I could only worry that the balm would be too thick for my now short (trimmed under an inch) beard. With proper application it works. Really helps from where I shave my neck line from itching. It has little smell, if I had to place any it&#x27;s almost a citrus/oil/honey kinda thing. Not overbearing and certainly not feminine. I would highly suggest this balm to anyone who needs just a smudge more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; than a oil can do. And with a short beard a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this beard oil.  It has a little bit of hold and gives my beard a nice scent and shine.  I use this product on a daily basis to make my beard presentable for the office.  I will use other products in conjunction with this one on weekends when I&#x27;m looking for more hold and a more aggressive look.  Never feels greasy nor do I have problems with the scent.  Keeps split ends at bay as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it.Is there some place local (Detroit)that I can purchase Beard Balm?</li>
            <li> This is actually the first beard balm I used, about 4 months in growing. Now Ive been growing for over a year and I&#x27;m still using it. The smell is great and keeps my beard soft. I use it both when I start my day, and before I go to bed as a conditioner. Great stuff here</li>
            <li> Loved the beard balm. Lasted longer than I expected considering you don&#x27;t need much for your beard. Smell is pleasant and and smoothness is great. Will purchase another can soon.</li>
            <li> It helps keep the hairs straight and makes my beard nice and soft. My wife loves it. #thankGodiambearded</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I don&#x27;t grow a perfect beard, and as my beard hair continues to grow, it makes me itch.  After using Beard Balm, all of my problems have been solved.  I love the natural ingredients used in this product, but nonetheless I love that it keeps my beard far from itching, somewhat shiny, and overtime straightens the hair.</li>
            <li> What a great product. Keeps my beard looking great and has a nice smell. Not overpowering just right!!</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, from other balms to beard oil and I must say that The Beard Balm, has done everything that it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;Wanting a beard softer and more manageable... Yep&lt;br /&gt;Wanting something that smells like it belongs on a man and not all fruity and feminine.. Yep&lt;br /&gt;Want a product where a little goes a long way.. Yep a little product from my finger to my hand, rub my hands together and then smooth on an in beard..  Pure man awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, that you out down the razor, grow a beard and buy and use this product...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a man and I approve this message!</li>
            <li> I have tried Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s, Honest Amish and this one, Beard Balm. Out of the three this is the one that gets dipped into most mornings.  The beard Balm and Honest Amish are similar in how they make your beard feel but Beard Balm excels in smell.  I think it&#x27;s better in other areas but its hard for me to quantify. Beard Balm makes your beard soft, tame and healthy looking. It isn&#x27;t greasy like Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s and Beard Balm is made in the US. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many balms and oils on my beard and this product is hands down the best!  It has a great consistency that makes it easy to apply, and the smell is great!  I have not hugged a woman yet that hadn&#x27;t said it smells amazing.  If you have beard then buy Beard Balm.  If you don&#x27;t then grow one, and buy Beard Balm!  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other similar products and this is by fa the best of them all...the only one worth using on my beard, keeps it soft, and smooth, with a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> Just got it in a couple of days ago. So far I really like the product. Smells good and my beard is starting to feel softer.</li>
            <li> boyfriend liked it but it caused him to break out a little around the mouth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the beard balm will work or not, but I am giving it to the three men in my life with beards. They will be a great test and I will let you know how it works next week. Thanks for your quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This Beard Balm really does work great. It tames my beard and makes it shiny and healthy looking. I just finished a can and ordered a couple other brands to explore my options, but so far it&#x27;s not even a contest. I will be ordering another can of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product delivers as promised.  Recommended and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, makes my beard look nice and clean...plus my wife likes the smell.</li>
            <li> I was concerned this balm would have an overpowering smell but surprisingly enough it was very pleasant. It also gives your beard a shine almost like a wet look but doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a glob of grease either.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly the wife didn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all. In fact she sniffed it right out of the can and said &amp;#34;ok...you can put this one on....it smells nice&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> I smell like a lumberjack and I love it</li>
            <li> Package arrived together and on time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the smell to this balm. It&#x27;s not too light or too strong. It&#x27;s just right. I&#x27;ve tried Professor Fussworthy balm and I think their scent was very strong, even though it went away after 5 minutes. My gf hated the smell, she said I smelt like medicine! Beard balm holds nicely all day with a nice shine to it. Also, it is not greasy at all and makes your hair soft. It all depends on how you want your beard to look and smell I guess, but his works for me.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, but oils my beard nicely so i can live with it.</li>
            <li> Not fond of the smell but works great</li>
            <li> Beard balm is amazing! I decided to try beard balm to tame my beard and it worked.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  I was looking for something for my beard that would eliminate the flaking and soften my beard.  I cannot believe how well and how fast it worked.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> Works really well at keeping my beard in check. The smell has grown on me.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells great and keeps my beard soft and manageable. I was initially nervous that it would leave my skin and beard feeling greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his Beard Balm! I like how good it smells and it looks less frizzy! 😍 very nice!</li>
            <li> This works great. It tames my beard the day I use it and keeps it soft for a couple days after. It softens up quickly and goes in evenly with a fine toothed comb. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Great! Tamed my beard. I would have these furls at the end and now they are gone!!!! My beard has never looked any better.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Love the fact it comes out of Detroit, and does wonders for my beard. I do not have a nice trimmed neat beard, but beard balm keeps it well under control. If you cannot decide what beard balm to buy, buy this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Throw some on the beard in the morning and brush the beard and I am good for the rest of the day. Smells good too!!!</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff – and comes from the Motor City, which is fun. I had a full, wild and woolly heard for 15 years and then stopped for another 15 because people started calling me &#x27;gramps&#x27;. Now that I&#x27;m old enough to be a gramps (and my beard is white), I have started again but this time it&#x27;s no longer wild and woolly because I have discovered beard maintenance, part of which is this beard balm. It smells nice (an interesting but undefinable odour which does not linger too long), and is easy to apply – just rub a couple of fingers around the tin, transfer to beard and rub in, continue until whole beard is done. Comb with Kent beard comb (available on Amazon) and it is soon absorbed (no greasy look or feel). To make beard even better, after a few minutes brush with Diane&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Palm Brush (100% boar hair – also available from Amazon for nice low price) for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a matter of personal taste which beard balm one uses. I have tried three: this one; also Honest Amish (I  quite like the smell but not so much, nor the consistency, as it is softer and probably less economical); and Grave Before Shave (which smells more lemony but is very similar to Beard Balm).&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is fine stuff and I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: I was prompted to write this review by the promise of another tin, but the above is an honest opinion and I would probably have gotten around to a review sometime anyway.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the product. I like the shine it gives my beard. The only thing is I wish it had a bit stronger hold. But overall I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but it literally does nothing for your beard other than smell good.</li>
            <li> I bought my Beard Balm about three months into growing my beard when it was starting to get a little gnarly. It really does make the beard quite a bit softer and easier to manage, especially after sleeping on it all night. It would wake up all tangled and junk and I just wet it and rubbed a little balm in and it was silky again.    One tin has lasted me 3 months, and it&#x27;s only about half done, and my beard is pretty epic. I would anticipate one tin to last an average person 4-6 months depending on the size of the foliage.    It does make the beard feel really really nice, but I find that the effect starts to wear off after a day of work. Sometimes I find myself wanting to re-apply it when I get home, and sometimes it seems like it makes my beard a little flaky when it dries, but to be fair, that might just be that I am disgusting.    The smell is the biggest point of contention. It&#x27;s kind of eucalyptus-rubber-wax-smokey. I actually enjoy it; I wish it was a little less smoky/rubbery, but the overall scent is nice. My wife likes it too, but she&#x27;s weird. Your mileage may vary here. It smells very manly. It&#x27;s not actually that strong unless you put it on your moustache.    Speaking of that: don&#x27;t put it in your moustache. It&#x27;s not wax. It doesn&#x27;t hold like wax. It will not keep your hair out of your mouth. Instead, it will make your moustache buttery smooth, and give you a mouthful of buttery smooth moustache. I tried this for like the first week but it would all rub off on my lips so I looked like a fourteen year old girl with a sea urchin on my face. It says \\&quot;beard\\&quot; right on the front. Don&#x27;t put it in your moustache.    Overall I like this stuff a lot. It does wonders for texture and control of my half-yeard, smells like muscles and chopping wood, last a long time, and is easy to use. If it lasted 24 hours and was slightly less smokey it would be absolutely perfect, but it&#x27;s definitely mostly perfect just the way it is. So, yeah. Get you some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used beard  oil in the past, but I much prefer the beard balm after trying this product.  It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, definitely leaves the beard softer and more manageable, and the tin has been long lasting.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> An excellent beard balm, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Other balms have too strong of a scent, or make my beard to shiny.  My wife loves the smell of this balm, and it keeps my beard soft, moisturized, and controlled.  Highly recommend.  The 1.6oz container goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> I have been using Beard Balm for several months, and have been very pleased with the outcome. I like the mild scent, and the just right amount of shine it gives the beard. I use it on my mustache as well. The container travels well, and is a TSA friendly size.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; has a great smell to it. Something that keeps my girlfriend off my back about the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This has taken me to the next level in beard awesomeness. Love it.. Takes a couple minutes to get used to the smell, but my lady loves it.</li>
            <li> Do you want your display of manliness that is your facial hair to be soft and shiny? Do you want random men and women to cry from the sheer beauty of your magnificent beard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make Chuck Norris proud and your wife/girlfriend/significant other/grizzly bear happy/jealous with this great balm.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother (one day I&#x27;ll be able to grow a full, epic beard) and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;He loves maintaining that beard of his and it really feels soft to the touch and well nourished. Definitely helps keep his beard strong, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> A happy customer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it makes my beard much easier to manage.  It&#x27;s much softer and easier to shape.  No more frizzy ends going every which way.  I actually went to a fast food restaurant and there was a young kid with a goatee that actually complimented me on my beard and gave me an extra scoop of food!</li>
            <li> I have been growing a beard every year for the past decade.  This year I decided to give Beard Balm a try and I don&#x27;t know how I managed without it!  Really helps tame down my beard and leaves it soft and smooth.  Highly recommended, and I enjoy the faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great stuff.  It helps keep your beard shaped and conditioned without leaving a greesey mess.  I use it daily and my beard looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I Loved the product, I needed it for no shave November last month, and along with genetics Beard Balm was a wondering aid. Everything about Beard Balm is great, The smell, the feel and the texture. And thanks to the Coconut oil that is in beard balm, i don&#x27;t have to worry about having an itchy chin. My Barber recommended it and i am glad that he did.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff. It smells great, and goes on a tad greasy but with a great shine, then absorbs quickly, leaving my beard soft. I like to run the leftovers through my hair too. I usually apply it after I shower.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a miracle cure to grow your beard, your hair or your back hair. Keep looking. This isn&#x27;t snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this is great for is taming the course nuclear growing whiskers that will not comply with the flow. No this is not a wax, this is a balm. It softens the hair follicles, think of it as a leave in hair conditioner. It will help to maintain and enrich your beard and it makes you smell like a man. Think of a lumberjack with a torn flannel shirt, holding a chainsaw will riding a  wild bull in the snow. That about sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. It helps to keep my beard tame even in my travels in the deserts of Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my Van Dyke beard from looking too scraggly, plus my girlfriend loves the way it makes my beard smell!  It has a nice lime scent that isn&#x27;t too perfumy.  Beard wax is the only hair product I use and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is super useful for when your beard gets long and unruly. You put it on and run a comb through it a few times and you&#x27;re good. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it feels a little oily if you touch it but its alright. Don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very thick, making it very difficult to comb and maintain. I bought Beard Balm at the advice of a friend who uses it, and I have been very satisfied with how much easier it is to keep my beard in check. I like the manly smell, but the description is correct in stating that you get used to it and don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other gents on here, I was a little unsure of the smell of the beard balm at first, but I have grown to like it. I apply the balm every morning, and comb it through with a fine toothed comb. My beard feels softer since using the product, but more importantly I have noticed a big difference with my skin. Usually in the winter I have itchy dry skin under my beard. I haven&#x27;t had one problem with my skin drying out since using the beard balm. I have already recommended this product to a few of my friends. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This is great for beards. Smells good (Though my wife was not a fan) And leaves your beard supple and soft. These are some of the best beard products out there, and this is a great place to start lubricating and taking care of your beard.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I had no friends. I had no job. I had no girlfriend. I went to McDonald&#x27;s and ordered a McDouble and they gave me a filet-o-fish.&lt;br /&gt;My life had no value.&lt;br /&gt;But one day, while moaning around the house, I saw this beard balm on Amazon.com and thought &amp;#34;oh what the heck?&amp;#34; and bought a tin of it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m a 6-foot-4, 220 pound barrel chested love machine with a bank full of gold bars, more friends than the captain of the football team in an 80&#x27;s movie, I date not one, but two supermodels and I have a McDonalds inside my closet — which is actually inside a Burger King.&lt;br /&gt;Am I promising this beard balm will change your life?&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;Will it make you beard irresistible to women and make grizzly bears offer you a firm handshake?&lt;br /&gt;My friend Smokey says what&#x27;s up.&lt;br /&gt;And for this price? You can&#x27;t pass it by. In fact, Beard Balm Natural Leave In Conditioner may be more valuable than water, air or Mike Trout in your fantasy baseball league.&lt;br /&gt;Now if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I must go carve a canoe... out of a tree that fell to the ground at the near sight of my glorious beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rocking a scraggly Goat for ages and now he is tamed.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like a foot or a flower - just a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVES this balm!  He uses it every other day or so on his beard and it tames it beautifully!  total side-bonus, our Dog Loves to sniff his face and lick him when wearing the balm.  cutest thing ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending this to friends left and right and have heard nothing but positive reviews in return. Don&#x27;t let the size of the can fool you. I&#x27;ve been using it daily and I&#x27;m only about half way through my first can - after 2 months. Support small business and feel rad doing so.</li>
            <li> I apply just as I&#x27;m getting out of a steamy shower while the hair follicles are open and slightly damp. The conditioners penetrate my coarse facial hair and make it feel silky smooth. I use it on my beard, mustache, eyebrows, and sideburns. The mild, but manly scent took some getting used to because it puts me in mind of an old fashioned apothecary. I have grown quite fond of the fragrance now, and so have my female friends.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Beard Balm. It&#x27;s clean, and not overpowering. I live in the city, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like a campfire (like other brands of balm) unless I&#x27;m actually camping, but I digress.    Beard Balm makes my wiry beard very easy to sculpt, and gives it a nice shine without it looking greasy.  It has also made my beard quite soft, which my girlfriend loves. A little goes a long way, and lasts for hours on end.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly after i purchase it and I&#x27;ve been tried Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm for almost a year, my beard start to get in thicker and stronger, they are look so coor as every morning i applies the Beard Palm on them i also use for my mustache, they&#x27;re also works and get in thick and long. i use this Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm daily to hope to get the nice thick and strong beard and mustache. I would consider using it on your beard if you would to have a nice smile.</li>
            <li> I tend to get pretty dry skin and facial hair and this product has taken care of both those issues. I don&#x27;t find the scent off-putting at all, and I&#x27;ve never heard a complaint from those who get close to my beard. I&#x27;d recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I love Beard Balm, it does an excellent job conditioning my beard and giving me some control in taming some of my wild hairs.</li>
            <li> This balm does wonders for my beard! Before I got it, my beard was dry and frizzy. My best advice is to use this after a hot shower. Now my beard is soft and shiny without being greasy. It keeps the hair and the skin underneath healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with or without a beard. It smells great and you&#x27;re supporting a local (to me) / Michigan made product</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product, and it makes his beard so much nicer and much less prickly. I will definitely keep buying!</li>
            <li> Best product have use thus far regarding  beard products are concern I highly recommended  it</li>
            <li> Of the other products in this arena that I&#x27;ve tried, this has the most pleasing scent and it does a good job at taming my beard.  However, the scent is a little oldschool and while I do like it, it&#x27;s not the most appealing.  I&#x27;m trying their &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; condition which is scentless just for this reason.  Wish they had one with Peppermint, or some other clean smelling oils.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this daily and swears by it. I also appreciate the softness and tamed look of his ever-growing beard.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product! The fact that it is made in the good old USA is another plus for me! It is more of a light hold type product sort of between a conditioner and a heavy balm. Stays all&lt;br /&gt;day and leaves my face well conditioned. Puts a nice sheen on your face as well. This product will not manage your beard like a heavy wax but I like it better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the past year trying to tame my beard - this is the best! A lot of punch is packed into a small amount. It conditions, controls and smells good too. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is great. I love the honey smell and how fast it absorbs. No greasiness or residue. Lasts all day and is always consistent. The only balm use</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  My beard grows very wild but with beard balm I can tame it and it even makes my beard look thicker. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as other reviews say. Great gift for the bearded one in your life. Will always recommend.</li>
            <li> This balm is better than no balm, but certainly wouldn&#x27;t be a recommendation of mine. As noted by some other reviewers, the smell is &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; and my beard does feel oily rather than soft.</li>
            <li> I have a full, thick beard. I sometimes use oils, but come back again and again to BEARD BALM. It&#x27;s the best!  I put it on after I shower and no worries - it has great control and gives off a great shine.  It&#x27;s a permanent in my daily grooming rotation.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels really good as long as you dont mind a bit of an oily feeling on your face (at least for me).  i use it during the winter when i&#x27;m dried out, but not during the summer</li>
            <li> Delivered very promptly. Will be a stocking stuffer so I can&#x27;t give an accurate review of how it works but I can say it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other beard conditioners/balms and this is one of the best.  It is easy to apply, plus leaves my beard feeling soft and smelling great throughout the day.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid. I was petrified. But then I got this beard balm and I started dating super models.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t reviewed anything ever. First review,and it is well deserved. If you have a beard and want a better beard buy this. Use 3 days  a week generously and wash beard every 4 days.  Hands down the best Amazon purchase ever from An Amazon addict.</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time to be the favorite part of my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking. He&#x27;s been looking for a product to condition and tame his beard..winner!</li>
            <li> After my wife convinced me to grow my beard out, it started to get a little &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; searched online for a product and found this. What a great way to keep my beard looking and feeling healthy. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Showed up a couple days early, great stuff. Will order more.</li>
            <li> This balm is one mean product. If you are just cultivating a little scruff or  encouraging a massive beard-god altar on your face, this product is exactly what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance:&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some other products I have tried that seem to attempt to bathe you in the smell of spearmint gum, orange juice, or in one case cotton candy (what am I a clown?), Beard Balm&#x27;s simplicity is its greatest factor. The scent is a sophisticated aroma with a natural cleanly man smell. It never overpowers you competing with the fifteen-year old next store dowsed in a gallon of aftershave before his first prom like some other products. Instead it simply suggests a natural hint of cultivation that only the closeness of companionship could unlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium-large beard of about six inches and at first I was worried about the finer details of beard care with this kind of product. I couldn&#x27;t have been more unfounded in my fears. Application and use is an easy and enjoyable experience that I look forward to. Simply applying a small amount to a finger by &#x27;digging&#x27; in the balm and then rubbing it between my hands is all the prep needed to use this product on my burly man-scruff. I then breathe in deep the manly aroma as I work it in to the hairs. I also like to apply a little to each finger and work it into my mustache to help moisterize and train it as well. I do not use this in conjunction with a wax but the balm is pliable enough to keep my waves and curls from being a problem throughout the day. I have even taken to using any trace I have left over on my hands after application to style my hair and keep the tiny fly-aways in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very happy with this product and will likely continue to use it. It leaves my beard and skin feeling soft and with a natural healthy sheen that I cannot get any place else. The tin lasts me about three to four months with daily application and is worth every penny of the price paid. So if you want a manly beard the women will woo over and men could only wish they had use Beard Balm and never look back because once you go lumberjack, you never lumber back!omen will woo over and men could only wish they had use Beard Balm and never look back because once you go lumberjack, you never lumber back!</li>
            <li> Works well, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product! Not greasy and easy to rub in. Just use a fingernail amount and rub gently between your palm followed by massaging into your beautiful mane. Smells great, very masculine yet not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without using beard balm. It has become an essential part of my routine. It gives my beard a great shape that hold all day. It is super easy to apply and one can lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> This morning was like any other morning. I woke up, took a shower, washed my beard and thought in this sweet, sweeeeet balm. I was ready to tackle the day. My friends and I planned an adventure to go snowboarding at one of Idaho&#x27;s best resorts, Tamarack. On the drive there multiple hunnies (women), honked there horns and started getting very pleased whenever they saw my beard. We went through pounds of powder all day, and my beard looked like one solid icicle. I was concerned it would be lost in the deep holes of the Hellmouth. To my relief, it was still in tack, even after my gruesome fight with a polar bear. To say the least, buy this. You will go from friendzoned to bedzoned overnight.</li>
            <li> It is clearly obvious that this balm get my beard shinier and softer, last but not the least i really like how it smell ! Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! Best thing for morning beard. Just rub a small amount between the palms and apply. Brush with a boar bristle brush and carry on. If your a beardsman you have got to try Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It eliminates the dryness and dander that come from not moisturizing your beard. I have ordered this several times.</li>
            <li> Simple but perfect for my needs. It kept my beard soft no matter how thick I let it grow.  I have trimmed it down but surprisingly my wife has asked me to let it grow in full again.  She likes the texture and the smell, I like the manageability and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  So its a win win for all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good product</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I don&#x27;t know that it will make your beard grow in any faster or more fully, but it definitely keeps it nice and conditioned. I&#x27;ve even had barbers asked me what I was using, saying they could see I took great care of my beard. When I run out, I notice how dry and unhappy my beard feels. Plus, God Bless these guys for running a business out of Detroit. Shipping is always fast. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It may seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t leave my beard feeling overwhelming greasy or dense, and it&#x27;s great for keeping my beard looking neat and clean in the winter months. Definitely worth it, but make sure to pick up a brush as well!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as most of the people on here have reviewed, the smell is strange at first but as you use the product it grows on you. and so does your beard! makes my beard shiny and soft but leaves a bit of waxy residue which can be controlled by how much you put in your beard. its a learn as you go kind of thing, but I absolutely love this balm.</li>
            <li> give me more control over my beard. Also give it a nice smell and a shine!</li>
            <li> Good product and quick delivery. I put it on my beard and I noticed it has a faint lemony type smell, buts its not that bad. I noticed my beard looks fuller and softer and gives the beard a little shine to it, makes the beard come alive.  All in all, I like the beard balm and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Odd smell, but other than that great. Helps keep my epic beard epic. Not only does it help the hair, but it seems to reduce the amount of dry skin under the beard. I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and smells good too!</li>
            <li> I like what it does to my beard. The wife does NOT like the smell. I&#x27;m OK with the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, now does it?</li>
            <li> Great product, has a &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; smell at first but you get used to it quickly. Not bad, but throughout the day you might catch it and wonder what it is you&#x27;re smelling.</li>
            <li> Best bearld balm out, holds my scraggly hairs down and keeps them straight,its smells good, very soft.can&#x27;t wait for my second batch, instant buy!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I won&#x27;t leave my house without applying Beard Balm to my beard. I&#x27;ve reccomended it to countless people. I&#x27;ll be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best balm I&#x27;ve used in my beard. It creates a good shine and really does soften your beard. However if you run your hands through it you will end up looking like you just wiped down a pizza from a mall food court with your bare hands. Overall though it does soften your burl up well. I personally apply it when I get home from work.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for my guy&#x27;s beard, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell of it.  So much so, that I really disliked kissing my guy when he had it on.  He&#x27;s currently trying a different brand that has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> It got here on time but really didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting</li>
            <li> The product works as noted- Left my beard shimmering, smelling wonderful, and got quite a few compliments on it. Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Well I was skeptical to say the least, I figured it was just some crap shoved in a can and sold. This stuff is AMAZING! I have a small beard that is just starting out (about a month into it) and usually it starts itching or feels like hay and I shave it off. Decided to give this product a run and man does it work wonders! Turned me from hay to silk on the 1st application. I will be continuing to use it daily, and the scent is alotta awesome. Some say its over powering or too much, personally I find it to be refreshing and clean smelling. An awesome beard should have an Awesome scent. I think if it works as well as I have found it to, Beard Balm will be a LONG TIME product of mine. Here&#x27;s to the bearded brothers out there!! CHEERS!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel soft and have a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I just got the balm, and applied my first round.  It went on quite easily, and didn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy mess.  Previously, I&#x27;ve used coconut oil, which didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well, if that&#x27;s the word for it.  It left me a bit greasy.  I can already tell, however, that this balm is going to work better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Left my boyfriend&#x27;s beard feeling soft! Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> i personally don&#x27;t think that the smell of this is an issue.  random questioning of female friends didn&#x27;t express any opinion that my beard smelled funny.  the strongest opinion was of smelling the contents in the can and remarking that it reminded her of camping supplies.&lt;br /&gt;after using my first tin of this, i am now dependent on it. my beard feels better, looks better.  it even brings out the red in it a bit more. without it, my beard is super wiry and dry and flies out all over the place.  i appreciate that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, unlike shampoo and other hair care products.  i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good beard balm. I gave it only 3 stars due to the scent. The scent is a little overpowering and not my taste subjectively.</li>
            <li> This product is only for those who truly care about the appearance of their beard. This specific product gives me beard moisture and makes it more manageable. A small application goes along way. For anyone looking to add natural moisture  to beard, I seriously recommend this product....</li>
            <li> Great product. Smelled great, not greasy, controlled my wild hairs and left my beard with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> So people can&#x27;t seem to make up their mind about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a manly smell.&lt;br /&gt;It smells the way a man who has been working on his Harley all day should smell.&lt;br /&gt;The women REALLY like it.&lt;br /&gt;The produce itself goes a long way; a dab will do. That&#x27;s the best part.&lt;br /&gt;Once the sun hits your face hair, and this stuff is in there, it outshines even that wimp Edward Cullen from the Twilight movies.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell. Leaves your beard feeling as soft as Panda bear. Glistens. Keeps it uniformed.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Live it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I love supporting folks who produce things in the US and create jobs.  Every time I decide to grow my beard this stuff helps with that super itchy feeling and makes everything look and feel awesome.  Smells decent and makes combing out tangles so much easier. And they are totally active on social media and love to give shout outs to people.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has really softened my beard. It doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to and it has made my beard a lot less unruly.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> smells fine good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give 4 starts because I expected the blam to be like others I have used. This one feels and stays on your hair and skin like baseline&lt;br /&gt;Smell is okay not bad, but I&#x27;ll wait d see if it works with my facial hair</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, and super relaxing. There is nothing better than massaging your beard after a long day!</li>
            <li> Smell is very strong and stay for long time. My wife don&#x27;t like me smell like that.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is not with the product. The package had been outside all day BC I was at work and my balm was too cold to use when I got home. Used it first thing this morning and could immediately feel a difference in the softness of it. Excellent product. Would rate higher if I could.</li>
            <li> First Beard Balm I&#x27;ve ever bought/owned. Worked great and smells nice too. Easy to use as well</li>
            <li> i use this beard balm about 4 days of the week, using oils the other times. I like the smell, it lasts through much of the day, and it provides a moderate hold for unruly hairs. Keeps the beard pretty soft in dry climates as well. The only aspect I don&#x27;t like, is if you don&#x27;t rub the wax fully into a more liquid state, sometimes little clumps will show on the end of the hairs and can be unsightly, so always apply thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After having some variation of the goatee for years, I decided to finally pull the trigger and grow a beard for the first time this past July. Having accumulated a minimal amount of stubble everywhere my goatee wasn&#x27;t, I began to peruse the &amp;#34;beard product section&amp;#34; here at Amazon. I was giddy with expectation at my impending manliness. Being a deodorant and minimal grooming kind of guy, I was looking for something that would make me look presentable and smell good at the same time. I&#x27;m also married, so there&#x27;s a certain amount of the &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t really care&amp;#34; in my day-to-day grooming and appearance. Beard Balm is the stuff. Whether you&#x27;re a rough looking Navy Seal blending in with the locals, a &amp;#34;Brawny&amp;#34; spokesmodel selling paper towels, or a competitor heading to some international beard tournament, Beard Balm is for you. It keeps my medium length whiskers put and it smells good....nuff said. Buy it.</li>
            <li> i recently decided to grow my beard for a year without trimming and it didnt take long before it got a little unkempt. i bought beard balm to try and tame it a bit and it totally worked. it made my beard soft and silky. the odor took some getting used to but not much. now i love the smell. i highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> This has a great natural smell to it, and is not too slick. Just right. Really conditions beard well!</li>
            <li> It works well. Helps straighten and tame my crazy hairs, and helps hide my thin patches. The smell takes a bit to get used to, but it doesn&#x27;t stink. This product works well.</li>
            <li> A fantastic beard growing product. I have noticed a large increase in black hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! I use it everyday and it makes my beard look magical....at least that&#x27;s what my wife says :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can of Beard Balm now, and there will be a 3rd one soon! People have commented on the smell, but I actually find it to be a good smell, and my wife hasn&#x27;t complained at all. The balm provides some hold for my medium length beard and prevents some of the &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; hairs. It gives my dark beard a little shine and since I started using it a few months ago, my beard is definitely softer and more manageable. Finally, the company seems like a solid group. They interact with their customers and treat them well. By the TV segment I saw, they take great pride in their work and have produced a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have received compliments when using it. It helps keep fly away hairs in place, softens the beard hairs and gives it a nice sheen. I will be a regular user.</li>
            <li> Good product works well smells good all in all idea say good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this before I got a tin of beard balm my beard would grow but after a month or so would just get tangled knotted and I&#x27;d shave it off. Now when I grow my beard it&#x27;s soft and maybe one or two knots that comb or brush out with no issue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now boughten my third can of this. I love it. Each can lasts about a month I would say.&lt;br /&gt; It helps tame your beard, also making it soft and the smell is good! Def recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> Great item, got here in no time. Very good quality product that I use everyday. I recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> This just worked ok for my husband. His beard was dry and this didn&#x27;t change that. It smells ok at first but I noticed that when we wake up the next day before he showers it smells really bad. To me it smells like throw up after 24 hours on the beard. That&#x27;s not the smell you want to wake up too. Coffee? Yes! Bacon? You bet! But not this! Ewwwuuuuu!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one star because he only used it for about 2 weeks. It might have worked better if we used it longer.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my beard shiny. I like it.</li>
            <li> Best beard product you can uy. Everyone with hair should get this!!</li>
            <li> All my previous attempts at growing a beard ended when the itching got to be too much. Beard Balm has kept my face itch free through a very dry cold winter and I have what I have been told is a pretty good beard. This is a great product and I will buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin. It feels good on the beard as well as on dry hands. I love the smell. Detroit vs everybody.</li>
            <li> Balm is OK. Smells nice but really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Expected more! Thought it would help with some of the Friz.</li>
            <li> I used to be troubled by beardruff and a wirery, itchy beard that looked more like a brillo pad than glorious manhood. Sometimes using conditioner in my beard would help, but it would be a short term solution as by the end of the day, my beard would be unruly again. That has all gone away with Beard Balm. My beard now shines and glistens in the sun and also smells great. It&#x27;s no longer itchy and is soft to the touch. Just a little dab will do you. If you use too much, it will almost have a jehri curl effect. Anyhow, if you have a beard, use Beard Balm!</li>
            <li> Fast and accurate. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works well, just like it says. But if you have a job that requires to speak on the phone through out the day, watch out, this stuff will leave residue on you cell phones screen causing constant cleaning</li>
            <li> An excellent, reasonably priced grooming aid for beards.</li>
            <li> This product is &#x27;Honest&#x27;ly vastly superior to any of its competitors that it&#x27;s worth trying. If you have been disappointed with other products you should give Beard Balm a try and if you have not been disappointed you should try it and see how much better this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for every beard from the Movember novice to a certified Brooklyn Hipster and everybody in between.</li>
            <li> i want to give it zero stars!!  oily junk.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way and it leaves my beard nice and soft.  Has a pleasant (faint) odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever, around 6 months. It works well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Have this to my husband for Christmas and he&#x27;s excited to user this almost everyday. He says the cleaners smell good and not over powering and brushes his beard a couple times a day</li>
            <li> love the smell and does the job quite well keeping mustache soft.</li>
            <li> Conditions well, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. Can&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li> One of the better beard products I&#x27;ve tried.  I have a curly, thick, and sometimes dry beard and I use this balm daily to keep it in check.</li>
            <li> Gives a shine and improves look</li>
            <li> Great balm, helps keep your beard neat and smell good</li>
            <li> This feels great on my beard.  I have an almost completely gray beard and it didn&#x27;t discolor it and could reign in those wild hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, very faint.  I normally use beard oils and this was what I needed to help give me better control and some hold to keep the beard looking spot on all day.  A little goes a long way, so go lightly, rub it between your hands until it melts, then apply.  You&#x27;ll know if you need more,  so start of with less using this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...and it&#x27;s from Detroit!!</li>
            <li> Still my favorite after trying others I always go back to this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> My brother said, this is absolutely the only product out, that has made his Beard. feel like baby hair. And he definitely does not have baby hair. He has tried a lot of different products and none has stood up. So I ordered him several. Spread the word.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so don&#x27;t get the 1-Star wrong.  The 1-Star is due to the way this one (1) item was packaged and sent to me.  The box was about 7&amp;#34; long, 5&amp;#34; wide, and 3&amp;#34; tall.  The Beard Balm can is probably less than 3&amp;#34; wide.  So why the HUGE box!?!?!  When the box arrived, I could tell something was wrong.  The box looked like someone melted wax all over the bottom and once opened, the balm was melted and ended up dripping out of the box.  Talk about P.O.&#x27;d!!!  Without some type of plastic wrapping around the balm can, the lid will come off and the balm will go EVERYWHERE!  Again, I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm (this exact product) for over two years now and absolutely love it!  Just really upset that I had to receive it, melted and all over the place... I&#x27;ll stop my ranting.  BTW, I just reordered some more.  As mad as I am, still need this stuff to make my beard happy.  UPDATE:  Received my second can and it came in a nice small yellow padded envelope, inside a larger box (with other items I ordered).  Now THAT&#x27;S how it should be packaged.  The lid was able to stay on and even if the package got to 100 degrees, I feel the content would have remained inside the can and not all over the box, and me.  Changed my rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the one you want. Smells amazing and does a great job softening your beard. Just the right consistency, not runny and not too hard. I tried the Honest Amish brand, but it was too hard and didn&#x27;t smell as nice. To each their own, but I believe balm like this is far better than oil in that the balm allows you to work in and distribute the product more evenly. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Greasy and basically a cheap hand salve. Worst $16 I&#x27;ve ever spent. You&#x27;re better off putting olive oil in your beard than this s***.</li>
            <li> The lemon smell is excellent.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Bought this months ago, still plenty left. Makes my beard much, much softer and alive looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times and can&#x27;t bring myself to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I know so far, it appears to work just about as good any other beard balm, however I knocked 2 stars because of the smell. It has a medicine smell like neosporin that sticks with you all day long.</li>
            <li> It works well as a balm, but I&#x27;m just not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my beard soft</li>
            <li> I have used this for a bit and although I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference with my beard I love the scent. It takes me back to when I was a kid and my dad used Top Brass everyday. This is how a man should smell after a shower.</li>
            <li> The only beard conditioner I&#x27;ve really used, but I see no reason to look into others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my fairly long beard soft, manageable, and looking clean and slick, but not shiny or gunky. I use it religiously daily after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA (by an awesome company) of all-natural ingredients. Fantastic earthy, organic scent that quickly dissipates but maintains its effect.</li>
            <li> So far its amazing. Really calmed down my beard.</li>
            <li> This product pretty much lived up to what it said it was, far as making your beard easy to comb, nice scent &amp; shine also the reduce of hair shedding,  but far as beard growth!, I don&#x27;t know maybe it&#x27;s me. But I like it because it does make it a lot easier to maintain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first tin of this stuff. My beard is nice and soft and the skin under the hair is no longer flakey. My beard is thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps control wild beard hair. Does have a slight antiseptic smell though. You do not need much to get the job done so the smell doesn&#x27;t get that strong.</li>
            <li> great stuff very easy to apply smells great and definitely makes the beard look awesome would recommend and we&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing again</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that this stuff does a great job of softening and conditioning my beard. But the smell could be improved greatly. My wife will not kiss or hug me within an hour of applying this product. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes it worth it or not. After this runs out I will try another brand. Right now, Honest Amish is the best beard balm that I have used so far, and may go back to it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Will continue using</li>
            <li> Really great product. Lasts forever and I saw results less than a week after using it. I recommend to all who wish to grow a healthy beard</li>
            <li> Perfect for longs beards</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and I don&#x27;t regret getting it. However, it does have somewhat of a medicinal smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a non-greasy beard balm that melts easily at your touch, somewhere between the consistency of butter and vegetable shortening. When I put it on my beard, it felt nourished, not waxy or greasy. It does provide a bit of hold, but not enough to style my moustache. Part of the reason is its inclusion of lanolin, a type of purified wool &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;, and lanolin is sold as a moisturizing ingredient (an expensive one, though) for a number of uses. This is the most similar thing to human sebum, the natural conditioner for your beard, found in nature. In addition, its inclusion of grapeseed oil as a carrier oil is proof to me that they know what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s a prime choice for this type of product and is high in fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product replaces the oils you wash out of your beard, sealing in the moisture. I was surprised at the softness of my beard after use, and I will keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pine-ish and lemony, but very subtle. I would even say it&#x27;s very pleasant. I would not hesitate to order this again</li>
            <li> Straight out of Detroit; this product arrived quickly. They must have known how badly my whiskers needed to be tamed. I was eager to peel it out of the box and apply it to the 6-week extension of my face that I am currently calling \\&quot;my natural wolfman.\\&quot; Once applied, the balm gave my beastly grizzle a slight glint; which my wife liked. The next morning, my grizzly bear was noticeably softer. After a good washing and rinsing, the second application hailed even better results than the first. I suggest you apply it while your whiskers are still mildly damp.  Overall, the scent is subtle, and my wife didn&#x27;t mind it. I have no doubt this product will help keep my skin well-conditioned beneath the curl of the burl, and will do well to tame my beast.  -Months later... my face-jacket has grown significantly more burly; it looks and smells extraordinary thanks to our pals at Beard Balm. Guys at work ask me, \\&quot;How do you do the beard thing? I tried once but bailed out because of the itching... blah, blah, blah\\&quot; To which I simply reply, \\&quot;Get Beard Balm and be a man; problem solved.\\&quot;  I use Beard Balm daily; my beard is now capable of transcending from metal shows into meeting rooms. The beard-envy is clearly evident, as the clean-shaven colleagues of the office stroke their naked baby&#x27;s-bottom jaws wishing they had the ability to summon the great wisdom of the burl.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby, who has been using beard oil.  It smells amazing, very natural, and keeps his beard soft and tamed.  He likes it too ;)  We love that it&#x27;s a Detroit made product, we like to support local small businesses, wherever we live.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried out quite a few different beard oils, waxes, and balms. This one is my new favorite! One of my main reasons for growing my beard out initially was because I started getting dry skin on my lower face. This balm seems to have really moisturized my skin like no other product of this nature has been able to do for me! It is made from natural oils and beeswax that comes from Michigan! This particular balm is made in Detroit. I normally like unscented beard products, but this one has a very faint citrus smell, which I believe is from the lemon oil used in the making of it. I not only enjoy the smell, but I also like the way it makes my beard feel. It&#x27;s so plush and more manageable than ever before. You can apply this to a dry beard or a damp beard. It is in a semi solid state, so you may need to warm it up in your pocket or run it under warm water for about a minute before using it. I have a pretty big beard as you can see in the picture provided, but I only had to use a very small amount of this product. A little goes a long way, so you are really getting your money&#x27;s worth out of it. I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my opinion of it in a review. I highly recommend this USA made product to anyone with any amount of facial hair!</li>
            <li> I cant get past the smell</li>
            <li> This product is great and makes my beard feel fantastic. At first it seems a little greasy, but it gets absorbed into the hair, making it feel healthier and more lustrous. A strong citrus fragrance, almost citronella-esk, is a little overbearing at first, but lightens over time.  Every beard should get some good lovin&#x27;, using Beard Balm, is a good way.</li>
            <li> Works well, gives some shine to beard!</li>
            <li> A great product that does exactly what it should. Leaves my beard feeling softer, and with a slight glow. The smell is not bad, it&#x27;s just a subtle smell that goes away after an hour. Good luck with your beard</li>
            <li> A great product for smoothing out thick beard hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  New to having a real beard and this was the first product I tried.  Loved it, but thought as I was about out that I would try another brand.  Hated the other brand after using this....will be going back to this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using a little Beard Balm every day for the past few months, and my beard has completely stopped itching.  Smells nice, too.  I just got my second can.</li>
            <li> Got a beard? Rebel of the razor? Get this. It will make your beard shine in all its manly glory. It smells great, moisturizes, tames the untamable beard hairs. Made in the good ol&#x27; USofA by a bunch of awesome bearded guys that know what your face needs.  Get it. Now.</li>
            <li> At first the beeswax was something I was not use to, after a few months and a couple tins in I really quite enjoy the smell.  I must say I can not use much on my mustache though as if I have it constantly in my nostrils it does get too strong for me.  I apply this every day when I get out of the shower while the beard is still warm and slightly damp.  I&#x27;ve done before and after photos and this product seriously brings my beard to another level when I use it, it looks as if it&#x27;s a totally different beard once I apply it compared to just my beard being brushed.  My beard is beyond soft now, my girlfriend never complains about it anymore as she did before I began using this product and conditioning my facial hair.  I&#x27;ve used other products, but I find myself using this more than others.  The customer support is top notch, they don&#x27;t mess around.  If you haven&#x27;t talked with them, and you ever need anything they don&#x27;t treat you like a stranger. I will continue to support Beard Balm and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Having discovered Beard Balm, a self-described badass product from Detroit (which could totally use everyone&#x27;s support), I had to get some for my husband to at least try it out, because why not?  It turns out it was more than just a gag gift.  The stuff works.  While I absolutely love my husband&#x27;s beard (seriously we have an agreement: I keep my hair long and he doesn&#x27;t go clean shaven), he doesn&#x27;t always have time for proper grooming and mainenance, so his normally awesome beard can take on that &#x27;just found my way back to civilization after months lost on the Appalacian Trail&#x27; look with the texture of steel wool.  But the balm can actually wrangle it back under control and make it cuddlably soft.  The only caveat is that it does have a powerful scent to it (or at least the kind I bought does, which since it doesn&#x27;t have any special name on it, I am going to assume is original flavor), so I&#x27;d advise buying just one at first to see if that&#x27;s a deal breaker for you.  I acclimated to it, so Beard Balms still one of our go to products, but I feel I should warn you.  Otherwise the stuff is amazing and very amusing if you bother to read the instructions (which we were gloriously not deprived of thanks to my feminine intuition and the fact that I just like to read).</li>
            <li> Very effective beard tamer and promoter through some of the first couple of months during the wild times. I was a skeptic at first but now I am a believer with a full nicely groomed beard.</li>
            <li> Started using this balm for my 3 week old beard, can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s going to continue to work well as my beard grows but so far it has given me a decent hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the smell, it&#x27;s not a bad smell just not what I wanted.  It&#x27;s tough to describe, I can smell the lemon and a bit of the eucalyptus but overall it&#x27;s off putting.  It&#x27;s a masculine scent for sure just not for everyone.  My wife didn&#x27;t like it so as soon as it&#x27;s gone i&#x27;ll be trying out another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this balm now for 2 months, the smell was \\&quot;off putting\\&quot; at first but I got used to it and actually enjoy it now.  It makes me think of an old barbershop from the 50&#x27;s, like I said originally it&#x27;s a very masculine scent which I grew to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd UPDATE: I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 months and I still have plenty left (I use it about 2-3 times a week). It sort of helps with keeping my beard tidy but it&#x27;s not a huge difference overall. This product is mainly good at keeping your beard soft, I personally use it in combination with jojoba oil and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Works great!!</li>
            <li> I will compare this product to honest amish and dr ganix since i have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ill start off by saying that when it comes to how your beard will feel and how your skin will feel (itch relief) all 3 products are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product will help slightly more w. a hold, although minimal, thanks to the bees wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is cheaper than the other 2 by a couple bucks and is prime which is a big pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that takes this to a 4 compared to the 5 i gave the other two is the smell. dont get me wrong, it doesnt smell bad. but the other two IMO smell good. this one smells like a regular ointment. while i dont hate the smell its def not something i like to smell like the other 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line if you dont care about the smell (keep in mind the aroma of all 3 products goes away rather quickly once applied) get this just bc of the price/prime and bees wax. if the smell is a difference maker go w. one of the other 2.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice beard balm. My boyfriend has a very experienced beard (since 1975) and it grows into wolf proportions rather quickly. Balms in general help keep his skin conditioned below and the strays from getting too prickly. The Original Scent Beard Balm has a refreshing aroma - there&#x27;s a very light eucalyptus aroma that disappears almost immediately. The balm (you shouldn&#x27;t need much) smooths into his beard rather quickly without leaving any clumps or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Beard balm as a gift for my brother who has a wild unruly beard.  He said it had a pleasant smell.  He  found it was best to use after taking a shower when his beard was a little damp.  He only needed a little bit.  It really conditioned his beard and made it much more healthy looking.  His beard is smooth and soft.  He is definitely going to continue using and it should last him a while.</li>
            <li> Strong smell but good</li>
            <li> Clean and crisp scent -- heavier on the lemon, and then a light note of geranium, I can&#x27;t really notice the eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lighter conditioner, not as heavy as the Honest Amish Beard balm. Doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of control, but it does soften my beard and make it sit a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Been using on my 8 month old beard. It does have a little odor to it. Wife hasn&#x27;t even mentioned a softer or shinier appearance. I&#x27;ll keep using until finished and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly. This is the first balm I have tried for my beard and it really keeps the hair soft and in place. Its all natural and made in the greatest country in the world, the USA. Highly recommend it to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, however I find it is much more oily than many other beard balms and oils. Leaves a residue whenever beard is touched.</li>
            <li> Hubby is excited to try.</li>
            <li> Very greasy. Does not soak into the beard at all. Can&#x27;t say that it did a very good job of smoothing my beard because when I used it, I didn&#x27;t want to touch the beard or else I got it all over my hands. This was the first beard balm/oil that I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.</li>
            <li> If your new to the beard balm game you need to pick you up some of this stuff!! It tames your man beard and will definitely get the ladies riled up and by the time you know it you will have ladies from every direction wanting to stroke your beard! Been using for a couple of days and i already have to fight women off me everyday!! I used to have dry skin underneath the beard but this has help to moistureize and make my beard soft and smell good!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face drape super soft. My even noticed the added softness. Thanks Beard Balm (insert thumbs up).</li>
            <li> I have a pretty wild beard, so I was hoping Beard Balm would be the solution to my woes. Does it work? Well, yes, but not as good as I had hoped. I can style it with some success. It is fairly greasy and takes a minute to wash off of your hands after styling. Like many other reviewers have pointed out, the smell is not for everyone. I didn&#x27;t hate the smell, but my wife didn&#x27;t care for it at all. It has an almost doctors&#x27; office like aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it works fairly well. Would I buy it again? Only after trying a few other products first.</li>
            <li> Ehh, I never tried anything like this before and it turned out to just be something that smells ok and makes my beard bushy. just sits in my drawer now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son because he had started a very nice beard. I bought the Beard Balm and a boars hair brush. I also got him goatee and beard softener pads but the didn&#x27;t work. My son had the most out of control beard. Once he started using the beard balm brush his beard was healthier looking, fuller, and even the parts of his beard that grew in all different directions looked perfect after 3 weeks using just this Beard Balm and  boars hair beard brush.he loves the smell too and has very rysensitive skin and will breAk out to most any product you put on his farce. He hasn&#x27;t had a break out or ingrown hairs. Anyone wanting to grow a healthy beard should use this.</li>
            <li> First time buying something to put on my beard. This is a great product, makes my beard soft and keeps it from looking all crazy. My wife appreciates the softness and the Beard Balm has a clean smell to it. Great product, I&#x27;ll use it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I started using it just to see if it&#x27;d actually do anything notable. It actually has helped my facial hair grow longer, be softer, and generally look better. I also enjoy the smell, it fades away after awhile though so if you don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t worry. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this stuff to do much, but after a bearded friend of mine recommended some type of conditioning oil I started doing some research and landed on this product. I must say that I initially chose this product over some of its competitors because I, much like this product, was made in Detroit. I&#x27;ve been impressed with it, though, and after about a week of use I can honestly say I&#x27;ll be ordering another tin when this one starts to run low. I keep my beard around 3/4&amp;#34; in length and Beard Balm softens and conditions quite nicely. The smell was pretty strong and a bit gross when I first got it, but after a week or so the scent has dissipated and it&#x27;s much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint was with the packaging. Since my order was fulfilled by Amazon, I can&#x27;t really fault the manufacturer for this, but Amazon had tossed the tin of Beard Balm in a padded envelope with another item I had ordered. The heat it experienced in shipping caused the Beard Balm to melt a little and some of the oils leaked out all over the other product in the envelope.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it, but doesn&#x27;t use it enough to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased and was hoping it would have a pleasant scent.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s nothing you&#x27;d ever want put into a spray bottle to use before...anything really.  Don&#x27;t let that be a deal breaker though since the scent only lasts a few minutes and will probably be gone well before you head out of the door to start your day.  I gave it 4 stars because of it&#x27;s ability to tame my scraggly beard into submission while also making it much softer.  After the first application I could feel and see the difference- it went from wiry to silky smooth immediately.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, just like everyone else and the directions state, all you need is about the size of a pea to coat a 2&amp;#34; beard.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, go ahead and give it a shot.  It&#x27;s fairly cheap for the amount you&#x27;re getting and it will most definitely approve the appearance and feel if you&#x27;re not using any kind of leave in conditioner currently.</li>
            <li> It works to grow faster</li>
            <li> Awesome beard balm. Keeps my beard groomed nicely.</li>
            <li> I have a decent-sized beard so was worried that I would burn through this product. A little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t use it ALL the time, but try and use it at least 2 out of 3 days. I can definitely tell a difference in the days that I use it, and I started getting compliments at work on my new found furry beauty. Some on here says it smell like medicine. I disagree. It does smell like bees wax (not unpleasant), but as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply the smell goes away shortly after application.</li>
            <li> I have been using oils for a long time and had little to no success.  Beard balm immediately put the life back into my beard!  It&#x27;s smells, feels, and LOOKS 100% better!  Order plenty so you don&#x27;t run out!  Don&#x27;t look any further, THIS is THE BEST PRODUCT for growing a clean, smooth, and healthy beard!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, works as advertised. The smell was okay but I got used to it. I think I put too much in on my first use but once I figured out how much to put in it looked a lot better. Overall I think this perfect for anybody with a nice full beard.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star review based on the 5 star review my girlfriend gave to the smoochability of my face after applying the product.  My face pet is soft, smooth, and smells manly yet pleasant.  Love it too because it&#x27;s one of the few things I order here in Atlanta that is from my beloved Detroit home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for over a year and using my wife&#x27;s leave-in conditioner after cleaning it.  After a while I noticed it left my face oily and I would started breaking out a lot.  I decided to get a product designed for beards.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face has cleared up, the beard looks better, lays flat and is much softer.  I would definitely recommend this for others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He says it makes him look good, feel good, and smell good! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;He loves how soft and healthy his beard is now and so do I. It does not look scraggly anymore. Instead it looks full of life, shiny, and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves no residue and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Just recently started growing a beard again after many attempts. I would  cut it off before it reached its potential, but this time around I said let look into hygiene products for beards. So here I am. I decided to go with this product  verses others due to the fact that it contains eucalyptus , which is great for healthy hair growth. I really like the way this product makes my beard feel. It makes it manageable and  so far I&#x27;m glad I chose it over others.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty skeptical about whether or not this stuff would work, but I have to say it works as advertised. I have really noticed a calming of my beard. It is softer, has fewer weird curls in random places, fewer runaway hairs, and it smells nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to bring it with me while traveling and didn&#x27;t use it for a few days and I could really tell the difference in my beard. But it only took one application upon my return to get my beard right back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this stuff works and it is not that expensive. So get it if you want to rein in your beard.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard balm so far that I have used. A little bit goes a long ways. Keeps my beard from drying out and turning into a briar patch.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has all day control to stop beard friz. It keeps your beard moisturized without being greasy. Great product made in the USA</li>
            <li> The unpleasant smell was so strong that I had to return it. When something is chemical/medicine smelling you tend to get irritated when it&#x27;s directly under your nose.</li>
            <li> Kind of has a neutral smell. Feels more like a coating than a conditioner. Comparable in texture to Burt&#x27;s Hand Salve. Keeps my wild beard mostly down which is nice for work, Has a nice luster that seems to last all day. After application does not leave an oily residue on my hands, I seem to play with my beard a lot. That may be why it&#x27;s so wild. Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s been using it for a month now.  His beard was immediately &amp;#34;contained&amp;#34; when the product was applied, which means he didn&#x27;t have random hairs going in different directions.  Also, the more he uses it, the softer and less bristle it becomes. Great product!</li>
            <li> Works well. Definitely hydrates the beard well. Adds a little volume. I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell but it fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Makes a huge difference! Now my beard doesn&#x27;t look so unruly while at work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve got a pretty bushy beard and beard balm allows me to tame the bushy down enough to look presentable without looking overly manicured, and the smell is subtle and not overpowering. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for about 5 months.. It&#x27;s now about 2.5&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; long and can get pretty wild at times. Prior to Beard Balm I was using coconut oil, but it did little to control my mane.  Since switching to this product I&#x27;ve been able to better shape and control my beard while at the same time conditioning it. The smell is pretty subtle and doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my beard out a few times but this is the first time that I have done it with the help from Beard Balm.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I was impressed from first popping the can open.  It has a manly smell but not over-powering.  The waxiness of it was perfect for me, I didn&#x27;t want to shape my beard I just wanted to tame it and it was just waxy enough to wrangle any strays back into place.  Not to mention, the Mrs thought that is was much softer, so that was a plus.    Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to take their beard to the next level.</li>
            <li> Stop the madness and buy some Balm ! Billions of whiskers can&#x27;t be wrong ! This stuff rocks, I use it all the time. Your beard will feel and look.... so fine !!</li>
            <li> I usually regret letting my beard grow after about a week. Combing it is like combing a Brillo pad. I bought beard balm after reading the reviews and loved it. The smell is different but it&#x27;s definitely more pleasant than bad. Unlike other beard products I&#x27;ve used this one usually lasts very long. It keeps the beard hydrated/shining and makes combing and brushing really easy. Overall a good beard product. Definitely the best I&#x27;ve used to far.</li>
            <li> I use alternatively with an unscented beard oil and I prefer this to the oil, for a quicker and longer-lasting treatment. I could tell a difference in feel and texture within a week of use. My wife agreed and likes the softness. I tried a few difference applications styles since it is a bit greasy. Ended up using my beard brush and working it through to the skin. Seemed to work pretty well. It does have a unique scent, which is not for everyone but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive. It just took a little getting used to. Lasted me about 3 months of 3-4 times per week use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My beard feels very soft using this.  It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I put it in in the evening after work, though, as the scent is a tad too &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to want to wear at work.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell by any means, and I find it to be kind of nice, but it&#x27;s by no means scented like some sort of hair product or aftershave.  All in all, very good product.</li>
            <li> The balm is a bit smaller than I expected but I bought this as a birthday gift and they love this product; especially the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is a great product!  I&#x27;ve tried others and this is hands down the best balm for your beard.  Consistency makes it easy to use and the smell is great.  Help manage morning beard and will not leave your beard oily or shiny.  Remember your beard is a lighthouse to lost, beardless souls, seeking true manhood.  Give them the best advice you can offer; stop shaving, use Beard Balm and enjoy your passport to awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.&amp;#34; - William Shakespeare</li>
            <li> I have a rather long beard. I&#x27;ve used several products to control it.  I really like Beard Balm.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it does control the beard.  I like the manly aroma as I use it.</li>
            <li> One of the best personal grooming products I have purchased in some time. Sent it subtle, the balm absorbs and applies nicely with no carry off onto clothes.</li>
            <li> First off, the product description made me giggle. It said:&lt;br /&gt;The Best Way to Grow an Awesome Beard!&lt;br /&gt;Handmade in Detroit by a bunch of bearded dudes.&lt;br /&gt;The best gift you can give a man! Softens whiskers, relieves dry itchy skin&lt;br /&gt;All natural, easy to use, essential for the modern man.&lt;br /&gt;Our popular original scent - a blend of lemon peel, eucalyptus leaf, and geranium flower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman, I HATE products that men use that make them STINK. THIS beard conditioner smells like it&#x27;s made for the man and also made for a woman to love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started the review I said how much the description cracked me up, but the back is even cuter and funnier. I love this company, I wish these fellas were in my group of friends cause they seem to have an awesome sense of humor!!! I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review, but this company has found a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, really: It&#x27;s not greasy, allows for a little shaping but doesn&#x27;t get stiff like stache wax, has a pleasantly subtle smell, and my wife has been turning away women who wanna run their fingers through my beard&#x27;s illustriousness in droves at all hours.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is spot-on, and shipping is seamless.</li>
            <li> I have had this can for several weeks now and I find myself using it about 1 time a week now. It was too greasy for me every day but when I get a beard afro going on, this stuff tames it. I love the scent. Kinda lemony musk?&lt;br /&gt;I have learned to not use soap every day on your beard in the shower and to sometimes use some of the wifes fancy hair conditioner. I will definitely use this again, but it has left oily stains on the neck part of some of my favorite white shirts.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is awesome! I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it! After I used it for about two weeks my beard was noticeably more heathy and manageable, I turned two of my buddies to beard balm as well and they love it!! It&#x27;s a wonderful product, keep up the good work guys! And they also have a non scented balm as well if you are weary of the scent</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I was but a baby-faced lad with mere aspirations to manliness.  Through sheer force of will I was able to grow a virile manscape the likes of which this world has rarely seen before.  But alas, my macho mansage was wild and barbarous.  Upon attempting to give my masculine patronage to a local tavern, I was mistaken for a vagrant and promptly asked to leave.  This was a low point in my life, but the epic levels of testosterone coursing through my veins ensured that defeat was not an option.  What comes after rampant, untamed progress?  Refinement!  I resolved to turn my unrefined manliness into a fine-tuned machine of vigorous and well-groomed manglory.  And that&#x27;s where Beard Balm came in!  With a pair of trimming scissors and mild application of this wondrous concoction, I was transformed from &#x27;the noble savage&#x27; into true nobility.  The end result was a beard so thick, neat, and gleaming that women everywhere in its line of sight now swoon uncontrollably.  No manly fellow worth his salt should ever leave the house without a healthy application of the miracle mixture that is Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My beard has never been softer or happier.  As a long time hair farmer, I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just comb it into your face fur and enjoy. It doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that. The smell was strange the first time I used it, but just suck it up and enjoy your new awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have found it best to slip the teeth of my comb over the rim of the can and scrape out a little bit of Balm, then combing it into the hairs. You will waste less balm and the balm still in the can stays neat and flat. I first tried to scrape some out with a fingertip and wipe it on, but that didn&#x27;t work at all. It may work for short beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is fairly long at about 4 inches, so I usually dip the comb twice but be careful not to use too much Balm or your beard will be shiny and have a greasy feel to it. However, I happen to like how it makes my hands feel so I always over-apply. Your experience may vary. A little bit will go a long way, it just takes more comb strokes to evenly apply small amounts. It will coat your comb like paint coats a brush, so if you want a thin coat, brush more than you dip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to work outdoors all day so it makes more sense for me to apply Beard Balm after work. Otherwise all sorts of wildlife and pollen will stick to it. After work I comb in the Balm and all of the tangles and wild hairs are very easily tamed with the bare minimum of pulled hairs. The detritus in your now-glowing beard will mostly be sticking to your comb rather than your face. Wash your hands with some soap and use some of the lather to clean the oils from the comb. Voila! You now have an awesome looking beard and a clean comb, soft hands and a spring in your step.</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant smelling and very easy to handle....it does melt quickly and is easy to apply to you beard....do not get the wrong idea...this is not a sculpting wax or a gloss...this is a leave in conditioner.....the smell is pleasant and my wife likes it more than Dr. Fuzzworthy.....floral notes....i love it......it does what i need to to do for my beard and that is make it soft and managable.....i would reccomend this to anyone looking for this type of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this and I love the look it gives my beard and feel but enjoy the smell very much</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick.  I&#x27;m not new to beards but I am new to Beard Balm.  I&#x27;ve got about a 6&amp;#34; Lions mane growing here and let me tell you it gets rowdy.  I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with the ladies and I thought maybe its because my beard is outta control!  Bring in Beard Balm, just a finger tips amount combed through a damp freshly washed beard and PRESTO It gives me the shape, shine, and pleasant scent I was looking for.  This stuff gives me a good hold and control over my mane all day and well into the night.  I landed a date tonight, you better believe Beard Balm played a part in that.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, this stuff is the Balm! (Pun Intended)&lt;br /&gt;Those pesky hairs that poke out all awkward.. No need to cut them. Balm them.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it has a nice aroma to it that lasts a little bit. Just long enough.&lt;br /&gt;(Mic drop)</li>
            <li> I have a particularly snaggly beard (which I love) but hate to comb. Here is why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s made in Detroit by a company that seems very committed to the craft.&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;3) A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;4) A little turns my comb into a friend, not weapon to be feared.&lt;br /&gt;5) All the little hairs submit to this goo over time.&lt;br /&gt;6) It&#x27;s also great as a hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple. It works. Go get some.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product to soften the beard, I was using it with stubble basically(not a good idea). I gave up on the product until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard grew! (with time, this isn&#x27;t a hair supplement) I use this product on my beard and it really darkens, shines and softens the manly feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;*Only apply it while the beard is a real beard. Don&#x27;t apply on stubble; my skin reacted to it.&lt;br /&gt;*Rub your fingers over the balm, then rub in your fingers, then rub lightly onto the hair.&lt;br /&gt;*It smells(good), don&#x27;t rub too much or you&#x27;ll get tired of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;*Lastly, buy a Boars hair brush. Brush then balm into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love if this company offered other scents. I wish the cost was less.</li>
            <li> I like the lemony/citrus scent. maybe not for everyday use and not for a scent for everyone but I like it. my girlfriend is a bit opposed to it though but I got it for me anyway. it feels a bit oily but after using it for a week I noticed my beard got quite a bit softer.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my beard feel and I love the smell! Highly recommended for the razor blade rebels!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work its a waste of money and time unless you have a beard and want to  make it soft</li>
            <li> A bit greasy, but I might be applying too heavily. I normally use a little every day to tame my fly-aways that I&#x27;m too stubborn to trim. This product has great hair maintence, I used it on a bit of hair my girlfriend had fried with a straightener and now she won&#x27;t give it back. So its not great for holding your beard in place (though I have a full beard) it is great for keeping it healthy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Its just the scent that I had a problem with. I recommend the non scented version to anyone in the future. The balms effects on the beard are fine.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because I believe tin should b a larger. Good smell and keeps beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Got this after I already got a short haircut &amp; shaved off my hirsute manliness for the spring. Turns out you can use Beard Balm in your hair as &#x27;product&#x27; (avoiding term &#x27;hair gel&#x27; because of &#x27;Something About Mary&#x27; connotations.) My well-coiffed mane is getting double-takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard Balm smells great. I&#x27;m pumping out pheromones I never knew I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression is that Beard Balm will last longer than an industrial-size tube of toothpaste. Definitely going to re-up after the millennium as it seems it might last until then.</li>
            <li> My beard is at that awkward stage of growing and doing whatever the hell it wants... nothing was working. A friend told about this stuff. I have never wrote a review but this deserves it. It almost immediately brought the best out of my beard it&#x27;s not all lopsided it&#x27;s not greasy it just looks great! Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> This beard balm is wonderful. At first I was sceptic to buy this product from all the reviews. Some said the product didn&#x27;t smell quit right while others said it simply didn&#x27;t work. Well, for me it is wonderful! It gives my beard a more fuller and shinier looked. Me as well as my wife enjoy the smell and for the price it&#x27;s a great buy! I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  His beard is now healthy and it smells really good. I will definitely buy this for my husband again.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  Arrived quickly.  Works great. Keeps my beard soft all day long and I don&#x27;t use a lot. I have used other products and by far this is the best thing.</li>
            <li> Great product, solid performance essential for any beard growing gent!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m obsessed with what this does to my beard. i want to put it in my pubes.</li>
            <li> For the good:  It definitely does its job with respect to softening, and gives your beard a more finished/groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good:  Though the smell didn&#x27;t bother me like some other reviewers, it did ruin the collars of a couple of my dress shirts, leaving a greasy ring that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  This may be my fault due to using too much or using it in the morning rather than at night and letting it dry, but still a negative effect.</li>
            <li> Beard balm smells good and makes the beard feel smooth. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and the balm kept me blemish free. I&#x27;ve always hated facial beard itch.  This stuff reduced the itch to &amp;#34;tolerable&amp;#34;. I give it 4 stars because the can is pretty small; although one could argue a good product is worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is awesome. It helps my coarse beard come together and gives it a great shine.  It&#x27;s also very easy to use and not sticky either.  It&#x27;s compact and easy to carry around when traveling.  My girl also loves the smell, super clean. Will never trust my beard with anything else. Great product.</li>
            <li> For my first time growing a beard (beyond 5:00 shadow) I knew I needed a good product to maintain my beard and keep a clean look. The Beard Balm was highly reviewed, so I took a leap and it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I keep a short beard, I have curly hair and the beard balm actually keeps those little beasts tamed and straighter than tgey would be without any product. And it smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, to boot! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and t works well.  It has a better hold than other balms that I&#x27;ve tired and spreads easily.  Personally I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, though I&#x27;ve gotten used to and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore, but some of the ladies like it.....which is what matters in the end.</li>
            <li> Love Beard Balm! Made my beard feel so much better: fuller, cleaner, all around better. Highly recommend to any beard enthusiast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks.  The smell (pine) is like others have described it (it&#x27;s not bad) and fades within a couple of hours.  Though the delivery was very quick, it didn&#x27;t come with directions.  I had to youtube the directions on applying (my first beard).  I could complain about the packaging but I&#x27;m not a chick.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is the bomb!! I&#x27;ve been using beard balm for about a year now and it is the ONLY product I use in my beard. I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m given 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the fact it took a few days to get used to the scent. I&#x27;ve grown to love it now, but it does take time.</li>
            <li> Conditions moistens and gives a nice flat shine after it sets in. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Arrived.  However the lid was off and product may have dried out.</li>
            <li> Many people seem to be put off by the smell, but to me it is not that bad and it goes away after about 10 minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i first used it on my 3 month old growth, it took a bit more than what I use now to get it conditioned.  After about a week of liberal use to help nourish and soften the scrub, I now only use a small pea sized portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how smooth and silky it makes beard feel. It also makes it shine and look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li> Love the way Beard Balm leaves my beard! The smell is all man, nothing &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;! And definitely not too greasy either!</li>
            <li> For performance I give this a thumbs up. It makes my beard shiny and soft and I get many compliments on the condition of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users have mentioned, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite. It smells like I&#x27;m applying a product designed for my grandmother and not a modern bearded gentleman. I&#x27;m sure an essential oil could be added to help alleviate the grandma-odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other gripe is about the tin that the product comes in. Within a couple of weeks of using it the tin started to rust which makes it really hard to open. I&#x27;d recommend sourcing a different tin or jar so that the product isn&#x27;t compromised by inexpensive packaging. It may seem like a little thing but it does when I choose products.</li>
            <li> I hated waking up in the morning to find my beard flattened and half way up my nose.  After reading some reviews I decided to give Beard Balm a try.  It&#x27;s awesome and even better it&#x27;s made in the USA!  No longer do I have to worry about looking like I just woke up after hibernating all winter.  My wife appreciates how soft it makes my beard, she told me she doesn&#x27;t feel like she is kissing a wire brush any more.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! It makes his beard softer and more manageable. Plus it smells great! Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> Husband Love this Beard Balm. Uses it once a week.</li>
            <li> I love it. It tames my beard and leaves it soft and smelling good. One complaint: it doesn&#x27;t taste too good, so avoid getting it in your mustache.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Started using BeardBalm last week after having the privilege of meeting the people behind it at a coffee bar in Austin, Texas. I was amazed how easily it comes out of the tin &amp; how wonderful it smells. I just take a little bit out, rub it together in my hands, work it into my beard, &amp; I&#x27;m ready to conquer the world. I have roughly a 10inch beard so needless to say when I wake up it&#x27;s everywhere, but just a quick brush &amp; a little BeardBalm &amp; my beard is neat, controlled, &amp; looking good. If you have a beard &amp; are interested in keeping it looking &amp; smelling great I highly recommend you pick up some BeardBalm.</li>
            <li> I needed help. There was a blizzard whenever I scratched my face and my black heavy metal t-shirts weren&#x27;t doing anything to hide this awful flakage. So instead of shaving or changing my wardrobe I tried this, and on the first day of use I had zero flakes. Sure, the smell was a little weird at first but by the 3rd day I was loving it, it&#x27;s earthy and manly. After a week I felt like I should buy some flannels, an axe and head out to the woods. Even my girlfriend said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re becoming the mountain man I&#x27;ve always wanted you to be.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re beard itches and your skin flakes all over your shirts get this. You&#x27;ll kill the itch and the flakes and have a softer, more manageable beard. It rules!</li>
            <li> Great product, simple to use and great on the look. Makes my beard shine, it conditions, and feels amazing. I&#x27;ve tried other products but this is the best so far!! I use it everyday and Im definitely be buying more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was great, bit of a learning curve for how much should be used on your beard. But it helps with the itchiness like crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting my second round of Beard Balm. This stuff makes your beard and underlying skin really soft. Smells great, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Your beard will thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Before I started using it, my beard was bushy and uncontrollable. After I started using it I began to get complements from coworkers, friends, family, and even strangers. I started getting more attention from ladies as well. I love how the product doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell to it. As a man, I do not want to smell like anything other than my natural smell. A little bit of product goes along way. I am about to order my third can. I recommend it to any man with a beard, short or long.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the balm dalt calm!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why others comment about the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just different, but I think the smell could grow on a person.</li>
            <li> I never run out.  I may try other products but I always have at least 1/2 a tin of Beard balm on hand.  I don&#x27;t want to mention any inferior products by name, but the Mennonites have nothing of good ole&#x27; Detroit craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Great product.  This was my first time using a beard balm but decided to go with this based on the reviews.  I am growing out a mustache and so far with this product, the stache is coming in more full and the hairs are softer and easier to tame.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy. Scent takes a little getting used to. Does the trick for my coarse beard. Leaves a nice shine to the beard hairs when applied.</li>
            <li> Smell is not the best.</li>
            <li> Tame that hairy beast! Get ya some!!</li>
            <li> Just the Job...&lt;br /&gt;A small amount makes my beard feel soft and silky. It goes on easily and has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Ok, the smell... I love it.  There is nothing wrong with the smell, it is neither offensive nor strong in presence.  The smell is just fine.  First application and my beard was gleaming, felt softer, and was manageable.  This may not be a wonder all product, but I am pleased thus far, and will update when the first can is complete if for any reason I am displeased.</li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t tried other beard balms to see how they compare to beard balm. I love the natural smell like they say a little bit of balm goes a long way .I use it in the morning once I get out the shower and my beard feels so soft and keeps my hairs tame so I can keep that professional look with my beard. The can last me over a month and I&#x27;m already on my 4th can . Keep up the good work guys satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The smell is like any other hair product... Not too loud ...</li>
            <li> It has a good hold without residue or smell. What more do you need</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My beard thanks you, as does my face. It keeps my beard soft while controlling any stragglers or rebellious hairs. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because a scent would be nice. Maybe sandalwood or something like that. That&#x27;s my only (very very minor) issue.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is the tits of beard care. By the tits, I mean it is wonderful to massage into your beard. Beard Balm keeps your beard hair straight, soft, and smelling great all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard balm for men who want beard control, strength, and a groovy scent. I&#x27;ve used other brands as well as homemade balms, but always come back to this genuine product.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm works wonders on my beard only thing I wish they would do is a bigger can. Love love this stuff makes it soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Softens wily facial growth and provides a subtle shine that feels smooth and silky.  The scent takes a bit of getting used to, but seems OK now, a bit outdoorsy may be one way to describe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months. I trim my beard, so it&#x27;s never longer than 3/4 of in inch or so. My beard can feel wiry at times, and I always have hairs that want to stick out in any direction they choose. The balm does an awesome job of taming out-of-control hairs and making my beard feel good to the touch. I&#x27;m a fan of the smell, but it may not be for everyone. Overall, I think this (plus a boar&#x27;s hair brush) is a great purchase for guys interested in keeping and properly maintaining a beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, been using this for a few months now (about 3-4 times a week). Makes my beard really soft and gives it a slight shine. My beard is a bit unruly, especially on the cheeks, and this balm really helps with combing and keeping the hairs in line.  At first the balm seems like it might leave your beard greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t at all - just leaves you with a soft and healthy looking beard. A great American product from a great American city.</li>
            <li> I meant to say, Detroit...it&#x27;s coming back from the bottom up by companies like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their Balm is actually really really nice. It&#x27;s one of my 2 &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; balms (the other is also a Michigan based brand which shall remain nameless for this review). There are 2 main reasons I love this stuff, aside from being made down the street.&lt;br /&gt;1) It does the job damn well. The people who have invaded my personal space in an attempt to grab ahold of my whiskers have all commented on how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s very neutrally scented. When I want to wear cologne and balm, I don&#x27;t have to worry about what vile scent might be created as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s priced very reasonably...$4+  per tin less that most others.</li>
            <li> feels like its doing something, not sure though</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The smell takes a bit getting used to (not in a bad way), but other than that, beard Balm helped me with my dry, itchy skin.  It also gave my beard a nice sheen and is slightly moldable, almost like a light hair gel.  I would definitely recommend this as soon as you start growing your beard!</li>
            <li> This stuff turned my beard from a stinking mess of hair into a well coiffed set of impervious chin armor. When men see it they quiver in fear... Women flock to it like moths to a lantern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this stuff is boss. It works so much better when applied to a moist beard. It keeps my long beard soft and tame. I also love this for travel because it is easier to transport than oil. No spills. I&#x27;m on my second tin and the smell is glorious. It took some getting used to but it&#x27;s awesome. My wife digs it too. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is a great, all natural product that makes my usually wild goatee soft and civilized. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes your beard soft and smooth and controllable. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well and helps keep my beard and face looking nice.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA! The smell is great and the product is well made. Run it through with a small comb or brush and you are good to go! Recommendations of the highest degree!</li>
            <li> take your unruly, burly mountain man beard and tame it! Love this beard balm! like the smell and it helps soften and condition the facial hair. definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this product and another Amish type one (not naming any names) at the same time, well my can of Beard Balm is almost gone, time to get some more and the other one got given away, it was nowhere as good as Beard Balm which makes my beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Been using beard balm for about a week now, and I definitely see a difference both in the look and grooming of my beard.  My beard looks healthy and shiny, not over done though... and brushing seems easier with less tangles and pulling. The scent is not bad I don&#x27;t mind it at all, overall a great product</li>
            <li> Smells great. Easy to apply. Keeps beard from drying out. Beard is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best beard product that I have used.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Beard always looks good and is much softer.  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is I&#x27;ve added time to my lean and mean grooming regimen (no hair on my head means no hair product needed).  But it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  It makes his beard soft and smell really nice.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> I teach in a high school and compete with the kids each year for &amp;#34;No Shave November.&amp;#34; I am usually happy to shave on Dec. 1st. This year I decided to try to cultivate my beard a bit and gave this beard balm a try. It is Dec. 9th and I am still going with the beard, thanks mostly to Beard Balm. It makes my beard soft, shiny, and even hides some of the grey hairs. I find the smell to be fine and my only complaint is that it can get a bit greasy. After stroking my beard my key pad glistens from the oil of the balm . Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for quite some time now and have never used any oils or balms on it. However on a recent trip to Detroit one of my friends suggested that I start taking better care of my beard, an after much thought and consideration I stumbled upon beard balm. Now maybe I am partial because I am from Michigan but this product will soften up ad also help you style your beard. I have tried many oils and other products, but beard balm is my go to product when I want my beard looking its best.&lt;br /&gt;jason</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this balm, and it has helped my beard feel softer and thicker. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly greasy which is nice for a balm like this.  It is discouraging when the beard feels greasy after use.  It does have an odor to it that is a bit off putting though.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this beard balm.  It smells very masculine.  Great product and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on some mixed reviews on this product. It works awesome. I can read and know exactly what I am putting on my face, and it does the job awesome.  I live in a desert and use more than a pea sized amount of this product, but it is super dry here.  Love the product and that it is made in america.</li>
            <li> Received Product earlier than expected. But when I opened the box the product looked like it had been used. The tin lid was under the tin can and looked like someone had took a few finger swipes to it. Not going to put that on my face. Returning and buying directly from beard balm. As for the scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Like lemons.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell and it doesn&#x27;t do anything besides my your beard greasey sticky and smelly</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps my beard smooth and manageable and my skin free of dandruff. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have and hold for my mustache, but I guess this is meant to be more of a conditioner than a beard holder.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it seems to work just fine. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent though. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it. I like the scent of other products much better. Brooklyn brothers and others.</li>
            <li> Am not a very hairy person so I thought this will make me grow plenty beards, moustaches and side burns but am kind of disappointed. Maybe this is not really meant to do just that but to help the hairy guys maintain a healthy style.</li>
            <li> Really love this new Beard Balm.  I&#x27;ve tried others that leave me greasy and don&#x27;t really condition my beard which is what I was looking for.  After using for a week or so my beard has become mush softer, which definitely is better for my wife :)!  Also love the bees&amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; smell.  Great product, I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Pleasant fragrance.  Conditions hair nicely without leaving a greasy feeling.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm was recommended to me by a friend and I would definitely second the recommendation.  I noticed a difference in quality of my beard and my girlfriend personally enjoys the faint smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it turns my untamed beard into a work of art.  I use it everyday and can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;d do without a can.  I love the smell, it&#x27;s easy to work with, and it makes you feel manly.  The can is made of tin and will rust if you get it too wet so I&#x27;d recommend avoiding water.  However, this product is great, and as long as there is hair on my face I will own a can of this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Definitely improved the texture and sheen of the hair located on my face.  Great smell.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this balm for my fiancés amazing beard. After some convincing he finally tried it out and loved it! Now he doesn&#x27;t leave the house without using the balm... i didn&#x27;t think his beard could look any better until now! This is a must try item even for the most handsome beards! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Being in Afghanistan, I needed something to help tame the ever glorious gift of the gods to man, my beard.  I came upon Beard Balm and figured  I would try it out.  My beard can be unruly.  It likes to curl and tangle and isn&#x27;t easy to comb out.  I apply it after I shower and dry the pride that is my beard and it detangles and softens the beard so it may be tamed and presentable.  I can comb it out without fearing I&#x27;m ripping out knots.  Depending on your beard, you may need to apply it more than once a week.  I tend to apply it thrice a week.  Long lasting, the can is ample enough to last many moonturns, and smells of man.  If you&#x27;re a man, its a duty to grow a beard, and care for it.  Beard Balm.  Buy it. Use it. Show the glory that is the Beard. Hail the Beard!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a beard balm or oil to give my beard some shine and I definitely have found it in Beard Balm! This give my beard that &amp;#34;ready to take over the world&amp;#34; look. Keep on making it and I will keep on buying!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. As a newly bearded person, I was looking for something to soften it down, make it less itchy and keep those random hairs in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the trick - I&#x27;m very happy and on my second tin.</li>
            <li> This has been an AMAZING product! I initially bought it to help with beard dandruff and soon found that it seemed to also make my beard softer and more manageable while also shortening the &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; stage shorter/easier to get through.  Cannot brag enough about this balm!</li>
            <li> Love the smell on my husband&#x27;s beard.  He has Jewish heritage, so his scruff is a bit curly and unruly - but this smooths it down like a charm!  He loves it, too!</li>
            <li> I have been indulging in this poduct for a few weeks now havent experienced anything different as of yet. The smell isnt as bad as some may say. Hoping that this product may help me in a few problem areas of my beard still in growth mood...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable how much softer and fluffier my beard is since I started using this product. It does leave a slight smell for about 45 minutes, but it&#x27;s not a smell that I hate</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with, I&#x27;m not a beard man.  I&#x27;ve never had a beard before and started one a few months back.  I&#x27;ve got a baby face and it took a good amount of time to get the full growth in.  That being said, this stuff works well, for what I believe it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Good, workable texture that works right in to my beard.  It gives it a good shine and let&#x27;s me work the &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hairs in to order.  The smell, as others noted, was a bit getting used to, however, now I don&#x27;t notice it and never really bothered me, just different.  I&#x27;m not sure what other options are like but this was a good starting point for me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my beard is too course to absorb this conditioner but no matter how I apply this I&#x27;m not satisfied enough to use very often. Maybe when my beard gets fuller I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great! My husband loves it! Super quick shipping.... happy campers over here!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different beard balms, and this one is my favorite so far.  Good solid scent (though there is another I like better).  However, Beard Balm has outperformed all the others I have tried.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple days now, and I can tell you that the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. I actually do not notice 5 mins after putting it on.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with my order through Amazon and the folks at Beard Balm took care of me directly and promptly. They are great folks and I love the beard balm.</li>
            <li> it is balmy....also works good as kiss repellent because its so stinky</li>
            <li> Leaves the beard feeling smooth and clean. a little oily, be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li> Smells great, after having used this Beard Balm for over a month my beard is softer than its ever been. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It doesnt have a fancy scent (it smells like Eucalyptus, which is nice but not fancy), but this stuff works. It made my beard SUPER SOFT and also has a slight styling ability. Not to mention its not very costly and lasts a long time. If you are growing a beard or currently have a beard that needs some work this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the ingredients are all natural and non-exhaustible for all you environment conscious peoples.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what it promises with no bs. When I first got it, it didn&#x27;t look like much in terms of amount but a little does go a long way and will last a good bit. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really hate to rate Bear Balm so low.  It does what the product description says it does.  My beard feels good and it actually makes it feel fuller. But and this is a big but for me, I can&#x27;t handle the smell.  It has a very strong odor and it reminds me of a old musty building.&lt;br /&gt;I does work but it also smells odd.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re growing a beard its just a no brainer. It has brought my beard to its best potential no doubt. I get compliments from all my friends and family about how nice it looks and how it shines in the sun, how soft it feels. All the ladies wanna touch and get up in my groomed face mop. As far as conditioning the hair, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it. The smell? Barely notice the spell its pretty neutral. Seems to work for me cause my hair just drinks the stuff. Can feel a little bit greasy if over applied, so remember a little goes a long way. Oh yea, and all natural ingredients made in &#x27;MERICA! Now, that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m talking about!</li>
            <li> The beard looks and feels great</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husbands scraggly beard and he loves it! It&#x27;s shiny, healthy looking and it does not have a strong smell. I actually like how it smells very much. He gets so many compliments and gets asked what he uses all the time. He loves it and will not go a day without conditioning his beard, he uses it before bed and before he goes out. Five Stars all the way! I will definitely be purchasing this for him again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gag gift for my best whose beard is approaching wizard status. He was very hesitant to use it at first. After the first application I was told that his beard was much more manageable and softer. His fiance loves the smell and insists that he uses it daily. This product comes highly recommended, and heartily approved by a man that has not cut nor trimmed his beard in almost 3 years. Fellas, there is no better product for your illustrious facial hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. Super easy to use and would recommend both this product and the seller, really fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  My beard is now soft to the touch and manageable.  Before beard balm my beard would do whatever it wanted. It would stick out and look all unkempt, but now when I comb it down, it stays.  I like the look.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My beard is naturally very bristly.  The balm makes it soft as babies hair.  It smells nice and feels good to the touch.  I can&#x27;t help but continue to stroke the beard.  .</li>
            <li> Too oily and it stinks. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; back to my old stuff. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works very well to give your beard a nice soft smooth feel, smells great, and helps to keep any stray whiskers laying flat and your whole beard looking sharp!  Customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Make my beard feel and look great.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, works great and smells very nice on my whiskers!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay balm. Not sure why people don&#x27;t like the smell---it&#x27;s a citrus type scent. I don&#x27;t mind that at all. It is quite greasy compared to Honest Amish beard balm. Has a consistency much like Chapstick that&#x27;s been in your pocket all day. If you like that, or your beard needs that, this may be the balm for you.</li>
            <li> not a big fan of the scent</li>
            <li> Went out with a bunch of co-workers last night. Me and someone else started talking about beards, and about beard care products. i mentioned that I&#x27;d been using Beard Balm for the past week, and he commented on how he used it when he had a beard, saying that it made it soft and majestic. The person sitting next to me asked if she could touch my beard, then more and more. How soft my beard was was the talk of the night. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm for a few weeks now. I apply it every day after a shower and use a boars hair brush to tame my wild beard. I love the fact that it makes my beard soft, my only problem now is that I&#x27;m constantly running my fingers through my beard because it feels so soft and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I have been growing beards for quite a few years.  however mine are very stringy and loose and needed tending all the time.  I tried using some standard conditioners and while they made the hair softer, it was still very unmanageable. I decided to do some research and stumbled upon Beard Balm.  I have to say, i&#x27;m glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Beard balm for about 3 weeks now and I have to say, I love the stuff. Every day when I get out of the shower I take just a dab on my fingers and rub it into my beard.  Upon brushing it out, the beard feels fuller, and smells great.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional growth as of yet, but I do notice it feels fuller and softer than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the common talks about any leave in conditioner for facial hair is the smell.  I read some reviews that stated that the smell was a little overpowering, but I found it pleasant.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, and when you happen to get a small bit in your mouth, it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I think I love this stuff and plan on using it for as long as I can.  I grow my beard out in the winter to full and cant wait to see how it helps things along this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a beard Do yourself a favor and try out Beard Balm.  I know you&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product with a unique scent that gradually grows on you. Especially great after you get out of the shower and treat your hair follicles to some divine moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I was watching the local Channel 7 news when they featured Beard Balm which is made here in Detroit. I decided to give them a try, even after reading reviews of many complaints regarding the not-so-nice smell. Upon opening the can, the smell was reminiscent of an old gym - that musky and manly odor mixed with a hint of rust and sweat. After applying it on my beard, the smell really went away within a few minutes leaving the beard a bit softer but also greasier. I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the beard over the long term. I can&#x27;t really say there is a lingering scent either. I tried Honest Amish&#x27;s beard balm, which smells like a spicy gum drop in the beginning, but it kept leaving a hint of a fruity scent later on - leaving me to look for rotten fruit somewhere in the vicinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, I never really noticed an improvement in the feel of my beard. The initial smell reminds me of an old gym, it is harder to apply out of the can than Honest Amish (which seems to melt easier).</li>
            <li> Cured my beard dandruff and keepsake beard looking sharp. Love the smell too. Buy some, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My first beard balm. Makes my beard shine and look great, but greasy. Maybe it&#x27;s good for it, who knows..? I don&#x27;t think beard balm is for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and I honestly couldn&#x27;t imagine starting my day without it! It leaves my beard soft and manageable, plus it smells great! I would highly recommend this to any fellow bearders.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of beard balm, and within ten days my goatee was noticeably longer and fuller and less tangled. I actually get complemented on my goatee now! I was skeptical, but whatever they put in this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Works great for the guy or bearded lady who is fairly new to having a beard.  Its not too greasy, so it actually rubs pretty well, though I&#x27;m not sure about its moisturizing factor.  The smell is pretty good too. it has a natural smell without being too earthy.  Perfect for the beards that need that extra bit of control.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell based on some of the reviews that I read, but it&#x27;s definitely grown on me. Keeps my beard (mostly) in check and leaves a nice shine to things.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times, it is great!  This Beard Balm is not greasy, not oily, it&#x27;s just right.  The smell is not overwhelming or perfume like, it&#x27;s a clean natural scent.  Products like this may just put Detroit back on the map.&lt;br /&gt;Jon</li>
            <li> The best! Love this stuff, I use it everyday to tame my beard. Some reviewers have mentioned the smell as if it were a bad thing, to me, it is not. I love the smell, the product and the fact that it&#x27;s made and comes from Detroit, MI. Buy this stuff, put it in your beard and conquer all.</li>
            <li> Amazing product :) and really works. Don&#x27;t waste your time reading all these reviews, be a man and buy Beard Balm...Now!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality product that I found for my partner who loves it and this is coming from a guy who does not like any kind of \\&quot;product\\&quot; It smells very good and conditions his beard. I like it too☺️</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know is it work or my age does most of growing, but I am a teen and I had 100% no facial hair, after using it I already got some noticeable hair on my face. The smell is nice, I don&#x27;t have an idea what are people here are complaining aboot. Also the face feels nice after using it, no itch or whatever</li>
            <li> Great balm for the beard. after using 3 other brands I pretty much stuck with beard balm. Not that the other brands were bad but this one&lt;br /&gt;has a good texture and I found the eucalyptus scent pleasing. It does not have much hold but does help in keeping the hair on your beard&lt;br /&gt;from getting out of hand.</li>
            <li> Works great for longer beards.</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple days but it seems to be helping a lot. Smells nice too</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was SUPER quick, I got it way earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is exactly as described, no tricks here.  The balm is of above average to high quality, it really does great conditioning and taming my beard.  Keep in mind that this is a balm, not a wax, though it does contain beeswax to help increase its hold.</li>
            <li> Beard well my friend.  Smells good.  I was getting flakes.  This stopped it!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be reviewing this item as it is a gift.  I thought it was a little odd though, that it was fastened shut with scotch tape.  I pealed it open just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t used or something.  It was fine.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...better than expected. I wish I&#x27;d had found out about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my beard smelling great all day</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say. A little goes a long way and the scent is great. I always look forward to using and do so daily.</li>
            <li> Gives my beard a nice shine and stopped the itching.. The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The scent is subtle and awesome. This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft. I was contemplating shaving, so glad I found Beard Balm and saved my beard. Just ordered 6 more cans.</li>
            <li> My Beard Balm came in a few days ago, and every day since I&#x27;ve put about a dime sized amount in, it is great product, it keeps my facial hair shinny and fresh, I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Yes thanks.and it&#x27;s working in good</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, didnt really care for it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your beard nice and soft.  Dreaded beardruff is gone too!!</li>
            <li> I met these girls in Austin Texas while pedicabbing. They were wondering where a certain place was and while they said they didn&#x27;t want a ride (which left me a tad disappointed), they did offer me two cans of this Beard Balm as a way to thank me for the help and to promote the product. Just a couple of nice people trying to market an idea that I personally think is under-utilized. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but after about 6 months of fairly frequent use I&#x27;d say I got the better end of the interaction on that corner in front of Star Bar half a year ago. If you&#x27;ve a beard, and want some shwag for it, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> The product is highly recommended smells so good</li>
            <li> This will help you beard better than you have ever bearded before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard</li>
            <li> Easy to spread, great light scent, and adds great shine and softness to any beard!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as the first product to tame my beard a bit and it has turned out to be a good product that has softened up and smoothed out my beard a bit.  The product has a light scent that isn&#x27;t really that noticable after application.  Getting the product into your beard is easy...I just tend to rub it in.  I&#x27;ve noticed my beard softening up and the dry skin I have in the winter under my beard has gotten better.  I&#x27;d get it again to keep my beard soft and my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Very greesy and smells awful</li>
            <li> For the first time I was able to run my fingers through my husbands beard without yanking on his hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> My beard and I truly enjoy this product! My beard had a patchy area and this helps it grow, one of my favorite beard products, will continue to use for a while. Goes on great not oily or greasy, good stuff!</li>
            <li> I was totally against using this stuff at first. I was given a sample tin at a party by a very bearded hipster. I was skeptical with a trimmed beard and acceptance of the mainstream. However, since I have started using Beard Balm, my beard has been softer and shinier. I use a little every day. Great product!</li>
            <li> My hubby and I are in LOVE with this Beard Balm.  I always hated how his stubble on his face felt whenever I touched it and I can&#x27;t even imagine how it felt for him.  I know he would complain a lot when his stubble is in that &amp;#34;growing&amp;#34; phase.  Currently he hasn&#x27;t shaved for 3 weeks so it&#x27;s still in that awkward phase.  Let me tell you, only after 1 application, it changed everything. His face is silky smooth and my hubby has a major grin on his face.  My husband has applied this 3 times now and he can&#x27;t get enough of it.  The only thing we had to get use to was the smell of it. It really does have a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell.  It&#x27;s like a earth tone type of smell. I know he is going to be using this everyday since it makes his face feel so smooth. Also, if you have sensitive skin like my husband, this product is great for you.  I also love the fact that this is made in the USA.  The packaging it came in was very professional.  I highly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased honest review*</li>
            <li> Pleasant and not overwhelming smell. Has a slight hold to it which is nice. Spreads very nice and evenly through the beard, especially when paired with a beard brush. I prefer the beeswax style of balm such as this. If I wanted a liquid I would use a beard oil. After daily use for over a month it has left my beard softer and easier to manage. Paired with a good conditioner my skin does not itch or irritate me like it had. One can has lasted just over a month and I am generous when I use it. Do not use too much though or your beard will feel greasy for the majority of the day. Already bought another can. Wish they would come out with some other scents.</li>
            <li> How long does it take for the product to show that it is working?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any sort of beard products before, so I have nothing to compare this product to, but after a couple months of using it I am satisfied. After seeing a lot of the silly reviews about lumberjacks and manliness I was sceptical that any of them were genuine. Their product website is pretty much the same way, which leads me to believe that many of the reviews were left by the manufacturers.    Positives: It really makes my beard softer, and gives it a bit of a glow. A little goes a long way, I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 months now and still have about half a can left after daily use. If it&#x27;s not used for a few days in a row, beard is noticeably dryer and more tangled. This stuff makes a big difference for sure.    Negatives: The smell. Some reviews say it goes away after 20 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t true. Your nose just gets used to it so you don&#x27;t notice it after some time, but run your fingers through your beard and you&#x27;ll see that it is infact still there. It&#x27;s not a bad smell per say, just unnecessary. And no, the majority of women, even those who like beards, don&#x27;t like the smell.  There aren&#x27;t any instructions, the can comes all by itself. Granted, it&#x27;s not something you can screw up, but for a first time user some pointers would be helpful. Their website has an instructions page, but it&#x27;s pretty much a joke about put it on any time you want to feel like a man.    It&#x27;s a good product that I would likely buy again, but I will also try others to compare it with. My advice if you do buy it, is to use a little after a shower while your beard is still wet. It&#x27;s easier to apply that way, and you use less of the product. Using it on a dry beard makes your beard a bit sticky and clumpy, whereas application to a damp beard yields much better results. Don&#x27;t brush your beard after using it, because you&#x27;ll never get it, or its smell, off your brush. Then the brush gets sticky and starts collecting crap that then gets transferred to your beard the next time you useit.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal, my buddy at work uses Honest Amish and a guy at the beer store suggested this one.&lt;br /&gt;I like the H.A but I want to give this one a beards up challenge.&lt;br /&gt;After I do that I&#x27;ll post my opinionated results.</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard ever since I was a young man. I am 55 years old now, and I have watched it slowly turn grey with the passing years. In the past I would simply wash and condition it like the hair on my head,but always had issues with dry skin and flaking. A couple of years ago I began using an assortment of different products that I found here  on Amazon. When I discovered  this one I realized that I had found the one that meets all of my needs. It keeps my large beard soft ,neat and tidy, I&#x27;m addicted to the scent,and I even use some on my lips to keep them from getting chapped. It is the only beard product  I buy regularly  now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband a few months back as he started growing his beard out. He prefers it to other products he&#x27;s tried, and so do I. The balm has definitely increased his (and my) enthusiasm for his beard growth and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> smells great, softens and conditions beard nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. Keeps things under control. Smells good. Buy it.</li>
            <li> When I started growing my beard almost six months ago, I kind of stumbled through learning what to do. For a bit, I procrastinated about getting the right tools together to make sure I kept it in good shape. One of the first tools I picked up, pretty much on a lark, was a tin of Beard Balm. I do have to say it was a good choice to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that mention the scent takes some getting used to. Personally, I enjoyed the scent right off the bat. It is masculine, but not overpowering, and can be calming. The balm itself easily melts in your palms, so you can apply it to your beard. The result, once your beard absorbs it, is incredible softness. This has also helped with the one problem area I have, which is my chin. It can get dry and flaky pretty easily. I just apply a little bit directly to the skin there and it takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also lasts a while. In the four months that I have had my tin, I have used about half of it. My beard is pretty big right now, but I don&#x27;t have to use much to see the benefit. Using a bit everyday or every other day goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My face can get itchy and flaky under my beard, but the Beard Balm fixes it and smells manly. My lady likes it, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it in addition to a natural shampoo and conditioner for beards. This stuff is the icing on the cake though. I apply after showering while my beard is still damp and comb it in. The scent is subtle and pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I work in an office so being presentable is key. Beard Balm keeps my rugged manliness in check. Beardless &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; in the office envy my awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Great product I actually like the smell, but I find it is a little expensive for me as my beard is fairly long and I have to use a good amount of the product. And for how long a tin lasted me it&#x27; put me on the fence of wanting to continue purchase. But it&#x27;s great for keeping a scraggly beard in order.</li>
            <li> I love my beard. And I love my beard balm. After the first few uses my bearded looked healthier and shiny. It was much softer too. Fast forward almost 4 months later and I have a healthy beard. And I never experienced the itchy phase. Since it was conditioning with beard balm the skin never dried out. The hairs are.stronger and longer than dome of my other beard buddies. If I have a beard, I&#x27;m going to be using beard balm.</li>
            <li> This beard balm did everything I wanted it to do, and more. Not only did it leave my beard feeling soft, and silky, but I personally really enjoyed the scent of said beard balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also a fan of how minimalistic the ingredients were, and the fact they were all natural. I would recommend this to a friend, provided they had a juicy beard.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and keeps my beard looking good.  Smells good, though that fades after a bit, but the balm lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Until I got the Beard Balm I had been using a variety of different beard oils.  After using this balm, I can&#x27;t foresee myself ever going back to oils of any kind.  The Beard balm does an excellent job of softening my beard while making it more manageable at the same time.  This is a great product and I actually do recommend it, not only here, but also to my bearded brethren I meet on the street</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it more stars. Like everyone else has said, if you have a beard get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started to grow mine out and found it to be stupidly itchy, girlfriend got me a tin of this and I haven&#x27;t put it down since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the itching gone, my new found beard looks and feels healthier. I wont buy another product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are overzealous or have a 5ft long beard this small 1.6oz tin lasts ages, so for $16 its a steal.</li>
            <li> Great product. I actually love the smell- it is very masculine. It also keeps my beard looking good and work appropriate. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> What a great product I look forward to using it even more ! The scent of it i think is just phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any products in my beard until recently. I tried Beard Balm based on the reveiws and really liked it. It&#x27;s has a nice manly smell and gives beard a nice healthy shine but it&#x27;s not greasy. Because it&#x27;s made with natural oils and bees wax, it leaves my beard healthy and the skin under it well moisturized so it&#x27;s not itchy and flakey with it used to get (especially in winter). I recommend trying it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that its a little pricey for a small tin and if you have a long bread it takes a fair amount per application.</li>
            <li> I started using Beard Balm several months ago. My beard is only about 1-inch long, but I have to keep it well groomed for professional reasons. Beard Balm is a great product because even just a small amount provides a deep shine to the beard and allows you to shape the beard very well with a fine-toothed comb after you apply it. The smell of Beard Balm is really masculine. I ordered this product online through Amazon and it arrived on time by the date indicated by the seller.</li>
            <li> I like the semi shinny well groomed look that the balm gives my beard. The smell is a little off putting at first , but you learn to injoy it after the first couple of treatments. It also helps reduce itching from dry skin under all the growth.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li> This beard balm is amazing. I have struggled to keep stray hair down for awhile now. But since this is a wax base balm it puts them down with no problem. At first I didn&#x27;t really like the smell and neither did my fiancé,  but after using if for awhile I really started to like the smell and she couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off my beard because it smelled so good and was incredibly soft. Do yourself a favor and buy the product!</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way. Smells great and absorbs fast. You will need a good beard shampoo as this stuff dose build up quickly. I like how it controls the hair and makes it more manageable. Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has worked wonders on my beard. Great smell! Great shine! Also cured the beard dandruff!! My wife and daughter love it as well. Because now my beards nice and soft. Great product got try it!!</li>
            <li> Go read the negative reviews which at the time of this writing is 8. Yes eight two zero&#x27;s on top of each other making some kinda snowman but I digress...anyways finished reading the Negative reviews? Good, i&#x27;m not going to discuss them or try to invalidate the sissy men complaining about &amp;#34;bad odors&amp;#34; or anything like that. Instead I&#x27;m going to focus on how awesome this product is from the container it arrives in with it&#x27;s sleek style to the product itself with the pleasant aroma of brilliance. So on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The container fits comfortably into the palm of my hand. It stores well, I&#x27;ve been using it 1-3 times a week since July and still have only now started making a dent into the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The gel itself is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t feel gross when I apply it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-While it does have an aroma to it, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses either. Why would you want your beard to smell like roses anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It makes my beard hair less coarse and more soft to the touch so the wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps stray hairs in formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the smell sickens the hearts &amp; stomachs of lesser men.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm is fantastic. It smells great and really aids in the health of my beard. I use some after every wash and my beard has never looked better! I can&#x27;t imagine not using this product now.</li>
            <li> I use it down there, you know what I mean...I&#x27;m a girl and was given this for a gift, but don&#x27;t have a beard...except ya know, down there. I now glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, easy to use balm.  My biggest problem is that it smells almost exactly like Vaseline, with a hint of lemon.  My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t think so but she doesn&#x27;t have to smell it for the roughly 6 hours it takes for the smell to wear off.  But to me, it smells just like Vaseline, even though the base ingredients are nowhere near close to petroleum jelly.  I wish it had a lesser lemon smell, but my girlfriend prefers this over my previous balm which she said smelled like licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it performs, it&#x27;s adequate.  I have a very large bushy beard, so I have to use a decent amount every time, but after a few months of using this, I still haven&#x27;t really used more than 1/4 of the tub.  It doesn&#x27;t help with split ends, even though every balm says it does, it can&#x27;t.  If your hair is already split, a conditioner isn&#x27;t going to glue it back together.  It works great on beardruff and makes your beard very shiny, which are about the only two things most men care about when choosing a balm.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my beard manageable and soft. Women love a soft beard. The smell took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This was a quality product with a good scent. I used it to shape my curly beard and keep it soft. Not awkwardly sticky like hair gel products.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard so manageable. Love it ! It has kind of strong smell, though!</li>
            <li> I had looked at beard balms and bought one before this, I didn&#x27;t care for that one much. So for this beard I bought two of the other top reviewed balms. Of those I like Beard Balm the best. The consistency seems perfect, it is soft enough to apply with ease, but not so soft that too much comes off at once, and it is not grainy or lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all I like the smell; it is pleasantly floral but in a masculine acceptable way. I can live with the other, it smells like I have been working on a machine or something but I just don&#x27;t get the same feeling of satisfaction when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using both cans, the other is larger and cost more but they both seem have about the same consumption rate, so I would say they are on par price wise. But when I buy more it will be Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard, long may it live!</li>
            <li> Im 19 years old my beard usually grows in with a few patches. I cut my entire beard off once my order of beard balm came in the mail. After 4 weeks of not shaving and using Beard Balm my beard finally grew into a good shadow with out any patches. Just be patient this isn&#x27;t magic it doesn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry beard skin and itch at bay. However my wife hates the smell. It&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of shaping. I decided to try other products when this one runs out. I can only use this stuff on days when my wife doesn&#x27;t need some sugar.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard you need to condition it.  This is some of the best stuff out there.  I have tried multiple versions of &amp;#34;Honest Amish&amp;#34; which work well, but the Beard Balm brand has a smooth finish and is much easier to apply.  My only gripe is that the can should be bigger for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Hands Down the Best Beard Product Money Can Buy!    I decided to grow out my beard earlier this year and I noticed that, when it got longer, t it had a frazzled unkempt look about it.  I conducted some internet research and saw a few positive reviews for Beard Balm.  I found Beard Balm on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It works like a charm.  I use it four days a week or so and my beard now behaves the way I want it to without the unkempt look.  Beard Balm also gives my beard a nice healthy shine and my wife loves the luxurious feel of my beard.  The only negative I saw in the reviews I read discussed the smell of Beard Balm.  Beard Balm has a unique smell and I was unsure about the scent at first, but now I don&#x27;t feel complete if I do not smell it.  Finally, using Beard Balm about four days a week, a tub of Beard Balm should last two to three months.  In short, this is an awesome product at a great price.</li>
            <li> good stuff here wear it all the time. keeps my beard feeling great. showed my boss and she bought some for her bf, she loved the natural smell.cant go wrong beard balm and its imported from Detroit</li>
            <li> Really pricey, but it does soften the beard. Also, it&#x27;s made in Detroit: that city needs all the money for startups we can give it ^_^</li>
            <li> Beard Balm has made my beard much smoother and more manageable. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!!! Definitely been seeing some results and definitely a product i will be purchasing more of. What addictions would be advisable to use along with it?</li>
            <li> Love the texture, I like how plyable it is. Most beard balms are hard and do not work into your beard evenly. Decent shuttle smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall with Bear Balm. Works as described to help alleviate tangles, split ends, scraggly hairs, and provide some shine. Bonus points for being all natural and made in Detroit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have described, a little goes a long way. I work Beard Balm between my fingers and into my beard, then comb through with a fine toothed beard comb. Beard Balm is sticky and provides some control and hold to your hair, helps tame those random wild hairs and keeps you looking sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people seem to complain about the aroma, but neither my girlfriend nor I find it offensive or strong. It smells like lemony honey but masculine enough and dissipates rather quickly like they alluded to. If you wear cologne or after shave the aroma will be totally masked. Do not let other users&#x27; reviews about the smell hold you back from purchasing Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used beard oils before (not balms) and some have worked better to improve the softness and feel of my beard, but don&#x27;t provide the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; or taming qualities of Beard Balm. For that reason and the aroma which could be improved, I give Bear Balm a solid 4 stars. Improve those aspects and it&#x27;d be an absolute knock-out! As is, you can&#x27;t go wrong and it&#x27;s a must have I use in conjunction with the aforementioned oils.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month. The smell is subtle and nice, not overpowering. It reminds me of the smell of lemon zest, very pleasant. I apply it almost daily after shower and it helps keeping my beard untangled, and makes it easier to comb. It also adds a bit of shine to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Has a nice subtle scent and leaves your beard feeling extremely soft. Without Beard Balm, my beard feels like a brillo pad. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> It has a different smell, but thats good. My wife says it smells great! Not overpowering and it spreads on smooth. Makes your beard shiny and washes out easily. Great product!</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this stuff. Was unsure if I even needed it, then pretty much said WTF, easy to try and according to reviews I couldn&#x27;t miss.&lt;br /&gt;They were all right. My beard is much more well-behaved and I used the whole can(just got another). Smell is very homey/outdoors/just cut down a tree and built a cabin with it while I tamed a wolverine. Girlfriend loves it keeps things easy outta the shower.</li>
            <li> Good product. Beard feels soft, also takes care of fly aways. Smells pretty good. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. He loves it. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great beard balm! The consistency is nice and it isn&#x27;t as oily as some others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I would definitely recommend this product to any bearded fella who is looking to tame his face.</li>
            <li> I liked it . Easy to apply and made my beard hair softer and healthier appearing.</li>
            <li> This made my skin breakout and my beard feel really greasy as opposed to moisturized. It also smells like medicated Bengay cream - so...the opposite of sexy. I found I was losing more hairs when I would brush while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest going with The Fresh Man beard oils over this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great, applies well.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm. It has a great scent, not too strong but still present, and a nice feel after being applied. It makes my beard softer and gives a nice little shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it! I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this balm.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great smell. Has really help strengthen my beard and promote volume. My first balm I&#x27;ve tried and probably my last cause it does the job so well. A little goes a long way. Great product. Great company.</li>
            <li> Before Beard Balm, I was a beard novice. I let my beard grow for a few months, but I had no idea how to care for it. Since using Beard Balm, my life has undoubtedly improved for the better. Not only do I walk around with a soft, lush beard, I also smile with confidence knowing that I have eliminated any and all beard dandruff that used to scare off womenfolk. The odor of the balm is unique, but I quickly came to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I teach college classes, and I knew Beard Balm was working when one of my students told me that my beard was distractingly shiny when I stood in the light of the projector. I gave her an A.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments on my beard and how well kept it looks since I&#x27;ve started using Beard Balm. It also helps relieve itching that is commonly associated with having a beard. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys looking good. Your beard will thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the balm. It helps tame fly-away hairs in your flavor savor and does it in a not too greasy way. Pleasant aroma and super easy to use. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I am new to the art of beard growing and my beard grows quite slowly. In combination with a boars-bristle brush, this keeps everything untangled and in place throughout the growing process. As far as the smell, I hardly notice it. It does have a little bit of an oily/waxy scent. But this is of course because it is composed of both oil and wax. If you are man enough to grow a beard, you are man enough to bear the light, natural smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but the makers of beard balm offered me a free tin for writing a review. That won&#x27;t influence the honesty of my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a thick, full beard; it&#x27;s a little sparse and thin in my opinion, but I like it well enough so I keep it around. That being said, I really like this Beard Balm conditioner. The packaging (tin) is nice, the smell is fragrant but not overpowering, and I think it does a better job of conditioning the hair and skin underneath my beard than other products. The only other conditioner I&#x27;ve used is Honest Amish, and I have to say this stuff (Beard Balm) does a little better job of leaving the hairs smoother longer. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that I can actually go a day or two in between uses and the hair still feels conditioned, whereas with the other product I&#x27;ve used it had to be everyday or I would definitely notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, any kind of conditioner is subjective but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product and say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I took some time and did my research. As a guy who normally has a face full of stubble, i decided it was time to give the beard a shot. Once i got past the itch I entered a weird stage where I had a ton of flyaways and a rough looking beard. With a quick trim with hair clippers and a little beard balm I was surprised how neat and controlled it looked. You really only need a little to get the job done. It adds a nice light shine and a pleasant smell. I cannot recommend it enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note. As someone raised in Detroit, I will always support Detroit business owners.</li>
            <li> I stopped cutting the hair on both my head and my face for some time now. While I have products that work well for my hair nothing worked well for my beard -- until I found Beard Balm (quite by accident) on facebook. I thought the price was right so I gave it a try. Now I am a Beard Balm customer for life. Excellent product. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I grew a beard for the first time this summer and was told I should get a balm for it.  I looked at all the products on Amazon and ultimately settled on Beard Balm because of the great reviews as well as awesome name.  I have not been disappointed and love it.  It helps tame my beard as well as make it look well kept and groomed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it.  My beard has gotten long and can become quite unruly.  This balm definitely helps tame it into a semblance of respectability and professionalism.  I also live in a fairly arid region, and this stuff helps to keep my beard from becoming dried out.  Like others here, I recommend putting it in while your beard is still a little wet from the shower.  Some reviewers mention that the scent is an acquired taste, but I&#x27;ve never had any issue with it.  Your mileage may vary, I suppose.    To sum it up: It keeps your beard soft and tame.  What&#x27;s not to love?  Get some today.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty grizzly, coarse beard that is pretty hard to tame. I use pine tar soap, I use oil conditioner, I serenade it with love songs, I bathe in milk and honey, but nothing softens it like Beard Balm. A lot of people were complaining about the smell, or saying it&#x27;s an acquired taste, but I loved it immediately. My girlfriend does as well. Plus, as a Michigan native, I love that it&#x27;s made in Detroit.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a beard balm and this one happen to be one of the first results. When I noticed the product is made in Detroit I figured I would give it a try because I am from Detroit and have an obsession with the city - I have a giant collection of antique and vintage Detroit items. The product smells a little funky at first, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Also, I think the fact that Beard Balm actually works makes up for the smell. My beard came in much better, and the problem hairs that would stand up before fell nicely in line with the rest.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the product, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;Just can&#x27;t stand the smell. It&#x27;s probably just me.&lt;br /&gt;Very good overall quality though and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> First beard balm I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. Either I have an untameable beard or this just isn&#x27;t as strong as I need it to be to keep those wild stray beard hairs down - I&#x27;ve resorted to cutting those hairs short so I don&#x27;t look like a wild man. Will try a few other beard balms and revisit this review to update.&lt;br /&gt;About the balm - Decent smell. Does soften my beard &amp; my wife can tell when I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days because my beard is more coarse and wild.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this product. If you have coarse or unruly man beard issues, this stuff will help make it much more manageable! I brush it in with a kent beard comb and it works great!  The price is good for how long the product lasts. I&#x27;ve been using the same can for 4 months.  My wife also approves :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW if you buy a can, be sure to follow their Instagram. It&#x27;s hilarious</li>
            <li> I have had some time to grow a manly beard and also compare it with a few other beard balms. This one is much softer coming out of the tin than many others and it has a more &amp;#34;mechanic in the workshop&amp;#34; smell than some of the other citrusy ones. My wife doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and it seems to calm the itch and discomfort greatly. Support America, Support Detroit, Buy this one.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  The aroma is pleasant and not over-powering.  I love the way it makes my whiskers feel.  Will definitely buy again....</li>
            <li> Works great.  No itch, soft bread now.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool tin!!  I got it quickly!  I was going to wait to give it to my son for Christmas, but couldn&#x27;t wait!  He loves it!  His beard looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> tames my beard... Smells nice... Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more</li>
            <li> As someone with a curly beard, I was struggling with the dreaded beard dandruff and the super itchiness that goes along with that. I saw a bunch of recommendations for beard balm and WOW, were they right. Stuff really is liquid gold and has helped tame my mane. If you want to get a good present for the bearded man in your life, look no further</li>
            <li> This stuff smells kind of like a can of Copenhagen. It&#x27;s a very soft blend, it melts easily as soon as your fingers touch it.  It worked pretty effectively to soften up my whiskers but within an hour it seemed like it had disappeared and I had to reapply it. On average I think I had to use it four times a day or my beard would dry out and the ends would break off.  My beard is really curly and unruly and it did very little to tame it.  Good product, just not quite right for my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bearded boyfriend who has a crazy long wizard-like beard. I can&#x27;t believe how much more tame it looks! And it&#x27;s so shiny and soft! This product is a must for any lumbersexual man! I would like to see the product offered in different scents...all-natural essential oils of course.</li>
            <li> Really like this beard balm! It make by beard softer and got all the frizzy strays to go down but with a natural look. The smell is great, not overpowering or flowery. It is also a great consistency. I was afraid that it would be too oily but after a good couple of gentle rubbings and youre skin feels really smooth without that greasy/oily feeling. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Beard Balm for a little over a week and so far it is great.  It has softened my beard and made it more manageable.  The scent is unique, but much like other reviews, I found it to be not offensive and ultimately enjoyable.  My only regret is that I did not start using this product sooner.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying a product for my beard. Like the other reviews said, the smell is something to get used to at first. But very quickly I started to really like the smell. It is quite manly. The balm also makes my beard behave much better and soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews.  This stuff stinks.  I thought it would be mainly, but it makes you smell like you made love to a skunk in pine tree.  It&#x27;s also too stiff to rub in to your beard.</li>
            <li> My daughter tells me my beard stinks when I&#x27;m using it. It works but it doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test of my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> First use of this beard balm and I loved it!!  Huge difference after I put it on.  Women laughed at my jokes, angels sang when I entered the room, people thought I was special forces, and people started getting out of my way in the fast lane.  Trust me, when this can is out, I am re-upping again!!</li>
            <li> Tried this on my goatee today for the first time and was very pleased with how only a little bit of this balm softened the hairs.  Beard Balm doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish and I didn&#x27;t really detect any aroma, which is fine by me.  I consider it excellent value for the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now. After reading the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give this a try even with the complaints about the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, you ARE going to be confused by the smell of the product. It&#x27;s interesting to say the least. It reminds me of a very barky/outdoorsy type of scent. As men, we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to perfumey type of scents that can be sweet or relatively bland so that women won&#x27;t be &amp;#34;offended&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is very very masculine to say the least. I&#x27;ve had a girl compliment the smell (yes it does leave a smell albeit very faintly). She stated that it smells like what &amp;#34;a man should smell like&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, if you are at this point in life where you are growing a beard this is a complimenting smell that makes you and the women around you feel like you have hair on your chest. This is the scent a woman wants to smell because it makes her feel like you just got back from wrestling a full grown grizzly bear out in Canada in your favorite plaid shirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my beard several times, but my wife has always banished it after a few months -- scratchy, ugly, smelly. This last time I started using this stuff. They really seem to know what works.  WOW,  My beard is soft, it glistens, and looks really good.  It contains no petroleum products.  The list of ingredients isn&#x27;t long.  Clearly, they put some research into this product.  What they chose to include really does the trick for me. There is a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not a fragrance and once applied disappears quickly.  My wife really likes being close to my beard.  It leaves my hands feeling soft too-- a bonus. Without a doubt, I owe my beard to Beard Balm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have had nothing but positive results.&lt;br /&gt;My beard seems to be fuller and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the way my husband&#x27;s beard feels and smells age using this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;The container did start to rust around the inside edges when it melted and got a bit messy, but I&#x27;ll totally buy him another one when he runs out (lasts long, use sparingly like palmade)</li>
            <li> Works great! Speedy delivery! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over the smell.  Sorry.  I&#x27;ve tried for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Not as much control as I hoped for. Smells great. Should get more for the price. I&#x27;m going to stick with Honest Amish heavy duty for my taming needs.</li>
            <li> Works as described but do not care for the greasy feeling the conditioner leaves on my beard.</li>
            <li> Product itself was awesome. Smells great, and my husband uses it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging from Amazon was for the first time, not great. I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of packages and never had a problem. But this time, they shipped this product without of lid. It must&#x27;ve fallen off at some point. As it came the day before Christmas, I was creative and found another lid that would fit it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, makes my beard a little shiny. My beard votes two thumbs up</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews and to be honest I am skeptical about product reviews in general. My beard was suffering due to the humidity and extreme heat and weather changes here in Florida. I tried the honest Amish brand wax and to be it was kind of weird. I like this brand because it comes in a wax form ( thicker but similar to lip balm ) and is easily applied to the mane on my face. Be sure you get a boar bristle brush to evenly distribute the oil. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and can say my beard is 60-70% healthier and I expect it to get even softer. Beard balm made my beard very manageable and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! It makes his beard so much softer and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, been using it for about five months now and its really done a great job at giving my beard a healthy sheen and giving just enough hold to help get my moustache out of my mouth. Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as wax, but I didn&#x27;t want that much anyway, so this is perfect. The scent of the balm is good, too, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it, but now I find it to be a rather masculine, natural scent, fragrant, but not overwhelming or chemical-smelling. A little goes a long way with this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again, and I have no hesitations recommending it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this exclusively for his beard. It keeps it manageable and soft, isn&#x27;t overly scented - basically does a great job and is reasonably priced. Even my baby girl snuggles in to his beard - if that doesn&#x27;t sell you on how soft it makes it, I don&#x27;t know what will.  If you&#x27;re looking for something for that bearded gentleman in your life, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great, leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Hubs loves this stuff!  The fragrance takes some getting used to, but we both agree that his beard looks more lush and the hairs are smoothed down nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for brother-in-law for Christmas. My husband uses this and LOVES the balm.</li>
            <li> I bought beard balm a few months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. I live in very hot, humid weather where your hair is always getting frizzed. This beard balm helped me control my beard and also helped it grow healthier. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother hair and it doesn&#x27;t get as curled an frizzy anymore. Great buy.</li>
            <li> the beard balm makes my beard super relaxed, way less wirey, and smells terrific.. When I don&#x27;t have it in now, I feel not myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care too much for the smell!</li>
            <li> Great product, natural smelling fresh</li>
            <li> He loved his beard balm. Love following the instagram page. Also live the smell of the balm. And his beard looks even more sexy, if that&#x27;s possible. Thanks beard balm</li>
            <li> Been using this and I can feel my beard is softer. The girlfriend is pleased lol</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it daily when I get out of the shower and now sport a full man beard. Don&#x27;t walk around with a weak zen master beard. Grab a can of beard balm and become the newest member of Sons Of Anarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your beard/stache greasy or shiny, just full and strong. Go get em&#x27; Paul Bunyan!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Feels really good on my beard.</li>
            <li> I received my beard balm but it came missing the lid. It was not in the box.</li>
            <li> Im new to the beard product game and a friend told me about this stuff. I tried it and am not disappointed. I liked the fact that it is make in Detroit USA and is all natural. It&#x27;s got a pleasant eucalyptus aroma that goes away after a few minutes after you put it in. I have noticed a fuller shiner beard since I started using this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. Know that it does not give you hold but makes your moutache softer! Smell is ok but I like other products for a nicer scent.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected</li>
            <li> Update: The manufacturer was kind to send the same product with a redesigned container and a personal email apologizing. I had absolutely no problem opening the replaced container. I use the product and it works great.  Thank you!      My previous review:  It&#x27;d be nice to have the product in a container where you could actually get into trying the  product.  FIX THE DESIGN OF THE CONTAINER! I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 days, and I&#x27;ve made many attempts at opening it, but still I&#x27;m unsuccessful. Crap.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Honest Amish product and thought I&#x27;d try something else. Big mistake. This stuff smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t soften my beard at all. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted $16 on this because now I&#x27;m going to throw it away and order some more Honest Amish beard balm.</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff. Been using for a couple of days and I&#x27;m noticing a difference already. My beard is becoming softer and more groomed looking. I recommend using a boar-bristle brush to comb beard and spread the balm throughout. Balm smells great too. Manly but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> First time beard grower so no expert by any means, but I like this product. Scent is nice without being overwhelming. Texture is good and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. Serving me well thus far during a cold Chicago winter.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  My husband likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It helped me control my beard and put an end to any beardruff. The scent is kinda waxy but you get used to it and can&#x27;t argue with the results. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and comes as advertised. I guess I was a little shocked that the tin was so small, but I should have expected it. It does dry out and flake out of my beard fairly quickly in the day, though. But hey, I like the smell.</li>
            <li> smells rancid and makes me want to take a shower after I use it.</li>
            <li> Just purchased two more cans! Best product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> It Does exactly what it Describes. my Beard Hasn&#x27;t looked and felt so good. I recommend this product to all beards.&lt;br /&gt;i plan on continuing to use Beardbalm For as long as i can...Im Happy,My Beard is Happy,And my Fiance&#x27; Enjoys it so much.&lt;br /&gt;#TeamBeardBalm</li>
            <li> As I grow older my whiskers have become more salt and less pepper.  Those white whiskers seem to be stiffer and more prickly.  This beard balm helps tremendously with making those thorny whiskers much softer.</li>
            <li> I have a ~8&amp;#34; beard and have been dealing with split ends for years now. Since I&#x27;ve started using Beard Balm they have been much less of an issue (although they do still happen from time-to-time.) I, unlike the other reviewers apparently, love the smell. My partner isn&#x27;t a fan but it goes away after a couple hours. This is a great leave-in conditioner/moisturizer, it probably won&#x27;t work as well as a styling product per se, but for what it is it is fantastic. If I forget to use it for a day I can feel the difference and I don&#x27;t like it; I much prefer my beard with Bear Balm. I&#x27;m not sure how I went so long without (I was mixing various oils myself before... this is much easier and works better.) I would recommend it to anyone with a beard and especially those dealing with split ends and dryness.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good and does add a bit of sheen to your beard, but doesnt soften it up much.  Hair conditioner works better for softening your beard up. This was worth it though because it smells so good and does keep the hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> The beard balm just made my beard like an Afro, not very manageable unless Much product was used. :(( Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Product overall is good.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, Don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, Seems to get all the hairs going in the same direction to fend off wirey sum-bishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, don&#x27;t know any difference to compare to but I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only knock I&#x27;ve got is the tin it came in is difficult to open, seems bent or something.</li>
            <li> I switch from Jojoba Oil to Beard Balm a litle while ago. The Balm is works great on the beard. A little goes a long way. My beard is about 12&amp;#34; from chin to tip and I find I only need about a thumb nail of balm.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell. It has somewhat of a medicinal / ointment type of smell that I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;BeardBalm customer service is top notch and even includes a personal note with your order :)&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You just might like it :)</li>
            <li> This works great. I love it and will be purchasing again. I have had people commenting on how great my beard looks after using this. I have a long goatee and had split ends. This is no longer the issue. It is now softer as well. The colors in my beard are more noticeable too. This balm has a pleasant smell to it, my girlfriend likes the smell so that is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> Makes my boyfriend smell like the woods and I love it. He always wears it so I think he loves it too!</li>
            <li> Works great. Not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> First beard product I&#x27;ve tried.  As far as the fragrance: the Lanolin odor is prominent (oily/waxy smell).  However, it&#x27;s blended well with other flavors to give it a Manly, earthy aroma (but not dirty hippie) and has no obnoxious perfume smell period.  Lanolin is an excellent conditioner for skin and hair.  Secondly, this balm does a nice job softening up the whiskers.  I was running an untamed beard about 4-5 inches long and this really helped whip it into shape.  I have since trimmed it (happens so often) and the resulting new beard is very nice.  Basically all that crap that girls whine about with split ends and stuff... your beard does it too, and this helps keep it manageable, soft, and awesome.  Needless to say,  I&#x27;m gonna try some other products and see what&#x27;s up... just cause.  However, works as advertised.  Also, I thought I was gonna rail through this little tin can of balm real quick, but no.  It goes quite a long ways, even on a bushy beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful: I rub it in morning and night and my beard is juuuuussssst right.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm I have ever used. It worked as advertised and had a very mild smell, which I found to be pleasant. The tin lasted me about a month and a half, and I am considering reordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caution to watch the price of this. The first time I ordered, the tin was $10.95. I log in today to reorder, and it has increased in price to $16.00. While I am unsure if I purchased this during a sale of some sort, a 46% price increase over 6 weeks is unexpected. I may try a competing brand due to a larger size for a similar price.</li>
            <li> Have you ever wondered how you can smell more like your mechanic? If so, this beard balm is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I bought this product to do market research, as I am a producer and seller of beard products, including balms. I am not trolling this product, just giving an insider&#x27;s point of view from someone who has tried all the balms, oils, and waxes available on the market and providing some insight into how their recipe compares to others. I am not going to be a jerk and say the name of my brand because it isn&#x27;t kosher to steal sales that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are nothing special compared to anything else on the market, so really you have to base it on smell. While smell is totally subjective, I can tell you that this captures the exact smell of my grandfather after a day of working on his industrial machinery out in his shop. It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s necessarily great either. On the plus side, it smells like an honest days&#x27; work, which is sort of satisfying and manly, but not how I want to smell all the time. Apart from my sensibilities, when I showed this to potential customers during market research it was never selected as the favorite. So, if you want your beard to be sniffed and scruffed by potential lovers, this may not be the perfect balm for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my nose, the overwhelming scent here is geranium oil and the lanolin, which is a fatty oil that&#x27;s a byproduct of the wool industry. I can&#x27;t pick up the lemon at all, and the eucalyptus is quite faint. Lanolin is actually very beneficial for the skin, but carries with it a mild sheepy smell. It is slightly strange that Beard Balm decided to go with Lanolin instead of the more commonly used shea butter. I would rate this balm 2 stars based on smell, but using lanolin as the base is a more gutsy choice than others and this balm might provide additional benefits if used with a shea butter based balm in rotation--I bumped it up to 3 stars. Variety is the spice of life, as they say. Long story short: if you have an allergy or aversion to lanolin or sheep&#x27;s wool, this product is not for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil seems to be light-bodied and I&#x27;m guessing that lanolin makes up about 75% of the overall mix, possibly more. I can&#x27;t detect any beeswax smell and it doesn&#x27;t give my beard that characteristic &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; hold that comes with beeswax. If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say they have about 15% beeswax in the mix, possibly less. The remaining composition seems to come from coconut oil, but there is no coconut smell to be found, which is sort of a shame to my nose. I could be wrong here and they could be using refined coconut oil, but it&#x27;s hard to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as balms go, this one is slighty above average and I feel like the ingredients themselves are high-quality. If this is your first foray into beard balms, I would recommend trying another brand first, if only because the scent is unquestionably divisive. I&#x27;d actually recommend that you only use a balm if your beard is quite young (say, less than 6 weeks) since the main benefit to a balm is that it conditions the face and reduces the terrible itchy beard phase. If your beard is of a more substantial length, stick with oils which are more readily absorbed and beneficial to your hair. You can break out the balm if you want a change, or if you find that it has enough styling hold for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been roughly around a week that I have been beard balming and I must say it has made my beard softer. At first the smell was somewhat strong, but I got used to it already. Overall it seems like a good product. I have been growing my beard for a month so I hope it works out with it being longer.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at first but then it really grew on me and now I love it.  It makes my beard nice and soft and helps keep the hairs straight.  I brush it in with a little eyebrow comb I stole from my wife.  I didn&#x27;t know it was called an eyebrow comb but you learn something new everyday.  I also learned that stealing your wifes eyebrow comb is not a good idea.  Especially now that it has beard balm all over it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use it after showering and it keeps my beard hairs soft and in place. I really enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this back in April, along with a tin of Honest Amish. At first, the smell of Beard Balm was strong to me, and I found myself getting irritated by the smell. However, after using it the smell grew on me and is not strong at all. I&#x27;m thinking when they first manufacture this the smell is strong as the product is fresh but mellows out over a few days. I also like the texture of this balm compared to Honest Amish. While both balms do a fantastic job, I haven&#x27;t even used much of the other tin, and find myself using Beard Balm more often. Try it out! Your beard will thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! I read all the reviews for all of the beard balm products and I chose to purchase this one. I will definitely be a return customer</li>
            <li> Beard balm is a fantastic product. I have been using it in my beard every morning since I got it and it is yielding good results. It keeps my beard from feeling dried out and keeps everything in place. My only problem with this product is that it seems to wear off after half a day or so. Other than that, this is a great product. Smells awesome as well!</li>
            <li> Smells gross, kinda like pine-sol and fish sauce. It stopped my beard dandruff and made my beard nice and soft. It also kept my stray hairs from going up and sideways. Only complaint is the smell. I wish they could make this stuff unscented. My wife refuses to go near my face when I put this stuff on. I think I get used to the smell after an hour or so, but she says its still there and very pungent. I probably am going to look for another brand with a less pungent smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is A1 in my book.  Makes my beard look  and feel great!! Shipping was super fast as well. I will be using this again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Feels good, smells good... makes your face smile.  Leaves my beard smooth and shiny.  I use it twice a day, but sometimes I cheat and use it a third time.  I&#x27;m a fan.  As Arnold once said, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> I did *no* research before growing a beard four years ago. I just did it. I figured, I&#x27;m a man, I can grow hair any place on my body on a whim (turns out, that&#x27;s not true anymore, but it&#x27;s an entirely different product review if I were to make scalp-cream shame-based purchases). When my under-beard facial hair started becoming frustrated this year, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do. I was getting flaky skin irritations and dander that had me reconsidering my aged beard of wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *did* research in finding product that would moisturize, calm and outright tame my angry beard and angry beard skin. Beard Balm is not waxy, it doesn&#x27;t smell funny, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, and it&#x27;s produced in small batches in the town of my longtime-favorite hockey team - the Detroit Redwings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I go bald on my cheeks and chin, I will continue to purchase Beard Balm. If I go bald on my cheeks and chin, I will (reluctantly) purchase another popular hair-growing product to bring the hair back so I can continue to buy Beard Balm. Keep up the great work.</li>
            <li> It feels great and does its job but I don&#x27;t really care too much for the smell and neither does anyone else around me.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell. I found it similar to car grease or plain vaseline.  I have used much better beard conditioners.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction w/ and as an alternative to jojoba oil and it works great. Opposed to beard oil, which soaks in quite quickly, this product remains &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; throughout the day (which I don&#x27;t consider to be a bad thing). It leaves the beard looking more full, better shaped, better looking and smelling great (I can&#x27;t overstate this point enough, the smell is amazing), all without appearing greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the desired effect, so I&#x27;m sure this tin will last me quite a while; I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another when the time comes!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a greaser or a gearhead you may dig this, but I found the smell to have a faint note of motor oil or WD-40, which is not my scene.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super easy to apply. Toss it through the beard in the morning and it&#x27;s shinier, easier to control, and has a great scent all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can leave a bit of residue behind if you use too much, which is easy, since it only takes about a dime-sized amount to get desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to keep ordering this product as my beard gets bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently grown out my beard to the point where I need to control a few unruly hairs. This stuff is magic, and it smells great. Leaves your beard pretty soft. If you cake it on (like I do) your beard may be a little greasy feeling for a few hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I tried Beard Balm as a way to tame the &amp;#34;afro&amp;#34; effect I was getting while growing out my beard.  Its important to me that my beard make good first impressions and not look unkempt.  Beard Balm does the trick.  The smell does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have used a few cans of this wonderful beard product and it works wonderfully. Aroma has been mentioned as a possible problem but for me I never really noticed, I use it just about everyday and my beard looks great with a softness from &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34; that is soft as a gentle breeze on a warm summer day. A small dab in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and apply to your beard and the gentle breeze of beard balm goes to work, no frizzy&#x27;s, lots of control, just a real joy.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and let the gentle breeze massage your beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and so does my wife... only using for 2 days but I can tell a difference much softer... shipping was quick and fast.. thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it suppose to do... Hydrates and keeps my beard conditioned throughout the day. In addition the scent of the is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product from a reliable business. I have been on the search for the right balm for a long time, and finally found it with this product. I live in Alaska and the product helps protect a beard from the cold dry winters we have up here.</li>
            <li> It worked great and is also good for hands</li>
            <li> Good stuff, left my beard soft, shiny, and comfortable........</li>
            <li> I ordered this beard balm a few months ago and am still loving it. It smells great and leaves my beard feeling nice and smooth. This was the first beard balm I ever purchased, and I definitely know I made the right choice!</li>
            <li> Works great, mild scent, easy to warm up and work in, and best of all MADE IN DETROIT.</li>
            <li> As a newly bearded man I was looking for something to deal with wild hairs.  Sometimes it was bristly and untamable.  I decided to give Beard Balm a shot and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the smell is great.  Its light and clean.  Nothing overwhelming and my wife loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my beards texture improved after just 2 uses.  Soft and easy to manage.  I use it after I get out of the shower and it keeps my beard shiny and smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more in the future now that Its helped me get my beard shape and style where I want it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he loves the product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and I like the smell. My beard is quite coarse and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this stuff, but now I&#x27;m pretty let down. My biggest issue with this stuff is the smell. It&#x27;s not manly, certainly not the smell of someone with a beard big enough to justify using a balm. You know when you start wearing a new cologne and the smell seems extra strong until your sense get used to it? That&#x27;s what happened with this stuff and the intensity of the smell lasts for weeks after the initial punch in the face. I can&#x27;t tell if people around me notice the smell, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they did. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s an unpleasant smell, like garbage, it&#x27;s just not very good. I was using the Crux beard oil before this and that had a nice, manly smell. Both products I&#x27;ve used certainly condition my beard, make it softer and such. But it&#x27;s going to be hard to get through this whole tin of balm before I bail on it for something different is my guess.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell that great. Works okay.</li>
            <li> The only entity that loves this stuff more than I do is my beard! I highly recommend this stuff to anybody who wants their beard to smell as good as it looks...</li>
            <li> I have now almost made it through my first tin of Beard Balm and much to my satisfaction it has met my expectations. Another tin will be on order when its gone. My beard is quite rough and Beard Balm has no problem softening and conditioning it. It really helps with all the knots and tangles. If you are looking for something to soften and smooth your beard I highly recommend giving this a try. There is a lot of discussion regarding the smell; it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It takes time to get used to it but that&#x27;s expected. Go ahead, order.</li>
            <li> The smell was the first thing that killed me. At first, I HATED the smell. It ruined all my food all day and just smelled like dip or something. The next day it wasn&#x27;t as bad. Maybe I got used to it or thought the dip smell was MANLY. The smell is strong, though, and you do smell it all day. I don&#x27;t put very much on but I hate touching my beard all day because my hands get greasy and beeswaxy. Don&#x27;t really notice much difference in softness, either. I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I would never buy it again. Especially at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You got me again, Made in America!</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing facial hair, yet this product has made my baby beard much more manageable. I love how quickly it absorbs, without a greasy after feel. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! I have purchased many beard balms/glosses and have found that along with Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard gloss this is a fantastic balm. It smells great and applies very easy to my bitchin&#x27; beard. I have no doubt that this product will continue to allow my beard to reach epic lengths. THANKS BEARD BALM!</li>
            <li> Used it twice, so far.  Smells good, looks good, feels good.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> The stuff works well, only giving 4* because I feel the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely seems to work.  It smells just like Carmex lip balm so if you dont like that regular lip balm smell it may not be for you..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smooths down all the fly away beard hairs and does make it feel a little smoother than without.  I would recommend it but for smoothness you could probably buy any leave in conditioner and get the same effect for a little less money.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. The smell is different, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. My beard is softer, straighter, and looks much better!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is soft.</li>
            <li> Smalls like my middle school band room that was carpeted and everyone emptied their spit valves on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s function is great, but the odor is not. Should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four weeks now and my beard stays soft it doesn&#x27;t dry out like it use to im definitely getting more. Check them out on Instagram #beardbalm</li>
            <li> My beard is happy! You guys always come through. I&#x27;ve never has a problem when I order from Amazon and I love Beard Balm! It really conditions my beard well and it smells good! Thanks again for your professionalism.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted. Its the best!</li>
            <li> has a waxy smell that lingers, although the lady didn&#x27;t think so. Does a good job to stick around and shine your face garden throughout the day.  Would buy again to cultivate my face with manliness once more.</li>
            <li> Very good product for keeping beard very conditioned. I highly recommended this if you are trying to keep it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, smells great and my beard has never looked healthier!</li>
            <li> This balm is amazing!  It&#x27;s one of the easiest balms to work into a beard, and leaves the hair soft and smooth without feeling overly oily.  I&#x27;m not personally a fan of the smell (it almost smells a bit buttery when first applied), but it fades into a more natural, earthy/floral scent throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll definitely be giving the unscented version a try next time.  But overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my beard feeing soft and looking great.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my beard it was still rough in dry did not soften it at all</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, definitely makes my beard look healthier.</li>
            <li> Works great, not greasy, smells good as well!</li>
            <li> Smells like formaldehyde in my opinion. Not my favorite but it does the job.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I traveled to Austin TX for Come and Shave it #9, a beard competition hosted by the Austin Facial Hair club. There were girls walking around handing out free tins of the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; balm.....I have used just about everything on the market in my beard and enjoy trying new things....and I really think this balm is great. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves a nice shine to my beard and makes it look and feel very healthy. Whenever I run out I will definitely be purchasing more!f</li>
            <li> The balm is ok - the smell is quite nice once you get used to it and it does give my beard a nice look when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue with the stuff is that it&#x27;s incredibly greasy.  It reminds me of the days when I used to use wax for my hair and my entire forehead would be greasy because of it.  It&#x27;s the exact same with this stuff except now my neck is covered in grease which I can feel during the day - not a particularly pleasant feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result I just can&#x27;t recommend this as something for long term use, the cons outweigh the pros for me</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and I saw the product and how small the little jar was  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last. But I was wrong, this thing is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good, but don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, it smells like a man should smell . The product itself is great, I will definitely buy another again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm for 4 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any kind of beard conditioner so I can&#x27;t comment on how this compares to other products but I can tell you this; I have very curly facial hair and this managed to make it manageable enough for me to grow a beard that is now almost five inches long now, and it doesn&#x27;t look like a bush! Before I used this product, any time I would make an attempt at growing a beard my face would always get itchier and itchier the longer it got. Now I think my only complaint now is that so many ladies want to feel how soft my beard is. Cane I blame them? We are talking about a silky soft, majestically flowing beard... too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re serious about your beard and want something that won&#x27;t weigh it down, just leave it shiny, soft and smelling great, you have to treat yourself to Beard Balm guys. Also it&#x27;s was made by a lady ( Hannah Lewis ) now I don&#x27;t know her but I&#x27;d imagine that a men&#x27;s hair care product for something only men have, a beard, being made by a lady means two things, she cares about our beards and ladies will like our beards if we use Beard Balm. Boom!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this to anyone with a beard. My beard stays gloriously glowing like the heavens opened up and god himself was jealous of my beard type of glorious. Keeps it soft and makes it more manageable. Although it would be nice if they could add some scented types to the lineup.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, will order again.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first tin and I have to say I love it. Other reviews mentioned the scent being strange or off putting, but I found it quite pleasing. I really like randomly smelling honey throughout the first couple minutes after application. I got many compliments on the shine and shape my beard was in after starting to use Beard Balm. I&#x27;m going to continue using it whether or not it has an affect on beard &amp;#34;health&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy a lumberjack scented concoction.</li>
            <li> A little bit to greasy but the smell is better than most. I prefer this over most beard balms</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of how it smells, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have tried all types of conditioning for my beard over the years and this stuff blows them all away. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the 1.5 oz. can size; big beard... need more per container</li>
            <li> My beard is now more manly than ever. The smell of this beard balm is one of the best smelling things I&#x27;ve ever smelled. It smells manly, rugged, and makes you feel like you need to go chop some wood and build a cabin. This would be my top pick for a beard balm. Smell like a man and fear the beard.</li>
            <li> So this was the first product of many that I tried and it&#x27;s the best of all. It works great and smells unbelievable. It gives your beard a nice shine with a little hold. I apply it everyday. The best time to apply in my opinion is fresh out of the shower at giving the beard a good towel dry. I highly recommend Beard Balm. Great job guys, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Smells great! First beard balm I have used and I love it.</li>
            <li> My beard smells great. It is soft. Women now flock to me to rub my glorious face hair.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this stuff, I had a pathetic, peach-fuzz of a beard.  After using Beard Balm, my inner lumberjack has shown his face (literally) and turned my fuzz into a manly mane of manliness.  My beard can wield an axe to help chop down trees, flannel not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit overpowering at first, but not because it smells bad.  It has an A&amp;D ointment tinge to it and it only took a day or two to get used to having that smell around.  Now that I&#x27;m used to it, its a part of me as much as my deodorant scent is.  Wife didnt like it (or my beard for that matter) at first, but I put the goo in anyways and my beard told her to shush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After only a few uses, the beard is noticeably softer and lays a little differently on my face.  Most of the flyaways are under control now (somewhat).  Also seems to look fuller now as well.  My skin under said mane is not nearly as dry anymore now too.  Excellent product though-I will most likely keep using it.</li>
            <li> First time using a balm and I really liked this. It really helps to tame a dry beard and wild hairs. Not much of a smell, which is a plus. Good product.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here needs to be in every beard sporting mans shelf. Some may complain about a smell, but as a female I actually quite liked it. I bought this for my significant other and he loved how amazing his beard felt afterwards and so did I. I will continue to give nothing but postive feedback with this product. Also it has a bonus, after using all the balm, you have a pretty cool tin afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my first time growing a beard, and I&#x27;m so happy I did some research and got something to keep me from looking disheveled and homeless.  This balm isn&#x27;t heavy at all, and works as a great conditioner after the thorough washes I&#x27;ve given it.  I just put it on after trimming and washing, and I get a nice, smooth, good smelling beard.  Loose hairs are put in line, and the itch of a dry, scraggly face is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue recommending this to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it&#x27;s growing on me. I was unsure at first about honey-like aroma, but I am liking it. Moisturizes and holds beard in place. Plus it&#x27;s made in Detroit!</li>
            <li> Once I opened the can, I was nervous about the smell...  It goes away pretty quick.  Does exactly what I bought it for.  Keeps my beard under control.  I&#x27;ve got some gray.  My wife tells me when I put it on, my grays &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s how she knows I have it on lol.  Be forewarned..  If you have a cat, keep it away from your face.  Cat hair clings!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great. Getting addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant smell. I also may be allergic to it because I get all scratchy with my beard. Much more than I did without it in.</li>
            <li> This is a brilliant product. I&#x27;ve been using my first can, daily, for about 4 months now and I&#x27;m about halfway through. It does exactly what it promises. I&#x27;m an Indian guy with a rather thick full black beard. I haven&#x27;t trimmed it all of November and the only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from looking like a caveman is this fantastic balm. It makes my beard soft and smooth and easy to manage.    The smell is very natural and kind of eucalyptus/camphor -ish, but subtle if you&#x27;re using the recommended amount (very little). My girlfriend had absolutely no issues with it and she loved stroking my beard whenever she got the chance. In terms of its efficacy, I have no complaints. My hair grows full and even and my skin feels smooth. Do yourself a favor and get this now if you have a beard or ever plan to grow one.    I do meet a lot of people who compliment my beard and say they don&#x27;t grow one because it&#x27;s hard to manage. All I tell them is to try out the beard balm and stop worrying about managing it. It really works.</li>
            <li> Growing a beard has been one of the highlights of 2014, signifying freedom for me.  Beard balm is the right product to compliment this freedom beard, and it&#x27;s made in the USA makes this freedom loving bearded man quite happy.  Sometimes, after Bruce&#x27;s \\&quot;Born in the USA\\&quot; finishes, and the Star Spangled Banner starts up, my beard is glistening in the East Coast Sunrise over the Atlantic, Bald Eagles swoop down and adorn my face.   I start crying because the amount of freedom is over whelming, and thank God for this county, the U.S. Marine Corps, Ed Sheeran, Bald Eagles, and Made in Detroit Beard Balm.   Amazon only allows me to rate this five stars- multiply that number by ten and you have the amount of stars I really give it- Fifty.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried many oils and balms and this is by far my go to choice. It smells great once you get used to it, and it always makes my beard looking lush after a shower. It keeps my ample beard looking nice through a long day at the office as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back and have been using it daily.  It definitely seems to make my beard more smooth.  The smell of this product is pretty neutral, but maybe smells most like lanolin (not sure if I really know what that smells like).  I notice that if I put too much in or don&#x27;t massage it in well that I get little drops of conditioner in my beard.  When this happens, I just make sure to wipe this out.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm. I have tried a bunch of different balms before I found this amazing american made product. I love the smell, and the shine it gives my beard. I love that it is all natural and is made in the USA. Give this a try! I promise it wont disappoint.</li>
            <li> My beard is stupid. It&#x27;s frizzed out, wild, and probably too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky enough to work in a place that doesn&#x27;t care if I look like an out of work lumberjack so I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time grooming, primping, trimming, or styling my beard. BUT I do want my beard to be healthy, soft, and well taken care of because it&#x27;s a fine line between robust mountain man beard and hobo who sleeps in a rail yard and heats up a can of beans over a barrel fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Beard Balm is perfect. Keeps my beard hydrated and healthy and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite increase in overall softness. The scent is gentle and pleasant and I&#x27;ve had no complaints from anyone who has gotten close enough to get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with hold and control for styling or whatever you may want to jump up to a wax or something. Think of Beard Balm as conditioner as opposed to hairspray/mousse/gel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Not too oily.  Geranium smell is interesting.  A bit medicinal, but enjoyable overall.  ANd you really only notice it during the application.  I&#x27;d like to see a version with a bay rum scent (bay rum is a tree by the way).</li>
            <li> It works well. It&#x27;s heavy enough to calm the wild hairs. It also tamed the itch after doing a heavier trim of my beard. It&#x27;s a really good product. Love that it comes from my (former) home state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I am not a fan of the scent. It&#x27;s not obtrusive, it&#x27;s not a bad smell. It&#x27;s just not for me. I think I just got too used to my pine scented oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still will use this from time to time to help keep things conditioned. If they add some scents options to this (pine), I would be all over it.</li>
            <li> Beard balm is great in all aspects! It helps control your beard, helps condition it and keeps it healthy all at the same time. It also has a nice scent to it as well! I reccomend this product to anyone growing a beard.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve tried numerous beard creams. This was my first and I had to go back to it. Other creams are just too hard, over priced or just plain didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted. Beard Balm spreads easy and evenly, smells great, and tames my unruly beard, especially the curly parts of my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon S.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this. It makes my beard shiny and soft, and gives it a little bit of hold for stray hairs. The smell is light and agreeable, and I usually don&#x27;t go for fragranced products</li>
            <li> This balm is great! I&#x27;ve been using it and my beard looks and feels great! The smell is real nice, very manly and girls love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first beard product I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My beard looks full, a little bit shiny, and smells nice. Its a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering like other products can be. My wife loves it and has taken to smelling and stroking my bears. Manliness booster.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The oils help soften and condition your beard while the little bit of wax helps with control and training thought beard how to lay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good brush is essential to get the most out of this product. Just a dab of balm and then brush it in and spread it around.</li>
            <li> Beard balm does what it says. I had been looking for something to make my beard soft and to tame it. I tried other beard products and this right here was worth money spent on. It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my beard. Do yourself a favor and get it. Don&#x27;t think about it. Just do it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to having a beard but I&#x27;m not new to being a man. This balm smells manly. I used it and never had any of the itch that stopped me from growing a beard before in the few times I tried. And it smelled good and manly. I got a ton of compliments which upped my confidence and I&#x27;ve kept the beard.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and it transformed -- transformed -- his beard.  it was so scratchy before.  now it shines and is soft.  thanks beard balm!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff use it everyday. Better then beard oil. I&#x27;ve used a lot of beard products and this is the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff works for me. I have a long goatee and this stuff makes it softer, more manageable, and helps prevent split ends. The smell is eucalyptus, so it is a bit medicinal. Fortunately the smell is gone by the time I drive to work, and after a few weeks I stopped noticing the smell. I am in the process of trying out other balms, so I will likely have more to add later.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34; brand beard balm gives me the confidence to allow my beard to continue to grow and exist as a fixture on my face without fear of rebellious strands. The light texture of the balm allows me to sculpt my beard into the shape of my choosing, and my partner loves the delicious, woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> Few people understand the dangers a tribute artist faces on a daily basis. When unruly fans, faulty tour buses, and drunk carnies at the county fair aren&#x27;t threatening your life, irresponsible pyrotechnics are setting your face on fire. My beard used to be as dry as the Mojave, and at any moment an errant spark could have lit the whole thing ablaze. Now, I&#x27;m not saying this product claims to be a fire retardant, but it did make my beard softer and less dry. I can play &amp;#34;Sharp Dressed Man&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Cheap Sunglasses&amp;#34; with confidence, and the other members of La Strange have noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beard Balm for a few months now and I love it. The scent, while being strong and slightly different than what I&#x27;m accustomed to, is really nice. It has a nice woodsy smell, while not being too off-putting. I have yet to have anyone say anything negative about the fragrance. As for the balm itself, the application is a breeze, usually taking no more than a minute for my medium-length beard. I have noticed a difference in how soft, and manageable my facial hair is since I started using this product. Also, it has helped to keep my skin nice and conditioned. Even in this dry South Korean winter. I fully recommend this product to any bearded or aspiring beard wearers.</li>
            <li> I bought my first can of Beard Balm a couple of months ago and it has become part of my morning routine. Beard Balm leaves you with a nice glistening beard and ever since I started using Beard Balm my beard has become more manageable and has the appearance of being fuller. Would recommend this for anyone who wants to enhance their beard.</li>
            <li> Can was open and dented,but product fine.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it overnight and my beard is already softer, the girlfriend will be happy.  Only complaint is that it arrived opened. Looks like the top fell off during delivery.</li>
            <li> I had a little left in a can and started using this stuff during the winter, as my beard has been getting dry from being out in the elements all day, and it helps battle the cold wind to block out the dryness.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Its not working I still have whiskers. And I really want a beard how long will it take I bought this in September. ...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent.... I thought I&#x27;d get used to it and used it for about a week.  It wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kept my mustache nice and soft and I&#x27;d reapply it mid-day.  Still just didn&#x27;t get used to the lemony zest scent too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered beard balm from Man&#x27;s Face Stuff and that stuff is HEAVEN.  Check them out for sure.  They have a store on et sy.</li>
            <li> Thank you product arrive good. Very satisfied with the services</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m bearding, I&#x27;ve ordered several beard balms available on Amazon. This is the third one I tried and it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others either have too much eucalyptus scent or are too oily. This one has a great scent that my wife enjoys and it helps tame my coarse beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that this product is manufactured in Detroit, which is near where I grew up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because of these guys the motor city will become Beard City.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used few different beard balms, and while this one doesn&#x27;t help shape the beard as much as the others, it makes my beard and my skin feel amazing.  Just ordered 2 more cans, as I can&#x27;t scrape any more out of the first can I got.  I will never run out of Beard Balm again.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the Beard Balm. The smell is pleasant and it&#x27;s lightweight. Also made his beard softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It makes my beard look healthy and manageable. My only complaint is the odor. My wife hates when I have first applied it because she states it smells like diaper ointment. It does have a similar odor to popular diaper cream so the smell leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> The scent has grown on me. Get it? Cause beards grow, and I applied it to my beard, so it&#x27;s grown on me?? Yuk-yuk.</li>
            <li> Order arrived quicker than I expected!  Smells nice, and is a great thing for a beard OR a mustache!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard bam.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Keeps my face happy. Little oily if you are a beard fidgeter, but thats expected when you put oil in your beard. Skin is happy again.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and has a nice but subtle scent. Makes my beard full and soft.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this!</li>
            <li> this balm is exceptionally greasy. use VERY VERY LITTLE. like poke it with a finger or two. dont rub, just poke. thats how much you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, go get some thai curry (like gang gai) and take a big deep whif of it. that is what your face will smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting cooling eucalyptus and menthol. it also did nothing to help with beard itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO if you are getting this for itchy beard, stop right there. go to your local pharmacy, get some regular old body lotion (green bottle vaseline with aloe smells great and applies without greasiness) and just use that. use it on your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will leave you a stinking greasy mess, i dont know how anyone could stand smelling like this all the time.</li>
            <li> Great balm, I melt it between my fingers and rub it into my beard following a shower, it creates just enough cohesion to brush it down and it stays down. People close to me have noticed. Customer service is also good with an immediate follow-up and definitely personalized. Love it, thanks for the great product. Will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> husband loves it, he can&#x27;t keep his hands off his beard</li>
            <li> I first found this product on another site, I&#x27;m so happy to find it here on Amazon, as well!!! It smells wonderful and makes my husband&#x27;s beard soft... he&#x27;s really happy with it and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for him! It&#x27;s great to find something locally produced, as well.</li>
