    <ol>
            <li>I think this works great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my purse and to get rid of those smudges under your eyes during the day,</li>
            <li>This is great for doing winged eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but I was still happy with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for eyeliner mistakes and even mascara mishaps like when you accidentally poke yourself with it.  </li>
            <li>Really good for cleaning up eyeliner mistakes and mascara goofs.</li>
            <li>Does the job and is a good size tube.</li>
            <li>This is great for my purse... very quick and effective in removing the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; under eye!  </li>
            <li>Great at making clean wings!</li>
            <li>glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>The tip fits nicely under my lower lashes, getting the mascara off the eyelid but not removing any mascara from my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>So easy and so effective!</li>
            <li>Definitely good for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Using that method, product residue on your skin gets removed perfectly with this elf pen just like the old Revlon pen.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to wipe the tip of the pen on a tissue or towel as you use it so the liner doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>Love this make up remover pen...</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Like many customers, I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan of the now discontinued Revlon makeup eraser pen.  </li>
            <li>I like this e.l.f. pen a lot better than the Loreal paris pen.  </li>
            <li>love it for the price</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup well- tested on lip liner and it erased most or the color in one swipe.</li>
            <li>The tip and size are really what makes this superior to using a q-tip or makeup pad which would take off more makeup than you want and are also not reusable.</li>
            <li>You do have to wipe it off with a tissue between uses which is totally fine IMO.</li>
            <li>The lid is secure so this would be portable (for example, if you were out and about and were wearing mascara or eyeliner that started to run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just is lightly soaked from within in the makeup remover.</li>
            <li>If you touch the pen to your skin it will wipe away whatever makeup is there, pretty precise!</li>
            <li>Just keep it clean and it will work over and over</li>
            <li>I struggle to get an even line across my top lid with liquid eyeliner, and this pen allows me to clean up any mistakes without completely washing off the liner.</li>
            <li>It will take it right off.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I have the most issues getting it on my lower eyelids, but sometimes I&#x27;ll get it on my upper eyelids or even cheek</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>tip is turning dark brown because I mostly use it to clean up eyeliner but still works well.</li>
            <li>This is amazing,  it just wipes makeup right off the little spots</li>
            <li>Works really well, freshens up your look anytime during the day or evening.</li>
            <li>That worked, but always involved a little more liquid than I wanted to use.</li>
            <li>I worry that this pen may dry out quickly, but it has worked very well in the time I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>I got my first one of these in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle but have re-purchased several times because I find them to be so convenient.</li>
            <li>Takes off wayward mascara quickly without taking off too much other makeup.</li>
            <li>I have already used it a couple of different times and it really works.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve  tried this to get all sorts of mascaras and liquid eyeliners off my skin.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a fairly fine, stiff tip, so you only use the product where you want it and not anywhere else.</li>
            <li>thought that it would leave behind more liquid</li>

            <li> This is great for doing winged eyeliner. I struggle to get an even line across my top lid with liquid eyeliner, and this pen allows me to clean up any mistakes without completely washing off the liner. Just be sure to wipe the tip of the pen on a tissue or towel as you use it so the liner doesn&#x27;t stain. I worry that this pen may dry out quickly, but it has worked very well in the time I&#x27;ve had it. Do not regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have fiddled with qtips and makeup remover, only to redo my eye makeup again, when this product exists.  So easy and so effective! I was worried that this would leave a smudge, but it removed it completely without encroaching on the rest of my makeup, so much less to redo.  Great at making clean wings!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it needs to do. Really good for cleaning up eyeliner mistakes and mascara goofs.</li>
            <li> Love this make up remover pen...</li>
            <li> Does the job and is a good size tube.</li>
            <li> I think this works great! Takes off wayward mascara quickly without taking off too much other makeup. I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is great for my purse... very quick and effective in removing the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; under eye!  A little goes a long way!  Was afraid that the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; would just add more mascara breakdown on my eyes, but no problem at all.</li>
            <li> This is amazing,  it just wipes makeup right off the little spots were you might have made an error.  Just keep it clean and it will work over and over</li>
            <li> It is ok. Definitely good for the cheap price. So it deserves a few stars.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> It broke but I was still happy with it</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty well.  Like many customers, I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan of the now discontinued Revlon makeup eraser pen.  I like this e.l.f. pen a lot better than the Loreal paris pen.  The elf pen feels like it leaves a sharper line.  I&#x27;ve always used a method with both elf and Revlon of wrapping a square of tissue paper over my finger tip and using my fingernail to wipe over the line that I just corrected with the makeup pen.  Using that method, product residue on your skin gets removed perfectly with this elf pen just like the old Revlon pen.  I also blot the pen tip after every use.</li>
            <li> I had finally ran out of my expensive L&#x27;Oreal remover pen and thought I would give this one a try and it works just as good as the expensive ones, glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> love it for the price</li>
            <li> Works really well, freshens up your look anytime during the day or evening. No more &#x27;raccoon eyes&#x27; in the middle of the day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pointed so it&#x27;s not comfortable to use and due to that hurts to use. Smears makeup instead of removing it so I end up having to take it off manually still.</li>
            <li> I almost never manage to put mascara on without getting some somewhere besides my eyelashes. I have the most issues getting it on my lower eyelids, but sometimes I&#x27;ll get it on my upper eyelids or even cheek (don&#x27;t ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was dipping Q-Tips in my Clinique &amp;#34;Take the Day Off&amp;#34; makeup remover. That worked, but always involved a little more liquid than I wanted to use. I was worried about drying time/getting it off, and I was worried about the liquid spreading and removing makeup that I didn&#x27;t want removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this eye makeup remover pen. I have already used it a couple of different times and it really works. It sort of feels like a marker so it&#x27;s not dripping liquid anywhere. There&#x27;s a fairly fine, stiff tip, so you only use the product where you want it and not anywhere else. The tip fits nicely under my lower lashes, getting the mascara off the eyelid but not removing any mascara from my eyelashes. The lid is secure so this would be portable (for example, if you were out and about and were wearing mascara or eyeliner that started to run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve  tried this to get all sorts of mascaras and liquid eyeliners off my skin.  I got my first one of these in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle but have re-purchased several times because I find them to be so convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for makeup mess-ups. It&#x27;s great for eyeliner mistakes and even mascara mishaps like when you accidentally poke yourself with it.  (We&#x27;ve all done it.) It will take it right off. I just wipe off the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; with a baby wipe or paper towel after I use it to get the excess makeup off.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup well- tested on lip liner and it erased most or the color in one swipe. I use to neaten eye makeup, too- it gets those annoying humidity smudges right off. Works on my waterproof liquid eyeliner after it has set, and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> Completely dried up and the tip fell out when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Amazon and based on reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try look for it in an actual store where it&#x27;d be cheaper. Target carries it for $3 and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that it would leave behind more liquid but it seems like the pen tip (felt on hard plastic) just is lightly soaked from within in the makeup remover. If you touch the pen to your skin it will wipe away whatever makeup is there, pretty precise! Doesn&#x27;t leave grease or oil behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip is turning dark brown because I mostly use it to clean up eyeliner but still works well. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, though. You do have to wipe it off with a tissue between uses which is totally fine IMO. The tip and size are really what makes this superior to using a q-tip or makeup pad which would take off more makeup than you want and are also not reusable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. Perfect for my purse and to get rid of those smudges under your eyes during the day,</li>
