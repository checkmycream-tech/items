            <li>My favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I do love it.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is it already fell off the wall with the screws provided and had to get better ones.</li>
            <li>Dryer is great, very powerfull and hangs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could be better is it had more heat but, still outperforms the smaller&lt;br /&gt;wall mounts</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>we love this product that mounts on the wall easy to find no fuss to deal with in a drawer</li>
            <li>It blows great and is handy having it on the wall especially for guest.</li>
            <li>The price is fair and it blows strong without being too hot or too damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great and keeps the bathroom counter clear of clutter.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, powerful, wall-hanging blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Easily mounted and seems to have suffiecient drying speed.</li>
            <li>The mounting device is so so but works and is relatively easy to mount/install.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount.</li>
            <li>Worked well- gave as gift as lady said it went on wall easy</li>
            <li>More powerful than most wall mount models.</li>
            <li>I immediately unplugged it, let it cool on my counter top, and then threw it away.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but I do not like the mounting system.  </li>
            <li>It seems rather cheap</li>
            <li>It seems to be cheaply made and there is no way to keep dust etc from being sucked in-</li>
            <li>Light , comfortable,simple and very powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.</li>
            <li>This dryer really puts out the hot air and at a good speed.</li>
            <li>product!&lt;br /&gt;Packing was excellent as usual.  </li>
            <li>Last one had a night light that I loved but the blow dryer went out.</li>
            <li>no filter to clean and replace.  </li>
            <li>and clean.  </li>
            <li>The fan is strong and it is powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is a full size dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great other than that.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you want a lot of hot air - fast - this is the ideal dryer.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer because I was looking for a full size powerful dryer that hangs on the wall.  </li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t think it is worth putting on the wall.</li>
            <li>Works Great for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one was simple to install and is very secure to the wall.</li>
            <li>The price seems very reasonable.</li>
            <li>End the sink top clutter, and add safety at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous dryers, which may be better for my hair, but I like it fine.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer, I just wish it would last longer then 12 months!!</li>
            <li>The dryer itself works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>First time purchase of a wall-mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>There are other more powerful and nicer for mounting.  </li>
            <li>My one little frustration with it is that I keep accidentally turning it off while using it because the on/off switch is right under my thumb when I am gripping it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first one of this style earlier this year and paid much more than the current price.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and seems very much like a professional dryer.</li>
            <li>For the next four months, the strength of the air blowing out of the dryer continued to decrease until finally one day, while I was trying to finish drying my hair, the heating element turned bright red and glowed through the plastic.  </li>
            <li>The previous model had a more substantial wall mounted bracket with metal and was easier to holster and retrieve.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected, does the job, but I thought it would not have so much plastic, the holder is cheap.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I bought a second one just like it, but only after the first one died after about a year&#x27;s worth of daily use.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>Also, the switch could have been a little better designed, but again, I don&#x27;t see any problems there either.</li>
            <li>Quiet but powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Although the customer service representative was fully understanding and agreed to send a new replacement hair dryer, it has been a month and a new one has yet to be received.  </li>
            <li>But I obviously bought an exact replacement and will buy another one if this one goes.</li>
            <li>I love the functionality of wall mounting for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>And here I am again, purchasing another one exactly one year later!!!!  </li>
            <li>I received the first one as a Christmas gift and in November the next year, it completely died on me.  </li>
            <li>Had to lay my old dryer in the floor when not in use.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it will hold up.</li>
            <li>Also, the old bracket was metal, this one is plastic.</li>
            <li>When I called Amazon customer service, I was directed to contact the company Andis directly.  </li>
            <li>Saying all of that, this is my THIRD ONE in just as much time.  </li>
            <li>so far</li>
            <li>Just low, off and high.</li>
            <li>BUT it has much more power than previous wall-mounted ones from other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is great--it is our second one for this model---and hope it lasts as long as the first one we purchased.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I am extremely picky about my hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>The bracket on this one is plastic and the dryer is a little more difficult to get in and out of the bracket due to being snug, However, the way that it is set up, the on/off switch automatically turns to off which is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>have had the dryer for about 2 years ,and then it would only work intermittenly and finaly one time when using it a loud pop was heard and</li>
            <li>It is simple to operate - since there are only three options - off, low, and high.</li>
            <li>The wall mounting hardware could have been a little more heavy duty (like the one that It replaced), but I don&#x27;t see any problems there if mounted correctly.</li>
            <li>The instructions given to attach the unit to drywall first tell you to drill a hole that is far too small for the supplied inserts.</li>
            <li>Serves it&#x27;s purpose exactly as needed, no more no less.</li>
            <li>Also, does not have some of the other functions of other models, like cool or high/med or low heat.  </li>
            <li>Overall, does the trick, but is pretty plain looking.  </li>

            <li> I have thick hair and it dries my hair quickly and the cord is long enough to move around.</li>
            <li> It is so convenient, no more digging for the hair dryer, it is ready and waiting.  </li>
            <li> About 7 months after purchase, the hair dyer started making strange noises.  </li>

            <li> Even more frustrating was the fact that the wall inserts were slightly different sizes, so if you drill a hole that fits the slightly larger (mind you, the size difference is not noticeable to your eyes, you need to use a micrometer) insert, the smaller insert is useless.</li>

            <li> I noticed this one has louder noise than my previous one, I have one bathroom next to my bedroom, I need a dryer with low noise level. But in terms of power and effectiveness of drying hair, no complain, it does the job well.</li>
            <li> ASIN: B000928EE8 I bought this hair dryer cause I needed a hair dryer that could be wall mounted as I need one for my Travel Trailer. Had to lay my old dryer in the floor when not in use. The dryer has plenty of power to dry your hair. Mounts easly with little tools needed. I was disappointed in the mount holding power. I don&#x27;t think it will stay in the holder while traveling down the road. Stays while stopped. This holder just has a pressure point on it. Wish it had release buttons like the ones that are mounted in Hotels. Works great other than that. I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is inconveniently located on the handle so that when blow drying hair, it is easy to inadvertently switch off the dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer hangs up well and is really handy to use.  I use it every three days and do not have to look for it or plug it in; it is already there.  The dryer works well.</li>
            <li> have had the dryer for about 2 years ,and then it would only work intermittenly and finaly one time when using it a loud pop was heard and it quit all together.the switch seemed to be the problem.</li>
            <li> End the sink top clutter, and add safety at the same time.  Product does a good job on both heat settings.  The mounting bracket leaves a little to be desired.  Other reviewers commented on this also.  I had to modify it by using larger &amp; longer screws with washers.</li>
            <li> Easily mounted and seems to have suffiecient drying speed. Some disappointed about the plastic base/housing. Too early to tell if it will hold up.</li>
            <li> I would like to give this hair dryer 3.5 stars. I liked it enough that I bought a second one just like it, but only after the first one died after about a year&#x27;s worth of daily use. We lack storage space in our small bathroom, so I needed a wall-mounted hair dryer. This one was simple to install and is very secure to the wall. It is simple to operate - since there are only three options - off, low, and high. I would have liked a cold air button, but that&#x27;s too high-tech for this simple machine. But I obviously bought an exact replacement and will buy another one if this one goes. Luckily, they aren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the accessibility and convenience of this blow dryer.  The directions made it very easy to install on the wall.  It works great and keeps the bathroom counter clear of clutter.</li>
            <li> I love the functionality of wall mounting for my small bathroom. I bought the first one of this style earlier this year and paid much more than the current price.  Yes, it is plastic and looks a bit inexpensive BUT it has much more power than previous wall-mounted ones from other manufacturers.  The power switch on the handle is MUCH more convenient than having to reach to the wall to change settings to turn on/off!   The noise level seems less, or comparable to other models.  The cord became overly stretched out when the painting contractors decided to use it to dry their ceiling repair work so I&#x27;m replacing it; otherwise it is still functional. I&#x27;ve recommended this brand and style to family members as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to return it. I think I may just donate it to the salvation army.  It seems rather cheap and so I don&#x27;t think it is worth putting on the wall.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about two years ago for about 50$. Now it&#x27;s about half of the price. Light , comfortable,simple and very powerful dryer.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this thing......but hold on it blows like a hurricane.....</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very good with two heat settings. The mounting device is so so but works and is relatively easy to mount/install.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer bedcause of the power.  I love that it hangs on the wall but I&#x27;ve bought a couple of them and 2 out of 3 died in a short period.  I don&#x27;t know why??</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and I recommend this item to anybody. I take my time to do research and settled on this one. I&#x27;m very happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> we love this product that mounts on the wall easy to find no fuss to deal with in a drawer</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, does the job, but I thought it would not have so much plastic, the holder is cheap.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be just what I wanted.  I wanted a blow dryer which would hang on the wall and be out of the way.  The fan is strong and it is powerful.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, powerful, wall-hanging blow dryer.  Time will tell if it holds up well!  It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous dryers, which may be better for my hair, but I like it fine.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 of these... this one has lasted the longest.  Last one had a night light that I loved but the blow dryer went out.</li>
            <li> Great product, good power, hangs on the wall, works great.  Nothing I can say except I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> last for a month, burn now.</li>
            <li> Only lasted 3 months.  Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> This model works well.  The previous model had a more substantial wall mounted bracket with metal and was easier to holster and retrieve.  The bracket on this one is plastic and the dryer is a little more difficult to get in and out of the bracket due to being snug, However, the way that it is set up, the on/off switch automatically turns to off which is a nice feature.  Nice product for the price and it sure beats pulling the dryer in and out of the cabinet.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. It is so convenient, no more digging for the hair dryer, it is ready and waiting.  I would hate to be without this product, it makes my mornings run so smoothly! My teenagers love it too, it just couldn&#x27;t be more handy. It has a lot of power and seems very much like a professional dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer!  It helps keep the bathroom organized.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair quickly and the cord is long enough to move around.</li>
            <li> All in all a great dryer. The hi speed is very powerful and heat level is good. Serves it&#x27;s purpose exactly as needed, no more no less.</li>
            <li> Have had this same hair dryer before.  Puts out a lot of heat, and I love that it is out of the way hanging on the wall.  My favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It seems to be cheaply made and there is no way to keep dust etc from being sucked in- no filter to clean and replace.  It does do its job but I am not sure for how long.</li>
            <li> Pretty powerful..not bad for a wall hair dryer.  I use it everyday and it does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> I hung this in my bathroom and I do love it. It is very powerful. Cord is perfect. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is it already fell off the wall with the screws provided and had to get better ones. I would order it again if needed!</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I do not like the mounting system.  Over time, I expect the dryer will pull out from the wall.  You have to yank the dryer out of the wall mount, and either the wall mount or the wall will eventually fail.  The old dryer (broken), from the same company had four screws holding the mounting bracket, this one has two.  Also, the old bracket was metal, this one is plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because I was looking for a full size powerful dryer that hangs on the wall.  The price is fair and it blows strong without being too hot or too damaging to the hair.  My one little frustration with it is that I keep accidentally turning it off while using it because the on/off switch is right under my thumb when I am gripping it.  I am trying to train myself to hold it so that doesn&#x27;t happen.  Overall though, the benefits outweigh the problem.</li>
            <li> Dryer is great, very powerfull and hangs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very fast and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product its a great buy for the money!!</li>
            <li> About 7 months after purchase, the hair dyer started making strange noises.  About a week or two latr, just stopped working.  When I called Amazon customer service, I was directed to contact the company Andis directly.  Although the customer service representative was fully understanding and agreed to send a new replacement hair dryer, it has been a month and a new one has yet to be received.  Today I will try to call Andis again to see status of the replacement</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am extremely picky about my hair dryers.  I blow dry my hair every morning and do NOT want to spend 30 minutes underneath a hair dryer every day.  THIS hair dryer has awesome power, the right amount of heat, and I LOVE that I can hook it to my wall so it&#x27;s out of the way.  Saying all of that, this is my THIRD ONE in just as much time.  I received the first one as a Christmas gift and in November the next year, it completely died on me.  After about 7 months, I heard a click while I was in the middle of drying my hair and then the strength of the air coming out of the dryer decreased by about 50%.  For the next four months, the strength of the air blowing out of the dryer continued to decrease until finally one day, while I was trying to finish drying my hair, the heating element turned bright red and glowed through the plastic.  I immediately unplugged it, let it cool on my counter top, and then threw it away.  I thought maybe I just received a defective one because I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer only last for less than a year!  So I purchased another one, through Amazon.  The same thing happened with that one!!  And here I am again, purchasing another one exactly one year later!!!!  I love this hair dryer, I just wish it would last longer then 12 months!!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> The dryer itself works exactly as advertised. On the down side, the part that mounts to the wall and the hardware provided is a piece of junk. The instructions given to attach the unit to drywall first tell you to drill a hole that is far too small for the supplied inserts. Even more frustrating was the fact that the wall inserts were slightly different sizes, so if you drill a hole that fits the slightly larger (mind you, the size difference is not noticeable to your eyes, you need to use a micrometer) insert, the smaller insert is useless. The piece that holds the dryer is flimsy, and to remove the dryer you need to be cautious. Once this dryer dies, I won&#x27;t be replacing it with the same dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer really puts out the hot air and at a good speed. I would have given it five stars if it would have had a &#x27;fan only&#x27; switch. The wall mounting hardware could have been a little more heavy duty (like the one that It replaced), but I don&#x27;t see any problems there if mounted correctly. Also, the switch could have been a little better designed, but again, I don&#x27;t see any problems there either. Overall, if you want a lot of hot air - fast - this is the ideal dryer.</li>
            <li> does a great job drying we hair ! keeps the wife happy</li>
            <li> I love my new wall dryer worked perfect. I would recommend it to anyone. It blows great and is handy having it on the wall especially for guest. I also wouldn&#x27;t order from anyone but amazon  they always have what I want at a good price, and get it to me quickly. I always trust them with my orders.</li>
            <li> Quiet but powerful hairdryer. Easy to mount. Why didn&#x27;t I look for this item years ago? Keeps the cords off the counter and is conveniently within reach at all times.</li>
            <li> Worked well- gave as gift as lady said it went on wall easy just wish the cord was a little longer</li>
            <li> There are other more powerful and nicer for mounting.  Overall, does the trick, but is pretty plain looking.  Also, does not have some of the other functions of other models, like cool or high/med or low heat.  Just low, off and high.</li>
            <li> This is good for using my conair diffuser with.&lt;br /&gt;I like having this hanging on the wall next to my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Neat and clean.  This is a full size dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best way to save space in the bathroom and have the dryer handy!</li>
            <li> First time purchase of a wall-mount hair dryer.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It looks great and is light and not bulky!&lt;br /&gt;Excepional product!&lt;br /&gt;Packing was excellent as usual.  I intend to purchase another one for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> Just had them for a week so far but one is not working properly and the site person tells me they do not replace damaged or non-working merchandise as it was received.  I would not patronize this one again.</li>
            <li> This dryer lasted less than six weeks.  Yesterday morning the unit had a spark flash internally and a puff of smoke came out of each side.  I let the unit sit for a day, tried reseting it, but nothing... it&#x27;s completely dead.  Wish it had done this two weeks ago so it could still be returned.</li>
            <li> Ordered it on a Monday and it arrived on Wednesday--good delivery time. The dryer itself is great--it is our second one for this model---and hope it lasts as long as the first one we purchased. The price seems very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This item helps with the limited space in my wife&#x27;s bathroom.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> More powerful than most wall mount models. Could be better is it had more heat but, still outperforms the smaller&lt;br /&gt;wall mounts</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get a hair dryer like those in hotels, and when our last one went, I bought this one. It is excellent.  The cord never is in the way, the dryer is never in the way, and is now the only way we&#x27;ll ever go with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Wish it was facing the other direction though. But very nice to have off the counter in the bathroom. Good power.</li>
            <li> Works Great for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product.  No more clutter or picking the fool thing up off the floor.  Has the power I wanted and is of great quality.</li>
            <li> This thing blew up just after warranty expired,</li>
            <li> must admit it is a little noisy It doesnt have heat controls on it just an on and off. I was a touch dissappointed</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer!! It is one of the best I have ever used or seen on the market! Thank you for a wonderful product!!!</li>
