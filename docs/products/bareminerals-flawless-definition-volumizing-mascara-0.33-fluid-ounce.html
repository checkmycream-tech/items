            <li>This version is the best, I love it -</li>
            <li>Used to buy this mascara and loved it, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fantastically as I remember, but still a great product, no clumping</li>
            <li>But for now it seems to be a fairly good product.</li>
            <li>This mascara is perfect - goes on smooth, stays put all day, never smudges off below my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>This product was supposed to be good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of mascaras over the years and like Bare Minerals Flawless Definition Volumizing Mascara the best.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Truly love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>I repurchased 2 more!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>My 3d fiber lash is way better!</li>
            <li>This mascara works well, looks good and washes away easily!  </li>
            <li>It feels nice going on</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice that this was &#x27;volumizing&#x27;, but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would be concerned about getting mascara not wrapped individually............in its own wrapper.</li>
            <li>I usually love Bareminerals mascara, but the volumizing isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Nice mascara.</li>
            <li>so I would have it handy at the office, home,</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara gives great volume, doesn&#x27;t flake and washes off easily</li>
            <li>than that I am happy with the product and how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li>It smells very strong, as if it came from a sub-standard batch.</li>
            <li>I have heard alot of good things about the product of bare Minerals and so glad I ordered, best ever!</li>
            <li>By far the best mascara out there.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>A near perfect mascara</li>
            <li>I always say the true test of a product is if you would purchase it again, well, I will!!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best mascara bareMinerals makes in my opinion, but it does the job, and it wipes off pretty clean.</li>
            <li>It was great the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>The mascara didn&#x27;t have the rubber seal around the top of it</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>is much better and lasts way longer.</li>
            <li>It lengthened my eyelashes, defined them, made my eyes just lovely and defined.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love???  </li>
            <li>I love mascaras and have tried drug store mascaras and department stores mascaras.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem any better than the brands you can pick up in a discount store.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Glad I could find it online.</li>
            <li>I love Bareminerals products for the most part</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this mascara  </li>
            <li>love that..</li>
            <li>tried this 3-4 times, and it never got better.</li>
            <li>I like it as a mascara, but I wish it did more</li>
            <li>so I could feel even better about spending more on a  paraben-free mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love this brand.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara for giving me the fullness I want.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I love bareminerals eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love how it separates my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I like plastic brushes much better.</li>
            <li>Checked with the website EWG to see what is considered safe mascara</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara to use.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product looks.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara as it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will stick to paying more for something of quality.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I do love it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as well as most others.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  my eye doctor told me my eyes were completely healthy</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but Calvin Klein mascara costs a lot more and has harmful ingredients in it</li>
            <li>But as a daily mascara this stuff it awesome.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Mascara.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li>and I could see how some reviewers might love it,</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see anything remarkable about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other products and this is the greatest.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect one, and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>but when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and so many cosmetics were noted with estrogen-mimicking ingredients, toxins, etc, I decided to clean up my make-up.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t define lashes well and smudges easily.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself, once helped, is easy to get off.</li>
            <li>it goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
            <li>And is easy to wash off with my nightly cleanser.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with make up remover</li>
            <li>Bare minerals makes great makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find my favorite mascara available on Amazon, so I ordered it with 2-day shipping from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>It is, hands down, the BEST I&#x27;ve used ever</li>
            <li>For these great prices I don&#x27;t need the packaging, only the tube is just fine.  </li>
            <li>so when I pull it out, there is a huge glump of mascara that you can&#x27;t put on your eyes.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m cheap and frugal and will use it up but will buy from another vendor..  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but instead clumped together and did not have a smooth application, like it was supposed to have.</li>
            <li>I have light eyelashes</li>
            <li>I use the regular Bare Escentuals Flawless mascara and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is the best makeup by far.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to wash off with mild soap and water.</li>
            <li>I have used this mascara for a long time and I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I still like the color and the lack of strange ingredients, plus the coverage is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to give it one more try since I have loyalty with this brand.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dime!</li>
            <li>The full brush is great &amp; I recommend this mascara to those who want to make long lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basically cheap, but I splurge on this, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Because of that, my whole face is opened up more.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I&#x27;m very picky about mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried this mascara in a smaller version and loved it.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara; the consistency and the brush are top notch.  </li>
            <li>Go to me quick (without having to pay for shipping:-))&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off quickly.</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of the Bare Minerals line, I wanted to love this mascara...</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that I don&#x27;t get itchy eyes from!  </li>
            <li>Not only has it Never irritated my eyes, I believe it leaves my lashes in better condition!  </li>
            <li>I liked their non-volumizing mascara as well, but it just didn&#x27;t give my lashes enough &#x27;oomph&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li>This one however is clumpy and I rarely wear it.</li>
            <li>You can add layers, I&#x27;ve only needed two, but to each their own.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush and really do feel like it gives me tons of volume on my puny Asian lashes :)</li>
            <li>i like it because this is useful for my lashes</li>
            <li>I do not use any other mascara that can give me the same great results like Bareminerals!</li>
            <li>First of it plumps you lashes to max and makes them super fat without making them look spidery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good mascara that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>but right now i am dome with my thing that i need to buy another one.</li>
            <li>so it looks better and it has more staying power, less smudging.  </li>
            <li>My bare lashes look better when I use Bareminerals</li>
            <li>I wish it would last a little longer than it does, but it stays all day, does not flake, very water resistant and its the perfect color.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might have been the product, mascara always smells funny to me.</li>
            <li>I have watched the Bareminerals infomercials with interest but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried one of their products.</li>
            <li>complaints that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as full as even some of the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried (although, granted, the Bare Minerals formula is probably much more natural, which is why I wanted it in the first place).</li>
            <li>It is a good mascara, it went on a bit too heavy</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that even when you apply a lot of this product you never get raccoon eyes which I&#x27;ve noticed other high end mascaras</li>
            <li>I finally found a mascara that is great on dry eyes.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals and is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>First the wand is nearly perfect, small and cylindrical so it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product, and the tip actually is able to get into close quarters, like the inner and outer corners of your eyes and your bottom lashes without the mess .  </li>
            <li>I also like to add that this product is more like a cake, pasty, charcoal gray, dry content.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, builds lush natural looking lashes, stays on all day without smudging, and washes off with Dove soap and water.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand and product many times, so I&#x27;m familiar with its usual consistency and odor.</li>
            <li>The brush is not the kind I was hoping for and the picture is a little misleading .&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>This (and the $15 I spend on it) is going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This mascara is very clumpy.</li>
            <li>Just keeping it real.</li>
            <li>just gently pull it up, there will be plenty of product for the job.  </li>
            <li>i really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for it on here</li>
            <li>It really does make my lashes fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>It really thickens my lashes without being clumpy at all.</li>
            <li>But I really like how it makes my eyes look.</li>
            <li>this highly!</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t go for the cheapy stuff, but going to a regular store for mascara is fine IF it has a decent BRUSH.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve had to stay in a completely black room with an eye patch since the first time my eye was scratched.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have wasted money on every kind from drug store to high end department store mascaras.</li>
            <li>At that price, it&#x27;s unfortunately not even worth a trip to the post office to ship back.</li>
            <li>I have used Bare minerals in other products and I love them!</li>
            <li>Love and use only bare mineral products</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but when I opened it for the first time, it was dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li>It gives you the appearance of thick full lashes both top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals, but I highly doubt this is the actual product</li>
            <li>I grabbed a &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; mascara from another company to leave at work, &amp; the very first time I used it my eyes were red &amp; it was flaking...</li>
            <li>Keep the natural and healthy glowing look using only Bare Escentual products.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cap is on tight, you&#x27;ll have no problems</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes due a surgery I had many years ago &amp;</li>
            <li>It last all day and makes me lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li>Volumizing should not mean cake on the goop.</li>
            <li>I have sparse lashes &amp; sensitive eyes (&amp; sometimes wear contacts), and have found this product very helpful.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s put it this way, this is pretty much the only mascara I buy.</li>
            <li>However, there just isn&#x27;t enough of the product in the tube to make it worth it.  </li>
            <li>First time to purchase Bare Escentuals mascara</li>
            <li>Ok so the reason I bought this is because I was having eye trouble.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this mascara in the store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a new mascara forever</li>
            <li>I have very short, very straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was old, of just normal performance.</li>
            <li>No more Covergirl arsenic filled mascara for me!</li>
            <li>I tried it for a week and ended up throwing it away because it made my lashes look like one huge clump of black goo.</li>
            <li>Mascara is the last and final thing I put on in regards to makeup and this mascara goes on quick without a lot of effort and time.</li>
            <li>The application is smooth, just a little clumping.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with one of the other reviews that this mascara dries out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I place the wand at the bast and just give it a little wiggle then pull straight to tip a few times, this keeps clumps away and coats nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a &#x27;natural&#x27; one, but my mom accidentally ordered this one and then raved about it.  </li>
            <li>or I just got old product.</li>
            <li>Looks soft and naturally.</li>
            <li>and so it makes them look like I do not have a lot of mascara on by having the natural look.  </li>
            <li>That is a mind numbing pain that I would compare with the pain of natural childbirth.</li>
            <li>and they sent me something that was already a bit old.  </li>
            <li>It also does not affect my sensitive allergy eyes.</li>
            <li>I keep it on hand in case I am looking for a really dramatic look, but for everyday use the regular Flawless mascara</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that the particular tube I got was old or bunk.</li>
            <li>Most mascara is black and wet.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try some organic mascara but settled on this since it was my only local option to anything remotely natural.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, especially at this low price.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, not too thick.</li>
            <li>Since this purchase I have bought additional tubes at the local store and had no problems with it drying out or seeming dry at first.</li>
            <li>This is my second tube of bareminerals mascara and as the last one got older</li>
            <li>This one goes on a bit sticky - hard to get the lashes smooth looking.</li>
            <li>I have used other Bareminerals products, and always had a positive experience.</li>
            <li>It barely would cover my lashes, came out of the tube in blobs, didn&#x27;t color them.</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals products and decided to try their mascara.</li>
            <li>I fixed the problem by adding several drops of saline and mixing it in.</li>
            <li>I alwasys do well with bare minerals.</li>
            <li>it goes on thick and when I use a brush to smooth out to ends to make my lases longer  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals products my entire adult life (ten years)</li>
            <li>Contrary to some of the other reviews stating how dry the product was this one came fresh.  </li>
            <li>The mascara didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tubes I normally buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I bought this and used it a few times and then it started to smell funny.</li>
            <li>I will try a different Bare Minerals mascara next time - I don&#x27;t remember the one I had before.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other mascara tends to do, Bare Minerals Volumizing mascara does not usually clump but it does what it promises to do: create volume.</li>
            <li>This product was clearly used and not NEW as represented in the ad!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, though, while the tube did appear to be new and in original packaging, the mascara itself seemed to have expired.</li>

            <li> This version is the best, I love it -</li>
            <li> Used to buy this mascara and loved it, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fantastically as I remember, but still a great product, no clumping</li>
            <li> But for now it seems to be a fairly good product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect - goes on smooth, stays put all day, never smudges off below my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascaras over the years and like Bare Minerals Flawless Definition Volumizing Mascara the best.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Truly love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> I repurchased 2 more!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> My 3d fiber lash is way better!</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, looks good and washes away easily!  </li>
            <li> It feels nice going on</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice that this was &#x27;volumizing&#x27;, but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be concerned about getting mascara not wrapped individually............in its own wrapper.</li>
            <li> I usually love Bareminerals mascara, but the volumizing isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara.</li>
            <li> so I would have it handy at the office, home,</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara gives great volume, doesn&#x27;t flake and washes off easily</li>
            <li> than that I am happy with the product and how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, as if it came from a sub-standard batch.</li>
            <li> I have heard alot of good things about the product of bare Minerals and so glad I ordered, best ever!</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara out there.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> A near perfect mascara</li>
            <li> I always say the true test of a product is if you would purchase it again, well, I will!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best mascara bareMinerals makes in my opinion, but it does the job, and it wipes off pretty clean.</li>
            <li> It was great the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> The mascara didn&#x27;t have the rubber seal around the top of it</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> is much better and lasts way longer.</li>
            <li> It lengthened my eyelashes, defined them, made my eyes just lovely and defined.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love???  </li>
            <li> I love mascaras and have tried drug store mascaras and department stores mascaras.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem any better than the brands you can pick up in a discount store.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Glad I could find it online.</li>
            <li> I love Bareminerals products for the most part</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love this mascara  </li>
            <li> love that..</li>
            <li> tried this 3-4 times, and it never got better.</li>
            <li> I like it as a mascara, but I wish it did more</li>
            <li> so I could feel even better about spending more on a  paraben-free mascara.</li>
            <li> and I love this brand.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for giving me the fullness I want.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I love bareminerals eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love how it separates my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I like plastic brushes much better.</li>
            <li> Checked with the website EWG to see what is considered safe mascara</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara to use.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara as it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will stick to paying more for something of quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I do love it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as well as most others.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Anyway,  my eye doctor told me my eyes were completely healthy</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but Calvin Klein mascara costs a lot more and has harmful ingredients in it</li>
            <li> But as a daily mascara this stuff it awesome.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Mascara.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li> and I could see how some reviewers might love it,</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see anything remarkable about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other products and this is the greatest.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect one, and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> but when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and so many cosmetics were noted with estrogen-mimicking ingredients, toxins, etc, I decided to clean up my make-up.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t define lashes well and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself, once helped, is easy to get off.</li>
            <li> it goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
            <li> And is easy to wash off with my nightly cleanser.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with make up remover</li>
            <li> Bare minerals makes great makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find my favorite mascara available on Amazon, so I ordered it with 2-day shipping from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> It is, hands down, the BEST I&#x27;ve used ever</li>
            <li> For these great prices I don&#x27;t need the packaging, only the tube is just fine.  </li>
            <li> so when I pull it out, there is a huge glump of mascara that you can&#x27;t put on your eyes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m cheap and frugal and will use it up but will buy from another vendor..  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but instead clumped together and did not have a smooth application, like it was supposed to have.</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes</li>
            <li> I use the regular Bare Escentuals Flawless mascara and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is the best makeup by far.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to wash off with mild soap and water.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for a long time and I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I still like the color and the lack of strange ingredients, plus the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to give it one more try since I have loyalty with this brand.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dime!</li>
            <li> The full brush is great &amp; I recommend this mascara to those who want to make long lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically cheap, but I splurge on this, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Because of that, my whole face is opened up more.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I&#x27;m very picky about mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried this mascara in a smaller version and loved it.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara; the consistency and the brush are top notch.  </li>
            <li> Go to me quick (without having to pay for shipping:-))&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off quickly.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of the Bare Minerals line, I wanted to love this mascara...</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I don&#x27;t get itchy eyes from!  </li>
            <li> Not only has it Never irritated my eyes, I believe it leaves my lashes in better condition!  </li>
            <li> I liked their non-volumizing mascara as well, but it just didn&#x27;t give my lashes enough &#x27;oomph&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> This one however is clumpy and I rarely wear it.</li>
            <li> You can add layers, I&#x27;ve only needed two, but to each their own.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush and really do feel like it gives me tons of volume on my puny Asian lashes :)</li>
            <li> i like it because this is useful for my lashes</li>
            <li> I do not use any other mascara that can give me the same great results like Bareminerals!</li>
            <li> First of it plumps you lashes to max and makes them super fat without making them look spidery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good mascara that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> but right now i am dome with my thing that i need to buy another one.</li>
            <li> so it looks better and it has more staying power, less smudging.  </li>
            <li> My bare lashes look better when I use Bareminerals</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer than it does, but it stays all day, does not flake, very water resistant and its the perfect color.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might have been the product, mascara always smells funny to me.</li>
            <li> I have watched the Bareminerals infomercials with interest but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried one of their products.</li>
            <li> complaints that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as full as even some of the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried (although, granted, the Bare Minerals formula is probably much more natural, which is why I wanted it in the first place).</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara, it went on a bit too heavy</li>
            <li> Another good thing is that even when you apply a lot of this product you never get raccoon eyes which I&#x27;ve noticed other high end mascaras</li>
            <li> I finally found a mascara that is great on dry eyes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals and is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> First the wand is nearly perfect, small and cylindrical so it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product, and the tip actually is able to get into close quarters, like the inner and outer corners of your eyes and your bottom lashes without the mess .  </li>
            <li> I also like to add that this product is more like a cake, pasty, charcoal gray, dry content.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, builds lush natural looking lashes, stays on all day without smudging, and washes off with Dove soap and water.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and product many times, so I&#x27;m familiar with its usual consistency and odor.</li>
            <li> The brush is not the kind I was hoping for and the picture is a little misleading .&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> This (and the $15 I spend on it) is going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This mascara is very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Just keeping it real.</li>
            <li> just gently pull it up, there will be plenty of product for the job.  </li>
            <li> i really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for it on here</li>
            <li> It really does make my lashes fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> It really thickens my lashes without being clumpy at all.</li>
            <li> But I really like how it makes my eyes look.</li>
            <li> this highly!</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t go for the cheapy stuff, but going to a regular store for mascara is fine IF it has a decent BRUSH.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve had to stay in a completely black room with an eye patch since the first time my eye was scratched.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on every kind from drug store to high end department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> At that price, it&#x27;s unfortunately not even worth a trip to the post office to ship back.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare minerals in other products and I love them!</li>
            <li> Love and use only bare mineral products</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but when I opened it for the first time, it was dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It gives you the appearance of thick full lashes both top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals, but I highly doubt this is the actual product</li>
            <li> I grabbed a &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; mascara from another company to leave at work, &amp; the very first time I used it my eyes were red &amp; it was flaking...</li>
            <li> Keep the natural and healthy glowing look using only Bare Escentual products.</li>
            <li> Make sure the cap is on tight, you&#x27;ll have no problems</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes due a surgery I had many years ago &amp;</li>
            <li> It last all day and makes me lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li> Volumizing should not mean cake on the goop.</li>
            <li> I have sparse lashes &amp; sensitive eyes (&amp; sometimes wear contacts), and have found this product very helpful.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s put it this way, this is pretty much the only mascara I buy.</li>
            <li> However, there just isn&#x27;t enough of the product in the tube to make it worth it.  </li>
            <li> First time to purchase Bare Escentuals mascara</li>
            <li> Ok so the reason I bought this is because I was having eye trouble.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this mascara in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new mascara forever</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old, of just normal performance.</li>
            <li> No more Covergirl arsenic filled mascara for me!</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week and ended up throwing it away because it made my lashes look like one huge clump of black goo.</li>
            <li> Mascara is the last and final thing I put on in regards to makeup and this mascara goes on quick without a lot of effort and time.</li>
            <li> The application is smooth, just a little clumping.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with one of the other reviews that this mascara dries out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I place the wand at the bast and just give it a little wiggle then pull straight to tip a few times, this keeps clumps away and coats nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a &#x27;natural&#x27; one, but my mom accidentally ordered this one and then raved about it.  </li>
            <li> or I just got old product.</li>
            <li> Looks soft and naturally.</li>
            <li> and so it makes them look like I do not have a lot of mascara on by having the natural look.  </li>
            <li> That is a mind numbing pain that I would compare with the pain of natural childbirth.</li>
            <li> and they sent me something that was already a bit old.  </li>
            <li> It also does not affect my sensitive allergy eyes.</li>
            <li> I keep it on hand in case I am looking for a really dramatic look, but for everyday use the regular Flawless mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that the particular tube I got was old or bunk.</li>
            <li> Most mascara is black and wet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try some organic mascara but settled on this since it was my only local option to anything remotely natural.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, especially at this low price.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, not too thick.</li>
            <li> Since this purchase I have bought additional tubes at the local store and had no problems with it drying out or seeming dry at first.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of bareminerals mascara and as the last one got older</li>
            <li> This one goes on a bit sticky - hard to get the lashes smooth looking.</li>
            <li> I have used other Bareminerals products, and always had a positive experience.</li>
            <li> It barely would cover my lashes, came out of the tube in blobs, didn&#x27;t color them.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals products and decided to try their mascara.</li>
            <li> I fixed the problem by adding several drops of saline and mixing it in.</li>
            <li> I alwasys do well with bare minerals.</li>
            <li> it goes on thick and when I use a brush to smooth out to ends to make my lases longer  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals products my entire adult life (ten years)</li>
            <li> Contrary to some of the other reviews stating how dry the product was this one came fresh.  </li>
            <li> The mascara didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tubes I normally buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it a few times and then it started to smell funny.</li>
            <li> I will try a different Bare Minerals mascara next time - I don&#x27;t remember the one I had before.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other mascara tends to do, Bare Minerals Volumizing mascara does not usually clump but it does what it promises to do: create volume.</li>
            <li> This product was clearly used and not NEW as represented in the ad!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, while the tube did appear to be new and in original packaging, the mascara itself seemed to have expired.</li>
            <li> i have in the past benn satisfied with this product, but the one i got from this retailer was all goopy and thick and went on in clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my eye lashes broke &amp; flaked off as well, but they certainly felt brittle.  </li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t tried it in high heat or humidity (or crying ha ha)</li>
            <li> and this seems to last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake, it makes my lashes pop &amp; look extra long.  </li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick</li>
            <li> I barely applied it and was left with a gross mess.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and would like a refund or a new tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the name, but clumps easily and removal is difficult and takes a while.</li>
            <li> I actually threw away my other mascara after I applied this last week</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is nice which makes me think I may have gotten a bad tube.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I have been using Bare Minerals makeup for years and generally love the entire line of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes extremely long - as long as ever with any mascara-</li>
            <li> This makes my lashes stand out and makes them look really long.</li>
            <li> It was old and dried out.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> I have been using it and bare minerals eye liner since October and a few weeks ago got big chunks of sheetrock in my eye while helping my mother-in-law remodel her home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the regular black.  </li>
            <li> About the other comment here, the only thing I can say is that when I pull the wand out of the tube, I wipe the excess off on a tissue.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see me buying any other mascara in future.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than drugstore type mascara</li>
            <li> I finally started wondering if my eye makeup could be deteriorating my corneas, you know since it had arsenic in it among other things.</li>
            <li> It was dry and lashes were found in the mascara tube.  </li>
            <li> However the tube of mascara I received seemed a bit dry from day one.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this mascara five stars is because it does not last as long as other mascaras that I have used, it tends to get thicker and dry out after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Only issue it seemed a little dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes as dark as any other mascara, but otherwise works the same.</li>
            <li> I only use Bareminerals makeup, so I may be a little biased.</li>
            <li> There are other, cheaper mascaras that last longer and don&#x27;t turn into gunk in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I expect a tube of mascara to have enough product to last at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I spent $18 on this mascara--more than I EVER</li>
            <li> All dried out would cost to ship back thus me loosing money just threw out product</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected, which is why it gets 2 stars.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say this brand is one of the few brands that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and may have actually helped even out my complection.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was alleged to be the solution for those of us who get raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> and this mascara makes my eyelashes look naturally long and dark.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than some of the other brands I have used (Eco Bella)</li>
            <li> no box or packing other than a plastic bag</li>
            <li> My daughter scratched by eye almost two years ago and since that time I have had cornea abrasions six other times.</li>
            <li> This was a little dry compared to the tube I had bought from the store.</li>
            <li> so I only need one or two coats to get thick, well defined lashes, unlike other mascaras where I would need at least four coats to get the same definition.</li>
            <li> its really dark</li>
            <li> was to big and thick.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was asked if I had false lashes frequently.  </li>
            <li> Hint: NEVER &#x27;pump&#x27; the applicator up and down before removing and applying mascara,</li>
            <li> I also feel like this tube dried up faster than some of my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it on my lashes, and its just black as advertised.</li>
            <li> This mascara would chip off during the day onto my face and cause black streaking on my checks.</li>
            <li> For this to cost so much it sure don&#x27;t last nor does it do much, boring mascara.</li>
            <li> It clumps together and leaves little balls of mascara on your lashes.</li>
            <li> Can be a little clumpy at times</li>
            <li> It does seem to have little product in the cannister though</li>
            <li> very hard to put on because the brush is very thick and the mascara gets very clumpy on the brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve forsaken this for my former BE mascara which has a thin brush and captures all my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Product seemed to be dried up, will never order again.</li>
            <li> This mascara seems like it was dried up by the fifth time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit clumpy and it flaked and dried off by days end,  </li>
            <li> Product was sparse, as if the container had already been used; and dried out.</li>
            <li> dried after 1 month of having it...</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and this was one of the few.</li>
            <li> While it did make my lashes look really thick, the mascara also got really gloopy on the brush and sometimes was difficult to apply without getting \\&quot;spider lashes.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would dry out since it couldn&#x27;t close properly.  </li>
            <li> This mascara comes out a little clumpy!</li>
            <li> It can be a little thick so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> The tube lasts for months,and I use it usually twice or three times a day..</li>
            <li> not sure.  </li>
            <li> It even comes out of the tube on the wand very uneven and looks like it&#x27;s old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it to be clumpy and the formula was very harsh on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> My issue is that it is extremely thick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on thick though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find cosmetics that safe--free of parabens, aluminum, and other dangerous and toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> So thick it is actually difficult to get off the wand and onto my lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear contact so flaking is a big issue for me, I hate when mascaras flake and did in my eyes and with this one, I almost never have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> It made me look like I had false lashes on.  </li>
            <li> must try for anyone who loves volume and dramatic eyes</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed because this was very dry and hard to get off of the brush.</li>
            <li> It was quite thick and it was very difficult to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> i contacted the retailer by email asking if perhaps there was something wrong - seconds?</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this mascara.</li>
            <li> This product was thick as mud (so thick that I couldn&#x27;t even apply it when I tried) and smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry you tried this mascara!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated this mascara.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> It clumps horribly and by the end of the day I have smudged mascara under both eyes.  </li>
            <li> Using this product makes you wonder why any of the cosmetic companies still feel a need to conduct cruel and senseless experiments on animals.</li>
            <li> I buy this at the store all the time and never have a problem, I got this at a discounted rate and it was TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Miserable!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  Makes lashes fuller and doesn&#x27;t clump.  Easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The mascara didn&#x27;t have the rubber seal around the top of it so when I pull it out, there is a huge glump of mascara that you can&#x27;t put on your eyes. I wasted my money and would like a refund or a new tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. This is the only brand I buy.</li>
            <li> This was a little dry compared to the tube I had bought from the store.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with one of the other reviews that this mascara dries out rather quickly.  And I don&#x27;t pump the tube.    I use the regular Bare Escentuals Flawless mascara and LOVE it.  So I thought I&#x27;d give the volumizing version a try.  While it did make my lashes look really thick, the mascara also got really gloopy on the brush and sometimes was difficult to apply without getting \\&quot;spider lashes.\\&quot;    I keep it on hand in case I am looking for a really dramatic look, but for everyday use the regular Flawless mascara is much better and lasts way longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I don&#x27;t get itchy eyes from!  It feels nice going on and then it feels like nothing is there. It does not clump or stick...LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Bit of a warning...I only use Bareminerals makeup, so I may be a little biased. I like the performance of this mascara. It goes on well and seems to volumize my lashes well. It also lasts all day for me. Let&#x27;s put it this way, this is pretty much the only mascara I buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the comments that this mascara turns to goop...I have used nothing but this for the last 5 years, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. I&#x27;m basically cheap, but I splurge on this, it&#x27;s worth it. The tube lasts for months,and I use it usually twice or three times a day..Make sure the cap is on tight, you&#x27;ll have no problems</li>
            <li> It gave me nothing but clumpy, lumpy, lashes, as soon as applied. I couldn&#x27;t work with the mascara at all. I barely applied it and was left with a gross mess. I don&#x27;t know if it was old, of just normal performance.</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara, it went on a bit too heavy and I had to separate my lashes.  I probably won&#x27;t order this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have sparse lashes &amp; sensitive eyes (&amp; sometimes wear contacts), and have found this product very helpful. Not only has it Never irritated my eyes, I believe it leaves my lashes in better condition!  I grabbed a &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; mascara from another company to leave at work, &amp; the very first time I used it my eyes were red &amp; it was flaking... I&#x27;m not sure if my eye lashes broke &amp; flaked off as well, but they certainly felt brittle.  I&#x27;ll never use anything but Bareminerals again!  I&#x27;d rather go to a meeting with nothing on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find cosmetics that safe--free of parabens, aluminum, and other dangerous and toxic ingredients. I spent $18 on this mascara--more than I EVER thought I&#x27;d spend on mascara. But it met all the toxin earmarks. So I splurged. It was great the first couple of times I used it. It lengthened my eyelashes, defined them, made my eyes just lovely and defined. But in a very short time--less than a month--it turned to gunk. It barely would cover my lashes, came out of the tube in blobs, didn&#x27;t color them. I pretty much wasted my money. I&#x27;d been using L&#x27;Oreal Volumizing mascara for years but when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and so many cosmetics were noted with estrogen-mimicking ingredients, toxins, etc, I decided to clean up my make-up. Don&#x27;t bother with this one. There are other, cheaper mascaras that last longer and don&#x27;t turn into gunk in less than a month. I won&#x27;t buy this again/</li>
            <li> The application is smooth, just a little clumping.  It is thicker than some of the other brands I have used (Eco Bella) so it looks better and it has more staying power, less smudging.  However, I haven&#x27;t tried it in high heat or humidity (or crying ha ha) So I&#x27;ll check back on the wear.  But for now it seems to be a fairly good product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is AMAZING!  This is the ONLY mascara that I wear.  It makes my lashes longer and look fuller.  It&#x27;s lightweight and made from natural ingredients. What&#x27;s not to love???  A MUST for any makeup geek.</li>
            <li> I love mascaras and have tried drug store mascaras and department stores mascaras. This has is the best mascara I have ever tried. I have gone through 20 tubes of this mascara. First of it plumps you lashes to max and makes them super fat without making them look spidery. It also adds volume and it also separates your lashes. Another good thing is that even when you apply a lot of this product you never get raccoon eyes which I&#x27;ve noticed other high end mascaras do after a couple of hours. By far the best mascara out there.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see anything remarkable about this mascara.  The one I got came with a cracked lid, so I had to send it back.  I was afraid it would dry out since it couldn&#x27;t close properly.  I did try it once and it didn&#x27;t seem any better than the brands you can pick up in a discount store.  I was disappointed because I have been using Bare Minerals makeup for years and generally love the entire line of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  Glad I could find it online.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes due a surgery I had many years ago &amp; this mascara is the only one that does not irritate me nor smudge.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice that this was &#x27;volumizing&#x27;, but that&#x27;s my own fault. I like the feel of it on my lashes, and its just black as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of bareminerals mascara and as the last one got older it got a bit clumpy.  This one seemed clumpy from day one.  I still like the color and the lack of strange ingredients, plus the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> All dried out would cost to ship back thus me loosing money just threw out product</li>
            <li> I was excited to find my favorite mascara available on Amazon, so I ordered it with 2-day shipping from Amazon Prime. It arrived as expected, which is why it gets 2 stars. Unfortunately, though, while the tube did appear to be new and in original packaging, the mascara itself seemed to have expired. I have used this brand and product many times, so I&#x27;m familiar with its usual consistency and odor. This product was thick as mud (so thick that I couldn&#x27;t even apply it when I tried) and smelled terrible. So disappointed. This (and the $15 I spend on it) is going straight into the trash. At that price, it&#x27;s unfortunately not even worth a trip to the post office to ship back.</li>
            <li> I will try a different Bare Minerals mascara next time - I don&#x27;t remember the one I had before.  This one goes on a bit sticky - hard to get the lashes smooth looking.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful on your lashes and does not clump.</li>
            <li> i have in the past benn satisfied with this product, but the one i got from this retailer was all goopy and thick and went on in clumps. i contacted the retailer by email asking if perhaps there was something wrong - seconds? they never replied at all - just ignored me, so although i may buy the product again - it won&#x27;t be from this retailer.</li>
            <li> I love Bareminerals products for the most part so I thought I would try the mascara.... I was very disappointed. It says  smudge-proof, clump-proof  but it is neither of those.  It clumps horribly and by the end of the day I have smudged mascara under both eyes.  I tried it for a week and ended up throwing it away because it made my lashes look like one huge clump of black goo.</li>
            <li> This came wrapped in a bubble pack but it wasn&#x27;t wrapped individualy so I didn&#x27;t understand that, since I have never seen mascara wrapped in bubble in the store and this said it was NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be concerned about getting mascara not wrapped individually............in its own wrapper.</li>
            <li> I have been through mascara&#x27;s galore - from the priciest to the cheapest - and this is the best I have found.  I liked their non-volumizing mascara as well, but it just didn&#x27;t give my lashes enough &#x27;oomph&#x27;.  This volumizing one did the trick.  I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a &#x27;natural&#x27; one, but my mom accidentally ordered this one and then raved about it.  I am a total fuss when it comes to mascara - has to stay on all day, can&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, and needs to give my lashes some drama.  This mascara is perfect - goes on smooth, stays put all day, never smudges off below my eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t cry well, but what non-waterproof mascara does?  About the other comment here, the only thing I can say is that when I pull the wand out of the tube, I wipe the excess off on a tissue.  I do this with all my mascaras and it keeps them all from getting &#x27;gloppy&#x27;.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals products and decided to try their mascara. But I was very disappointed because this was very dry and hard to get off of the brush. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be or I just got old product.</li>
            <li> the item came just with the mascara and included brush inside.  no box or packing other than a plastic bag so it may be a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; or even a used item.  it does work o.k.  i&#x27;m cheap and frugal and will use it up but will buy from another vendor..  you only have one set of eyes.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Volumizing and lengthens.</li>
            <li> 1. Go to me quick (without having to pay for shipping:-))&lt;br /&gt;2. Cheaper than going to to the store.&lt;br /&gt;3. Only issue it seemed a little dry.  Not fresh like mascara normally is.....BUT this type is the only one I have found that will not make my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;Would I order again....not sure.  Still deciding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn mascara that makes my eyes pop like this. Because of that, my whole face is opened up more. I have deep set eyes and this mascara looks great. Unlike other mascara tends to do, Bare Minerals Volumizing mascara does not usually clump but it does what it promises to do: create volume. I love it, and I&#x27;m very picky about mascara. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I have bought this 3 times already. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried this mascara in a smaller version and loved it. This one however is clumpy and I rarely wear it.</li>
            <li> I like it, though not 100%, but still very very good! Easy to put on, not too thick.I have used Bare minerals in other products and I love them!</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, looks good and washes away easily!  I really liked this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> love this mascara  it goes on thick and when I use a brush to smooth out to ends to make my lases longer  it doesn&#x27;t clump..love that..</li>
            <li> This mascara is very clumpy. It doesn&#x27;t define lashes well and smudges easily. It even comes out of the tube on the wand very uneven and looks like it&#x27;s old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this 3-4 times, and it never got better. It&#x27;s garbage. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like it as a mascara, but I wish it did more so I could feel even better about spending more on a  paraben-free mascara. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works, it&#x27;s not clumpy, but it doesn&#x27;t do  much more than the basics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals products my entire adult life (ten years) and I love this brand. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of their products. In fact, I&#x27;d say this brand is one of the few brands that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and may have actually helped even out my complection. I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore. However, I&#x27;m not in love with this mascara. I&#x27;d be willing to give it one more try since I have loyalty with this brand. My issue is that it is extremely thick. So thick it is actually difficult to get off the wand and onto my lashes. I fixed the problem by adding several drops of saline and mixing it in. That seem helped it get onto my lashes. It&#x27;s possible that the particular tube I got was old or bunk. But I shouldn&#x27;t have to do anything to make a product work. The mascara itself, once helped, is easy to get off. The mascara itself is nice which makes me think I may have gotten a bad tube. If I try it again and have a different experience I&#x27;ll amend this review. At the moment, based on what I&#x27;ve experienced it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;flawless definition&amp;#34; it&#x27;s &amp;#34;the volume clump&amp;#34;. Just keeping it real.</li>
            <li> This mascara would chip off during the day onto my face and cause black streaking on my checks. Flaky product.</li>
            <li> The brush in this mascara always comes out clumped.  I&#x27;ve forsaken this for my former BE mascara which has a thin brush and captures all my lashes.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara gives great volume, doesn&#x27;t flake and washes off easily must try for anyone who loves volume and dramatic eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about the brush, not the actual mascara when you have skinny lashes and are blonde....this brush gets in the corners without smudging.  Mascara is mascara almost.  Just can&#x27;t go for the cheapy stuff, but going to a regular store for mascara is fine IF it has a decent BRUSH.</li>
            <li> Product seemed to be dried up, will never order again.</li>
            <li> Good price. This isn&#x27;t the best mascara bareMinerals makes in my opinion, but it does the job, and it wipes off pretty clean.</li>
            <li> This mascara seems like it was dried up by the fifth time I used it.  It was a bit clumpy and it flaked and dried off by days end,  I will not purchase this again.  Very disappointed in this product.  I have used other Bareminerals products, and always had a positive experience.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for giving me the fullness I want.</li>
            <li> very hard to put on because the brush is very thick and the mascara gets very clumpy on the brush.</li>
            <li> Great service and product!!!</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else. It adds volume and length. It does not smudge or clump. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I actually threw away my other mascara after I applied this last week, it&#x27;s awesome and I can&#x27;t see me buying any other mascara in future.  First the wand is nearly perfect, small and cylindrical so it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product, and the tip actually is able to get into close quarters, like the inner and outer corners of your eyes and your bottom lashes without the mess .  Hint: NEVER &#x27;pump&#x27; the applicator up and down before removing and applying mascara, just gently pull it up, there will be plenty of product for the job.  I place the wand at the bast and just give it a little wiggle then pull straight to tip a few times, this keeps clumps away and coats nicely.  You can add layers, I&#x27;ve only needed two, but to each their own.  It gives you the appearance of thick full lashes both top and bottom.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any clumping, caking or smudging at all with this  product. It is, hands down, the BEST I&#x27;ve used ever and I highly recommend this to anyone.  I always say the true test of a product is if you would purchase it again, well, I will!!</li>
            <li> I finally found a mascara that is great on dry eyes. It stays put all day, does not irritate, flake. It is easy to wash off with mild soap and water. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The brush is not the kind I was hoping for and the picture is a little misleading .&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I am happy with the product and how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li> Perfect mascara for me. Love and use only bare mineral products</li>
            <li> Only mascara I will use...  I would definitely purchase it again! ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----- --</li>
            <li> Ordered from here to save my sanity during the Christmas shopping rush. I got the make up. She wears it and says that it isn&#x27;t any different than what is sold at retail stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I love bareminerals eyeshadow. I bought this and used it a few times and then it started to smell funny. I thought it might have been the product, mascara always smells funny to me. I used even after I noticed the smell. No problems. Lives up to the name, but clumps easily and removal is difficult and takes a while.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be good but instead clumped together and did not have a smooth application, like it was supposed to have.</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, as if it came from a sub-standard batch. I have bought and used this product before and never have experienced this smell.</li>
            <li> i really like this mascara.  it goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  it also makes my lashes appear longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good mascara that is not tested on animals. This is it!  Makes my lashes extremely long - as long as ever with any mascara- yet it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Using this product makes you wonder why any of the cosmetic companies still feel a need to conduct cruel and senseless experiments on animals.</li>
            <li> I usually love Bareminerals mascara, but the volumizing isn&#x27;t good. My eyelashes don&#x27;t look like they have mascara on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for three years and regret it every time I switch. Doesn&#x27;t run!</li>
            <li> I have heard alot of good things about the product of bare Minerals and so glad I ordered, best ever!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara; the consistency and the brush are top notch.  However, there just isn&#x27;t enough of the product in the tube to make it worth it.  I purchased it twice and had the same experience.  I expect a tube of mascara to have enough product to last at least 3 months.  I was ready to throw it out after a few weeks.  I won&#x27;t by it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  I love how it separates my lashes.  It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals and is easy to remove.  I used to buy Lancome mascara and swore by it until I found Bareminerals.  I will never go back.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some of the other reviews stating how dry the product was this one came fresh.  I love this brush and really do feel like it gives me tons of volume on my puny Asian lashes :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.  It goes on easily, builds lush natural looking lashes, stays on all day without smudging, and washes off with Dove soap and water.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry you tried this mascara! no clumps, not raccoon eyes. great definition. This is the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Truly love this mascara!  I have wasted money on every kind from drug store to high end department store mascaras. It doesn&#x27;t clump. Does what is claims - volumizes. Looks soft and naturally. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. And is easy to wash off with my nightly cleanser. If these traits appeal to you - buy it!</li>
            <li> Product was sparse, as if the container had already been used; and dried out.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for thickening &amp; lengthening !!!</li>
            <li> This arrived CRACKED. I didn&#x27;t pay much for it on here so I just blew it off. I ended up cleaning off the wand and using it as an eyebrow comb.</li>
            <li> I buy this at the store all the time and never have a problem, I got this at a discounted rate and it was TERRIBLE! dried after 1 month of having it... I love Bare Minerals, but I highly doubt this is the actual product</li>
            <li> This product was amazing! its really dark and it makes your eyelashes look longer! the product was shipped and arrived on time! i would suggest this Product to any one, plus it comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> I hated this mascara. I threw it away after using it once. I found it to be clumpy and the formula was very harsh on my lashes.  It was quite thick and it was very difficult to get an even coat. Volumizing should not mean cake on the goop.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself rates a 5 star. I love this mascara, but when I opened it for the first time, it was dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other mascara that can give me the same great results like Bareminerals! This mascara lives up to the Bareminerals name!</li>
            <li> i like it because this is useful for my lashes and i use it a lot since i have my make up but right now i am dome with my thing that i need to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this mascara. It clumps together and leaves little balls of mascara on your lashes. You need to swipe lashes several times to fix it. Also, my eyes feel irritated at the end of the day. I don&#x27;t care for the brush either. I like plastic brushes much better. I won&#x27;t be buying this mascara again.</li>
            <li> I do not like the Brush it is was to big and thick.  I took the name off the mascara that I had and it should be the same but the brush is defiantly not.  Great service though!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belinda Wells</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bareminerals mascara for years and thought I&#x27;d try the volumizing this time.  It is a waste of money.  Clumps and pastes lashes together.  I&#x27;m going back to the regular black.  It has a great brush that covers and separates lashes.</li>
            <li> This product was clearly used and not NEW as represented in the ad!  It was dry and lashes were found in the mascara tube.  This person should not be allowed to sell merchandise on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Checked with the website EWG to see what is considered safe mascara and this was one of the few. This version is the best, I love it - I repurchased 2 more!</li>
            <li> Love!! I ordered makeup for my daughter last year and got a sample bag for me, it had a tube of this. I loved it! I&#x27;ve always used Maybeline mascara but this kicks your lashes up three times that!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara to use. I wear contact so flaking is a big issue for me, I hate when mascaras flake and did in my eyes and with this one, I almost never have to worry about that. It last all day and makes me lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li> It made me look like I had false lashes on.  In fact, I was asked if I had false lashes frequently.  The brush that comes with it is amazing!  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, especially at this low price. The only difference in  buying the mascara here is that you don&#x27;t get the packaging with it.  For these great prices I don&#x27;t need the packaging, only the tube is just fine.  I have tried a lot of mascaras over the years and like Bare Minerals Flawless Definition Volumizing Mascara the best.  It goes on pretty thick so I only need one or two coats to get thick, well defined lashes, unlike other mascaras where I would need at least four coats to get the same definition. It lasts all day without clumping or flaking.  The only reason I did not give this mascara five stars is because it does not last as long as other mascaras that I have used, it tends to get thicker and dry out after a few months.  But I guess you are only supposed to keep mascara for three months before throwing it out.  I received my mascara in a timely fashion.  And I would recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks. It really does make my lashes fuller and longer. I just wish it would wash off with soap, water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I alwasys do well with bare minerals. Doesn&#x27;t clump or smear. Doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts. My bare lashes look better when I use Bareminerals</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for a long time and I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Did not purchase birthday card.&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals has been \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; by my doctor and has worked well for me.  Like all their products.&lt;br /&gt;This is from Susan Horner and I got a gift card.  Just want you to know it&#x27;s not Richard Horner</li>
            <li> I love this mascara as it is my favorite. It is a little more expensive than drugstore type mascara but you get what you pay for. This makes my lashes stand out and makes them look really long. It can be a little thick so use sparingly. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> I try to chose beauty products that don&#x27;t use harmful chemicals and parabens, and this mascara is great. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but it still works great. It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes as dark as any other mascara, but otherwise works the same. Makes my lashes look fuller and has great consistency as well.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara. Doesn&#x27;t go on thick though.  I prefer Tarte Cosmetics lights camera lashes or amazonian clay mascara to this.  It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals makes great makeup.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof which makes it easier on the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It was old and dried out. Must have been sitting around for awhile. I will stick to paying more for something of quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It really thickens my lashes without being clumpy at all. The full brush is great &amp; I recommend this mascara to those who want to make long lashes look fuller. It&#x27;s worth every dime!</li>
            <li> First time to purchase Bare Escentuals mascara and I do love it.  Mascara is the last and final thing I put on in regards to makeup and this mascara goes on quick without a lot of effort and time. I have long lashes and so it makes them look like I do not have a lot of mascara on by having the natural look.  Bare Escentuals is the best makeup by far.  Keep the natural and healthy glowing look using only Bare Escentual products.</li>
            <li> Can be a little clumpy at times</li>
            <li> Comes off quickly. Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken as well as most others.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was alleged to be the solution for those of us who get raccoon eyes. It is NOT the solution. It flakes off all day into tiny specks, that in turn create the dreaded raccoon eye. Boo!</li>
            <li> I have watched the Bareminerals infomercials with interest but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried one of their products. I like how the mascara goes on, and it looks great with two coats. But I did find the mascara tends to run a bit. I had to smear it off my face with a rag, both on my cheeks and around the edges of my eyes. It did not irritate my eyes. But I really like how it makes my eyes look. I have light eyelashes and this mascara makes my eyelashes look naturally long and dark.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this mascara and loved it, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fantastically as I remember, but still a great product, no clumping</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my daughter. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. A near perfect mascara</li>
            <li> For this to cost so much it sure don&#x27;t last nor does it do much, boring mascara. My 3d fiber lash is way better! I also like to add that this product is more like a cake, pasty, charcoal gray, dry content. Most mascara is black and wet. I rather go to the drug store.</li>
            <li> Ok so the reason I bought this is because I was having eye trouble. My daughter scratched by eye almost two years ago and since that time I have had cornea abrasions six other times. That is a mind numbing pain that I would compare with the pain of natural childbirth. Anyway,  my eye doctor told me my eyes were completely healthy so I could not figure out why, all of a sudden, household dust in my eye would cause deep abrasions. Literally, ANYTHING that got in my eye would cause multiple abrasions on my cornea. I scoured the Internet to see if I could find any explanation. Nothing. I finally started wondering if my eye makeup could be deteriorating my corneas, you know since it had arsenic in it among other things. I really wanted to try some organic mascara but settled on this since it was my only local option to anything remotely natural. I have been using it and bare minerals eye liner since October and a few weeks ago got big chunks of sheetrock in my eye while helping my mother-in-law remodel her home. No scratches or irritation. You just don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve had to stay in a completely black room with an eye patch since the first time my eye was scratched. Miserable! Anyway, I haven&#x27;t looked at ask the ingredients but I know my eyes are healthier now and it looks great! No more Covergirl arsenic filled mascara for me!</li>
            <li> I normally buy this mascara in the store and I love this product.  However the tube of mascara I received seemed a bit dry from day one.  The mascara didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tubes I normally buy in the store.  It dried out much faster.  I wonder if perhaps that had it in inventory longer than it should have been and they sent me something that was already a bit old.  Since this purchase I have bought additional tubes at the local store and had no problems with it drying out or seeming dry at first.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Calvin Klein mascara but Calvin Klein mascara costs a lot more and has harmful ingredients in it and this doesn&#x27;t. It does seem to have little product in the cannister though but I would use it again as a cheaper alternative to Calvin Klein&#x27;s One.</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight eyelashes. I&#x27;ve been searching for a new mascara forever, this is my second time buying this!! I finally found the perfect one, and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> This is my must have staple mascara. I have been wearing it for years. It really is flawless definition. I like to layer it with Buxom Amplified Lash if I am going out for the night. But as a daily mascara this stuff it awesome.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this.  Leave it to the youth to know a quality item.  I bought several&lt;br /&gt;more so I would have it handy at the office, home, in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is even, doesn&#x27;t clump up.... and this seems to last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> This mascara comes out a little clumpy! I think I will have to venture out to a. Store for my next mascara purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Bareminerals!!! Their mascara is great!!! It doesn&#x27;t flake, it makes my lashes pop &amp; look extra long.  It comes off easily with make up remover and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Mascara.  I wish it would last a little longer than it does, but it stays all day, does not flake, very water resistant and its the perfect color.  I have used many other products and this is the greatest.  It also does not affect my sensitive allergy eyes.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of the Bare Minerals line, I wanted to love this mascara... but I just kinda sorta like it. It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as full as even some of the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried (although, granted, the Bare Minerals formula is probably much more natural, which is why I wanted it in the first place). By the end of the workday I feel like I am in need of another coat. I also feel like this tube dried up faster than some of my other mascaras. Bottom line, it&#x27;s not awful and I could see how some reviewers might love it, but it&#x27;s just not for me. Until they can ramp this mascara up a notch, I&#x27;m sticking with my chemical-laden drugstore brand.</li>
