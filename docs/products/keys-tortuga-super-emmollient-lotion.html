            <li>Best cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars If I could tolerate the odor of this wonderful lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for soothing spots of eczema.</li>

            <li>Really good for the skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly has good ingrediants, and if felt wonderful in my skin, but I have to say, it smells like a cedar bug repellant.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The lotion, although kind of pricey, feels luxurious when you put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, if you are looking for a really clean (scored 0-1 on EWG Cosmetic Database) lotion that is rich and moisturizing, this is the perfect lotion for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most effective on sunburns as well.</li>
            <li>This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve found for my super-reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion for my body.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE it for my body</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I just love Keys products.</li>
            <li>I love Keys Lotions.</li>
            <li>My search for the perfect facial moisturizer is over!!!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite creams.</li>
            <li>Lovely moisturizer - I use it on my body and neck.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best cream to touch this 70 year old skin!!!</li>
            <li>the keys brand is really great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh sent.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much and it has a light, non-floral, pleasant scent that is almost unnoticable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a strong aroma which wears away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without chemicals, has a nice smell - smells like rosemary to me.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I have found for dry skin and it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>very nice and really helps my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>This particular lotion is so rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many many products for extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite face moisturizer, especially for winter.</li>
            <li>The product is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I use this particular one (Tortuga) during winter/cold months and the Lumios moisturizer during the summer/warm months.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for feet, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized for a whole day.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li>My friend has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also like the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>Actual lotion with real moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes like no other lotion I have used before, leaving your skin feeling completely hydrated and supple but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The difference is that the hydrated feeling lasts long after application whereas many other lotions I have used do not last past 15-20 minutes and require constant re-application.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very thick lotion, yet it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It even has a matte finish when I apply it.  It&#x27;s my new favorite face moisturizer, especially for winter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion for my body. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without chemicals, has a nice smell - smells like rosemary to me. It&#x27;s great for soothing spots of eczema. It doesn&#x27;t work on my face though. Like the other person, it does bring on a zit or two if I use it on my face. But I LOVE it for my body</li>
            <li> Actual lotion with real moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but it fades quickly. The lotion, although kind of pricey, feels luxurious when you put it on. I like the way it makes my very dry hands feel, and I will probably purchase this lotion again. I also like the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> very nice and really helps my dry skin.  Just wish Keys had a program for buying several at once and getting a discount.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have found for dry skin and it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL ingredients!  I would highly recommend it for feet, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s great for calming irritated skin as well as reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many many products for extreme dry skin. This is the best. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized for a whole day.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  It moisturizes like no other lotion I have used before, leaving your skin feeling completely hydrated and supple but not greasy.

I have long suffered from bad eczema and my condition has improved since I started using this lotion (after about 3-4 weeks of daily use).</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!! It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I like to use this at night and the Keys luminos moisturizer during the day under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion.  It does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The product is very greasy.  I have normal skin.  I used it at night and woke up to little zits all over my forehead.  I never get zits and was looking for something natural to use without any harsh chemicals.  I read the reviews and also heard about it from a friend.  My friend has very sensitive skin and she loves it.  It has a nice fresh sent.  My husband said it smelled like pledge.  If you have normal/ combination skin I would go with a lighter face lotion.</li>
            <li> Designed for post op surgical patients, this lotion helps with dryness and promotes healing. I&#x27;ve been using this and it&#x27;s sister product &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34; for years. It&#x27;s got a strong aroma which wears away but I have grown to like. It&#x27;s most effective on sunburns as well.</li>
            <li> the keys brand is really great for sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I just love Keys products. I&#x27;ve never had a bad one from them. They formulate the most perfect blends to feed your skin. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love Keys Lotions. This particular lotion is so rich and moisturizing. It is somewhat \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; so I use this particular one (Tortuga) during winter/cold months and the Lumios moisturizer during the summer/warm months. I just wish they would put this in a larger container and sell it as body lotion, however the price might be insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, if you are looking for a really clean (scored 0-1 on EWG Cosmetic Database) lotion that is rich and moisturizing, this is the perfect lotion for you.</li>
            <li> Best cream I have ever used. No allergic reactions by me or my friend. Don&#x27;t need to use much and it has a light, non-floral, pleasant scent that is almost unnoticable.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve found for my super-reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have ever tried that has not made my skin burn upon application. I can not say enough good things about this product. My search for the perfect facial moisturizer is over!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite creams. Really good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars If I could tolerate the odor of this wonderful lotion.  It certainly has good ingrediants, and if felt wonderful in my skin, but I have to say, it smells like a cedar bug repellant.  The odor stayed on my clothes and my sheets.  Unfortunately I had to throw it and the face moisturizer in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Lovely moisturizer - I use it on my body and neck.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best cream to touch this 70 year old skin!!!</li>
