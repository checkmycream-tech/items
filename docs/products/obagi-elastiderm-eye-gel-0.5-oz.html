            <li>Will try to look for a better product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Okay.  was recomended by derm.  </li>
            <li>i need more moisture under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>switching to something more creamy</li>
            <li>I love Obagi.  </li>
            <li>Better than the eye cream version.</li>
            <li>I use mostly Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, is refreshing and decreases any puffiness and fine lines well.  </li>
            <li>Feels cool and refreshing but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li>My esthetician and the RN in a Medispa recommended this to me to reduce fine wrinkles, crows feet, etc.  </li>
            <li>have light olive skin and was always in the sun - it slowed the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I was able to find it much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>,  i found safe to use on your own , and they wouldn&#x27;t sell without DR HIGH HIGH  strengths OC if a DR needed to apply, so I felt safe in knowing that from experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li>But anyone suggest something better, I&#x27;m willing to try newðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works if you already have wrinkles, but it you use this at the first sign of aging as I did, I think it helps sustain a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eye treatment for several years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Though it does seem to decrease the appearances of fine lines around the eyes, it does dry out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Noticeably much smoother after the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and a lot goes a long way.  </li>

            <li>I have been using it for 2 years now, and I&#x27;m very satified with my results.</li>
            <li>So many other eye creams and gels</li>
            <li>and that is TRULY been like a Magic eraser taking away that deep left line on one eye,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So to me, in my 50s, the extra money is worth it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it for far less than my DRs office.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>face is SOFT AS BABY SKIN , each day lines around mouth from nose on right side shows never left side of mouth  is noticeable lessened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he said 10 yrs younger exactly than i am, im 46!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first saw this product in my dermatologist office, but decided to research it further before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Works for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>results are  important and dont want to waste money, then TRY these and as I have done I have  </li>
            <li>Obagi Eye Treatment Gel has the ability to completely hide wrinkles and circles under the eye after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>at last  STOPPED trying each so called NEW THING from AVON</li>
            <li>ADD lost natural collagen and Hyaluronic acid and peptides back in , and are SERUMS</li>
            <li>EXCEPT my NEW found RED white tube of 15% AHA another acid</li>
            <li>But it was exactly what I had previously purchased from my dermatologist office .</li>
            <li>price is too high for the minimal results.</li>
            <li>This product just didnt work for me sucks to say so but true.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste.  </li>

            <li> Pretty much a waste.  </li>
            <li> and I really think there is a huge difference as compared to any other eye creams I have used, even expensive drugstore ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for long time, I like it.</li>
            <li> INCLUDES SAME REVIEW FOR OTHER OBAJI PRODUCT I BOUGHT HERE &amp;#60</li>
            <li> its peptide cell turnover expediter cream  too,  that doesn&#x27;t give acne  but helps it dry up,  and i will NOT be without ,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only down is I have to wait for this to absorb before applying eye make up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried seem to produce results by actually creating a little edema</li>
            <li> Who hasn&#x27;t spent $$$$ on trying to find a miracle for wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> small peeling if you rub face hard with wash cloth only, otherwise the jar of skin turnover accelerator helps take excess old skin away .&lt;br</li>
            <li> i woke up with a serious rash around my eye near the nose area.</li>
            <li> WILL THROW A OTHER creams away  </li>
            <li> i should have tested it on other parts of my skin instead of my face.</li>
            <li> &amp; I would not use other products.</li>
            <li> I see other women my age getting.  </li>
            <li> all issues faced as entering mid to late 30s ,  40s and  </li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s something in here that&#x27;s supposed to tighten the skin, but what happens is the gel leaves a film under the eye that peals off in a little sheet or beads at some point in the day.</li>
            <li> So each time when I tried to use it some dried gel comes out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and it has helped me evade the eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my gene&#x27;s or this product, but, I like to believe it&#x27;s the elastiderm that is contributing my eternally youthful look at 50.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> Just balls up - like over night - there will be a small glob.  </li>
            <li> and/or are a little irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> and you just apply a very small amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously going to save my $$$$ for Botox.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated the bottle does get a little \\&quot;glob\\&quot; that comes out of the pump and is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great product, great price.  Never causes me to puff and many expensive eye creams do.  Love that I can get it for far less than my DRs office.</li>
            <li> Gentle way to tighten skin around my eyes, which tend to be puffy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that buying this online and not from a physicians office or spa that it might not be the same quality etc . But it was exactly what I had previously purchased from my dermatologist office .</li>

            <li> Love this. Lightweight. Works for sensitive eyes. NO irritation. Feels cool and refreshing but still moisturizes. Eliminates puffiness. Hydrates. Has really improved the Look of the skin around my eyes. Noticeably much smoother after the first bottle. Somehow it covers all the bases in one product. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I love Obagi products... I believe in them</li>
            <li> This eye gel is great for wrinkles around the eyes...very silky and smooth to the touch...and you just apply a very small amount so the product lasts....the price is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my gene&#x27;s or this product, but, I like to believe it&#x27;s the elastiderm that is contributing my eternally youthful look at 50.</li>

            <li> I have used this eye gel for years and love it. Works best in combination with something that reduces puffiness (I use the Garnier roller and it works great).</li>
            <li> Though it does seem to decrease the appearances of fine lines around the eyes, it does dry out rather quickly. So each time when I tried to use it some dried gel comes out. Ineffective use of product. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eye gel! Use all obagi products! Much cheaper online! Great transaction! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Great price and it works!</li>
            <li> This product has become part of my OCD morning merinating routine.  I love the way it feels and a lot goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and can see improvement in my under eye area.  Texture is better and wrinkles fading.</li>
            <li> using for years.  love it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams/gels to help with the eye puffiness and circles around my eyes and decided to try this one. Heard so many good reviews about obagi products but I&#x27;m not satisfied with this one. I thought this will give me better results but still not working for me. Will try to look for a better product. Will not repurchase</li>
            <li> Obagi is the best product!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Make sure you let it dry before putting on eye cream. Under eye wrinkles disappear. I use on my forehead, too.</li>
            <li> I use the obagi eye cream as well and I really think there is a huge difference as compared to any other eye creams I have used, even expensive drugstore ones.  So to me, in my 50s, the extra money is worth it.</li>
            <li> This really works and you will enjoy the benefits.  I&#x27;ve bought this from different sellers each time.  It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li> i started using the product right away when i received it in the mail. i should have tested it on other parts of my skin instead of my face. while i put it on my eye area over night. i woke up with a serious rash around my eye near the nose area. i was trying to return it but the seller declined. This product just didnt work for me sucks to say so but true. i am going out of town next week so i hope this clears up soon. i will not be buying any of obagi products again.</li>
            <li> I love obagi, the best product,  and I always ordered from them, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great eye cream. Smooths and hydrates. I use it day and night. Good under foundation.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye cream. You can see results in 1 week. I have been using obagi products for several years &amp; I would not use other products.</li>
            <li> My esthetician and the RN in a Medispa recommended this to me to reduce fine wrinkles, crows feet, etc.  The RN said it works by helping collagen and elasticity to return to skin. I reviewed on Amazon first and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s $104 at the spa and $60 something on Amazon.  As another reviewer stated the bottle does get a little \\&quot;glob\\&quot; that comes out of the pump and is completely useless.  Just balls up - like over night - there will be a small glob.  Pretty much a waste.  (It adds up $)  This did cause zits to appear under, corner, and on lids of eyes.  Never have I had zits by my eyes. Also, how can anyone wear mascara (Waterproof) without raccoon eyes happening after applying in the a.m.?  Who hasn&#x27;t spent $$$$ on trying to find a miracle for wrinkles?  I&#x27;m seriously going to save my $$$$ for Botox.</li>
            <li> Okay.  was recomended by derm.  i need more moisture under my eyes.  switching to something more creamy</li>
            <li> I first saw this product in my dermatologist office, but decided to research it further before purchasing.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because I was able to find it much cheaper on Amazon.  I have been using it for 2 years now, and I&#x27;m very satified with my results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I tried it with the Obagi Eye Cream.  I love Obagi.  I must be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the eye cream verses the gel.  They both work just as well.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this gel! Better than the eye cream version. Eyes stay tighter longer.</li>
            <li> I use mostly Obagi products.  This is the best eye gel I have EVER used. You can feel&lt;br /&gt;it tighten around your eyes...keeping the wrinkles in check.&lt;br /&gt;I have light olive skin and was always in the sun - it slowed the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> haved used this for years, love it, can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for long time, I like it. But anyone suggest something better, I&#x27;m willing to try newðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Product did not work on my puffy eyes. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Obagi is a great eye treatment line.  I have used the cream and the gel.  Both are great!  Both go on the eyes very smoothly and work well with the make-up that goes on top.</li>
            <li> Very good for hydrating but you have to wait several minutes to apply any eye makeup</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great for me...........</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and it has helped me evade the eye wrinkles I see other women my age getting.  I don&#x27;t know how it works if you already have wrinkles, but it you use this at the first sign of aging as I did, I think it helps sustain a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye treatment for several years and LOVE it. It&#x27;s part of my nightly face/eye regimen. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> l loved the serum, the elasticity of the skin gets better  and better. I recommended very highly!</li>
            <li> Obagi Eye Treatment Gel has the ability to completely hide wrinkles and circles under the eye after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel &amp; use in am &amp; pm</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s something in here that&#x27;s supposed to tighten the skin, but what happens is the gel leaves a film under the eye that peals off in a little sheet or beads at some point in the day. It does moisturize, and Obagi uses ingredients that are good quality and pleasing on the skin, however, I won&#x27;t buy this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is too high for the minimal results.</li>
            <li> Gel is lighter than the cream by Obagi.  Only down is I have to wait for this to absorb before applying eye make up.  Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years...it&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, is refreshing and decreases any puffiness and fine lines well.  So many other eye creams and gels I&#x27;ve tried seem to produce results by actually creating a little edema and/or are a little irritating to the skin.  I use it morning and night time, too, whether or no I apply makeup.</li>
