            <li>Thanks for great service.</li>
            <li>I would consider ordering more as needed</li>
            <li>The package arrived faster than expected and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The original was much better.</li>
            <li>Took no time to receive through the mail and were easy to put on my Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>the blades were sharp, the package arrived on time, and they fit my 5 star trimmer perfectly.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t require any initial adjustment and I was really happy with the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>IT really has a nice edge .</li>
            <li>The product works and fits precisely on my wahl detailer...</li>
            <li>but, it didn&#x27;t allow a fit for the trimmer guards, so I bought these (again)</li>
            <li>Not the clean edges I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to fijd it here for such a good price.</li>
            <li>5 stars because they are sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li>So these blades are absolutely wonderful they are razor sharp but they can be used on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These blades are the best and sometimes hard to find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It works, not as sharp as I would have loved it to be, you have to use the blade setting tool to get it work at all though, still needs to come a lot sharper than this.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Ever since I first bought my clippers</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use a regular razor due to a potential ingrown hair issue, so this is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li>They fit just fine but don&#x27;t seem very sharp.</li>
            <li>, I had the Wide T blade, which worked very good as well (and was INCREDIBLY sharp!!)</li>
            <li>If you feel like your not get a really close shave with your stock blades</li>
            <li>Now I am all lined up and ready for the world.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp, and easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Cuts like new again.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why I put off buying new blades...</li>
            <li>It saved me from having to buy a new clipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a brand new set of edgers every time.</li>
            <li>I change the blades, when I start noticing more ingrown hairs than usual.</li>
            <li>Blades are very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Just be careful picking the right set of screws ( you get 2 sets) or you can strip the screw holes</li>
            <li>not sharp at all .dont</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These were a perfect fit for my Wahl Razor Trimmer.  They didn&#x27;t require any initial adjustment and I was really happy with the quality of the shave.  I have noticed they require adjustment after a using for a few shaves.  I like a close shave, but they have been know to bite if you try and adjust them to closely.  This can cause my face to peel from the roughly shaved areas.  I can&#x27;t use a regular razor due to a potential ingrown hair issue, so this is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li> IT really has a nice edge . The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my hubby. He he is a barber by profession and he swears by this product.</li>
            <li> It works, not as sharp as I would have loved it to be, you have to use the blade setting tool to get it work at all though, still needs to come a lot sharper than this.</li>
            <li> The product works and fits precisely on my wahl detailer...not much i can say about this..just keep it away from water or it will rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- I ordered another Blade from this retailer. The package arrived faster than expected and works perfectly. Just be careful picking the right set of screws ( you get 2 sets) or you can strip the screw holes</li>
            <li> 5 stars because they are sharp and work great.  Cuts like new again.  Great price too.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well,  although when bought on wholesale not all are good</li>
            <li> Fits like OME, at half the price of Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply...</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Lines up so smooth! Most hurt the skin but this one is by far the best I bought!</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered these blades...it let me know how sharp my existing blades were not! I have no idea why I put off buying new blades...it&#x27;s actually cheaper than going to get the existing ones sharpened. go figure.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull and not nearly as sharp as the older Wahl trimmer blades. I would not recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, and easy to replace.  It saved me from having to buy a new clipper. I will buy these blades again.</li>
            <li> The blades came rusted</li>
            <li> the blades are ok but are not shape. The fit is good the price is good. Need to be sharper</li>
            <li> not sharp at all .dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Not much to be said.. the case the replacement blade comes in is facatory sealed.. installation is as simple as pulling out your (teeny) Philips screwdriver.. And the blades run nice and smooth. For this price, much better than replacing the unit, or going to one of those overpriced mortar stops! I&#x27;ll be putting in another order when I run these blades down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Side note, I had the Wide T blade, which worked very good as well (and was INCREDIBLY sharp!!) but, it didn&#x27;t allow a fit for the trimmer guards, so I bought these (again) so I could control the length of the hair, etc. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this blade replacement everywhere. It&#x27;s hard to find. I was lucky to fijd it here for such a good price. This is a great deal and it works perfect. Lines come out a lot sharper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 5*s edgers for about 5 years. A couple of times a year I change the blades, when I start noticing more ingrown hairs than usual. It&#x27;s like a brand new set of edgers every time. Only con, they are quite sharp so adjust them properly. I usually aim for just a smidge behind the teeth.</li>
            <li> the blades were sharp, the package arrived on time, and they fit my 5 star trimmer perfectly. Thanks for great service.</li>
            <li> If you feel like your not get a really close shave with your stock blades I&#x27;d upgrade to these. Ever since I first bought my clippers I regretted the purchase and felt like I should have gotten the Andis t liner. I was so close to just selling my Wahl  and investing in the Andis line. But I decided to go ahead and see what the 5 star series had to offer before I jumped to conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;These things are sharp very sharp as if I&#x27;m using the barbers edgers myself. I do not regret the purchase what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;Keep them oiled and clean and your good to go</li>
            <li> These blades are the best and sometimes hard to find at a reasonable price. Now I am all lined up and ready for the world.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my trimmer</li>
            <li> So these blades are absolutely wonderful they are razor sharp but they can be used on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely isn&#x27;t the same blade as what came with the edger. It is no where near as sharp. I would not recommend buying this product or this seller.</li>
            <li> Nice product...exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived on time, and as listed. Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected didn&#x27;t have to go in the store for them and there just fine I would consider ordering more as needed</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these blades except now I can edge up my &#x27;stache like I need to now!</li>
            <li> Took no time to receive through the mail and were easy to put on my Wahl clippers. Blades are very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> great for work as barber</li>
            <li> They fit just fine but don&#x27;t seem very sharp.</li>
            <li> Not the clean edges I wanted.  The original was much better.</li>
            <li> These work just like they are suposed to work, a great product that is well worth the money, I love it.</li>
            <li> Very good . Thank you</li>
