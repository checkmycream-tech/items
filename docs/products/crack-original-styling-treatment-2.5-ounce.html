            <li>Stuff smells so good</li>

            <li>I have been buying it through Amazon for about 6 months and tried it solely based on it&#x27;s good reviews.  </li>

            <li>Glad others had great results with this product but it did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>With all the great reviews I wanted to love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a balm that smoothes it out and makes it look great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Its a trial and error sort of thing, but once you find the right balance it is an awesome</li>

            <li>I actually love my hair!</li>
            <li>I LOVE CRACK!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>and I was thinking that this &#x27;Crack&#x27; should have been doing a better job protecting my hair since it is supposed to be a thermal protectant!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>Will order more!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>:) hope this helps!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Though after using this product more often and with a hair protectant, I have realized that my hair will keep for about three days in between washes!</li>
            <li>love this!  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly, I am an irish/hispanic mix :)!</li>
            <li>It works like magic!  </li>
            <li>I cannot stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and will order this way again!  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do anything too too amazing to be honest.</li>
            <li>And did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
            <li>It is amazing for all styles.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this stuff really is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great smooth result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I&#x27;ve been struggling with frizz forever.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the tube because it just smells so nice.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I feel that is the best part of it because thats what makes my hair so straight when I use.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a men&#x27;s cologne or deodorant smell.</li>
            <li>liked the thermal protection for my hair since it was burning up otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but she liked receiving the gift.</li>
            <li>and it seemed nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sleek straight hairstyles.</li>
            <li>honestly the finishing wasn&#x27;t all that spectacular compared to a drugstore item.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thrilled with this one.  </li>
            <li>I had to have a tube of my own to use when I style my own hair</li>
            <li>It smells good and works even better.</li>
            <li>she said she liked to use it on her client&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>and I really liked it on mine</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s aptly named, can&#x27;t imagine buying another product for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes your hair feel \\&quot;styled\\&quot; but you have to shampoo a lot more often.</li>
            <li>love love love it!!</li>
            <li>This, to me, is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found for SOFT curly hair!!  </li>
            <li>The absolute real true best product for unruly frizz...</li>
            <li>Smells delicious, gives great heat protection, no left over greasiness, no stickiness on my hands, love it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product &amp; amazon-love love love it!</li>
            <li>Her hair was a bit dry and this smoothed it out beautifully (and smells so good!).  </li>

            <li>is very important.</li>

            <li>Omg I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how this stuff makes my hair and how it feels.</li>

            <li>It provides excellent protection from my constant straightening.  </li>

            <li>The ratings on this are great.i find it ok</li>
            <li>I love it and it works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>so it ended up feeling even more greasy.</li>
            <li>I also felt like I got more dandruff with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This does the job! :)</li>
            <li>Oh, and it frizzes, did I mention that lovely attribute as well?  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to do that without having a frizzbomb on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Wish it smelled better though.</li>
            <li>Magic for hair softness and smoothing hair ends.  </li>
            <li>i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally found a winning</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I use this leave-in treatment on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and still love it.</li>
            <li>but once I rubbed it on my damp hair, it works magic.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny despite all of the ironing it has gone through.</li>
            <li>It helps against frizz and tames your split ends from sticking out giving it a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my hair is in better condition than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t recommend those with thinning scalpy hair to use this also, it would make your hair flatter and thus, making the skin on your scalp more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more...</li>
            <li>The cheaper drugstore brands work better to de-frizz and give a bit of hold for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a real frizz problems, just some fly aways this product is not designed to help with.</li>
            <li>I love Crack, I have been using it for two years now</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone wanting healthy looking shiny hair</li>
            <li>LOVE ...</li>
            <li>love ... love this product to straighten my curly hair whe blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about Crack is that it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that when I use Crack, my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb as many smells from the environment, like cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li>It is curly underneath and wavy on top.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this it was amazing!</li>
            <li>Make sure you are in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>Redken Align 12 is a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a better substitute.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>so ok</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Much better now.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know for sure if it does provide UV protection.</li>
            <li>I will use it as a conditioner but need something that puts more body in it for wearing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok, but still have the at grease feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is a keeper, ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>If you use more your hair can look greasy (unless you want that look).&lt;br /&gt;It works well with styling with a dryer and/or a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, well-defined, soft waves!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It has a silky texture and pleasant, light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Best styling product I&#x27;ve used, relaxes hair, keeps it neat for a long time.</li>
            <li>what more can I say except price was right too!!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle, I still have hair that gets spit ends easily, but it is a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>I use on dry hair before using heat styler and it seals and protects perfectly.</li>
            <li>, I put it throughout my hair after I towel dry it, and it conditions GREAT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product guys, but you need to consider an unscented version and a good graphic designer.</li>
            <li>I knew this product favored the application of heat, so I lightly ran my large-barrel curling iron over my hair to smooth it.. and it became stick straight and sparkly shiny.</li>
            <li>Wow this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap compared to the better known brands.  </li>
            <li>Good for frizz free curls as well as straight sleek hair!</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it really protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair very soft, shiny, and smelling super good!</li>
            <li>I have fine easy to curl color-treated hair with some split ends and I can honestly say that this leaves my hair feel like silk and provides great flat iron coverage.</li>
            <li>Very nice for helping define my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>other then that its awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redkin, Pureology, and lots of other great brands but this product beats them all in this category!</li>
            <li>Great product works with many different lengths and styles of hair.  </li>
            <li>Comb runs through my hair easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use a curler or straightener that often, so I can&#x27;t say how effective it is in that capacity, but whenever I use it, my hair is softer, more manageable and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>It makes hair straightening so easy.</li>
            <li>(My hair gets discolored easily...</li>
            <li>so it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li>The scent is really strong.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this product but got the free sample with my Sedu flat iron  ( which is great too ).</li>
            <li>The first day my hair was nice smooth and thicker.</li>
            <li>( I have fine hair)</li>
            <li>fine</li>
            <li>hair is really fine</li>
            <li>I dye &amp; highlight to cover grays which has caused frizzies in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair smooth and easy to style and straighten.</li>
            <li>I have kinky, fine shoulder length hair when straightened</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night and absolutely loved it!!</li>

            <li>thanks I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells so good, and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth, it tames my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this stuff is incredibly rich!</li>
            <li>it is a great product, makes my hair smooth and shiny (and smelling great), but I can only use a tiny amount (like 1/2 a pea) or it overwhelms my wimpy fine hair.</li>
            <li>I had to give this five stars because it has allowed me to keep my hair healthy and nice, despite frequent straightener and curling iron use.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist gave me a free one time use sample</li>
            <li>and it was shipped for free.</li>
            <li>So I bought this after I got a free sample in the mail, and I have to say,</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this and it was fabulous, made my hair shiny and did not look like I had any product in my hair and believe me</li>
            <li>I bought a few and have been using it and think it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I received this product as a free sample with my straightener SOLIA..</li>
            <li>Meh...I liked it but didn&#x27;t notice any difference really.</li>
            <li>This product does work wonders on the hair and gives it a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>-- it does everything -- nourishes, keeps your style and protects and a fantastic price</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product made it smooth as butter.</li>
            <li>Even if I were to get this product dirt cheap or as a gift, I still wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and adds so much shine to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and stays that way for two days.</li>
            <li>The girl that cuts my hair gave me a free sample of this</li>
            <li>It smells great too, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought Crack to smooth my frazzled ends</li>
            <li>This product keeps my frizzy curly hair looking nice and straight.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Used before styling, to makes my hair sleek and shiny and frizz free, with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the softness of my hair now.</li>
            <li>I thought it would give body, shine, smooth all the frizzies.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and smooth and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I am totally natural and this is nice to help the frizz, but I think the &amp;#34;Miracle 10&amp;#34; works way better.</li>
            <li>Buying it online here for such a reasonable price was great!</li>
            <li>It smells good, makes my hair soft, and seems to help with split ends.</li>
            <li>But with this product is amazing, my hair was silky smooth, didn&#x27;t tangle that much</li>
            <li>and I cannot agree more with the positive reviews!</li>
            <li>I was scared because it had a very powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>When wet I add a nickle dized amount and voila, I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>and it was amazing on her beautiful, thick hair.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I looked for a more economical solution and luckily, I found this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is simply intoxicating and my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>and i think that this stuff is worth a try!</li>
            <li>After that I buy the CHI SILK INFUSION to use it after the straightener it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair so pretty like CRACK product, so now I&#x27;m buying the 2.5 oz CRACK because I found it much better than CHI.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>A great pomade/balm for your long locks but</li>
            <li>I was given this originally by my stylist.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was just going to use it on days when I was going to be out in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li>Great product for long hair.</li>
            <li>My stylist used it on my hair originally and ever since I always apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li>And, it washes out cleanly without residue.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on dry hair and it works great that way as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and healthy looking, I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it makes my normal hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>She was so right!</li>
            <li>I have hard to straighten hair and this stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>my hair stylist recommended this product and I love it so much I have recommended it to everyone I know with frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried this product or even heard of it, so it&#x27;s not based on anyone recommending it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many products side by side, each strip as I was getting ready for church.  </li>
            <li>Everything from coconut oil masks to argan oil to a full cabinet of leave-in conditioners and humectants.</li>

            <li>Crack really smooths my hair, gets rid of the frizzies and adds a lot of shine; my hair looks gorgeous and is so soft!  </li>

            <li>This is my new favorite hair product.</li>

            <li>Not crazy about the name &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; the name almost prevented me from buying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the Dallas/Fort Worth area where we have lots of humidity.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I bought Crack awhile ago and really liked it but then started using another product that I&#x27;d bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Of course it didnt fix the damage ends, however it did make my hair really soft, the healthy part of my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair style able and soft.</li>
            <li>It has a fruity smell that leaves my hair smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a combination of leave in conditioners, mousse, gel and other anti frizz treatments, but nothing really worked as great as Crack.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders if used right before blow drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either wash your hands a couple of times right after applying product or wash AND wear haircare/heat tolerant gloves.</li>
            <li>and I must say the creators made the right choice.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and it makes my hair much more shiny and less frizzy after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I use just a small dab and work into my hair as it is damp and it styles great.</li>
            <li>I have used many professional products and by far this is the best,  I usually have too use more than one product before flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think is smells great and feels really nice, the only thing I was not thrilled about was the size of this tube...</li>
            <li>I can honestly say with my fine hair it can be too heavy, I use a pea size (literally) for my chin length bob hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super frizzy hair, but this CT weather has made my hair more frizzy than usual on top of getting my hair dyed on a monthly basis.  </li>
            <li>I received Crack as a free sample with a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It does contain ceaytle alcohol in it, which could not be good for black hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this item looking for a good thermal protectant since my main problem is breakage, dry ends</li>
            <li>I did feel like it worked as a great heat protectant and would possibly recommend to anyone who is outside a lot or swims in order to protect hair color/treatment.</li>
            <li>(actually I put that on first, with the gel last) and I&#x27;m happy each time.  </li>
            <li>Works great but be sure to only use a small amount, it will make hair greasy looking</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products to tame my curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my wavy unruly hair nice and tame and smooth - I get compliments on my hair every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Holds the shape, i.e. remains very straight.</li>
            <li>(if you start at the ends, you will end up with greasy looking ends), I very gently add it to my towel-dried hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise this is a great product to add shine, protection from heat products (I use a flat iron and hair dryer daily) and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li>Leaves my fine hair soft and shiny - no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I finally decided that it is great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It truly saves alot of time - no conditioner in the shower and less dry time with hair dryer makes me a very happy person every morning!</li>
            <li>You only need a LITTLE to rub between your palms and put it mostly on the ends, and your good to go.  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount of this works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on my hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly (aka, frizzy) hair and using just a dab of Crack allows me to easily smooth my hair with a flattener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-smell of product under 400 degree hot iron;</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate it in the top ten products out there</li>
            <li>This product looks my hair look and smell pretty</li>
            <li>FIRST OFF</li>
            <li>This stuff does seem to work pretty well</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft ,silky,and frizze free .I</li>
            <li>Feels greasy, at first, but that goes away.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li>routine is pretty simple:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I love knowing I do not need to put 10 different things</li>
            <li>I must warn, the first time I used it I thought it did almost nothing.</li>
            <li>Was still practically perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>My hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It really worked!</li>
            <li>Next time I will try some on the top, just the ends and give another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that seems to smooth the frizz and makes it look so shiney!</li>
            <li>The first time I had this on my hair, my hairdresser put it on me.</li>
            <li>Pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does what it says.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and white so my hair is somewhat smooth but still could use a nice leave-in treatment for protection.</li>
            <li>Same stuff I pay so much more at the store for.  </li>
            <li>else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very fine, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very sunny environment and UV protection for my light hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I use it with my Sedu Diamond flat iron (best flat iron ever btw) and finish off with just a bit of Biosilk Glazing gel on the tips and VERY little rubbed into my palms on the top of my hair to help hold my style through out</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and many hair products are too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and use this product after I wash my hair, then I add more after I flat iron.</li>
            <li>Crack makes my hair soft, straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t any more straight than it would be had I not used it and only used the blow dryer.    </li>
            <li>This product makes me look more like I&#x27;ve been smoking crack -- I have wavy hair, and it appeared really greasy within a short time of using the product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair frizz free like no other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>product so smell awesome and it only takes just a little bit to keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Its ok at first, but when i blow dry my hair it takes on a sorta rubber smell (like those gummy rubber worms your dad uses for fish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much on the quest for hair s</li>
            <li>I really do like this product because it does exactly what it said it would do; however, there is a</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and I barely had to use my straightener.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have relatively straight, agreeable hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about hair products, and I really like this one!</li>
            <li>Definitely becoming a regular hair product for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also incapable of blow-drying my hair straight and rely more so on my SEDU flat</li>
            <li>After blow-drying, my hair was softer, yes, but my hair felt kind of weighed down and borderline greasy.</li>
            <li>Forunetly though, when ever I use the Crack in my hair it makes it super straight and soft!</li>
            <li>In the end, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the real deal or not, as I haven&#x27;t used any other bottles of it, only this one that I purchased thru Amazon, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>it kinda just sits on top of your hair and dry it out.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>product does leave your hair super soft all day, but still makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love it for my dry, frizzed hair.</li>
            <li>My ends look a lot better after I blow dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very frizzy, and the only way I am able to control the frizz is to either put a lot of mouse/hairspray when I want somewhat decent kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>I have made the mistake of using too much thinking I would need more since my hair is long.</li>
            <li>I have very short hair and this product made it very soft and silky which took most of the body away.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and became damaged from recent colorings.</li>
            <li>and I only use about a half inch line on my palm - run it in your hands first than distribute to the back and ends first - then the front /bangs - plus use a good hair dryer ( that makes all the difference !</li>
            <li>Very hydrated and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This product bears its name very well, it is a CRACK,</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use it every day, or even probably monthly.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight in the NYC humidity, but it&#x27;s no match for rain.</li>
            <li>I really got a deal on this through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is flat-iron/silicone spray straight.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>One warning -don&#x27;t use too much - it will make your hair greay.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well for kinky hair (4b,4c)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really give my hair that shine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I would recommend this to anyone who wants protection from heat while styling, needs a leave in conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li>Crack keeps my curly hair straight, even when it&#x27;s raining</li>
            <li>Too much of this stuff will make your hair look very greasy.</li>
            <li>Like the smell it gives my hair but don&#x27;t really get the applying instruction, I just apply it after showering</li>
            <li>...because it is highly addicting!  </li>
            <li>it looks absolutely drab.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend it.</li>
            <li>My mom told me to get this product because it kept her hair straight for weeks.</li>
            <li>Very please with this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li>In Treatment performed very well for my baby</li>
            <li>Add to that it really acts as leave it moisturizer for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have also started mixing it with a John Freda thermal oil and the two work very well together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It used to be that if I let my hair air-dry, it&#x27;d poof up into a whole head of flyaways.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, hair will be greasy/oily/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works very well on my 5-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s hair and makes it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves ur hairs straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I try to buy as much as i can at one time</li>
            <li>Very Addicting.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for daughter and really don&#x27;t know how she likes it</li>
            <li>and it made my blow out much much easier....</li>
            <li>It works really really well</li>
            <li>I use this sparingly on my hair ends only - the heat protection works great on my thin, light hair.</li>
            <li>a  straight look maybe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair gets very frizzy</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use a lot my hair gets frizzy but if I use too much it looks oily.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my hairdryer heat really seemed to be damaging my hair</li>
            <li>so blow drying is much easier, and doesn&#x27;t take so much work.  </li>
            <li>It smoothes hair and makes it much easier to style.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is frizzy like a lions mane when it dries, its very thick/coarse</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
            <li>but this product really control the frizz..  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or you end up with greasy hair.</li>
            <li>Yup, I really like it for blowing out my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This helps keep my hair smooth even when it&#x27;s humid or rainy outside.</li>
            <li>Seems to help control frizz in a humid climate but put on too much</li>
            <li>I enjoy being outside, but forget having a nice die job; the sun will turn it orange in a few days.</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>After that my hair frizzed out but that&#x27;s a real improvement for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the product pictured that I thought I was buying.</li>
            <li>I really like this product - it is not sticky or drying to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it gets real fuzzy and</li>
            <li>Crack Leave-In Treatment for anyone who uses a straightener or blow drying your hair it really does work</li>
            <li>I purchased it and have been using the product for about a month now, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair from highlighting /bleaching it.</li>
            <li>It protects your hair if you straighten it, makes it very shiny too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight sleek hair, but my ends have been damaged from heat products.</li>
            <li>for the price, I think it&#x27;s very underwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have three kids and not a lot of time - this stuff makes styling my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li>It has made blow drying so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for thick hair</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but use very little otherwise your hair looks a bit greasy!</li>
            <li>If u need a hair cream to smooth or tame down a bit then this works pretty good</li>
            <li>I found both online and at salons, if they had even heard about it since it&#x27;s pretty new.  </li>
            <li>It fights frizz and smells great, and doesn&#x27;t weight it down when you blow dry.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to tame damaged hair of any kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooooo many things on my hair to control frizz in general, but especially in humidity and nothing ever really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed Crack for people who has curly, frizzy and wants to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far, I have fine hair and it left it kind of greasy, you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Using a small amount of this before styling with my flat iron works perfectly to give my hair a smooth look without looking limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>Do be advised to not use more than you need because it will make your hair very weighed down and greasy.</li>
            <li>Specially if you apply it prior torturing your hair by blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li>I recently got my hair done (which can result in a little more damage to the hair) and needed something to smooth it out during the heat styling process.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely frizzy hair and whether I wear it straight or curly it perfectly smoothed all the frizz away with only using a little drop.  </li>
            <li>Same amount on dry hair gets rid of frizz, adds shine and is a great thermal protector before using your flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Redken rinse out conditioner on my long hair by putting it primarily on the ends.</li>
            <li>I dry my highlighted and fine hair every day.</li>
            <li>I can wear my natural texture without feeling self-conscious for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most products I use weigh it down</li>
            <li>Most products I try leave my hair feeling greasy, or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida where humidity is very high</li>
            <li>; took on a whole new meaning.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and silky just after blowing it dry.</li>
            <li>The UV protection was the main reason why I bought Crack.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I recently colored my hair and wanted the UV protection to stop it from fading as quickly.</li>
            <li>However, nowhere on the bottle does it say it has UV protection, which was my main reason for purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Just a small drop of this mixed with and a couple of drops of hair oil on wet hair is a perfect mix.</li>
            <li>Beautiful soft curls that last for a least 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who has curly/frizzy hair, or living in a highly humid environment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>My hair comes out super shiny, soft, and very silky the only problem is with my length of hair</li>
            <li>This product can make your hair quite greasy if more than a little blob is applied.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, not thick, just a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I definetly reccomened it if ur looking for soft, straight, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>As far as a heat protector I dont really think thats its purpose.</li>
            <li>I finally have swingy, straight hair that moves freely instead of in one big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps with color treated hair, making it feel soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>If you use more, your hair will feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li>My under layer hair is heavy but healthy (no sun exposure).</li>
            <li>and I imagine it&#x27;d be just as good, if not better in human hair!</li>
            <li>it almost started to feel like my hair was becoming more damaged, which is weird....</li>
            <li>Its thin, fine, wavy and easily damaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a hair product that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair normally.</li>
            <li>That way it&#x27;s still pretty straight when I get up for work the next day</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this product to make my slightly wavy fine hair straight.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product after all the great reviews, but unfortunately it is not ideal for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I barely use a flat iron to have smooth silky hair with this product.</li>
            <li>Unlike other hair products, it leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky not hard and greasy.</li>
            <li>Keeps it protected and smooth and does have the greasiness of other products</li>
            <li>Maybe it was new product packaging...</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of hair products because I like to try new things</li>
            <li>How did I live without this?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new non-gel.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, and the sun does a number on my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after my new found hair dresser had used it on me</li>
            <li>I think I could live without it.</li>
            <li>I went to a new hairstylist</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair super soft after I blow it out and flat iron it.</li>
            <li>The only constant I&#x27;ve found to be a huge help is Wen cleansing conditioner in Fig..</li>
            <li>It also smells really good and a small amount does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Its not enough that I would wear my hair to work like that, but it definitely helps smooth my hair</li>
            <li>This product makes hair super soft but takes away my natural waves so I only use it when I am going to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>, I thought it&#x27;d need more because my hair is super long and super thick, but this stuff is super greasy and really thick, glue like if you put too much.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and Crack doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>My hair is now silky, flippy and very soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I did mix it with another leave in (its a 10) and let me tell you I grabbed a wide tooth comb and could comb right through my hair (this never happens)!</li>
            <li>Using more made my hair feel less clean, so start out with just a little.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products also with no success with the outcome, maybe I will find the right one one day.</li>
            <li>i have fine wavy hair, so all i need is less than the size of a dime for my hair.</li>
            <li>Significantly cheaper than if you were to buy in a salon or other beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>My hair turned out so soft and manageable - I was sold!</li>
            <li>Small amount really is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Magic - no more frizz</li>
            <li>Great product you really only need a little otherwise your hair will end up greasy and heavy less is defiantly more</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my half curly/half straight hair -- helps it stay straight for at least a few days, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>In the directions it says to apply to damp hair, so i after tried to apply it to dry hair and then kind of fluffed my hair with a blow dryer and that seemed to make my hair seem less greasy when I would follow the directions step by step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but does the job......only a tiny bit is needed and my hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li>this big lasts me about 7 months (I have shorter hair now, but mostly medium thickness with length below the middle of my back (natural curly))</li>
            <li>Liked it enough at first, but after continued use realized that my hair took forever to dry when using this, whether blow drying, air drying or a little of each.</li>
            <li>Really control the frizzies and kept my hair straight for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in less than a week which was fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dry, it put moisture back into it.</li>
            <li>I use it in my everyday hair routine and it does seem to make my hair smoother and my blonde color more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I usually have to use a combination of 5 or 6 different products to get my hair to look nice, but just this did the trick.</li>
            <li>, I love crack, I&#x27;m addicted to crack, and positively no ill side effects.  </li>
            <li>I personally love straight hair, but I had to stop straightning it due to the fact that it was only damaging my hair further.</li>
            <li>Makes hair healthy looking and totally manageable, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Well, the first couple of times I used my new straightening iron, I used my old hair product and my results were less than stellar.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made it extremely soft and has stopped the ends breaking off almost completely!  </li>
            <li>I am black (some people might find that tidbit important), and I chemically straighten and dye my hair frequently.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and use about the size of a large pea.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty excited about my bright purple color not fading, but it smells like Axe Body spray, which keeps confusing me because when I get a whiff of it keep thinking there is an insecure 17 year old boy somewhere</li>
            <li>This product is not for a person with fine black hair in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Anyway, it made me a little suspicious, so I opened each of the six tubes I had ordered to make sure it was indeed the same &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>However, a tiny little bit of this stuff works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you only use a little; I have short/medium hair</li>
            <li>so I need a little extra help with my ends now that there is more salt populating my crown.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find in our area so being able to order off</li>
            <li>I have unruly very frizzy hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I had some more split ends (I previously trimmed my hair a few days before) and that my ends were dry and that my bald looking crown was more apparent.</li>
            <li>Usually I use the flat iron to smooth it out even if I&#x27;m just going to bed right after that.</li>
            <li>Again, if you want a straight, smooth shiny look to your hair and you&#x27;ve got thick hair, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will feel greasy - smaller than a pea.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised, and touched up the rest of my hair with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, that&#x27;s completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/fine hair</li>
            <li>Really is the only thing that tames my wavy hair even if I don&#x27;t iron it out.</li>
            <li>Completely non greasy and helps straighten</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested I buy this product since I have naturally curly/wavy hair and straightening it was a chore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, my hands became overly sensitive to heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And wow....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It ends up soft, frizzLESS, and</li>
            <li>WOW.....</li>
            <li>I have recently combined this with the organix 14 day straight.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Suave Sleek leave in cream, Matrix Total Results spray, and Aquage Transforming Paste.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair silky and soft, but don&#x27;t use a lot</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>I rely on heat almost every day and so far this stuff seems to be a life saver.</li>
            <li>But so far no problems for me</li>
            <li>Restores moisture, enhances manageability and makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>You can put it on towel-dried hair and blow your hair out, knowing your hair&#x27;s protected from the heat, or use a smidge when those wild hairs spring out during the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are bouncy, shiny, soft and the ends do not feel damaged.</li>
            <li>and it comes alive.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference in my between this Crack and regular grease.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have the patience to do deep conditioning for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The product make hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It completely blocks the humidity from your hair.</li>
            <li>A couple of times, I have accidentally applied a bit too much and it results in gross looking hair.</li>
            <li>but rather it just keeps my hair soft and smelling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the price as you only need a tiny dab (</li>
            <li>the only thing i would have a complain about is that if i apply this on the top of my head it leaves it kinda oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>My hair was so shiney, soft and no little &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Fragance is a little strong, though not unpleasant and wears off after a little while....</li>
            <li>After reading it, it was exactly the same product just less colorful.</li>
            <li>this was something i bought for my girlfriend, i tried it a few times to rate it, and the first couple times it left my hair super greasy feeling and shiny</li>
            <li>but I think thats more because the creme is super thick and it weighed it down.  </li>
            <li>Only used a tiny amount of Crack on clean, wet hair, but that was too much.</li>
            <li>And my hair looked fantastic - not oily or stiff.  </li>
            <li>After that first used of this cream, I did not use a blow dryer to dry it.</li>
            <li>It is a great base to help keep my hair looking thick, full and damage free.</li>
            <li>she only wishes that it didnt have glitter its hadly noticible but other than that this porduct is very useful</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really help with straigtening with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to distribute evenly because of the thickness, but I&#x27;ve found that if I add some hot water and pour it into a spray bottle is does a great job of protecting, mending and detangling without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it MUCH flatter with the same number of flat iron passes I usually use.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use only a small amount.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been looking for a product that protects my hair from heat damage as I now use a straightener daily on my bangs and pretty much every other day to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...especially to those with short hair!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and always had that bristly top layer that would not smooth</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say it kept my hair straight that long</li>
            <li>hair fits into the category of long, dyed and straight.  </li>
            <li>I have short and straight, but thick, hair, and it helps smooth frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected it to be from what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It smoothes my hair when it is straight or curly, it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair easier to brush, and it makes my hair blow dry a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Dime size does the trick on baby fine hair but put it on when hair is half damp and blow dry it then a small dap rubbed between palms after drying to smooth the edges that didn&#x27;t get hit before.</li>
            <li>This makes the ends of my hair feel so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to get the proper amount, but it&#x27;s been golden since then.</li>
            <li>This may be too strong for people who don&#x27;t have thick hair, but it works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product for a beach vacation, thinking it would help tame my frizz and give my color some UV protection...but the results I had were so great, I am now addicted to using it everyday!</li>
            <li>but my hair is blonde and pretty dry.</li>
            <li>If I wanted straight hair, I had to use a flat iron or big barreled curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Finally, something that keeps my hair straight after using a flat iron!  </li>
            <li>As far as the scent it is lemongrass and not too overwhelming and very subtle once in your hair.</li>
            <li>I also realized that you may need to apply a little more product before flat ironing, my hair just soaked this stuff up or use a different flat iron protector on the ends.</li>
            <li>It probably cuts my blow drying time by a 1/3 and helps control the frizz and general &#x27;poof&#x27;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any other styling product on my hair beforehand other than a light mist of detangling spray.</li>
            <li>Even after I slept on my hair, the next day my hair was just as soft and barely frizzy or anything.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to use too much or it leaves hair greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found thus far that works.  </li>
            <li>The next morning I wake up to soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am addicted and can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit in the morning to dry or damp hair lasts all day, makes your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>amount of this stuff between my hands and smooth my wet hair down after showering, and</li>
            <li>, what&#x27;s another few bucks, right?  </li>
            <li>My hair looks less damaged and for the first time looks fuller and holds a curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some minor success with other products</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair that I bleach and have issues with thinning Ends and can never grow my hair past a certain point.</li>
            <li>It was silky smooth and less frizzy!!!</li>
            <li>I have dark brown thick slightly dry/frizzy top layer of hair (I think too much sun exposure as I live in a sunny area).</li>
            <li>If you put in a little to much your hair feels thick and you can&#x27;t easily run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li>a little dab&#x27;ll do you ;-)</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t know how nor want to use a curling iron / flat iron, this gives me a smooth finished look from just blow drying my long, wavy hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using it and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dry hair and breakage.  </li>
            <li>This product is pretty heavy and almost gummy, so I used it sparingly, and rubbed some water into it in my hand otherwise I would have had greasy clumps.</li>
            <li>At first the cream might feel a bit heavy or sticky</li>
            <li>I do find it necessary to apply more than the recommended small amount, but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or makes it look greasy</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, takes care o the frizz, and dries much quicker.</li>
            <li>straightening lasted an extra day or 2, without repeating product application and major ironing session: cut back time to 30 min.</li>
            <li>While it may protect your hair from the heat of flat-ironing it, it makes my hair super greasy (no matter how little of it I use) and when I used it alone as a leave-in conditioner my hair was left dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I really only need a little at a time even with long hair (a little more than a dime size dollop) - too much and it weighs down my hair.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair straight and less frizzy all day</li>
            <li>I can get twice as much BioSilk Silk Therapy for less than and that works just as well.</li>
            <li>It made my hair to soft and it made it look dry.</li>
            <li>I was worried when I read previous reviews about using too much, so I used a pea size amount.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my hands, smooth over my wet hair, then comb through.  </li>
            <li>I only have to use a small amount and apply right when I get out of the shower to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Took less than ten minutes for completely straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I only use about half an inch from the tube and that will do for my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done much with it other than growing it really long.</li>
            <li>The next day was a little decent!</li>
            <li>I really think they could have came up with something a little classier.</li>
            <li>i think this would be fine if you used very little and watered it down in your hands.  </li>
            <li>one caveat I have is that it&#x27;s possible to overdo it, so add a little at a time, until you learn how much your hair needs.</li>
            <li>Product was very lumpy and left little gel-balls in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My only peeve with it is if I use just a little bit too much my hair becomes oily looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every straightening gel and lotion on the market, both cheap and expensive, to straighten my naturally curly and frizzy hair.  </li>

            <li> This is some good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not what I needed.</li>
            <li> and I loved the scent and thought that it was good for me to use when I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li> It did as good a job as Nectar Thermique protecting my ends and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that this product would do something good to my hair on the days I did not curl it.  </li>

            <li> grandsons, ages 5, 6 &amp; 7, ask for me to wash their hair, and use that \\&quot;good</li>
            <li> not as good as the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It also smells so good</li>
            <li> I thought this product was good.</li>
            <li> and I do use a lot of good hair products.</li>
            <li> Best product to get rid of frizz or smooth kinky curls.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells so good</li>
            <li> and i have a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Ontop of that it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it through Amazon for about 6 months and tried it solely based on it&#x27;s good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, softens and give shine while it conditions.</li>
            <li> I was delighted they now have a shampoo and wash out conditioner along with this leave in</li>
            <li> Crack works wonderful, it makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is good and i like it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great treatment that serve many uses--detangles, protects from the heat of styling equipment, moisturizes and nourishes your hair, kind of a BB cream for your head!</li>
            <li> I sampled this product and was so impressed by the results, I had to get the full size.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - though not the best for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!!!</li>
            <li> exceptional results for the cost..</li>
            <li> lol :-)</li>
            <li> The name is very fitting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all those things and more.</li>
            <li> day!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Glad others had great results with this product but it did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> With all the great reviews I wanted to love it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a balm that smoothes it out and makes it look great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its a trial and error sort of thing, but once you find the right balance it is an awesome</li>
            <li> Very good product, shipping quick, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and pleasant and so is the feel of it on your hands.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I actually love my hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE CRACK!</li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> and I was thinking that this &#x27;Crack&#x27; should have been doing a better job protecting my hair since it is supposed to be a thermal protectant!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love!  </li>
            <li> Will order more!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> :) hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Though after using this product more often and with a hair protectant, I have realized that my hair will keep for about three days in between washes!</li>
            <li> love this!  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/curly, I am an irish/hispanic mix :)!</li>
            <li> It works like magic!  </li>
            <li> I cannot stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and will order this way again!  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do anything too too amazing to be honest.</li>
            <li> And did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
            <li> It is amazing for all styles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great smooth result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I&#x27;ve been struggling with frizz forever.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the tube because it just smells so nice.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I feel that is the best part of it because thats what makes my hair so straight when I use.</li>
            <li> It kind of has a men&#x27;s cologne or deodorant smell.</li>
            <li> liked the thermal protection for my hair since it was burning up otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but she liked receiving the gift.</li>
            <li> and it seemed nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sleek straight hairstyles.</li>
            <li> honestly the finishing wasn&#x27;t all that spectacular compared to a drugstore item.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thrilled with this one.  </li>
            <li> I had to have a tube of my own to use when I style my own hair</li>
            <li> It smells good and works even better.</li>
            <li> she said she liked to use it on her client&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> and I really liked it on mine</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s aptly named, can&#x27;t imagine buying another product for my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes your hair feel \\&quot;styled\\&quot; but you have to shampoo a lot more often.</li>
            <li> love love love it!!</li>
            <li> This, to me, is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found for SOFT curly hair!!  </li>
            <li> The absolute real true best product for unruly frizz...</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, gives great heat protection, no left over greasiness, no stickiness on my hands, love it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product &amp; amazon-love love love it!</li>
            <li> Her hair was a bit dry and this smoothed it out beautifully (and smells so good!).  </li>
            <li> My seller was amazing and this product even better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and economical.  </li>
            <li> Best hair care product i have used by far.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and makes my hair not have nearly as many fly-aways.</li>
            <li> So far so awesome!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as, but it&#x27;s still a pretty darn good product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was looking for a product that would help my hair...</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> It does not make your hair greasy, just soft, healthy and BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, each strand is fine, but I have a lot!</li>
            <li> is very important.</li>
            <li> it is very light and does not leave your hair crunchy like most leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> With thinning hair that can be a huge problem!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how this stuff makes my hair and how it feels.</li>
            <li> Also, its better to follow the instruction and put it in your hair when its damp.</li>
            <li> Crack lives up to its name for sure.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it in with some serum so that it blends better in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the timely delivery and the way it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and tried lots of leave in conditioner and never had such excellent result.  </li>

            <li> Works with or without blow drying :).  </li>
            <li> Although it is marketed as a product for straightening hair, I use it to control my frizzy curls and works like magic.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> You can buy better hair products at the drugstore.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s better than many!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Much better than all mousse crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel, and look.  </li>
            <li> It provides excellent protection from my constant straightening.  </li>
            <li> it smells awesome and its definitely addictive...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tempting to want to use more</li>
            <li> I do use CHI silk protein after styling to add more shine &amp; moisture</li>
            <li> I love how it works in my hair no heaviness.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser thought I had not used any heat on my hair for 4 months because my hair looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the product and the scent</li>
            <li> The ratings on this are great.i find it ok</li>
            <li> I love it and it works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> so it ended up feeling even more greasy.</li>
            <li> I also felt like I got more dandruff with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This does the job! :)</li>
            <li> Oh, and it frizzes, did I mention that lovely attribute as well?  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to do that without having a frizzbomb on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Wish it smelled better though.</li>
            <li> Magic for hair softness and smoothing hair ends.  </li>
            <li> i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally found a winning</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I use this leave-in treatment on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and still love it.</li>
            <li> but once I rubbed it on my damp hair, it works magic.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and shiny despite all of the ironing it has gone through.</li>
            <li> It helps against frizz and tames your split ends from sticking out giving it a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my hair is in better condition than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t recommend those with thinning scalpy hair to use this also, it would make your hair flatter and thus, making the skin on your scalp more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more...</li>
            <li> The cheaper drugstore brands work better to de-frizz and give a bit of hold for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real frizz problems, just some fly aways this product is not designed to help with.</li>
            <li> I love Crack, I have been using it for two years now</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone wanting healthy looking shiny hair</li>
            <li> LOVE ...</li>
            <li> love ... love this product to straighten my curly hair whe blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about Crack is that it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that when I use Crack, my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb as many smells from the environment, like cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li> It is curly underneath and wavy on top.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it was amazing!</li>
            <li> Make sure you are in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Redken Align 12 is a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a better substitute.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> so ok</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Much better now.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know for sure if it does provide UV protection.</li>
            <li> I will use it as a conditioner but need something that puts more body in it for wearing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok, but still have the at grease feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper, ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> If you use more your hair can look greasy (unless you want that look).&lt;br /&gt;It works well with styling with a dryer and/or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well-defined, soft waves!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It has a silky texture and pleasant, light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Best styling product I&#x27;ve used, relaxes hair, keeps it neat for a long time.</li>
            <li> what more can I say except price was right too!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle, I still have hair that gets spit ends easily, but it is a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I use on dry hair before using heat styler and it seals and protects perfectly.</li>
            <li> , I put it throughout my hair after I towel dry it, and it conditions GREAT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product guys, but you need to consider an unscented version and a good graphic designer.</li>
            <li> I knew this product favored the application of heat, so I lightly ran my large-barrel curling iron over my hair to smooth it.. and it became stick straight and sparkly shiny.</li>
            <li> Wow this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap compared to the better known brands.  </li>
            <li> Good for frizz free curls as well as straight sleek hair!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it really protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair very soft, shiny, and smelling super good!</li>
            <li> I have fine easy to curl color-treated hair with some split ends and I can honestly say that this leaves my hair feel like silk and provides great flat iron coverage.</li>
            <li> Very nice for helping define my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> other then that its awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redkin, Pureology, and lots of other great brands but this product beats them all in this category!</li>
            <li> Great product works with many different lengths and styles of hair.  </li>
            <li> Comb runs through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use a curler or straightener that often, so I can&#x27;t say how effective it is in that capacity, but whenever I use it, my hair is softer, more manageable and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> It makes hair straightening so easy.</li>
            <li> (My hair gets discolored easily...</li>
            <li> so it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li> The scent is really strong.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this product but got the free sample with my Sedu flat iron  ( which is great too ).</li>
            <li> The first day my hair was nice smooth and thicker.</li>
            <li> ( I have fine hair)</li>
            <li> fine</li>
            <li> hair is really fine</li>
            <li> I dye &amp; highlight to cover grays which has caused frizzies in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair smooth and easy to style and straighten.</li>
            <li> I have kinky, fine shoulder length hair when straightened</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> This cream works fine at protecting my hair and keeping the frizz in check.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is prone to split ends and frizz.</li>
            <li> Super silky!</li>
            <li> It smells so good, and my hair is as soft as it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> thanks I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells so good, and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth, it tames my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this stuff is incredibly rich!</li>
            <li> it is a great product, makes my hair smooth and shiny (and smelling great), but I can only use a tiny amount (like 1/2 a pea) or it overwhelms my wimpy fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had to give this five stars because it has allowed me to keep my hair healthy and nice, despite frequent straightener and curling iron use.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist gave me a free one time use sample</li>
            <li> and it was shipped for free.</li>
            <li> So I bought this after I got a free sample in the mail, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this and it was fabulous, made my hair shiny and did not look like I had any product in my hair and believe me</li>
            <li> I bought a few and have been using it and think it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I received this product as a free sample with my straightener SOLIA..</li>
            <li> Meh...I liked it but didn&#x27;t notice any difference really.</li>
            <li> This product does work wonders on the hair and gives it a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> -- it does everything -- nourishes, keeps your style and protects and a fantastic price</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This product made it smooth as butter.</li>
            <li> Even if I were to get this product dirt cheap or as a gift, I still wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and adds so much shine to my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and stays that way for two days.</li>
            <li> The girl that cuts my hair gave me a free sample of this</li>
            <li> It smells great too, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought Crack to smooth my frazzled ends</li>
            <li> This product keeps my frizzy curly hair looking nice and straight.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Used before styling, to makes my hair sleek and shiny and frizz free, with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the softness of my hair now.</li>
            <li> I thought it would give body, shine, smooth all the frizzies.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and smooth and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I am totally natural and this is nice to help the frizz, but I think the &amp;#34;Miracle 10&amp;#34; works way better.</li>
            <li> Buying it online here for such a reasonable price was great!</li>
            <li> It smells good, makes my hair soft, and seems to help with split ends.</li>
            <li> But with this product is amazing, my hair was silky smooth, didn&#x27;t tangle that much</li>
            <li> and I cannot agree more with the positive reviews!</li>
            <li> I was scared because it had a very powerful scent.  </li>
            <li> great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> When wet I add a nickle dized amount and voila, I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li> and it was amazing on her beautiful, thick hair.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I looked for a more economical solution and luckily, I found this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is simply intoxicating and my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and i think that this stuff is worth a try!</li>
            <li> After that I buy the CHI SILK INFUSION to use it after the straightener it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair so pretty like CRACK product, so now I&#x27;m buying the 2.5 oz CRACK because I found it much better than CHI.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> A great pomade/balm for your long locks but</li>
            <li> I was given this originally by my stylist.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was just going to use it on days when I was going to be out in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product for long hair.</li>
            <li> My stylist used it on my hair originally and ever since I always apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li> And, it washes out cleanly without residue.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on dry hair and it works great that way as well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and healthy looking, I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it makes my normal hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> She was so right!</li>
            <li> I have hard to straighten hair and this stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair soft with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It is true to its name-CRACK.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it since it made my hair straight</li>
            <li> my hair stylist recommended this product and I love it so much I have recommended it to everyone I know with frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried this product or even heard of it, so it&#x27;s not based on anyone recommending it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many products side by side, each strip as I was getting ready for church.  </li>
            <li> Everything from coconut oil masks to argan oil to a full cabinet of leave-in conditioners and humectants.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Buy one get one would be sweet.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and makes it very shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad as a leave-in treatment</li>
            <li> My new routine is Davines Love Smooth shampoo and conditioner paired with Crack.</li>
            <li> Crack really smooths my hair, gets rid of the frizzies and adds a lot of shine; my hair looks gorgeous and is so soft!  </li>
            <li> It also smells really good, and for an added bonus, I still giggle a little at the label whenever I reach for it :)</li>
            <li> and i have spend thousdand on hair care products in my life, and this is one of the best it makes my hair so smooth and soft without weighing it down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and makes hair look great, but wash hands afterwards!!!</li>
            <li> It does make my hair softer and it&#x27;s very cost effective as I don&#x27;t have to use much product.  </li>
            <li> Surely is addicting because I keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s not a lot of product for your money, it will last a while (although as it grows out, I except I will use more and more).  </li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and arrived on time.  </li>

            <li> Crack has helped tremendously in protecting my hair from the sun.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel super greasy.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t endorse this stuff more highly.</li>
            <li> Overall the quality of my hair is great due to my amazing hair stylist, but I was looking for something to help in between visits.</li>
            <li> Static is no longer a problem during the drier days (I live in the desert, drier climate with zero rain)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Performs as listed and far better than many high end salon brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> straight!!  </li>
            <li> it comes out really poufy!!</li>
            <li> I am actually thinking about ordering more now so that I don&#x27;t ever run put!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see if it works as well in the hot humid summer!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, straight and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Besides the little glitter this contains, it smells great</li>
            <li> I use just a little after I wash my hair and it lasts all day and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It smells delightful and comes out of the tube very thick.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and smells great.</li>
            <li> Underneath my bathroom sink is a graveyard of once or twice used products that were supposed to calm my frizz and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and does not leave your hair heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, especially on rainy or humid days when my hair would normally be a huge ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair turns out so smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair, and my hair has been coming out straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair product, especially if you apply heat to your hair.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely done well to help with my frizzy hair during humid days and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I get complemented a lot on how smooth and straight my hair is.</li>
            <li> I only use as much as it instructs and my hair is good to go.</li>
            <li> laugh.</li>
            <li> It gives me the soft, healthy hair that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and naturally healthy after using this product.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the name &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; the name almost prevented me from buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the Dallas/Fort Worth area where we have lots of humidity.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I bought Crack awhile ago and really liked it but then started using another product that I&#x27;d bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Of course it didnt fix the damage ends, however it did make my hair really soft, the healthy part of my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair style able and soft.</li>
            <li> It has a fruity smell that leaves my hair smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a combination of leave in conditioners, mousse, gel and other anti frizz treatments, but nothing really worked as great as Crack.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders if used right before blow drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either wash your hands a couple of times right after applying product or wash AND wear haircare/heat tolerant gloves.</li>
            <li> and I must say the creators made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it makes my hair much more shiny and less frizzy after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I use just a small dab and work into my hair as it is damp and it styles great.</li>
            <li> I have used many professional products and by far this is the best,  I usually have too use more than one product before flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I think is smells great and feels really nice, the only thing I was not thrilled about was the size of this tube...</li>
            <li> I can honestly say with my fine hair it can be too heavy, I use a pea size (literally) for my chin length bob hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super frizzy hair, but this CT weather has made my hair more frizzy than usual on top of getting my hair dyed on a monthly basis.  </li>
            <li> I received Crack as a free sample with a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It does contain ceaytle alcohol in it, which could not be good for black hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this item looking for a good thermal protectant since my main problem is breakage, dry ends</li>
            <li> I did feel like it worked as a great heat protectant and would possibly recommend to anyone who is outside a lot or swims in order to protect hair color/treatment.</li>
            <li> (actually I put that on first, with the gel last) and I&#x27;m happy each time.  </li>
            <li> Works great but be sure to only use a small amount, it will make hair greasy looking</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products to tame my curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my wavy unruly hair nice and tame and smooth - I get compliments on my hair every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Holds the shape, i.e. remains very straight.</li>
            <li> (if you start at the ends, you will end up with greasy looking ends), I very gently add it to my towel-dried hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise this is a great product to add shine, protection from heat products (I use a flat iron and hair dryer daily) and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine hair soft and shiny - no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I finally decided that it is great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It truly saves alot of time - no conditioner in the shower and less dry time with hair dryer makes me a very happy person every morning!</li>
            <li> You only need a LITTLE to rub between your palms and put it mostly on the ends, and your good to go.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount of this works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on my hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (aka, frizzy) hair and using just a dab of Crack allows me to easily smooth my hair with a flattener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-smell of product under 400 degree hot iron;</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate it in the top ten products out there</li>
            <li> This product looks my hair look and smell pretty</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF</li>
            <li> This stuff does seem to work pretty well</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft ,silky,and frizze free .I</li>
            <li> Feels greasy, at first, but that goes away.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li> routine is pretty simple:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I love knowing I do not need to put 10 different things</li>
            <li> I must warn, the first time I used it I thought it did almost nothing.</li>
            <li> Was still practically perfectly straight!</li>
            <li> My hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It really worked!</li>
            <li> Next time I will try some on the top, just the ends and give another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that seems to smooth the frizz and makes it look so shiney!</li>
            <li> The first time I had this on my hair, my hairdresser put it on me.</li>
            <li> Pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does what it says.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and white so my hair is somewhat smooth but still could use a nice leave-in treatment for protection.</li>
            <li> Same stuff I pay so much more at the store for.  </li>
            <li> else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very fine, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very sunny environment and UV protection for my light hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I use it with my Sedu Diamond flat iron (best flat iron ever btw) and finish off with just a bit of Biosilk Glazing gel on the tips and VERY little rubbed into my palms on the top of my hair to help hold my style through out</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and many hair products are too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and use this product after I wash my hair, then I add more after I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Crack makes my hair soft, straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t any more straight than it would be had I not used it and only used the blow dryer.    </li>
            <li> This product makes me look more like I&#x27;ve been smoking crack -- I have wavy hair, and it appeared really greasy within a short time of using the product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair frizz free like no other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> product so smell awesome and it only takes just a little bit to keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Its ok at first, but when i blow dry my hair it takes on a sorta rubber smell (like those gummy rubber worms your dad uses for fish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much on the quest for hair s</li>
            <li> I really do like this product because it does exactly what it said it would do; however, there is a</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and I barely had to use my straightener.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have relatively straight, agreeable hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about hair products, and I really like this one!</li>
            <li> Definitely becoming a regular hair product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also incapable of blow-drying my hair straight and rely more so on my SEDU flat</li>
            <li> After blow-drying, my hair was softer, yes, but my hair felt kind of weighed down and borderline greasy.</li>
            <li> Forunetly though, when ever I use the Crack in my hair it makes it super straight and soft!</li>
            <li> In the end, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the real deal or not, as I haven&#x27;t used any other bottles of it, only this one that I purchased thru Amazon, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> it kinda just sits on top of your hair and dry it out.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> product does leave your hair super soft all day, but still makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love it for my dry, frizzed hair.</li>
            <li> My ends look a lot better after I blow dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frizzy, and the only way I am able to control the frizz is to either put a lot of mouse/hairspray when I want somewhat decent kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> I have made the mistake of using too much thinking I would need more since my hair is long.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and this product made it very soft and silky which took most of the body away.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and became damaged from recent colorings.</li>
            <li> and I only use about a half inch line on my palm - run it in your hands first than distribute to the back and ends first - then the front /bangs - plus use a good hair dryer ( that makes all the difference !</li>
            <li> Very hydrated and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product bears its name very well, it is a CRACK,</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use it every day, or even probably monthly.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight in the NYC humidity, but it&#x27;s no match for rain.</li>
            <li> I really got a deal on this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is flat-iron/silicone spray straight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> One warning -don&#x27;t use too much - it will make your hair greay.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well for kinky hair (4b,4c)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really give my hair that shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I would recommend this to anyone who wants protection from heat while styling, needs a leave in conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> Crack keeps my curly hair straight, even when it&#x27;s raining</li>
            <li> Too much of this stuff will make your hair look very greasy.</li>
            <li> Like the smell it gives my hair but don&#x27;t really get the applying instruction, I just apply it after showering</li>
            <li> ...because it is highly addicting!  </li>
            <li> it looks absolutely drab.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really recommend it.</li>
            <li> My mom told me to get this product because it kept her hair straight for weeks.</li>
            <li> Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li> In Treatment performed very well for my baby</li>
            <li> Add to that it really acts as leave it moisturizer for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have also started mixing it with a John Freda thermal oil and the two work very well together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It used to be that if I let my hair air-dry, it&#x27;d poof up into a whole head of flyaways.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, hair will be greasy/oily/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works very well on my 5-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s hair and makes it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves ur hairs straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I try to buy as much as i can at one time</li>
            <li> Very Addicting.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for daughter and really don&#x27;t know how she likes it</li>
            <li> and it made my blow out much much easier....</li>
            <li> It works really really well</li>
            <li> I use this sparingly on my hair ends only - the heat protection works great on my thin, light hair.</li>
            <li> a  straight look maybe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair gets very frizzy</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use a lot my hair gets frizzy but if I use too much it looks oily.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my hairdryer heat really seemed to be damaging my hair</li>
            <li> so blow drying is much easier, and doesn&#x27;t take so much work.  </li>
            <li> It smoothes hair and makes it much easier to style.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy like a lions mane when it dries, its very thick/coarse</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
            <li> but this product really control the frizz..  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much or you end up with greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Yup, I really like it for blowing out my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my hair smooth even when it&#x27;s humid or rainy outside.</li>
            <li> Seems to help control frizz in a humid climate but put on too much</li>
            <li> I enjoy being outside, but forget having a nice die job; the sun will turn it orange in a few days.</li>
            <li> straight</li>
            <li> After that my hair frizzed out but that&#x27;s a real improvement for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the product pictured that I thought I was buying.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it is not sticky or drying to my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it gets real fuzzy and</li>
            <li> Crack Leave-In Treatment for anyone who uses a straightener or blow drying your hair it really does work</li>
            <li> I purchased it and have been using the product for about a month now, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from highlighting /bleaching it.</li>
            <li> It protects your hair if you straighten it, makes it very shiny too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight sleek hair, but my ends have been damaged from heat products.</li>
            <li> for the price, I think it&#x27;s very underwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have three kids and not a lot of time - this stuff makes styling my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li> It has made blow drying so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for thick hair</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but use very little otherwise your hair looks a bit greasy!</li>
            <li> If u need a hair cream to smooth or tame down a bit then this works pretty good</li>
            <li> I found both online and at salons, if they had even heard about it since it&#x27;s pretty new.  </li>
            <li> It fights frizz and smells great, and doesn&#x27;t weight it down when you blow dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to tame damaged hair of any kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooooo many things on my hair to control frizz in general, but especially in humidity and nothing ever really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed Crack for people who has curly, frizzy and wants to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, I have fine hair and it left it kind of greasy, you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Using a small amount of this before styling with my flat iron works perfectly to give my hair a smooth look without looking limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Do be advised to not use more than you need because it will make your hair very weighed down and greasy.</li>
            <li> Specially if you apply it prior torturing your hair by blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair done (which can result in a little more damage to the hair) and needed something to smooth it out during the heat styling process.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely frizzy hair and whether I wear it straight or curly it perfectly smoothed all the frizz away with only using a little drop.  </li>
            <li> Same amount on dry hair gets rid of frizz, adds shine and is a great thermal protector before using your flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Redken rinse out conditioner on my long hair by putting it primarily on the ends.</li>
            <li> I dry my highlighted and fine hair every day.</li>
            <li> I can wear my natural texture without feeling self-conscious for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most products I use weigh it down</li>
            <li> Most products I try leave my hair feeling greasy, or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida where humidity is very high</li>
            <li> ; took on a whole new meaning.  </li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and silky just after blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> The UV protection was the main reason why I bought Crack.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I recently colored my hair and wanted the UV protection to stop it from fading as quickly.</li>
            <li> However, nowhere on the bottle does it say it has UV protection, which was my main reason for purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Just a small drop of this mixed with and a couple of drops of hair oil on wet hair is a perfect mix.</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft curls that last for a least 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who has curly/frizzy hair, or living in a highly humid environment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My hair comes out super shiny, soft, and very silky the only problem is with my length of hair</li>
            <li> This product can make your hair quite greasy if more than a little blob is applied.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, not thick, just a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I definetly reccomened it if ur looking for soft, straight, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> As far as a heat protector I dont really think thats its purpose.</li>
            <li> I finally have swingy, straight hair that moves freely instead of in one big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps with color treated hair, making it feel soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> If you use more, your hair will feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li> My under layer hair is heavy but healthy (no sun exposure).</li>
            <li> and I imagine it&#x27;d be just as good, if not better in human hair!</li>
            <li> it almost started to feel like my hair was becoming more damaged, which is weird....</li>
            <li> Its thin, fine, wavy and easily damaged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find a hair product that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair normally.</li>
            <li> That way it&#x27;s still pretty straight when I get up for work the next day</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to make my slightly wavy fine hair straight.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product after all the great reviews, but unfortunately it is not ideal for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I barely use a flat iron to have smooth silky hair with this product.</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair products, it leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky not hard and greasy.</li>
            <li> Keeps it protected and smooth and does have the greasiness of other products</li>
            <li> Maybe it was new product packaging...</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of hair products because I like to try new things</li>
            <li> How did I live without this?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new non-gel.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona, and the sun does a number on my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my new found hair dresser had used it on me</li>
            <li> I think I could live without it.</li>
            <li> I went to a new hairstylist</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair super soft after I blow it out and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> The only constant I&#x27;ve found to be a huge help is Wen cleansing conditioner in Fig..</li>
            <li> It also smells really good and a small amount does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Its not enough that I would wear my hair to work like that, but it definitely helps smooth my hair</li>
            <li> This product makes hair super soft but takes away my natural waves so I only use it when I am going to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> , I thought it&#x27;d need more because my hair is super long and super thick, but this stuff is super greasy and really thick, glue like if you put too much.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and Crack doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair is now silky, flippy and very soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I did mix it with another leave in (its a 10) and let me tell you I grabbed a wide tooth comb and could comb right through my hair (this never happens)!</li>
            <li> Using more made my hair feel less clean, so start out with just a little.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products also with no success with the outcome, maybe I will find the right one one day.</li>
            <li> i have fine wavy hair, so all i need is less than the size of a dime for my hair.</li>
            <li> Significantly cheaper than if you were to buy in a salon or other beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned out so soft and manageable - I was sold!</li>
            <li> Small amount really is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Magic - no more frizz</li>
            <li> Great product you really only need a little otherwise your hair will end up greasy and heavy less is defiantly more</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my half curly/half straight hair -- helps it stay straight for at least a few days, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> In the directions it says to apply to damp hair, so i after tried to apply it to dry hair and then kind of fluffed my hair with a blow dryer and that seemed to make my hair seem less greasy when I would follow the directions step by step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but does the job......only a tiny bit is needed and my hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li> this big lasts me about 7 months (I have shorter hair now, but mostly medium thickness with length below the middle of my back (natural curly))</li>
            <li> Liked it enough at first, but after continued use realized that my hair took forever to dry when using this, whether blow drying, air drying or a little of each.</li>
            <li> Really control the frizzies and kept my hair straight for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in less than a week which was fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and dry, it put moisture back into it.</li>
            <li> I use it in my everyday hair routine and it does seem to make my hair smoother and my blonde color more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a combination of 5 or 6 different products to get my hair to look nice, but just this did the trick.</li>
            <li> , I love crack, I&#x27;m addicted to crack, and positively no ill side effects.  </li>
            <li> I personally love straight hair, but I had to stop straightning it due to the fact that it was only damaging my hair further.</li>
            <li> Makes hair healthy looking and totally manageable, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Well, the first couple of times I used my new straightening iron, I used my old hair product and my results were less than stellar.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has made it extremely soft and has stopped the ends breaking off almost completely!  </li>
            <li> I am black (some people might find that tidbit important), and I chemically straighten and dye my hair frequently.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and use about the size of a large pea.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty excited about my bright purple color not fading, but it smells like Axe Body spray, which keeps confusing me because when I get a whiff of it keep thinking there is an insecure 17 year old boy somewhere</li>
            <li> This product is not for a person with fine black hair in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Anyway, it made me a little suspicious, so I opened each of the six tubes I had ordered to make sure it was indeed the same &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> However, a tiny little bit of this stuff works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you only use a little; I have short/medium hair</li>
            <li> so I need a little extra help with my ends now that there is more salt populating my crown.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in our area so being able to order off</li>
            <li> I have unruly very frizzy hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had some more split ends (I previously trimmed my hair a few days before) and that my ends were dry and that my bald looking crown was more apparent.</li>
            <li> Usually I use the flat iron to smooth it out even if I&#x27;m just going to bed right after that.</li>
            <li> Again, if you want a straight, smooth shiny look to your hair and you&#x27;ve got thick hair, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will feel greasy - smaller than a pea.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised, and touched up the rest of my hair with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, that&#x27;s completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/fine hair</li>
            <li> Really is the only thing that tames my wavy hair even if I don&#x27;t iron it out.</li>
            <li> Completely non greasy and helps straighten</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I buy this product since I have naturally curly/wavy hair and straightening it was a chore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , my hands became overly sensitive to heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And wow....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It ends up soft, frizzLESS, and</li>
            <li> WOW.....</li>
            <li> I have recently combined this with the organix 14 day straight.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Suave Sleek leave in cream, Matrix Total Results spray, and Aquage Transforming Paste.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair silky and soft, but don&#x27;t use a lot</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> I rely on heat almost every day and so far this stuff seems to be a life saver.</li>
            <li> But so far no problems for me</li>
            <li> Restores moisture, enhances manageability and makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> You can put it on towel-dried hair and blow your hair out, knowing your hair&#x27;s protected from the heat, or use a smidge when those wild hairs spring out during the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are bouncy, shiny, soft and the ends do not feel damaged.</li>
            <li> and it comes alive.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference in my between this Crack and regular grease.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have the patience to do deep conditioning for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The product make hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It completely blocks the humidity from your hair.</li>
            <li> A couple of times, I have accidentally applied a bit too much and it results in gross looking hair.</li>
            <li> but rather it just keeps my hair soft and smelling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the price as you only need a tiny dab (</li>
            <li> the only thing i would have a complain about is that if i apply this on the top of my head it leaves it kinda oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair was so shiney, soft and no little &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Fragance is a little strong, though not unpleasant and wears off after a little while....</li>
            <li> After reading it, it was exactly the same product just less colorful.</li>
            <li> this was something i bought for my girlfriend, i tried it a few times to rate it, and the first couple times it left my hair super greasy feeling and shiny</li>
            <li> but I think thats more because the creme is super thick and it weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> Only used a tiny amount of Crack on clean, wet hair, but that was too much.</li>
            <li> And my hair looked fantastic - not oily or stiff.  </li>
            <li> After that first used of this cream, I did not use a blow dryer to dry it.</li>
            <li> It is a great base to help keep my hair looking thick, full and damage free.</li>
            <li> she only wishes that it didnt have glitter its hadly noticible but other than that this porduct is very useful</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really help with straigtening with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to distribute evenly because of the thickness, but I&#x27;ve found that if I add some hot water and pour it into a spray bottle is does a great job of protecting, mending and detangling without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it MUCH flatter with the same number of flat iron passes I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been looking for a product that protects my hair from heat damage as I now use a straightener daily on my bangs and pretty much every other day to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...especially to those with short hair!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and always had that bristly top layer that would not smooth</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say it kept my hair straight that long</li>
            <li> hair fits into the category of long, dyed and straight.  </li>
            <li> I have short and straight, but thick, hair, and it helps smooth frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected it to be from what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It smoothes my hair when it is straight or curly, it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair easier to brush, and it makes my hair blow dry a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Dime size does the trick on baby fine hair but put it on when hair is half damp and blow dry it then a small dap rubbed between palms after drying to smooth the edges that didn&#x27;t get hit before.</li>
            <li> This makes the ends of my hair feel so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to get the proper amount, but it&#x27;s been golden since then.</li>
            <li> This may be too strong for people who don&#x27;t have thick hair, but it works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for a beach vacation, thinking it would help tame my frizz and give my color some UV protection...but the results I had were so great, I am now addicted to using it everyday!</li>
            <li> but my hair is blonde and pretty dry.</li>
            <li> If I wanted straight hair, I had to use a flat iron or big barreled curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Finally, something that keeps my hair straight after using a flat iron!  </li>
            <li> As far as the scent it is lemongrass and not too overwhelming and very subtle once in your hair.</li>
            <li> I also realized that you may need to apply a little more product before flat ironing, my hair just soaked this stuff up or use a different flat iron protector on the ends.</li>
            <li> It probably cuts my blow drying time by a 1/3 and helps control the frizz and general &#x27;poof&#x27;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other styling product on my hair beforehand other than a light mist of detangling spray.</li>
            <li> Even after I slept on my hair, the next day my hair was just as soft and barely frizzy or anything.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to use too much or it leaves hair greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found thus far that works.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I wake up to soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am addicted and can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit in the morning to dry or damp hair lasts all day, makes your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> amount of this stuff between my hands and smooth my wet hair down after showering, and</li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s another few bucks, right?  </li>
            <li> My hair looks less damaged and for the first time looks fuller and holds a curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some minor success with other products</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair that I bleach and have issues with thinning Ends and can never grow my hair past a certain point.</li>
            <li> It was silky smooth and less frizzy!!!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown thick slightly dry/frizzy top layer of hair (I think too much sun exposure as I live in a sunny area).</li>
            <li> If you put in a little to much your hair feels thick and you can&#x27;t easily run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> a little dab&#x27;ll do you ;-)</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t know how nor want to use a curling iron / flat iron, this gives me a smooth finished look from just blow drying my long, wavy hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using it and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dry hair and breakage.  </li>
            <li> This product is pretty heavy and almost gummy, so I used it sparingly, and rubbed some water into it in my hand otherwise I would have had greasy clumps.</li>
            <li> At first the cream might feel a bit heavy or sticky</li>
            <li> I do find it necessary to apply more than the recommended small amount, but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or makes it look greasy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, takes care o the frizz, and dries much quicker.</li>
            <li> straightening lasted an extra day or 2, without repeating product application and major ironing session: cut back time to 30 min.</li>
            <li> While it may protect your hair from the heat of flat-ironing it, it makes my hair super greasy (no matter how little of it I use) and when I used it alone as a leave-in conditioner my hair was left dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I really only need a little at a time even with long hair (a little more than a dime size dollop) - too much and it weighs down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair straight and less frizzy all day</li>
            <li> I can get twice as much BioSilk Silk Therapy for less than and that works just as well.</li>
            <li> It made my hair to soft and it made it look dry.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I read previous reviews about using too much, so I used a pea size amount.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hands, smooth over my wet hair, then comb through.  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount and apply right when I get out of the shower to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Took less than ten minutes for completely straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use about half an inch from the tube and that will do for my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done much with it other than growing it really long.</li>
            <li> The next day was a little decent!</li>
            <li> I really think they could have came up with something a little classier.</li>
            <li> i think this would be fine if you used very little and watered it down in your hands.  </li>
            <li> one caveat I have is that it&#x27;s possible to overdo it, so add a little at a time, until you learn how much your hair needs.</li>
            <li> Product was very lumpy and left little gel-balls in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My only peeve with it is if I use just a little bit too much my hair becomes oily looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every straightening gel and lotion on the market, both cheap and expensive, to straighten my naturally curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I am multiracial and have long curly, super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I rub about a dime size amount into my towel-dried hair and style (blow-dry and sometime minimal flat ironing) and this keeps my hair soft and protected.  </li>
            <li> Pea sized amount in one hand, wet the other hand, rub together, gently touch the tips of my hair and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I put enough in my first try to get a little on all of my medium-length hair and my hair was so greasy that it looked like it was wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and if you put too much it makes your hair feel and look greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only use my flat iron for smoothing touch-ups on my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Tried using it several ways as leave in and before blow drying or flat</li>
            <li> My hair has become damaged by coloring and constant blowdrying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> shampoo, condition, sometimes deep condition with olive oil then apply shampoo, rinse with apple cider vinegar, apply heat serum, put into bantu knots overnight, then flat iron.</li>
            <li> Results are instant, as soon as the flat iron hits your hair.</li>
            <li> and I only need a minute or two with the flat iron again.</li>
            <li> it goes from natural dark brown to blonde on the tip)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this tube will last a long time, especially pay attention to the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> but since you only need a tiny amount, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many things to tame my thick, dry, color-treated, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I put in on my hair as per the instructions and blew dry straight using a round brush.</li>
            <li> This is a process that should be only applied to wet hair NOT dry.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair often and</li>
            <li> this made my hair feel even softer after flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It does protect the hair from heat, and if you use flat irons and blow dryers as I do, this is a must.  </li>
            <li> I judged the product by how long it held my curl as I moved onto the next curl, by the time I finished my hair, and how it held up through out the day.</li>
            <li> it protects your hair from the heat of your flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use both of those products to protect my hair from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> because at the time I wasn&#x27;t even using any curling irons or flat irons or anything else...</li>
            <li> Long story short: With this product my hair was noticeably softer, straighter and smoother after just blowdrying</li>
            <li> Like it won&#x27;t lay flat even after sleepy on my hair.</li>
            <li> Sedu Revolution Diamond Flat iron</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a heat protectant while flat ironing and a protectant when I went to the pool.</li>
            <li> While it does make my hair look healthier, it takes my already flat hair and makes it look even flatter.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care for heavy scents</li>
            <li> This product is not oily and does not weigh my dry-but-fine hair down at all, it smooths frizz and flyaways, gives me lots of shine and leaves my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Other than those weird little things, it still makes your hair feel good</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product --- really straightens your hair and with little or no frizz... use just a little on wet hair, blow dry and</li>
            <li> Just a dime size dollop of this potion left my frizzy, dry locks soft and touchable and definitely less frizzy.</li>
            <li> smell is citrus with a slight smell of professional straightener (like a perm).</li>
            <li> I noticed no tangles, instant smoothness while I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference when I put it on my hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said everyone in the salon was raving about this new product called Crack (odd name!).  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and live in Texas (not a good combination)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that I currently blow dry straight and then use a flat iron on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t like this extra volume and will stop using it until my hair gets longer and weighed down more.</li>
            <li> I flat iron once a week, with minor touch ups all week long.</li>
            <li> (either straighten it or blow dry it with a diffuser) or I just simply apply it and separate my hair into sections, twist them and let them dry, which is what I prefer to do if I have the time.  </li>
            <li> I would ALWAYS blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> the heat here just makes it hard to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I only use a pea size amount, and don&#x27;t get the heavy or greasy feeling at all (as some reviews mention) and my hair is almost as thin and as fine as it comes.</li>
            <li> At first it made my hair feel really greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> I use it about 4 times a week, so the tube lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Futhermore, I am not natural</li>
            <li> also I just put it on towel dried hair and focus on the ends, then try to pull it through the rest of my hair but staying away from scalp since some people said it made hair look greasy if they put it near scalp.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> Definitely use on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a dime sized amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and the humidity makes it frizz beyond control but</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m set all summer long.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have thick straight hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I slide my palms on the inside and outside of my hair starting at my ear length and work it down to the ends which is a couple of inches below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my wet hair and it smooths it enough that I am not so self-conscious in just washing my hair and letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with this stuff that will all change because after only two uses I&#x27;m starting to notice less breakage.</li>
            <li> You just need to apply a small amount into the palm of your hand, and then run your hands through you hair, and dry as you would normally.  </li>
            <li> only used a tiny bit and found it kind of difficult to spread throughout my hair because it&#x27;s a very thick cream.</li>
            <li> I was puzzled a bit by the actual product package, it was different than the picture, which was also the only way I had seen it in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can actually get away with washing every other day even with this product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> And the other thing I noticed as time went on, it felt like the product was beginning to actually build up residue in my hair, even after washing my hair!</li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit so it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Used after styling, it gives your hair a little definition, and for that you use a tiny, tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> Other products have left my hair greasy but not The CRACK serum.  </li>
            <li> My stylist questioned the authenticity of this product due to the very low price.</li>
            <li> very strange.  </li>
            <li> and it increases the time it takes to dry my hair with my Sedu by probably 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Plus, one negative is that it leaves tiny clear pearls on your hair strands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for damp, freshly-washed hair, would be too greasy on dry.</li>
            <li> This product  help me to blow dry and manage just use a dine size before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I always blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I apply to my hair damp and blow dry.</li>
            <li> Then, put the product on my fingers, rub them together, apply, comb through and dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess that depends on your hair and how dry or oily it is.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO use this product for each blow dry.</li>
            <li> It also works well when I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> used to have to straighten my hair all the time or the dry volume</li>
            <li> rub between both hands and apply to towel dry hair.  </li>
            <li> When I use this before I dry and flatten my hair</li>
            <li> I blow dry it just however.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s curly or wavy and dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I wait about 15 minutes, then I blow dry my hair, and use a brush.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every night before I go to bed, which dries out my hair from the shaft to the ends and leaves it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so I washed my hair and let it air dry to a damp phase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any noticeable shine or smoothness but the thermal protection does seem to work and it doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy.</li>
            <li> I rub my hair together, brush and either air or blow dry.</li>
            <li> I put a dime sized amount on my hair when dry</li>
            <li> my hair is dry damaged by the ends</li>
            <li> You need to apply it to damp hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my dry ends.</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair at night and blow dry at night.</li>
            <li> I have dry wiry hair.....</li>
            <li> My hair is thick coarse and unruly and this product has made it soft non-frizzed and manageable.</li>
            <li> They do last a long time and little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I comb it through with a wide tooth comb and either air dry or blow dry.  </li>
            <li> So, I split my hair down the middle</li>
            <li> Starting halfway down my hair</li>
            <li> I flipped my head upside down and used it underneath on my curliest part, then ran my hands over the rest (can&#x27;t say I had any left on there or not).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I can actually manage to blow-dry my hair</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so I wet my fingers, first.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been somewhat coarse in texture and wavy and frizzy, but now that the hair is 50% gray it becomes a mess in humid weather or dry with wind.  </li>
            <li> A little amount of Crack and the frizzies are tamed almost completely, but my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> I use it after shampoo and before blow dry styling!</li>
            <li> I but about the size of a quarter on wet hair and then blow dry</li>
            <li> If you only  have slight frizz</li>
            <li> Anyways, my hair is heavily layered and ranges from the nap of my neck to about my nose--once my hair gets long enough I will cut it to one length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair...</li>
            <li> , ULTA has this in a smaller sample size for way less $$$</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I used some last night after washing my hair and let it air dry a little before putting in a pony and going to bed.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts forever because even with my extra long hair, you only need a little each time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy cream, which surprised me, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> less than 1/2 a dime...goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever you do, do not apply the product again after flat ironing because it weighs down your hair.</li>
            <li> I simply let it air dry and half of that lion&#x27;s man depleted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe so much power exists in a little container.  </li>
            <li> When i rub it together in my hands, it accumulates into a bunch of tiny gooey little balls.</li>
            <li> Only a little pea size amount is needed too, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> as if each time I used it, it left a little bit on my hair that wouldn&#x27;t get washed out....</li>
            <li> You only use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Use only a little bit of this, pea-sized or so.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of heat tamers, oils, it&#x27;s like pouring money down a toilet.</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time finding anything funny about drugs, they are so  tragic and destroy to so many families.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair (past my shoulders) and I literally only have to use a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li> You use such a small amount that the tube lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> again, if I paid attention to the packaging, I might have expected this.</li>
            <li> I am sad that I bought two tubes of this because I have a ton of samples from my hair dresser and if I actually make it through using all of the samples, I know it&#x27;ll be so far in the future that I will never get to use the product that I paid for.</li>
            <li> No my hairs not straight</li>
            <li> It gets rid of frizz with a minimal amount.</li>
            <li> I used a pea sized amount after washing my hair and after what seemed like several days, my hair dried.</li>
            <li> so I used a tic-tac  sized amount on my wet hands and rubbed it together then rand my hands through my hair from root to ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just a pea size in wet hair will give you smoothness and shine.  </li>
            <li> After shampoo and conditioner I apply this stuff to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Also, must be used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit (less than 1/2 a dime size) does the trick, so one tube last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything on my hair, and this time my hair had a lot of breakage and wasn&#x27;t responding to the usual treatments of conditoning packs and Queen Helene Jojoba hot oil [usually a lifesaver!].</li>
            <li> only place a small amount on the dry ends and that should do the trick.</li>
            <li> After flat ironing, I noticed a little smoking at 340 degrees.</li>
            <li> Other products would either fail to smooth down my hair or weigh the waves down</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s half way down my back</li>
            <li> (I have thick blonde hair down to my shoulders with a little natural frizzy wave.)</li>
            <li> and I am half white half puerto rican who lives in the humid south.</li>
            <li> I tried again last night with much less, and it is less greasy looking but hasn&#x27;t done me any favors otherwise.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally flat at the roots with waves at the end, so I usually blow dry to straighten and add volume to my roots.</li>
            <li> Even when I use a very small amount, this product completely weighs down my hair, and I have enough trouble adding volume as it</li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit!</li>
            <li> The thick, non-sticky cream takes down the frizz and my hair remains soft.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little quarter size goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> I have short hair and a very little....</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product for those who have dry, wavy or thick hair.</li>
            <li> During these last gew months I have notice less dead, and healthier looking hair by just using this.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any other products.</li>
            <li> However, after drying and flat ironing my hair all that was left behind was a vague fresh and feminine scent.  </li>
            <li> , I do find that I have to wash my hair a day sooner than I would usually, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal...</li>
            <li> :/ totally gross.</li>
            <li> it did reduce frizz and worked longer than any of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Again you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it made it limp and greasy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must remember, only place/use a small dot of Crack in your hand...about the size of a dime...</li>
            <li> only downside is the small size (2.5 oz).  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed rather expensive</li>
            <li> When I have curls, I don&#x27;t need any other product to hold the curls throught the day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily like with some other products I&#x27;ve tried out.</li>
            <li> But as it is, I&#x27;m going to have to try other products to compare.</li>
            <li> If not, I suggest looking to other thermal protection products.</li>
            <li> I choose this product as reading the other reviews and listening to my friends who have purchased this product - it sounded so great!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It does not give my hair volume as other claim it does</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, frizzy hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> Some improvement, still felt dry and dead.</li>
            <li> I knew to only use a small amount from the reviews I read, so I use about a dime size for my thick and long hair (a few inches above my waist).</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to tame, and this product not only acts as the conditioner, but I need no other product when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine (thin) hair and put about a half dollar sized amount in my palm and rub it around to crate a thin film on my palms.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of bottles of leave in treatment they all left my thin hair flat.  </li>
            <li> This site is about half the cost of other sites.  </li>
            <li> I then put in a few small dabs of Crack mixed with drops of water into my hair..</li>
            <li> Just an average leave in creme.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost for the amount.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a small dab each day so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Due to reading the reviews I used a very small amount, it was not enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li> It really is crack because I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on wet hair</li>
            <li> So I hate to admit it :)</li>
            <li> The only thing is the instructions, I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate the name.  </li>
            <li> I come from a mixed background so my hair is thick, frizzy, curly, and kinky.</li>
            <li> This hair crack is not for black hair, it took the luster out and left a dull look to my hair.</li>
            <li> Although some people dont like this product because they feel it weighed down their hair</li>
            <li> No longer using Moroccan oil because this beats it hands down .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down at all.</li>
            <li> I still need a bit of mousse with it to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to and shouldn&#x27;t as it&#x27;ll weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down after I use it.</li>
            <li> When you rub it between your fingers, it breaks down into the consistency of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product defines curls without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Can put this on damp hair and not need any other product!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sticking with Crack and will get rid of the other products I was using; they don&#x27;t measure up!</li>
            <li> I like that my hair looks healthier, the ends are not as dry as they have been in the past, and it keeps the frizz down even during our Florida summers.  </li>
            <li> I only did 4 stars because I feel like I get similar results from other less expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and am skeptical of any products.  </li>
            <li> I obly apply it half way down to the ends, and when its almost all off my hands</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick, this does the job to keep it flat and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount (maybe half or a third the size of a tic tac) and focus it on the ends of my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went to beauty supply stores and have seriously tried EVERYTHING for my hair because how frizzy it is, especially when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s typically a frizz ball unless I put it up in a bun.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying, I noticed my hair was less voluminous</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Houston Tx and it is seriously humid here (90-100% humid)</li>
            <li> rather than the typical hour I was investing, each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair can be slightly frizzy and CRACK did nothing to improve my frizzies.  </li>
            <li> and I use a bit less than a pea sized amount on each half.  </li>
            <li> it actually makes my hair difficult to style and has to be washed before the next day&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Lesson learned after blowdrying: I used less than a dime-sized amount and should have used even less.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked slightly greasy in spots but not so after flat-ironing.</li>
            <li> it matters, I&#x27;m Black and am trying to grow out my hair from deciding to shave my head one day (still regretting it).</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slightly longer drying time as well</li>
            <li> I use my straightener to curl my hair and am used to slight tug and pull.</li>
            <li> Zero tug, pull and because my hair just runs through the plates of the straightener now, the time to curl my hair is cut in half.</li>
            <li> My hair was smoother and less tangled.</li>
            <li> so when I saw that I could get it on Amazon for a lot less money than I could have bought it at the beauty salon, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Instead of crazy kinky hair, I had pretty, shiny spirals.  </li>
            <li> I work it into the ends of my hair while still wet, then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and the 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> , I have very long thick course hair</li>
            <li> Using a very small amount of Crack at my ends each day for the past couple of months definitely has improved the texture and look of my hair, it is smoother and does not get weighed down or greasy from the product.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit and it lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s been air dried for half an hour.</li>
            <li> I spotted this in a beauty supply store, and was intrigued by the before and after pics in the little countertop display..</li>
            <li> Just a little bit (even when I have slept on my hair) and the hair dryer straightens my hair beautifully.\    </li>
            <li> Just a little dab is sufficient for below the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> put a little bit on my ends and work my way up.</li>
            <li> , a little bit of this also helps before I brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a little bit like a detangler too.</li>
            <li> I saw no significant difference in my hair.....</li>
            <li> Just takes a little planning ahead</li>
            <li> In regards to the reviewers saying it pills up into little balls in your hair...</li>
            <li> Once I think I have a little bit everywhere</li>
            <li> and I use a little bit of this with my leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also gives my hair a *little* shine.</li>
            <li> This little product, whether on dry or wet hair, helps to replenish hair that has been exhausted or drained by the elements.  </li>
            <li> A thick, epoxy like product with an odd Lysol scent, I found that this product left my hair lifeless and dull with little to no body or movement.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick, frizzy, course hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product may be a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> She said it helped keep down the frizz!  </li>
            <li> Weighed my hair down in spite of using the tiniest little bit!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat coarse, frizzy and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it can get a weird jelly type thing going on once in a while - (little mini bits of clear gel).&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair will feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine how some ladies might like this &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; but for short hair it&#x27;s really awkward especially having all of the pouf at the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li> Then I used too much and my hair looked dirty.</li>
            <li> School, the water in the dorms is sooo full of chlorine that it dries out my hair like crazy without this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t heavy and does not make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> and if it isn&#x27;t blow dried</li>
            <li> what I got was literally something that once dried, looked like lil flecks of boogers in my hair</li>
            <li> Hated it and wouldnt use more than once.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; on my hair a few times, and then I decided to spend 20 bucks and buy a tube from her for myself.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a few inches below my shoulders, medium thickness and layered.  </li>
            <li> Everyday Shea Moisturizing Shampoo Vanilla Mint&lt;</li>
            <li> I like this stuff , however, it is  a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> and my hair would remain silky and not bizarre</li>
            <li> so I can allow for a few days mailing time.</li>
            <li> I think if you slapped this on some already dried hair there might be a problem with with this though.  </li>
            <li> This product needs to be applied and then blow dried...</li>
            <li> It is so non sticky that you can put some on your skin and rub it in and there is no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> If I shower before bed, I can also put the Crack in my hair and not worry about getting my pillow messy.</li>
            <li> Now it has become my everyday hair product, so I don&#x27;t even have to think about</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that smell after I dried it.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and was worried about it turning green from salt and chlorine.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to tame frizzy ends, but wasn&#x27;t expecting the rest of my hair to look oily and limp.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it styles and controls my hair without leaving it stickey or stiff.</li>
            <li> I use very little and mix it with a little water.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for something that can tame my frizzies.  </li>
            <li> The margin of error is very small, so definitely start with very little product and slowly move up.</li>
            <li> I put a little in towel-dried hair and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> Usually it takes a little work to get my hair to look like it does after I use this product.</li>
            <li> When I say little, I mean pea sized amount or less.</li>
            <li> and little more.it is very heavy</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down and feel icky like some spray leave ins do.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry, wavy hair</li>
            <li> It works wonders as I have very thick and dry curls.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to use &#x27;a little,&#x27; and it does mean -a little-.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with and will continue to use but its hard to use less than what I&#x27;m already using.</li>
            <li> think this product would work well for people with thick and/or curly hair or anyone who can handle a slight loss of volume.</li>
            <li> little does go along way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the trick is to use very little and work it through your hair.</li>
            <li> and I use very little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that a VERY little amount goes along</li>
            <li> Small amount of product styles and smooths.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same and doesn&#x27;t work tha same really disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning I put about a pea size drop into my hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I used a small amount as mentioned in reviews.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again now.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my palms and distributed it throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> (My hair usually frizzes up within an hour)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to use this product</li>
            <li> Not sure whats in this</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is identook longer than expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> I was committed to Davines straightner at the time and didn&#x27;t really want to try another product I would be disappointed in.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in spending so much on a straightening iron</li>
            <li> The hold can feel a little weak at times.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair with slight akward waves and curls.</li>
            <li> In the past I have bought expensive salon products that were a waste of money because they dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously start with a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy, frizzy, wavy hair and just a tiny bit of this product smooths everything out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had wavy/curly hair that is really difficult to straighten and even harder to get to stay that way.  </li>
            <li> at least &#x27;look&#x27; healthier.</li>
            <li> I cannot think of anything negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is on the thick end</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy to curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is just way to thick like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair below my shoulders and all I need is a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> I have thick unruly hair and after I shampoo and condition</li>
            <li> MY thick course hair didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AF AM, and Croatian I have thick frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use  this when I want to blow out/flat iron my thick, processed, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not feel greasy or thick or goopy, like some reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a really REALLY thick leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m addicted to a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave reviews are about!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> but you seriously need just a drop</li>
            <li> And bonuses it sparkles, seriously it has glitter in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and hard to distribute through my hair.</li>
            <li> but the tube i got off amazon is a little weird..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give out five stars for any old crap.</li>
            <li> Expensive for an ordinary creme.  </li>
            <li> Remember though, this product doesn&#x27;t fix split ends, split ends can only be removed by cutting hair!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product that helped her damaged, broken, and over-processed hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian with thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair is addicted to crack.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my thin hair at all...</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy and after I&#x27;m done straightening my hair with my flat iron it looks terrible whenever I use this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Not for curling your hair because it weighs it down, making it impossible to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston, TX and anyone who lives here knows that the humidty is terrible!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad one, or maybe my sniffer is odd, but</li>
            <li> This crap left weird gel crystals in my hair.</li>
            <li> have NASTY, ugly and dry brittled damaged hair due to a decade of chemicals/ bleaching, blow drying and straightening nonstop!</li>
            <li> My mom, who has very thick curly hair and is hooked too!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely OBSESSED with crack.</li>
            <li> It gives it a weird stickiness that I don&#x27;t care for AT all</li>
            <li> One use and i was obsessed.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it had a weird film on it.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this crack!</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t enough to make up for the fact it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> NOT impressed what so ever by this product-</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!!</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, my dream for years has been to have the ability to wash my hair and</li>
            <li> but oh my gosh EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Sorry, for me this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Also way too expensive for a 2oz tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be a very sad, sad woman.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel dirty and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Crack stinks, period.</li>
            <li> which then started to make my hair feel dirty and damaged.</li>
            <li> I was mad at my self</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s stupid and unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hate the name however.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> But it works well, against even the worst humidity and heat.  </li>
            <li> I can NOT get passed how horrible it smells, no matter the benefits for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair anyone would ever want.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this daily back in March, my hairstylist recommended this. It smells so good, and my hair is as soft as it&#x27;s ever been! I&#x27;ve went to beauty supply stores and have seriously tried EVERYTHING for my hair because how frizzy it is, especially when it&#x27;s humid. Crack works amazing!! A itty bitty drop does perfect for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Besides the little glitter this contains, it smells great and I like the way my hair feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and was very impressed with it, and decided to buy a tube.  I have very thick, dry, wavy hair and it leaves my hair soft with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product. I am absolutely OBSESSED with crack. It makes my hair soft and healthy looking, I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Best styling product I&#x27;ve used, relaxes hair, keeps it neat for a long time. Fragance is a little strong, though not unpleasant and wears off after a little while.... Good purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and am skeptical of any products.  Using a very small amount of Crack at my ends each day for the past couple of months definitely has improved the texture and look of my hair, it is smoother and does not get weighed down or greasy from the product.  The smell is delicious and I look forward to using on my hair each day!</li>
            <li> this prodeuct was delivered with lightning speed.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and I was not disappointed.  It is a great product for my damaged overly processed hair.... thanks I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff but it doesn&#x27;t do anything too too amazing to be honest. I admit that i am a hair product junkie and i think that this stuff is worth a try! I use it in my everyday hair routine and it does seem to make my hair smoother and my blonde color more vibrant. Word to the wise.. you do not need to go to heavy with this stuff because too much will leave your hair oily. I only use as much as it instructs and my hair is good to go. It helps with breakage as well.. to all of you that use heat on your hair religiously like myself ;).</li>
            <li> I have unruly very frizzy hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that keep it smooth. I also purchased since it has UV protection since I go tanning. One application and I&#x27;m in love! I usually have to use a combination of 5 or 6 different products to get my hair to look nice, but just this did the trick. I am addicted and can&#x27;t wait to get more. It really is addictive! And did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair stylist gave me a free one time use sample and I just loved it. I didn&#x27;t purchased it at the salon because it was costly so I did what any sensible woman/ consumer would do and that is to shop on amazon and I was happy to have found it for 9.99 I bought 3 and it was shipped for free. I use this product everyday on wet hair and I just love it!! In the past I have bought expensive salon products that were a waste of money because they dried out my hair. So I hate to admit it :) but I&#x27;m hooked on crack. Victoria- glendale ca</li>
            <li> I love how this stuff makes my hair and how it feels. Very hydrated and not greasy at all.This product bears its name very well, it is a CRACK, lol :-)</li>
            <li> Very good product, shipping quick, very satisfied. Would recommend this product &amp; amazon-love love love it! what more can I say except price was right too!!</li>
            <li> It is true to its name-CRACK.  I have 4b/c hair and I use this when I blowdry my hair once a month in conjunction with Edenbodyworks Coconut Shea Leave in and my hair feels moisturized and protected. The only thing is the instructions, I have thick hair so I can do dime size for all over my hair so instead I do dime size to each section. I section my hair into four. Also, its better to follow the instruction and put it in your hair when its damp. I would definitely recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> Crack lives up to its name for sure. I have never used anything like it. Works wonders if used right before blow drying. The consistency is on the thick end so a little goes a long way. I like to mix it in with some serum so that it blends better in my hair. hair comes out shiny &amp; sleek, and protected from the damaging effects of thermal styling. Highly recommended for anyone who has curly/frizzy hair, or living in a highly humid environment. I happen to be blessed with both :0)  Wish they could come up with s smoothing shampoo and conditioner with the same quality!</li>
            <li> So I bought this after I got a free sample in the mail, and I have to say, I really don&#x27;t use it every day, or even probably monthly. This product can make your hair quite greasy if more than a little blob is applied. I like the way it smells and I like putting it in my hair. I think the problem that arises wit this for me is the way it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look nicer. It gives it a weird stickiness that I don&#x27;t care for AT all and it increases the time it takes to dry my hair with my Sedu by probably 15 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the tube because it just smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the product name but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> i do not know whats in it but it works, i am african american i have fine wavy hair, so all i need is less than the size of a dime for my hair. this tube will last a long time, especially pay attention to the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this and it was fabulous, made my hair shiny and did not look like I had any product in my hair and believe me I have every hair product on the market...exceptional results for the cost..love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the timely delivery and the way it was packaged.  I was puzzled a bit by the actual product package, it was different than the picture, which was also the only way I had seen it in the past.  Maybe it was new product packaging...I don&#x27;t know.  Anyway, it made me a little suspicious, so I opened each of the six tubes I had ordered to make sure it was indeed the same &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; product.  At this point, it all smells the same, but the test will be when I try it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! The name is very fitting. Makes hair soft and smooth and it smells really good. Just be careful not to use too much or it leaves hair greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and just a tiny bit of Crack and it&#x27;s smooth and straight.  Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will feel greasy - smaller than a pea.  It keeps my hair straight in the NYC humidity, but it&#x27;s no match for rain. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever find a product that can do that. Already recommended it to a coworker and she is now a Crack fan as well.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and tried lots of leave in conditioner and never had such excellent result.  I  found it to be the best product  for my hair type.  I bought a few and have been using it and think it is an excellent product.  I highly recommed Crack for people who has curly, frizzy and wants to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> This product is so great. It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I really got a deal on this through Amazon. I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I like using Crack when I&#x27;m straightening my hair. It leaves the hair frizz free like no other product I&#x27;ve used. You don&#x27;t need any other products. It&#x27;s not beneficial, though, if you want to leave your hair curly. Plus, one negative is that it leaves tiny clear pearls on your hair strands.</li>
            <li> I spotted this in a beauty supply store, and was intrigued by the before and after pics in the little countertop display.. The before hair looked a lot like me. laugh. I was there looking for a miracle conditioning treatment because my hair was so damaged [bleached blond/toner]. I have tried almost everything on my hair, and this time my hair had a lot of breakage and wasn&#x27;t responding to the usual treatments of conditoning packs and Queen Helene Jojoba hot oil [usually a lifesaver!]. The only constant I&#x27;ve found to be a huge help is Wen cleansing conditioner in Fig.. so I washed my hair with that and did a Redken conditioning treatment. Some improvement, still felt dry and dead. I then put in a few small dabs of Crack mixed with drops of water into my hair.. Air-dried and let it be. I knew this product favored the application of heat, so I lightly ran my large-barrel curling iron over my hair to smooth it.. and it became stick straight and sparkly shiny. I have wavy processed hair, and straightening it often means it will turn wavy again later with some frizz. Not in this case. It is flat-iron/silicone spray straight. With almost no effort. I was really surprised, and touched up the rest of my hair with the curling iron. Took less than ten minutes for completely straight hair.  My hair is now silky, flippy and very soft. Holds the shape, i.e. remains very straight. Haven&#x27;t tried curling it with this balm yet. This product is pretty heavy and almost gummy, so I used it sparingly, and rubbed some water into it in my hand otherwise I would have had greasy clumps. It&#x27;s for damp, freshly-washed hair, would be too greasy on dry. I didn&#x27;t use any other styling product on my hair beforehand other than a light mist of detangling spray. Crack seems like it needs an application of heat to melt into your hair and do its thing. I used it yesterday and air-dried with no curling iron, and it was meh and clumpy. Need to add heat.  I was starting to think of chopping off all my hair, but I just ordered a tube of this and I think if I stick with it for a while, it might save my hair. It may not work for everyone.. but definitely try a sample if you can get some at a beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Just an average leave in creme.  No big shakes.  Expensive for an ordinary creme.  Have curly hair and this did nothing for it.</li>
            <li> Over bleach hair it was falling out . This product  help me to blow dry and manage just use a dine size before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Just discovered it and it works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> My seller was amazing and this product even better.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me a sample of this last week. I used it for the first time today. I love it. My hair is fine and became damaged from recent colorings. This did the trick. I always blow dry my hair. My hair looks less damaged and for the first time looks fuller and holds a curl.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, that&#x27;s completely unmanageable.  I straighten my hair every day, causing a lot of heat damage.  I&#x27;m also incapable of blow-drying my hair straight and rely more so on my SEDU flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!!  A little goes a long way, and I can actually manage to blow-dry my hair straight!!  I only use my flat iron for smoothing touch-ups on my bangs.  That&#x27;s it!  This is my miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I absolutely recommend it. My hair has never been softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many smoothing products. This is great.</li>
            <li> Small amount of product styles and smooths.  Not greasy; gives body to hair.</li>
            <li> My hair loves these stuff</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and many hair products are too heavy for my hair. Using a small amount of this before styling with my flat iron works perfectly to give my hair a smooth look without looking limp and lifeless. This product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair product I have ever used. I have tried many many products to tame my curly/frizzy hair. My new routine is Davines Love Smooth shampoo and conditioner paired with Crack. I received Crack as a free sample with a new hair dryer. I was committed to Davines straightner at the time and didn&#x27;t really want to try another product I would be disappointed in. However, a tiny little bit of this stuff works magic on my hair. I don&#x27;t even need a polisher or hair spray after using it. Just a little bit (even when I have slept on my hair) and the hair dryer straightens my hair beautifully.\    One warning -don&#x27;t use too much - it will make your hair greay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it since it made my hair straight they way I wanted it. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a free sample with my straightener SOLIA.. after I straightened my hair I put it on and it was wonderful.. my hair was shiny with no frizz and remained that way like 3 days without using the straightener again. After that I buy the CHI SILK INFUSION to use it after the straightener it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair so pretty like CRACK product, so now I&#x27;m buying the 2.5 oz CRACK because I found it much better than CHI.</li>
            <li> Nice transaction works great.</li>
            <li> I did a search on Google to find great heat protecting products, and came across this item.  I read some of the reviews on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s a heavy cream, which surprised me, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  I have very kinky/frizzy hair.  I used some last night after washing my hair and let it air dry a little before putting in a pony and going to bed.  I anticipated my pony to be a disaster when I woke up.  It&#x27;s typically a frizz ball unless I put it up in a bun.  I was so surprised when I looked in the mirror.  Instead of crazy kinky hair, I had pretty, shiny spirals.  I love it!  I have a lot of hair, not thick, just a lot of it.  It&#x27;s very frizzy, and the only way I am able to control the frizz is to either put a lot of mouse/hairspray when I want somewhat decent kinky hair.  If I wanted straight hair, I had to use a flat iron or big barreled curling iron.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  When I first put it on my hair I was scared because it had a very powerful scent.  However, after drying and flat ironing my hair all that was left behind was a vague fresh and feminine scent.  And my hair looked fantastic - not oily or stiff.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> i used this styling cream a couple yeats ago and got it from folica.com and I loved it. great for flat ironing. but the tube i got off amazon is a little weird.. When i rub it together in my hands, it accumulates into a bunch of tiny gooey little balls. very strange.  Other than those weird little things, it still makes your hair feel good lol</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well for kinky hair (4b,4c) it kinda just sits on top of your hair and dry it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff works with just a pea-sized amount.  @ School, the water in the dorms is sooo full of chlorine that it dries out my hair like crazy without this stuff!  It makes a WORLD of a difference.  For reference, I have thick straight hair and I just use this after towel drying my hair.  Works with or without blow drying :).  My mom, who has very thick curly hair and is hooked too! Happiest camper in the world with this stuff, and recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product! Has a great scent and works great to keep hair sleek and shiny when blow drying.</li>
            <li> The product looked the same when I ordered it but when it arrived the coloring was replaced with silver. After reading it, it was exactly the same product just less colorful. I love this product and will continue to use it no matter if its in color or not!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad as a leave-in treatment and I&#x27;m pretty excited about my bright purple color not fading, but it smells like Axe Body spray, which keeps confusing me because when I get a whiff of it keep thinking there is an insecure 17 year old boy somewhere nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, if I paid attention to the packaging, I might have expected this. A tribal tattoo logo? In 2015? Are you serious?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product guys, but you need to consider an unscented version and a good graphic designer.</li>
            <li> One use and i was obsessed. Makes my hair look shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/fine hair and i have spend thousdand on hair care products in my life, and this is one of the best it makes my hair so smooth and soft without weighing it down and you only need a little bit! A must have!</li>
            <li> Packing was in good condition and delivery was on time. Crack helped with frizz but that&#x27;s about it. It didn&#x27;t really give my hair that shine I was looking for and it didn&#x27;t really help with straigtening with the flat iron. I have thick wavy to curly hair. I have tried many other products also with no success with the outcome, maybe I will find the right one one day.</li>
            <li> I am black (some people might find that tidbit important), and I chemically straighten and dye my hair frequently. Overall the quality of my hair is great due to my amazing hair stylist, but I was looking for something to help in between visits. This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I used a pea sized amount, and nothing else. My hair felt like it had a weird film on it. I switched to nexxus ultimate moisture, which seems to give enough moisture without me having to use extra products.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although it is marketed as a product for straightening hair, I use it to control my frizzy curls and works like magic. Oh and it smells amazing!!! It is worth the price as you only need a tiny dab (a little dab&#x27;ll do you ;-) LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times before But last two times I&#x27;ve gotten a different product in the mail.  It&#x27;s not the same and doesn&#x27;t work tha same really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Meh...I liked it but didn&#x27;t notice any difference really.</li>
            <li> This product is great, and has many great reviews. I purchased it from folica.com but will probably purchase from Amazon next time since it&#x27;s cheaper, and comes with prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the name however. And that&#x27;s the only con I can think of for it. I really think they could have came up with something a little classier. I just think it&#x27;s stupid and unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I would recommend this to anyone who wants protection from heat while styling, needs a leave in conditioner, etc. It&#x27;s great for all those things and more. A little goes a long way, so im hoping this stuff will last me a while.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I flat iron my hair often and this made my hair feel even softer after flat ironing. Plus, it smells good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  You only need to use a little and it lasts a long time.  I can&#x27;t stop buying it.  I put a little in towel-dried hair and style as usual.  It gives me the soft, healthy hair that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> Saw aall of the reviews and thought this would be good to get rid of frizz donnot like and i have tried alot of products and still go back to its a 10 serum. This is just way to thick like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent. I apply to my hair damp and blow dry. I haven&#x27;t found another product that leaves my hair so manageable and doesn&#x27;t break me out around my scalp. Plus it lasts forever- I have thick hair below my shoulders and all I need is a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> great hair product.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great hair product. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and economical.  It only takes a pea-sized amount for my shoulder-length hair.  If you use more, your hair will feel too heavy.  It&#x27;s very thick, so I wet my fingers, first.  Then, put the product on my fingers, rub them together, apply, comb through and dry my hair.  Crack keeps my curly hair straight, even when it&#x27;s raining (of course, I don&#x27;t stand in the rain and expect it to work).  And, it washes out cleanly without residue.  I like it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my wavy/curly frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve used a combination of leave in conditioners, mousse, gel and other anti frizz treatments, but nothing really worked as great as Crack.  I apply it after I wash my hair and style it (either straighten it or blow dry it with a diffuser) or I just simply apply it and separate my hair into sections, twist them and let them dry, which is what I prefer to do if I have the time.  I like that my hair looks healthier, the ends are not as dry as they have been in the past, and it keeps the frizz down even during our Florida summers.  I do find it necessary to apply more than the recommended small amount, but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or makes it look greasy, I do find that I have to wash my hair a day sooner than I would usually, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal...I guess that depends on your hair and how dry or oily it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I don&#x27;t love it. I bought it because it claims it has UV and Thermal Protection. I have 3c curls, but I sometimes blow it out. I&#x27;m still looking for my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Amazing! You only need to use a little bit and it lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome it is very light and does not leave your hair crunchy like most leave in conditioners. It leaves your hair very soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff after reading all the great reviews. My hair must be a lot different then the rest of the reviewers! This creme is not a miracle in a bottle.  I put in on my hair as per the instructions and blew dry straight using a round brush. After blow drying, I noticed my hair was less voluminous but I think thats more because the creme is super thick and it weighed it down.  It wasn&#x27;t any more straight than it would be had I not used it and only used the blow dryer.    I will not purchase this again and wish I would have saved my money.  You can buy better hair products at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. It is amazing for all styles. Silky smooth and lasts for up to 3 days!!! Pricing is also the greatest!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product that helped her damaged, broken, and over-processed hair.  I was having the same issues and tried several things, including WEN, but nothing helped.  I can definitely tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using it and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dry hair and breakage.  Just a little dab is sufficient for below the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> After my hairdresser used a tiny amount on my hair after a cut I was hooked.  &amp;#34;Sell me some crack!&amp;#34; took on a whole new meaning.  Found it here at a price I couldn&#x27;t resist.  This is some good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff don&#x27;t stop selling</li>
            <li> I have thick unruly hair and after I shampoo and condition I use just a small dab and work into my hair as it is damp and it styles great. Definitely recommend this product for those who have dry, wavy or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to go from blonde to brown. After only three months i was having my hair lightened every six weeks to go back to blonde. My hair was beyond damaged.  My hair dresser gave me some \\&quot;Crack\\&quot; to try. I instantly loved this product! It has tamed my fly aways and gives my hair a healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little bit on my ends and work my way up. Too much of this stuff will make your hair look very greasy. So a little goes a long way. Definitely don&#x27;t start on your roots. After 3 years i still use this product almost every day.</li>
            <li> Helps make your hair managble &amp; de tangles</li>
            <li> Addicted to this crack!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with t his product and also orderes some for my daughter.  This site is about half the cost of other sites.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. Really is the only thing that tames my wavy hair even if I don&#x27;t iron it out. It also smells really good and a small amount does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product! I actually was recommended to use it by my hair dresser and I buy it from her too. I have thin hair with slight akward waves and curls. I personally love straight hair, but I had to stop straightning it due to the fact that it was only damaging my hair further. Forunetly though, when ever I use the Crack in my hair it makes it super straight and soft! Its like my dream hair. Although some people dont like this product because they feel it weighed down their hair I feel that is the best part of it because thats what makes my hair so straight when I use. I definetly reccomened it if ur looking for soft, straight, shiny hair. As far as a heat protector I dont really think thats its purpose. Hope I helped!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this product but got the free sample with my Sedu flat iron  ( which is great too ). This product is the best. I used to use 3 products in my hair but now only use this. I am a Caucasian with thin hair and I only use a smidgen throughout my hair and it works! No longer using Moroccan oil because this beats it hands down .</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube blogger brag about this in one of her videos. We have similar hair and I figured I would try this out. I am multiracial and have long curly, super thick hair. I am totally natural and this is nice to help the frizz, but I think the &amp;#34;Miracle 10&amp;#34; works way better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not what I needed.</li>
            <li> Like the smell it gives my hair but don&#x27;t really get the applying instruction, I just apply it after showering</li>
            <li> Wow this is great stuff. I have curly hair and use this product after I wash my hair, then I add more after I flat iron. Completely non greasy and helps straighten n remove frizz</li>
            <li> Great product works with many different lengths and styles of hair.  Significantly cheaper than if you were to buy in a salon or other beauty supply store.  I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Not greasy.  You can slather it on your hair and go outside in the sun and it soaks in leaving your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this product several times.  it&#x27;s okay but nothing to write home about.  i will use it up,but, at this point, i don&#x27;t plan on purchasing it again.  there are products i like better.</li>
            <li> Does the rt thing for frizzy hair. Must use for awhile before any noticeable improvement. Recommended by my hair dresser</li>
            <li> I like this product. It makes my hair softer after blow drying it after I wash it. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t heavy and does not make my hair greasy. My hair feels soft and naturally healthy after using this product.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Houston Tx and it is seriously humid here (90-100% humid) so I am on the hunt for anti-humidity products and I was hoping this would be \\&quot;the one\\&quot;.  It does make my hair softer and it&#x27;s very cost effective as I don&#x27;t have to use much product.  But I will keep looking...</li>
            <li> ...because it is highly addicting!  My hair is very hard to tame, and this product not only acts as the conditioner, but I need no other product when I use it.  Love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> MY thick course hair didn&#x27;t like this. I also don&#x27;t prefer the smell. It may work for you, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item for several years now, and it has kept my hair from a lot of breaking.  I only use about half an inch from the tube and that will do for my whole head.  Love it.  Comb runs through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product! During these last gew months I have notice less dead, and healthier looking hair by just using this.</li>
            <li> One of my cousins is a hair dresser &amp; she recommended this to me for static. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months now &amp; cannot be without it.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I put about a pea size drop into my hair and style as usual. I&#x27;ve used this one very short hair and when my hair was in length well below the middle of my back without any problems. Do be advised to not use more than you need because it will make your hair very weighed down and greasy. I always apply only to the middle and ends of my hair and avoid the roots because if I don&#x27;t it weighs my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a great product to add shine, protection from heat products (I use a flat iron and hair dryer daily) and leaves my hair silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;A tube this big lasts me about 7 months (I have shorter hair now, but mostly medium thickness with length below the middle of my back (natural curly)) Static is no longer a problem during the drier days (I live in the desert, drier climate with zero rain)</li>
            <li> This, to me, is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found for SOFT curly hair!!  You only need a LITTLE to rub between your palms and put it mostly on the ends, and your good to go.  Beautiful soft curls that last for a least 3 days.  I also add my lightweight gel and also macadamia oil (actually I put that on first, with the gel last) and I&#x27;m happy each time.  BTW....this is cheapest I found both online and at salons, if they had even heard about it since it&#x27;s pretty new.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing how great this product has been for my hair! It is softer, straighter, and does not frizz, even in humidity! I use it after shampoo and before blow dry styling! Love this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used this on me and I loved the scent and thought that it was good for me to use when I flat-iron my hair. While it may protect your hair from the heat of flat-ironing it, it makes my hair super greasy (no matter how little of it I use) and when I used it alone as a leave-in conditioner my hair was left dry and brittle. I am sad that I bought two tubes of this because I have a ton of samples from my hair dresser and if I actually make it through using all of the samples, I know it&#x27;ll be so far in the future that I will never get to use the product that I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair that&#x27;s half way down my back and if it isn&#x27;t blow dried it looks absolutely drab. I HAVE TO use this product for each blow dry. It makes my hair feel super soft and silky. For those of you with relaxed hair, you know it takes a lot for your hair to feel like that. Surely is addicting because I keep coming back for more. Thank goodness I found it on here for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine hair soft and shiny - no frizz or flyaways. Can put this on damp hair and not need any other product!</li>
            <li> This crap left weird gel crystals in my hair. I wanted a smoothing lotion and what I got was literally something that once dried, looked like lil flecks of boogers in my hair :/ totally gross. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was on a visit to Colorado and went to a spa and had my hair done and the stylist used this product. She said they call it crack because you get hooked on it. She was so right! My hair is thick coarse and unruly and this product has made it soft non-frizzed and manageable. I LOVE IT!!! and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> My hair got a bit damaged after a bleach and tone, so I got in the habit of using Kerastase Nectar Thermique before drying my hair. However, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I looked for a more economical solution and luckily, I found this product. I bought this at the end of January and now (August), I&#x27;m picking up another tube. I use it about 4 times a week, so the tube lasts a really long time. It did as good a job as Nectar Thermique protecting my ends and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as, but it&#x27;s still a pretty darn good product. I don&#x27;t really use a curler or straightener that often, so I can&#x27;t say how effective it is in that capacity, but whenever I use it, my hair is softer, more manageable and looks healthier. I&#x27;d really recommend it.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. it leaves my hair very soft, shiny, and smelling super good! the only thing i would have a complain about is that if i apply this on the top of my head it leaves it kinda oily and heavy. other then that its awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this this product.  It makes hair straightening so easy. Keeps my hair straight and less frizzy all day</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, it&#x27;s good but you seriously need just a drop, I thought it&#x27;d need more because my hair is super long and super thick, but this stuff is super greasy and really thick, glue like if you put too much.</li>
            <li> Hated it and wouldnt use more than once. Waste of money. Foolish to ship back. Ouch again. Didnt pass on either - recyled tube.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I did mix it with another leave in (its a 10) and let me tell you I grabbed a wide tooth comb and could comb right through my hair (this never happens)! My mom told me to get this product because it kept her hair straight for weeks. While I can&#x27;t say it kept my hair straight that long it did reduce frizz and worked longer than any of the other products I&#x27;ve used. I have natural hair and live in Texas (not a good combination) the heat here just makes it hard to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product. LOVE the smell and it does help to protect your hair from damage.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my half curly/half straight hair -- helps it stay straight for at least a few days, and smells awesome. Only a little pea size amount is needed too, so it lasts quite a while. Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple years ago, it was given to me as a gift... I looked all over for it (in stores) I gave up and finally I looked online and found it YAAAAY. I LOVE this product...Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have short and straight, but thick, hair, and it helps smooth frizz and flyaways.  I only need a very tiny amount on the ends before blowdrying, so even though it&#x27;s not a lot of product for your money, it will last a while (although as it grows out, I except I will use more and more).  It also smells really good, and for an added bonus, I still giggle a little at the label whenever I reach for it :)</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and arrived on time.  This is also just the best product for taming the fuzzies in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Why do you think they call it Crack?</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this product is a gift to my mother and she loves it. she only wishes that it didnt have glitter its hadly noticible but other than that this porduct is very useful</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of bottles of leave in treatment they all left my thin hair flat.  This is a great product my hair has volume and it smells wonderful.  I love this.  Not crazy about the name &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; the name almost prevented me from buying it. I just have a hard time finding anything funny about drugs, they are so  tragic and destroy to so many families.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount as mentioned in reviews. The first day my hair was nice smooth and thicker. ( I have fine hair) but after that hair feels pasty, frizzy and unmanageable. I&#x27;m stuck with and will continue to use but its hard to use less than what I&#x27;m already using.</li>
            <li> The absolute real true best product for unruly frizz...my hair stylist recommended this product and I love it so much I have recommended it to everyone I know with frizzy hair.  It just works - try it &amp; see the beautiful difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair and I am half white half puerto rican who lives in the humid south. This stuff has been amazing! I only have to use a small amount and apply right when I get out of the shower to the ends of my hair. It probably cuts my blow drying time by a 1/3 and helps control the frizz and general &#x27;poof&#x27; my hair does when I straighten it. Again you only need a small amount. It also works well when I let my hair air dry. This may be too strong for people who don&#x27;t have thick hair, but it works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for a beach vacation, thinking it would help tame my frizz and give my color some UV protection...but the results I had were so great, I am now addicted to using it everyday! This product is not oily and does not weigh my dry-but-fine hair down at all, it smooths frizz and flyaways, gives me lots of shine and leaves my hair incredibly soft. I have fairly long hair (past my shoulders) and I literally only have to use a pea-sized amount. I cannot recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that this product would do something good to my hair on the days I did not curl it.  Simply put, it made it limp and greasy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a crunchy or sticky residue.  The hold can feel a little weak at times.  The scent is really strong. It kind of has a men&#x27;s cologne or deodorant smell.</li>
            <li> this stuff is incredible !  Makes hair healthy looking and totally manageable, without weighing it down.Will never be without it.</li>
            <li> it really is addictive for your hair.  It&#x27;s hard to believe so much power exists in a little container.  Life is good.</li>
            <li> This product does all that it claims. I have naturally curly (aka, frizzy) hair and using just a dab of Crack allows me to easily smooth my hair with a flattener. It never leaves my hair ffeling greasy or drab. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Its a good product. I loved it.It works really good on hair. It just works! It should be in stores more often though.</li>
            <li> My hair is addicted to crack. Perfect leave-in.  No silicone so it doesn&#x27;t frizz with humidity.  Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li> I have found a keeper.  This stuff is awesome.  Seals my split ends, reduces frizz, leaves my hair super glossy.  I paid $12.95 For a trial size.  Will purchase through here from now on.  Seriously start with a small amount.  I have also used it on dry hair and it works great that way as well.</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate the name.  This product does work wonders on the hair and gives it a smooth finish.  It does protect the hair from heat, and if you use flat irons and blow dryers as I do, this is a must.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a thermal protector as well as a finishing cream.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this product or even heard of it, so it&#x27;s not based on anyone recommending it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many products side by side, each strip as I was getting ready for church.  The Crack Styling Leave-In Treatment performed very well for my baby fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;.  I judged the product by how long it held my curl as I moved onto the next curl, by the time I finished my hair, and how it held up through out the day. It helded all day!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff really is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried soooooo many things on my hair to control frizz in general, but especially in humidity and nothing ever really works. This stuff does! I but about the size of a quarter on wet hair and then blow dry and my hair feels like it does when I come out of the salon. The best!</li>
            <li> Awesome product that I stumbled upon from an Allure magazine.  I don&#x27;t have super frizzy hair, but this CT weather has made my hair more frizzy than usual on top of getting my hair dyed on a monthly basis.  I&#x27;ve used this product twice and am already really pleased.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot which is a plus, and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair super greasy by the end of the day.  I can actually get away with washing every other day even with this product in my hair.  The odor isn&#x27;t as yummy as bed head products, but there&#x27;s nothing offensive about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair fits into the category of long, dyed and straight.  This is a definite pick me up when needed.</li>
            <li> Your hair will thank you for this. Specially if you apply it prior torturing your hair by blow drying and straightening it. Add to that it really acts as leave it moisturizer for your hair. I recommend it to everyone who use hair styling machines.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I use very little and mix it with a little water.  If you use too much your hair will feel dirty.  I have also started mixing it with a John Freda thermal oil and the two work very well together.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  It makes my hair feel dirty and sticky.  Even if I use an amount smaller than a pea.  This stuff is heavy and after I&#x27;m done straightening my hair with my flat iron it looks terrible whenever I use this stuff.  The smell is OK but that isn&#x27;t enough to make up for the fact it is terrible.  (I have thick blonde hair down to my shoulders with a little natural frizzy wave.)</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  I rub about a dime size amount into my towel-dried hair and style (blow-dry and sometime minimal flat ironing) and this keeps my hair soft and protected.  My only complaint is the cost for the amount.  I can get twice as much BioSilk Silk Therapy for less than and that works just as well.</li>
            <li> great stuff to protect your hair while drying</li>
            <li> I have my waves again! Beautiful, well-defined, soft waves! Couldn&#x27;t endorse this stuff more highly. I can wear my natural texture without feeling self-conscious for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be that if I let my hair air-dry, it&#x27;d poof up into a whole head of flyaways. If I didn&#x27;t use products, it&#x27;d look like a lion mane for minimum 2 days after washing. Now I just put a quarter-sized (!!) amount of this stuff between my hands and smooth my wet hair down after showering, and I have never seen my waves so well-defined and beautiful! Doesn&#x27;t weigh down at all. Other products would either fail to smooth down my hair or weigh the waves down so they looked lumpy, forcing me to flat-iron it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to straighten my hair all the time or the dry volume frizz would be unmanageable. I&#x27;ve tried SO many things to tame my thick, dry, color-treated, damaged hair. Everything from coconut oil masks to argan oil to a full cabinet of leave-in conditioners and humectants. Nothing comes close to this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; on my hair a few times, and then I decided to spend 20 bucks and buy a tube from her for myself.  It&#x27;s a quality product, but overpriced, I felt.  Buying it online here for such a reasonable price was great!</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it does.  Good for your hair.  The only problem is sometimes you find clumps in your hair.  You need to brush your hair after you put it in to avoid the clumps.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best \\&quot;leave in hair treatments\\&quot; I have ever used.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must remember, only place/use a small dot of Crack in your hand...about the size of a dime...rub between both hands and apply to towel dry hair.  If you use too much, hair will be greasy/oily/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandsons, ages 5, 6 &amp; 7, ask for me to wash their hair, and use that \\&quot;good smelling stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for sellin this great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Crack is like bb cream for your hair -- it does everything -- nourishes, keeps your style and protects and a fantastic price A+</li>
            <li> not as good as the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for taming frizzy hair. I&#x27;m in the Dallas/Fort Worth area where we have lots of humidity. Not too heavy and smells great. Just takes a small dab each day so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have crazy, frizzy, wavy hair and just a tiny bit of this product smooths everything out. I have tried everything and this is the product that works best for me.</li>
            <li> I love how this product works! I use this when I am going to straighten my hair, and it makes it so shiny and manageable! Will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> The best product ever</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I buy this product since I have naturally curly/wavy hair and straightening it was a chore.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the thermal protection for my hair since it was burning up otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smooth look after I was done.&lt;br /&gt;The straightening lasted an extra day or 2, without repeating product application and major ironing session: cut back time to 30 min. rather than the typical hour I was investing, each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 things I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-smell of product under 400 degree hot iron; kinda chemical, so you may want to open a window or turn on the overhead bathroom fan.&lt;br /&gt;-due to leftover product on hands, after application, my hands became overly sensitive to heat.&lt;br /&gt;Either wash your hands a couple of times right after applying product or wash AND wear haircare/heat tolerant gloves.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my thin hair at all... but it works very well on my 5-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s hair and makes it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Best hair care product i have used by far. It leaves ur hairs straight and not frizzy. It also smells so good</li>
            <li> I try to buy as much as i can at one time so I never run out. Even my hairdresser asked what I was using because my hair felt healthier!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but use very little otherwise your hair looks a bit greasy!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate it in the top ten products out there but it&#x27;s better than many!&lt;br /&gt;The last two tubes I&#x27;ve had I have noticed that it can get a weird jelly type thing going on once in a while - (little mini bits of clear gel).&lt;br /&gt; I bought it several times and I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again now.</li>
            <li> This product looks my hair look and smell pretty</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  it protects your hair from the heat of your flat iron. Finally my hair is growing since I have been using this heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Glad others had great results with this product but it did nothing for my hair.  Tried using it several ways as leave in and before blow drying or flat ironing my hair it saw no improvement.  I watched a video online and it seemed to work great on models hair but my results were dismal. Sometimes my hair can be slightly frizzy and CRACK did nothing to improve my frizzies.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was good. It was reccomended by my hair dresser. It doesn&#x27;t out perform anything I could buy in a store.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse frizzy hair. When I use this before I dry and flatten my hair I actually love my hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have dark brown thick slightly dry/frizzy top layer of hair (I think too much sun exposure as I live in a sunny area). My under layer hair is heavy but healthy (no sun exposure). I put this crack into my hair that&#x27;s been air dried for half an hour.</li>
            <li> It really is addictive!  It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  This little bottle lasts forever because even with my extra long hair, you only need a little each time.</li>
            <li> I waited until I&#x27;d used this product 6 times before I wrote a review.  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products......so many....dozens and dozens.  Underneath my bathroom sink is a graveyard of once or twice used products that were supposed to calm my frizz and straighten my hair.  Only one, before Crack, even came close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought the One Pass straightening iron and it suggested Crack with it...so I bought that too.  I&#x27;d tried everything else, what&#x27;s another few bucks, right?  Well, the first couple of times I used my new straightening iron, I used my old hair product and my results were less than stellar. I was disappointed in spending so much on a straightening iron and it wasn&#x27;t a lot better than my old one.  It WAS better...but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I decided to go ahead and try the Crack.  And wow....what a difference. My hair looks like it belongs to someone else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very fine, frizzy hair.  So, I split my hair down the middle and I use a bit less than a pea sized amount on each half.  Starting halfway down my hair (if you start at the ends, you will end up with greasy looking ends), I very gently add it to my towel-dried hair.  I blow dry it just however.  Then straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ends up soft, frizzLESS, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever stop making this....I&#x27;ll be a very sad, sad woman.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff...I still need a bit of mousse with it to keep the frizz down. Much better than all mousse crunchiness.</li>
            <li> Simply addictive to your hair and I never go without it.  It smells great and does not leave your hair heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down and feel icky like some spray leave ins do. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very Addicting. Works Great!</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF I HAVE NEVER BEEN A DRUGGIE!  But now I can actually say I use crack, I love crack, I&#x27;m addicted to crack, and positively no ill side effects.  I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel, and look.  And bonuses it sparkles, seriously it has glitter in it.  It provides excellent protection from my constant straightening.  I LOVE CRACK! And I recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for daughter and really don&#x27;t know how she likes it but she liked receiving the gift. Will have to  ask!</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of this stuff and fell in love its awesome smells great and it made my blow out much much easier....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my ends to prolong my blowout and freshen the style ...it smells awesome and its definitely addictive...&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fair, product is amazing will def order again!</li>
            <li> My hair is a few inches below my shoulders, medium thickness and layered.  I buy a lot of hair products because I like to try new things and I&#x27;m always looking for something that can tame my frizzies.  I bought Crack awhile ago and really liked it but then started using another product that I&#x27;d bought at the same time.  Well this morning I went back to using Crack and the difference was like night and day!  Crack really smooths my hair, gets rid of the frizzies and adds a lot of shine; my hair looks gorgeous and is so soft!  I only use a pea sized amount and only on the ends of my hair...it&#x27;s tempting to want to use more but you don&#x27;t need to and shouldn&#x27;t as it&#x27;ll weigh your hair down.  So, I&#x27;m sticking with Crack and will get rid of the other products I was using; they don&#x27;t measure up!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by a hairdresser and now its the only product I put in my hair while styling. I do use CHI silk protein after styling to add more shine &amp; moisture but my hair is blonde and pretty dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff does seem to work pretty well but I dislike the smell enough that I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this  stuff !!!!!!! WOW..... It makes your hair soft ,silky,and frizze free .I just wish i knew about this years ago ! :0</li>
            <li> all great, I was happy with the item and what I paid for it. No regrets. I would recommend to others.9</li>
            <li> I love how it works in my hair no heaviness. Keeps it protected and smooth and does have the greasiness of other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much on the quest for hair s*** that actually DOES what it says. This stuff works. I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of heat tamers, oils, it&#x27;s like pouring money down a toilet. I flat iron once a week, with minor touch ups all week long. I wash once or twice a week and let my hair chill out for a couple days. Needless to say I&#x27;m addicted to a flat iron. Now I&#x27;m addicted to this product. It made my hair silky smooth and shiny.  I&#x27;m AF AM, and Croatian I have thick frizzy curly hair. This product made it smooth as butter. I have recently combined this with the organix 14 day straight. No my hairs not straight but it IS healthier. I don&#x27;t give out five stars for any old crap. This deserves it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my dog&#x27;s hair.  It works really really well and I imagine it&#x27;d be just as good, if not better in human hair!</li>
            <li> I really only need a little at a time even with long hair (a little more than a dime size dollop) - too much and it weighs down my hair.  But it works well, against even the worst humidity and heat.  It fights frizz and smells great, and doesn&#x27;t weight it down when you blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use this sparingly on my hair ends only - the heat protection works great on my thin, light hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was convinced this was the styling product for me. It smells nice, but it makes my normal hair super greasy. I used it twice and threw it out. I much prefer Suave Sleek leave in cream, Matrix Total Results spray, and Aquage Transforming Paste.</li>
            <li> I had to give this five stars because it has allowed me to keep my hair healthy and nice, despite frequent straightener and curling iron use. My hairdresser thought I had not used any heat on my hair for 4 months because my hair looked so healthy. I owe it all to Crack treatment! I have short hair, 2b texture.</li>
            <li> This product is not for a person with fine black hair in my opinion! It does contain ceaytle alcohol in it, which could not be good for black hair. It made my hair to soft and it made it look dry. if you want curls after using this product forget it. a  straight look maybe.&lt;br /&gt;I was not overly impressed and I do use a lot of good hair products.</li>
            <li> The last time I had my hair cut, my hairdresser tried this on my hair before drying/styling. My hair turned out so soft and manageable - I was sold!</li>
            <li> The name and description got me.  I even checked out some reviews before buying.  I got GOT! NOT impressed what so ever by this product- it actually makes my hair difficult to style and has to be washed before the next day&#x27;s do  I have given it multiple chances to work it&#x27;s \\&quot;magic.\\&quot;  At $20 bucks a bottle--this thing&#x27;s a rip!  Even if I were to get this product dirt cheap or as a gift, I still wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, especially on rainy or humid days when my hair would normally be a huge ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! This leaves my hair super soft after I blow it out and flat iron it. Make sure you only use a little; I have short/medium hair and I use a tiny bit smaller than a pea sized amount. I also suggest flipping your head over and running your fingers through your hair to apply it.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very frizzy so I was hoping this would help.  With all the great reviews I wanted to love it but I&#x27;m disapointed.  If I don&#x27;t use a lot my hair gets frizzy but if I use too much it looks oily.  I normally don&#x27;t care for heavy scents so I do like the scent of this.  It&#x27;s very light and pleasant and so is the feel of it on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still up in the air on this one.  I love the feel of the product and the scent but it just doesn&#x27;t work as great as I&#x27;d hoped. If you only  have slight frizz this would probably work great for you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...perfect for &amp;#34;walk of shame&amp;#34; hair or bedhead. Makes my hair shiny and just perfect. I use it constantly but sparingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews. I can NOT get passed how horrible it smells, no matter the benefits for my hair. Crack stinks, period. Maybe I got a bad one, or maybe my sniffer is odd, but yuck!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from being frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> The ratings on this are great.i find it ok and little more.it is very heavy so use with caution.  I will look for slternatives</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It definitely is crack for your hair! It makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down after I use it. With thinning hair that can be a huge problem! I only use a dab and it seems to cover my entire hair. This will last forever but I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  You use such a small amount that the tube lasts for a long time.  I have short hair and use about the size of a large pea.  Using more made my hair feel less clean, so start out with just a little.  Put it on your finger tips and dab onto your hair (not the roots).  I comb it through with a wide tooth comb and either air dry or blow dry.  It makes my hair feel great.  Last time I went in for a cut, my hairdresser asked me about my hair.  I didn&#x27;t mention I was using it (I did not buy it from her) and she noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair silky and soft, but don&#x27;t use a lot and I wouldnt apply it to the roots of your hair. A little goes a long way and if you put too much it makes your hair feel and look greasy. I use this in conjunction with Tressemme heat protectant. I use both of those products to protect my hair from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> item was recommended by a hairstylist , i would never but it again still sits in my bathroom cabinet..waste of money</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love it and it works wonders for my hair. I am so happy I invested in it. I have purchased about 1 bottle a month I love it so much. Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely great for the hair. Really control the frizzies and kept my hair straight for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a hairdresser used it on my hair once and it seemed nice. But then when I started using it at home it just didn&#x27;t give the same results. At first it made my hair feel really greasy and dirty. So the next time I styled my hair I tried only using a tiny pea sized amount, but this time i didn&#x27;t have enough to distribute evenly in my hair and I had to get another pea sized amount for hair from the midshaft and to the ends. so it ended up feeling even more greasy. So then the next time I tried only using the pea sized amount once and then used a comb to distribute it evenly. this method actually seemed to stop it from feeling greasy, but as time went on , and I started using this product again and again,..I noticed that my hairdryer heat really seemed to be damaging my hair and I was thinking that this &#x27;Crack&#x27; should have been doing a better job protecting my hair since it is supposed to be a thermal protectant! it almost started to feel like my hair was becoming more damaged, which is weird....because at the time I wasn&#x27;t even using any curling irons or flat irons or anything else...just a blow dryer. And the other thing I noticed as time went on, it felt like the product was beginning to actually build up residue in my hair, even after washing my hair! as if each time I used it, it left a little bit on my hair that wouldn&#x27;t get washed out....which then started to make my hair feel dirty and damaged. I also felt like I got more dandruff with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not for curling your hair because it weighs it down, making it impossible to hold a curl. Perfect for sleek straight hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t use conditioner now. Styles easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally flat at the roots with waves at the end, so I usually blow dry to straighten and add volume to my roots. I bought this to protect my hair from the heat before blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I only used a tiny bit and found it kind of difficult to spread throughout my hair because it&#x27;s a very thick cream. After blow-drying, my hair was softer, yes, but my hair felt kind of weighed down and borderline greasy.</li>
            <li> A great pomade/balm for your long locks but honestly the finishing wasn&#x27;t all that spectacular compared to a drugstore item.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and adds so much shine to my hair</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use this after I shower to protect my hair from the Sun/ Chlorine damage (My hair gets discolored easily... it goes from natural dark brown to blonde on the tip)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really fine so it gets tangled easily, a little bit of this also helps before I brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and will def purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product twice since i&#x27;ve gotten it.  I recently got my hair done (which can result in a little more damage to the hair) and needed something to smooth it out during the heat styling process.  This does the job! :)</li>
            <li> I was given this originally by my stylist. I have the worst hair anyone would ever want.  Its thin, fine, wavy and easily damaged.  Oh, and it frizzes, did I mention that lovely attribute as well?  So, needless to say, my dream for years has been to have the ability to wash my hair and just \\&quot;go\\&quot; on the weekends. I have NEVER been able to do that without having a frizzbomb on top of my head.  I would ALWAYS blow dry and flat iron my hair, even on the weekends. This stuff is great! I put it on my wet hair and it smooths it enough that I am not so self-conscious in just washing my hair and letting it air dry.  Its not enough that I would wear my hair to work like that, but it definitely helps smooth my hair so blow drying is much easier, and doesn&#x27;t take so much work.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle, I still have hair that gets spit ends easily, but it is a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I dye &amp; highlight to cover grays which has caused frizzies in my fine hair.  Crack has given me everything I needed.  Feels greasy, at first, but that goes away.  It actually WORKS!!  YAY!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at first. It&#x27;s very thick and hard to distribute through my hair. After about two weeks I finally decided that it is great for flat ironing. My hair is smooth and stays that way for two days. It takes getting used to but it&#x27;s worth it. Wish it smelled better though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and I cannot agree more with the positive reviews! I have VERY thick, frizzy hair and live in a humid climate.  My hair has become damaged by coloring and constant blowdrying and flat ironing. I put a small amount on my palms and distributed it throughout my hair. Lesson learned after blowdrying: I used less than a dime-sized amount and should have used even less.  My hair looked slightly greasy in spots but not so after flat-ironing. Long story short: With this product my hair was noticeably softer, straighter and smoother after just blowdrying and I was able to get it MUCH flatter with the same number of flat iron passes I usually use.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it! I was mad at my self I thought it was bigger next time I&#x27;m going to buy larger.</li>
            <li> Any one with unruly hair should try this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love!  Will order more!</li>
            <li> Best product to get rid of frizz or smooth kinky curls.</li>
            <li> Magic for hair softness and smoothing hair ends.  It adds a shine of gloss from roots to ends. Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells amazing and makes my hair not have nearly as many fly-aways.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It smoothes hair and makes it much easier to style. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and ran back and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for thick hair that&#x27;s curly or wavy and dry and brittle. it&#x27;s more of a balm that smoothes it out and makes it look great. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trick is to use very little and work it through your hair. if you use a lot, it will look greasy. Again, if you want a straight, smooth shiny look to your hair and you&#x27;ve got thick hair, this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair looked like hay before.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every straightening gel and lotion on the market, both cheap and expensive, to straighten my naturally curly and frizzy hair.  This Crack is the best stuff on the market.  You don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  I put a small amount in my hands, smooth over my wet hair, then comb through.  I wait about 15 minutes, then I blow dry my hair, and use a brush.  My hair turns out so smooth and straight.  Even after sleeping on it, my hair remains that way.  I don&#x27;t even have to use an iron anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the small size (2.5 oz).  I pay between $11-12 on Amazon.  Ulta sells it for $20!!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this product because it does exactly what it said it would do; however, there is a but...for those with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;If it matters, I&#x27;m Black and am trying to grow out my hair from deciding to shave my head one day (still regretting it). Futhermore, I am not natural I use a relaxer in my hair. Anyways, my hair is heavily layered and ranges from the nap of my neck to about my nose--once my hair gets long enough I will cut it to one length.&lt;br /&gt;My routine is pretty simple:&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo, condition, sometimes deep condition with olive oil then apply shampoo, rinse with apple cider vinegar, apply heat serum, put into bantu knots overnight, then flat iron. When I use this stuff I put in replace of my heat serum and do my same steps. My hair comes out super shiny, soft, and very silky the only problem is with my length of hair it comes out really poufy!! Like it won&#x27;t lay flat even after sleepy on my hair. I can imagine how some ladies might like this &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; but for short hair it&#x27;s really awkward especially having all of the pouf at the roots of my hair. Anyways, I didn&#x27;t subtract any stars because like I said I can imagine people liking this so called &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34;. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t like this extra volume and will stop using it until my hair gets longer and weighed down more.</li>
            <li> Ok this is absolutely awesome! They have it in the stores and at salons but oh my gosh EXPENSIVE so but it from AMAZON! Stuff smells so good and you only need a little bit so it will last awhile. Would recommend buying this product. The name is great!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick, frizzy, course hair. Most products I use weigh it down but i still get frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AWESOME! And I love knowing I do not need to put 10 different things i my hair, all in need is Crack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I must warn, the first time I used it I thought it did almost nothing. Due to reading the reviews I used a very small amount, it was not enough to make a difference. Then I used too much and my hair looked dirty. Its a trial and error sort of thing, but once you find the right balance it is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE CON: I don&#x27;t like the smell! Its ok at first, but when i blow dry my hair it takes on a sorta rubber smell (like those gummy rubber worms your dad uses for fish bait!)This might just be me though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made my hair softer and healthier already. I use it with my Sedu Diamond flat iron (best flat iron ever btw) and finish off with just a bit of Biosilk Glazing gel on the tips and VERY little rubbed into my palms on the top of my hair to help hold my style through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally found a winning Combo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Everyday Shea Moisturizing Shampoo Vanilla Mint&lt;br /&gt;2: CRACK&lt;br /&gt;3: Sedu Revolution Diamond Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;4: Biosilk Glazing Gel</li>
            <li> this was something i bought for my girlfriend, i tried it a few times to rate it, and the first couple times it left my hair super greasy feeling and shiny like i hadnt showered, i had not applied much only a dime size and i have a fair amount of hair. In the directions it says to apply to damp hair, so i after tried to apply it to dry hair and then kind of fluffed my hair with a blow dryer and that seemed to make my hair seem less greasy when I would follow the directions step by step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does leave your hair super soft all day, but still makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, for my damaged hair. Of course it didnt fix the damage ends, however it did make my hair really soft, the healthy part of my hair. Ontop of that it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Makes my wavy unruly hair nice and tame and smooth - I get compliments on my hair every time I use it.  I am stocking up in case god forbid they stop making it !  Caution - you only need a tiny bit - I have pretty long hair and I only use about a half inch line on my palm - run it in your hands first than distribute to the back and ends first - then the front /bangs - plus use a good hair dryer ( that makes all the difference !</li>
            <li> I have purchased lots and lots of hair products in my life and I must say this is one of the very best!  My hair was so shiney, soft and no little &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve used Redkin, Pureology, and lots of other great brands but this product beats them all in this category!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years. It works great and I will continue buying it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had wavy/curly hair that is really difficult to straighten and even harder to get to stay that way.  I&#x27;ve had some minor success with other products but I&#x27;m thrilled with this one.  I finally have swingy, straight hair that moves freely instead of in one big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product didn&#x27;t keep my hair frizz-free in the rain, but I haven&#x27;t succeeded yet in finding one that does, so I didn&#x27;t subtract a star.</li>
            <li> Bought this item looking for a good thermal protectant since my main problem is breakage, dry ends etc. I love this stuff! I have pretty long hair that I bleach and have issues with thinning Ends and can never grow my hair past a certain point. I&#x27;m hoping with this stuff that will all change because after only two uses I&#x27;m starting to notice less breakage. This makes the ends of my hair feel so soft and not dry at all. Even after I slept on my hair, the next day my hair was just as soft and barely frizzy or anything. Was still practically perfectly straight! I only use a pea size amount, and don&#x27;t get the heavy or greasy feeling at all (as some reviews mention) and my hair is almost as thin and as fine as it comes. I rely on heat almost every day and so far this stuff seems to be a life saver. Amazon has the cheapest price I have found, but I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping so maybe that&#x27;s why. Either way I would totally spend 20 bucks on it next time if it keeps my hair feeling this way! Doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it! I love it :) also I just put it on towel dried hair and focus on the ends, then try to pull it through the rest of my hair but staying away from scalp since some people said it made hair look greasy if they put it near scalp. But so far no problems for me :) hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The girl that cuts my hair gave me a free sample of this and then I decided to buy some. It smells good, makes my hair soft, and seems to help with split ends. And I like that you only have to use a very tiny amount each time.</li>
            <li> This item was great! It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected it to be from what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I use this leave-in treatment on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful. My husband can&#x27;t keep his hands or his nose off my hair.</li>
            <li> Small amount really is fabulous!  My hair is dry and always had that bristly top layer that would not smooth</li>
            <li> this product is absolutely amazing! I use it after I wash my hair to ease the blow drying and relieve the heat damage from my hair. Awesome products this is my second time ordering</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was looking for a product that would help my hair...at least &#x27;look&#x27; healthier. My friends at work recommended &amp;#34;CRACK&amp;#34; and it works! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  Works very well on curly hair. A little quarter size goes a long way.  I have long curly hair and I use very little.  I highly recommend this.  I have used many professional products and by far this is the best,  I usually have too use more than one product before flat ironing my hair.  With this product, that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. I was introduced to it in the FL Keys to combat the humidity and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Great Product!! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this stuff is amazing.  I have extremely frizzy hair and whether I wear it straight or curly it perfectly smoothed all the frizz away with only using a little drop.  And the results last for days if you don&#x27;t wash it out.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have been buying it through Amazon for about 6 months and tried it solely based on it&#x27;s good reviews.  I blow dry my hair every night before I go to bed, which dries out my hair from the shaft to the ends and leaves it frizzy.  I have fine (thin) hair and put about a half dollar sized amount in my palm and rub it around to crate a thin film on my palms.  I slide my palms on the inside and outside of my hair starting at my ear length and work it down to the ends which is a couple of inches below my shoulders.  Magic - no more frizz and my hair feels like their is no product in it and is brushable.  Also a little bit like a detangler too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It gets rid of frizz with a minimal amount. Unlike other hair products, it leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky not hard and greasy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, softens and give shine while it conditions.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again and again. I use on dry hair before using heat styler and it seals and protects perfectly.</li>
            <li> Tames frizzy hair and says it has thermal protection</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair product. It smoothes my hair when it is straight or curly, it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair easier to brush, and it makes my hair blow dry a lot faster. My hair is so silky that I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it. At first it seemed rather expensive but since you only need a tiny amount, it lasts a long time. I have very long, thick hair and the 2.5 oz. bottle actually lasted me about 3 or 4 months</li>
            <li> Finally, something that keeps my hair straight after using a flat iron!  (My hair usually frizzes up within an hour)&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy anything else now.</li>
            <li> This product looks much different than the picture here. Must be a knockoff. This is actually a tube of grease. I used a pea sized amount after washing my hair and after what seemed like several days, my hair dried. However it looked like I hadn&#x27;t yet washed it that year. Suspected ingredients: motor oil, perfume.</li>
            <li> I think is smells great and feels really nice, the only thing I was not thrilled about was the size of this tube... it&#x27;s very small and I have a lot of hair.  I basically went through it in two uses so I don&#x27;t think I will be re-ordering this.  If I see it in a store I would buy it but not for mail order.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product! I put in just a touch on the tip of my hair and then rub it through the rest after I wash my hair. Works great and keeps my hair looking shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have hard to straighten hair and this stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and still love it. I was delighted they now have a shampoo and wash out conditioner along with this leave in and I must say the creators made the right choice. This product line is wonderful even for coily African American hair. I&#x27;m definitely \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; on all of their products!</li>
            <li> How did I live without this?</li>
            <li> Restores moisture, enhances manageability and makes hair soft and shiny. Can&#x27;t believe it took only a week fo my hair to improve in texture. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  It is a product that is a part of my daily routine. Every girl should have this in their bathroom.</li>
            <li> At first the cream might feel a bit heavy or sticky but once I rubbed it on my damp hair, it works magic. I have fine easy to curl color-treated hair with some split ends and I can honestly say that this leaves my hair feel like silk and provides great flat iron coverage. My hair looks healthy and shiny despite all of the ironing it has gone through. Remember though, this product doesn&#x27;t fix split ends, split ends can only be removed by cutting hair! It helps against frizz and tames your split ends from sticking out giving it a healthy appearance. You should only use the size of a pea, though otherwise it might feel greasy. It smells great too, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s review- I have fine, color treated hair.  I bought Crack to smooth my frazzled ends and it did just that.  I can&#x27;t go without this stuff now!  I work it into the ends of my hair while still wet, then style as usual.  It tames the fly-aways and I feel like my hair is in better condition than before I started using it.  1 tube lasted me approx 6 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I found it at the Ulta samples displays and picked it up on the off chance it might work.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair has always been somewhat coarse in texture and wavy and frizzy, but now that the hair is 50% gray it becomes a mess in humid weather or dry with wind.  This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found thus far that works.  It smells delightful and comes out of the tube very thick.  Once you rub it in your palms the warmth softens it up.  You can put it on towel-dried hair and blow your hair out, knowing your hair&#x27;s protected from the heat, or use a smidge when those wild hairs spring out during the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat I have is that it&#x27;s possible to overdo it, so add a little at a time, until you learn how much your hair needs. It&#x27;s a great treatment that serve many uses--detangles, protects from the heat of styling equipment, moisturizes and nourishes your hair, kind of a BB cream for your head!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff , however, it is  a bit heavy. It smells great. It does not prevent friz, which I need.</li>
            <li> This is the only product you will need.  It truly saves alot of time - no conditioner in the shower and less dry time with hair dryer makes me a very happy person every morning!</li>
            <li> I saw no significant difference in my hair..... It mulled great but it didn&#x27;t do the justice of its rave reviews. I personally wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> This product arrived in less than a week which was fantastic. I was so anxious to use this product so I washed my hair and let it air dry to a damp phase. I&#x27;ve read reviews that a VERY little amount goes along way so I used a tic-tac  sized amount on my wet hands and rubbed it together then rand my hands through my hair from root to ends.&lt;br /&gt;I have NASTY, ugly and dry brittled damaged hair due to a decade of chemicals/ bleaching, blow drying and straightening nonstop! My hair is frizzy like a lions mane when it dries, its very thick/coarse but I have some thinning around my crown. After that first used of this cream, I did not use a blow dryer to dry it. I simply let it air dry and half of that lion&#x27;s man depleted! It was silky smooth and less frizzy!!! Note, I did not use anything else on my hair besides that. After I straightened it, it became even more lustrous/ silky!! The next day was a little decent! I noticed that I had some more split ends (I previously trimmed my hair a few days before) and that my ends were dry and that my bald looking crown was more apparent. I would not rely/ depend on just this product to protect from thermal heating! I also don&#x27;t recommend those with thinning scalpy hair to use this also, it would make your hair flatter and thus, making the skin on your scalp more noticeable. Though after using this product more often and with a hair protectant, I have realized that my hair will keep for about three days in between washes! Note, I worked out and sweat and my hair would remain silky and not bizarre frizzy like before! So this product will react/work differently to everyone. I will be repurchasing though!</li>
            <li> Crack works wonderful, it makes my hair smooth and shiny.  My daughter loves it too and uses it everday like I do.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair product! It really is crack because I&#x27;m addicted! This bottle lasted me months &amp; ill always love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair! I have straight hair but it&#x27;s thick, this does the job to keep it flat and shiny.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s that rule about how all hair products don&#x27;t work on all hair types. This one doesn&#x27;t do much for me. I have naturally curly, thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any noticeable shine or smoothness but the thermal protection does seem to work and it doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy. It does seem to make my hair a bit greasier though.</li>
            <li> Ive been a hairdresser for 20 years and it&#x27;s an AMAZING Straightening greaseless conditioning balm!! Love!!</li>
            <li> love this!  little does go along way!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product. Put a tiny bit in your palms and rub through your damp hair before styling. This product keeps my frizzy curly hair looking nice and straight.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is a great base to help keep my hair looking thick, full and damage free.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my stylist. I really love it for my dry, frizzed hair. I just feel like it smoothes without making hair oily.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more... it didn&#x27;t really do much of anything. The cheaper drugstore brands work better to de-frizz and give a bit of hold for curly hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. My hair is wavy/curly, I am an irish/hispanic mix :)!</li>
            <li> This product is the best to add shine and smoothness to your hair...and it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap compared to the better known brands.  You can use it on wet or dry hair...just a pea size in wet hair will give you smoothness and shine.  Same amount on dry hair gets rid of frizz, adds shine and is a great thermal protector before using your flat iron.  Great, great product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product. My hair is fine and dry, it put moisture back into it. I use it about 3 times a week. You don&#x27;t need a lot in your hair, a dab will do.</li>
            <li> I use  this when I want to blow out/flat iron my thick, processed, frizzy hair.  It works like magic!  My hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida where humidity is very high but this product really control the frizz..  It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Just a dime size dollop of this potion left my frizzy, dry locks soft and touchable and definitely less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the salon for $20!  This was only $9 with shipping!  I will buy this again!  I can stand to save every dollar possible.Just takes a little planning ahead so I can allow for a few days mailing time.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. A thick, epoxy like product with an odd Lysol scent, I found that this product left my hair lifeless and dull with little to no body or movement. I did feel like it worked as a great heat protectant and would possibly recommend to anyone who is outside a lot or swims in order to protect hair color/treatment. All in all, I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love it- I use it in addition to Redken rinse out conditioner on my long hair by putting it primarily on the ends. Just don&#x27;t use too much or you end up with greasy hair. It&#x27;s rare to find a hair product that actually does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells amazing and it just WORKS!  In regards to the reviewers saying it pills up into little balls in your hair...I think I have the answer on that.  I&#x27;ve noticed when rubbing it between my palms it kinda pills up a tiny bit, but then I rub it in my hair and after DRYING &amp; STRAIGHTENING my hair there&#x27;s no residual &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; in my hair at all.  I think if you slapped this on some already dried hair there might be a problem with with this though.  Definitely use on wet hair.  I can honestly say with my fine hair it can be too heavy, I use a pea size (literally) for my chin length bob hairstyle.  I only did 4 stars because I feel like I get similar results from other less expensive products.  P.s., ULTA has this in a smaller sample size for way less $$$</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves hair style able and soft. It&#x27;s my new non-gel. 😉Wish it was cheaper though. Buy one get one would be sweet.</li>
            <li> works great in the humidity of the South!</li>
            <li> This product needs to be applied and then blow dried...then it works beautifully,.,,shiny manageable hair! I recommend this product to tame damaged hair of any kind.</li>
            <li> Great product you really only need a little otherwise your hair will end up greasy and heavy less is defiantly more</li>
            <li> Yup, I really like it for blowing out my wavy hair. Since I don&#x27;t know how nor want to use a curling iron / flat iron, this gives me a smooth finished look from just blow drying my long, wavy hair with a round brush. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and straight hair. I haven&#x27;t done much with it other than growing it really long. Last month I decided to get bangs and I love them. Since then, I have been looking for a product that protects my hair from heat damage as I now use a straightener daily on my bangs and pretty much every other day to curl my hair. I don&#x27;t have a real frizz problems, just some fly aways this product is not designed to help with. I have been using Crack for two weeks now. I have made the mistake of using too much thinking I would need more since my hair is long. Pea sized amount in one hand, wet the other hand, rub together, gently touch the tips of my hair and everywhere else. Once I think I have a little bit everywhere I rub my hair together, brush and either air or blow dry. I have noticed a slightly longer drying time as well but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. As far as the scent it is lemongrass and not too overwhelming and very subtle once in your hair. I use my straightener to curl my hair and am used to slight tug and pull. Now it&#x27;s breeze... Zero tug, pull and because my hair just runs through the plates of the straightener now, the time to curl my hair is cut in half. And now to the title of my review... I cannot stop touching my hair! The longer I have been using it, the softer my hair feels. Super silky! When I have curls, I don&#x27;t need any other product to hold the curls throught the day. They are bouncy, shiny, soft and the ends do not feel damaged. I could go on about this product.... I just hope you try it to see if it works for your hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I can&#x27;t imagine doing my hair every morning without! I am actually thinking about ordering more now so that I don&#x27;t ever run put!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, gives great heat protection, no left over greasiness, no stickiness on my hands, love it.  Wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love Crack, I have been using it for two years now, it&#x27;s wonderful for curly hair I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have salt&#x27;n&#x27;peppa colored hair so I need a little extra help with my ends now that there is more salt populating my crown.  This little product, whether on dry or wet hair, helps to replenish hair that has been exhausted or drained by the elements.  I put a dime sized amount on my hair when dry and it comes alive.  When wet I add a nickle dized amount and voila, I&#x27;m good to go!  Great leave-in treatment for all types and grades of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product.  Used before styling, to makes my hair sleek and shiny and frizz free, with lots of body.  You only use a little bit.  Used after styling, it gives your hair a little definition, and for that you use a tiny, tiny bit.  There&#x27;s no stiffness, no feel of having a hair product in your hair.  It took me a couple of tries to get the proper amount, but it&#x27;s been golden since then.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I blow dry straight.  This stuff works great.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a dime sized amount goes a long way.  This helps keep my hair smooth even when it&#x27;s humid or rainy outside.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!! Works instantly!! Good for frizz free curls as well as straight sleek hair! I recommend it to anyone wanting healthy looking shiny hair</li>
            <li> Not sure whats in this but it&#x27;s pretty unbelievable. Results are instant, as soon as the flat iron hits your hair.</li>
            <li> Crack Styling Leave-In Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend gave me a sample to try. It made my hair smooth and easy to style and straighten.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, and everything time I straighten my hair it only last for mmm i would say 2 days before a I had to do some retouch. But with this product is amazing, my hair was silky smooth, didn&#x27;t tangle that much ( I have lonnngg hair) and smells amazing! A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in treatment.  I barely use a flat iron to have smooth silky hair with this product.</li>
            <li> Crack is the best product I ever send on my curly, wiry hair.  It makes my hair smooth, soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Seems to help control frizz in a humid climate but put on too much and it&#x27;s greasy and flat.  Dime size does the trick on baby fine hair but put it on when hair is half damp and blow dry it then a small dap rubbed between palms after drying to smooth the edges that didn&#x27;t get hit before.</li>
            <li> LOVE ... love ... love this product to straighten my curly hair whe blow drying.  It was recommended by my hairdresser.  Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the softness of my hair now. I can really feel the difference in my between this Crack and regular grease.</li>
            <li> So far so awesome! I love the smell of this product and it makes my hair much more shiny and less frizzy after blow drying. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily like with some other products I&#x27;ve tried out.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works without making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this product on my hair, and they don&#x27;t carry it at any local stores or Sally Beauty Supply.  I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> This product definitely holds up to it&#x27;s name! It is addictive. My favorite thing about Crack is that it is not sticky at all. It has the texture of a thicker body lotion crossed with a conditioner. It is not runny; it holds it&#x27;s shape when it comes out of the tube. When you rub it between your fingers, it breaks down into the consistency of a conditioner. It is so non sticky that you can put some on your skin and rub it in and there is no residue left behind. I appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to take time out of my morning routine to wash my hands after I put the Crack product in my hair. If I shower before bed, I can also put the Crack in my hair and not worry about getting my pillow messy. The next morning I wake up to soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crack smells wonderful! It has a fruity smell that leaves my hair smelling fresh. I also noticed that when I use Crack, my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb as many smells from the environment, like cigarette smoke. The smell lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally... The UV protection. The UV protection was the main reason why I bought Crack. I live in Arizona, and the sun does a number on my hair. I enjoy being outside, but forget having a nice die job; the sun will turn it orange in a few days. Crack has helped tremendously in protecting my hair from the sun. Originally, I was just going to use it on days when I was going to be out in the sun a lot. Now it has become my everyday hair product, so I don&#x27;t even have to think about UV protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving Crack 5 Stars. I cannot think of anything negative to say about it. Just a little bit (less than 1/2 a dime size) does the trick, so one tube last me a long time. It is very reasonably priced as well. I am telling everyone about Crack!</li>
            <li> my hair is dry damaged by the ends so i mistakenly rubbed it all over my hair after washing. only place a small amount on the dry ends and that should do the trick. otherwise, it&#x27;s great and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product --- really straightens your hair and with little or no frizz... use just a little on wet hair, blow dry and voila ---- straight no frizz beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, each strand is fine, but I have a lot! It is curly underneath and wavy on top. I was worried when I read previous reviews about using too much, so I used a pea size amount. I flipped my head upside down and used it underneath on my curliest part, then ran my hands over the rest (can&#x27;t say I had any left on there or not). Then I used a blow dryer with a brush. It really worked! My hair is smooth and I barely had to use my straightener. It did not feel greasy or thick or goopy, like some reviews suggested.  Next time I will try some on the top, just the ends and give another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is citrus with a slight smell of professional straightener (like a perm). I didn&#x27;t get that smell after I dried it. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This product makes hair super soft but takes away my natural waves so I only use it when I am going to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I come from a mixed background so my hair is thick, frizzy, curly, and kinky. The first time I used this it was amazing! After shampoo and conditioner I apply this stuff to my wet hair. I noticed no tangles, instant smoothness while I blow dry. After flat ironing, I noticed a little smoking at 340 degrees. Make sure you are in a well ventilated area. I also realized that you may need to apply a little more product before flat ironing, my hair just soaked this stuff up or use a different flat iron protector on the ends. My hair was smoother and less tangled. It was also lightweight and got my hair straighter.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do, do not apply the product again after flat ironing because it weighs down your hair. This is a process that should be only applied to wet hair NOT dry. Another downer is that this product may only withstand humidity for up to 12hours. After that my hair frizzed out but that&#x27;s a real improvement for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough at first, but after continued use realized that my hair took forever to dry when using this, whether blow drying, air drying or a little of each. DOES NOT AT ALL eliminate frizz. Redken Align 12 is a MUCH better product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, takes care o the frizz, and dries much quicker. Sorry, for me this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> It works wonders as I have very thick and dry curls.  I really don&#x27;t have the patience to do deep conditioning for 10 minutes. This is definitely a better substitute.</li>
            <li> The product I received doesn&#x27;t look like the pictured product and the label shows different ingredients. I really wanted the product pictured that I thought I was buying. Will be looking Into getting a replacement. It&#x27;s the one with silver writing and says wheat protein not silk protein on the back.</li>
            <li> I love this product. You need to apply it to damp hair and then blow dry. If you don&#x27;t use it with some heat it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Great smooth result.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have kinky, fine shoulder length hair when straightened and I use a little bit of this with my leave in conditioner. When I say little, I mean pea sized amount or less. I swear by it and so do my friends. It does exactly what it says on the bottle. Just make sure you use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it is not sticky or drying to my hair.  I will reorder it when I run low.</li>
            <li> My beautician always applies Crack to my hair before straightening it, and it is wonderful, I have very long thick course hair and it gets real fuzzy and Crack UV and Thermal Protection stops the fuzzy fly-aways, I love this stuff.  I had to have a tube of my own to use when I style my own hair and I highly recommend Crack Leave-In Treatment for anyone who uses a straightener or blow drying your hair it really does work and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Crack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The product make hair soft and manageable. Helps to keep style longer also. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said everyone in the salon was raving about this new product called Crack (odd name!).  She said it helped keep down the frizz!  I purchased it and have been using the product for about a month now, and it really does work.  You just need to apply a small amount into the palm of your hand, and then run your hands through you hair, and dry as you would normally.  I am very pleased to say, it works!  I have curly, frizzy hair, and my hair has been coming out straight and smooth.  I can&#x27;t wait to see if it works as well in the hot humid summer!</li>
            <li> been using this for years. I have very damaged hair from highlighting /bleaching it. This is the only product that seems to smooth the frizz and makes it look so shiney!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, I have fine hair and it left it kind of greasy, you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> This is the best of this type of product that I&#x27;ve EVER used!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and was worried about it turning green from salt and chlorine. It smells good and works even better. Not an ounce of fade.</li>
            <li> The first time I had this on my hair, my hairdresser put it on me. she said she liked to use it on her client&#x27;s hair and I really liked it on mine so when I saw that I could get it on Amazon for a lot less money than I could have bought it at the beauty salon, I ordered it. I like the way it styles and controls my hair without leaving it stickey or stiff.</li>
            <li> If u need a hair cream to smooth or tame down a bit then this works pretty good so ok</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair normally. I bought this because I recently colored my hair and wanted the UV protection to stop it from fading as quickly. The directions say to use &#x27;a little,&#x27; and it does mean -a little-. I put enough in my first try to get a little on all of my medium-length hair and my hair was so greasy that it looked like it was wet. I tried again last night with much less, and it is less greasy looking but hasn&#x27;t done me any favors otherwise.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a stylist friend of mine. Works  .  Pretty well. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great smoothing product!</li>
            <li> Use this after every shower and it helps my hair stay straightened in humidity and protects my hair from the straightener/blow dryer. I can definitely tell a big difference in my hair when I use this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - though not the best for fine hair.  A friend of mine got this and it was amazing on her beautiful, thick hair. Her hair was a bit dry and this smoothed it out beautifully (and smells so good!).  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try... it is a great product, makes my hair smooth and shiny (and smelling great), but I can only use a tiny amount (like 1/2 a pea) or it overwhelms my wimpy fine hair. I use a couple days a week and only a tiny bit.  Wish I could use more - because it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Both my daughter and I use it everyday.  It protects your hair if you straighten it, makes it very shiny too.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s great for curly hair....my daughter scrunches her hair to bring out the curl...never frizzy!</li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample and was happy I could find it on line. My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> So far this stuff is amazing.  The smell is simply intoxicating and my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. Too thick/greasy. Also way too expensive for a 2oz tube. to the trash it went.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my new found hair dresser had used it on me and I have been using it every since. It works wonders on my dry ends. I have naturally straight sleek hair, but my ends have been damaged from heat products. Much better now.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and absolutely loved it!! I have thick hair that I currently blow dry straight and then use a flat iron on. I like to wash my hair at night and blow dry at night. Usually I use the flat iron to smooth it out even if I&#x27;m just going to bed right after that. That way it&#x27;s still pretty straight when I get up for work the next day and I only need a minute or two with the flat iron again. Well last night I didn&#x27;t need the iron at all... My hair was smooth and silky just after blowing it dry. That NEVER happens. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair product, especially if you apply heat to your hair.Just a little bit in the morning to dry or damp hair lasts all day, makes your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. I think it&#x27;s aptly named, can&#x27;t imagine buying another product for my hair. The only thing with using crack is this; use just a tiny amount. It will make your hair greasy. A little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> I dry my highlighted and fine hair every day. Use only a little bit of this, pea-sized or so. Works great!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist started me off with this stuff and I love it.  It is hard to find in our area so being able to order off Amazon was great.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have relatively straight, agreeable hair. I bought this to use as a heat protectant while flat ironing and a protectant when I went to the pool. I decided on this one because of the RAVE REVIEWS. I thought it would give body, shine, smooth all the frizzies. However, I wasn&#x27;t wowed. It&#x27;s just a really REALLY thick leave in conditioner. If you put in a little to much your hair feels thick and you can&#x27;t easily run your fingers through it. But it does it&#x27;s job, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel......meh.&lt;br /&gt;And for the price, I think it&#x27;s very underwhelming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like crack for my hair! It makes my hair so smooth, it tames my fine wavy hair. It smells so good, and my hair is so soft! I only have to use a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> This cream works fine at protecting my hair and keeping the frizz in check.  However, nowhere on the bottle does it say it has UV protection, which was my main reason for purchasing.  I don&#x27;t even know for sure if it does provide UV protection. I live in a very sunny environment and UV protection for my light hair and scalp is very important. If this product had the guarantee on the bottle and I actually noticed the difference when I used it, then it would get a five-star rating and I would definitely order it again. But as it is, I&#x27;m going to have to try other products to compare.</li>
            <li> i think this would be fine if you used very little and watered it down in your hands.  the smell is a bit overpowering though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Makes straightening your hair a breeze.  I have three kids and not a lot of time - this stuff makes styling my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is prone to split ends and frizz. Most products I try leave my hair feeling greasy, or weighed down. I knew to only use a small amount from the reviews I read, so I use about a dime size for my thick and long hair (a few inches above my waist). I obly apply it half way down to the ends, and when its almost all off my hands I swipe the remainder through my bangs.  My ends look a lot better after I blow dry. It also gives my hair a *little* shine. Usually it takes a little work to get my hair to look like it does after I use this product. While I do think it works, I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;ooohhhh ahhhhh\\&quot; reaction that a lot of reviewers seem to have. At this price I would buy it again, but if I can&#x27;t find it on sale I think I could live without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair is fine, straight and frizzy.  A little amount of Crack and the frizzies are tamed almost completely, but my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down. I&#x27;ve had problems with serums for frizz making my hair look greasy, Crack doesn&#x27;t do this at all.  The thick, non-sticky cream takes down the frizz and my hair remains soft.  It&#x27;s amazing, I&#x27;ve been struggling with frizz forever.  This is THE product for me.  I am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product and was so impressed by the results, I had to get the full size.  It has a silky texture and pleasant, light, fresh scent.  Looks like hand cream coming out of the tube.  The product defines curls without weighing it down.  It&#x27;s something keep in stock (in your hair products cabinet) at all times!</li>
            <li> Good product, smells great, tames and protects hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!!! I went to a new hairstylist and she said I was the perfect candidate for crack. I have very thick, somewhat coarse, frizzy and wavy hair. It has made blow drying so much easier and faster. My hair is not frizzy after blow drying anymore. Crack makes my hair soft, straight and smooth. My hair stylist said I would come back for my crack!!! It is addictive and I can&#x27;t go without it!!! You will LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is truly addicting! It does not make your hair greasy, just soft, healthy and BEAUTIFUL!! Great product! I wish there was a shampoo/conditioner line.</li>
            <li> This hair crack is not for black hair, it took the luster out and left a dull look to my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes your hair feel \\&quot;styled\\&quot; but you have to shampoo a lot more often. Hair feels oily/waxy by the end of the day. Also, must be used on wet hair. Which basically means you should plan to wash you hair twice: before &amp; after using. I&#x27;ve stopped using the product because of this.</li>
            <li> Product was very lumpy and left little gel-balls in my hair.  It also didn&#x27;t have any affect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and this product made it very soft and silky which took most of the body away.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and makes it very shiny.  I will use it as a conditioner but need something that puts more body in it for wearing.  Great product for long hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does what it says. I use just a little after I wash my hair and it lasts all day and smells great.  My hair is long and the humidity makes it frizz beyond control but with this, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  I buy two tubes at a time and I&#x27;m set all summer long.</li>
            <li> Very nice for helping define my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product after all the great reviews, but unfortunately it is not ideal for my fine, thin hair. While it does make my hair look healthier, it takes my already flat hair and makes it look even flatter. Even when I use a very small amount, this product completely weighs down my hair, and I have enough trouble adding volume as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would work well for people with thick and/or curly hair or anyone who can handle a slight loss of volume. If not, I suggest looking to other thermal protection products.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this stuff is incredibly rich! Weighed my hair down in spite of using the tiniest little bit! It&#x27;s difficult to distribute evenly because of the thickness, but I&#x27;ve found that if I add some hot water and pour it into a spray bottle is does a great job of protecting, mending and detangling without being too heavy. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again. The water/product ratio I use is about 50/50.</li>
            <li> I finally have a HG hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about hair products, and I really like this one! I can tell a big difference when I put it on my hair before I blow dry. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to make my slightly wavy fine hair straight.  I have not used this product with heat yet but anticipate that i will get great results,. with blow drying then ironing.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> This product makes me look more like I&#x27;ve been smoking crack -- I have wavy hair, and it appeared really greasy within a short time of using the product.  I was hoping to tame frizzy ends, but wasn&#x27;t expecting the rest of my hair to look oily and limp.  Only used a tiny amount of Crack on clean, wet hair, but that was too much. I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave reviews are about!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would protect my hair from thermal and uv heat and this product did just that! It also leaves my hair soft and shiny. Other products have left my hair greasy but not The CRACK serum.  Totally worth it I&#x27;ve purchased my 3rd bottle already. They do last a long time and little goes a long way! Only bad thing is identook longer than expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is good and i like it. It smells good and it really protect your hair from the heat. Moreover, you can use it as a sunscreen for your hair. But this is not only a heat protector, you can use it to get some volume on your hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used. Really helps with color treated hair, making it feel soft and conditioned. Hair smells so good! I have fine hair and Crack doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel super greasy.  I use only a drop of it and it&#x27;s ok, but still have the at grease feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Just a small drop of this mixed with and a couple of drops of hair oil on wet hair is a perfect mix.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely done well to help with my frizzy hair during humid days and it smells amazing. My stylist used it on my hair originally and ever since I always apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li> Performs as listed and far better than many high end salon brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely becoming a regular hair product for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry wiry hair.....crack has been a Godsend for me..it leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I live in Houston, TX and anyone who lives here knows that the humidty is terrible! You can straighten your hair for hours and as soon as you step outside, forget it! This is the best stuff to control frizz.  It completely blocks the humidity from your hair. A small amount goes a LONG way. Don&#x27;t overdue it. This bottle will last you forever! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for your hair.  It works just like it says it will.  Smells wonderful too!  You can use it on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and white so my hair is somewhat smooth but still could use a nice leave-in treatment for protection. I think this product may be a little heavy for my hair. I use a very small amount (maybe half or a third the size of a tic tac) and focus it on the ends of my medium length hair. A couple of times, I have accidentally applied a bit too much and it results in gross looking hair. The margin of error is very small, so definitely start with very little product and slowly move up.</li>
            <li> Light weight but does the job......only a tiny bit is needed and my hair is long and fine. This is a keeper, ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> Same stuff I pay so much more at the store for.  I&#x27;m satisfied and will order this way again!  Yay</li>
            <li> My stylist questioned the authenticity of this product due to the very low price. In the end, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the real deal or not, as I haven&#x27;t used any other bottles of it, only this one that I purchased thru Amazon, but it works great.  I get complemented a lot on how smooth and straight my hair is. I use this with a Babyliss Pro 1&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> I choose this product as reading the other reviews and listening to my friends who have purchased this product - it sounded so great!&lt;br /&gt;This product so smell awesome and it only takes just a little bit to keep my hair soft. My only peeve with it is if I use just a little bit too much my hair becomes oily looking. It does not give my hair volume as other claim it does but rather it just keeps my hair soft and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product and I would recommend it to a friend who is looking for a good leave in product that does leave your hair smelling great.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of this works amazingly well! My hair was damaged from coloring and felt like straw. This conditioner has made it extremely soft and has stopped the ends breaking off almost completely!  This is also the best price around! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product and I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt; I have short hair and a very little....less than 1/2 a dime...goes a long, long way. If you use more your hair can look greasy (unless you want that look).&lt;br /&gt;It works well with styling with a dryer and/or a curling iron. I highly recommend this product...especially to those with short hair! A+++&lt;br /&gt;AND It smells great!</li>
            <li> was used on my hair at a salon and I loved it...I like it now just don&#x27;t distribute as well as she did.</li>
            <li> Works great but be sure to only use a small amount, it will make hair greasy looking</li>
            <li> This is my must have hair product, along with Tigi Bedhead AfterParty Cream. This stuff smells amazing!!! I wish I could get this scent in a lotion or body spray!!!!!! It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner, I put it throughout my hair after I towel dry it, and it conditions GREAT! Also just a note, this lotion has shimmer/glitter in it!! It&#x27;s subtle and makes hair look great, but wash hands afterwards!!! Favorite product ever!!</li>
