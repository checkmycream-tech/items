            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>I will now buy about 5 more bottle and stock up.</li>
            <li>this item is absolutely lovely.  </li>
            <li>Smelled stronger and more pungent than I thought it would</li>
            <li>, I got it to refresh a patchouli potpourri container that I had! :)</li>
            <li>and i would rate them 2 stars for being ok smell</li>
            <li>it is alot better</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love this Patchouli.</li>
            <li>The pachouli oil was much better.</li>
            <li>i love it when she puts it on</li>
            <li>Love it and can&#x27;t wait to use the bottle for other things when I&#x27;m done with this wonderful scent!</li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and when I saw this I got excited.</li>
            <li>Strong woody , earthy smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent was very strong at first, but after a couple of hours, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li>Besides that little quirk, I&#x27;m very happy and would order again.</li>
            <li>smells rad and is very potent.. highly recommend</li>
            <li>And it is just a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li>The fragrance starts out tart and morphs into a fragrance redolent of the old men&#x27;s cologne Kourous (which I always loved).  </li>
            <li>The oil smells wonderful and it was worth every cent spent for this scent!!</li>
            <li>This small bottle of patchouli oil has a wonderful, earthy-sweet aroma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having my husband try to pry it out with some or another of his tools, because I love the fragrance and am willing to work a bit to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right amount of strong.  </li>
            <li>I just spent lol.</li>
            <li>I have bought Patchouli over 20 years mostly in  healthfood stores or Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>These precious oils come in many different qualities.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to run the top of the cork under hot water before trying to open.</li>
            <li>the bottle broke on me right away, but luckily it didn&#x27;t spill the product.  </li>
            <li>This definitely is not one that I liked.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>You need to soak the area around the sealant in some warm water to loosen it so that you can gently twist the stopper to open.  </li>
            <li>Not only did she love the perfume, but she really loves the bottle!</li>
            <li>The lovely patchouli scent in a gorgeous bottle instead of the standard round or square one?</li>
            <li>I have always been a patchouli fan and one takes a chance when buying as there are so many different varations.  </li>
            <li>i love patchouli and would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li>Be aware that, once opened, this is a stand up bottle.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to others, just be aware that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>Good oil concentrates are pricey and it takes very little to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I have been testing a varity of brands of sandalwood aroma oils and smartly decided to try this Patchouli oil.</li>
            <li>I tipped upside down ( do this first to make sure seal has not broken) then placed in hot water</li>
            <li>This was it , finely after trying 3 different oils I found the real patchouli sent</li>
            <li>Alone, it is the classic fragrance I love, and because it is an oil, it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>My sister in Texas is a Patchouli fan and is very picky on the scent.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely yummy.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other brands and this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is unique but a little challenging to open if you do not read the instructions thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I put a little on the back of my neck and on my chest and smell good all day at work.  </li>
            <li>Decent, considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its easy to find patchouli oil its hard to find the one that smells like true patchouli.</li>
            <li>The wax seal on the bottle was confusing until I found the paper tucked in the box that tells you to run the seal under warm water until you can twist the stopper out...</li>
            <li>For me right now I still like Spiritual Sky and NOW brand.</li>
            <li>Oil dark and strong.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, and the bottle is very intricate and delicate.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and found no problem with this oil (always a plus).</li>
            <li>This one was one of the ones from the second day and it was the first item to arrive.</li>
            <li>Excited to try some of the other scents from this company.</li>
            <li>Then I took the Qtip dipped in the hot water and squeezed out any water and ran the tip inside the rim to remove any left over wax this seemed to work well</li>
            <li>Smells good, subtle yet lasting.</li>
            <li>the bottle is the best part but very difficult to open with the wax seal.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood purified is not going to be clear as this oil was almost clear.  </li>
            <li>All this coming from an old patch head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m and aromatherapist and didn&#x27;t really think I&#x27;d get quality essential oil here</li>
            <li>the wax had loosen enough that I (with pairing knife) gently loosened the peeled wax from outer neck which enabled me to pull off the wax and remove dabber(top) .</li>
            <li>This was absolutely my fault in being too hasty to open.  </li>
            <li>I have been let down by many other kinds until now.</li>
            <li>The bottle makes up for it though, since I can probably refill it with my usual oil once the original oil is gone.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a little tricky to open I recommend having a preferably long wooden Qtip and a small pairing knife handy along with a glass of hot water!  </li>
            <li>Just a small dab to the insides of the wrists, and behind the ears, along with your favorite cologne, makes your fragrance uniquely yours.  </li>
            <li>Finally got the bottle open and it STUNK TO HIGH</li>
            <li>At first appearance I was not overly impressed with the &amp;#34;cute little bottle&amp;#34; it was thin glass and a little uneven.</li>
            <li>I was not careful enough and broke the glass at the point where the stopper and neck meet as well as the foot.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of patchouli I have been wearing the last 5 years and was unable to get the same kind.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not a masculine scent by any means.  </li>
            <li> The wax seal on mine was inside the long neck as well as around the edge.</li>
            <li> The last bottle I bought it was a little different.</li>
            <li> I mixed a little Now brand with the newer formula Spiritual Sky</li>
            <li> so I took another dry Qtip</li>
            <li> This is basically a deep patchouli essential oil in a fancy glass bottle: you will either love or hate the scent.</li>
            <li> bottle is also fairly small, so that, along with the short \\&quot;life\\&quot; of the scent, makes me expect it not to last</li>
            <li> Might not last 24 hours, but will last at least 12.  </li>
            <li> Came faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since cleaned the bottle  and rinsed it with alcohol and dried it and refilled it with an essential oil perfume blend.</li>
            <li> This oil had no smell other than motor oil smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using patchouli since 1969,I&#x27;m not sure what brand back then.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very fragile bottle that is capped with was around the small stopper.</li>
            <li> When I tried to release the stopper, the delicate glass broke and sliced my finger wide open and spilled the oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> broke in transit thin glass and patchouli stained my front porch terracotta tile was apparently damaged but left for dead on doorstep</li>
            <li> Bottle extremely breakable!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and the smell was of classic patchouli but was very weak</li>
            <li> The scent is not very strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough as the glass vial is very delicate.  </li>
            <li> Stinks... thanks for the reminder to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so not to waste the $</li>
            <li> I would recommend with the caveat to be very careful when removing the cap of this bottle so that you do not end up working as hard to use the fragrance as I have.  </li>
            <li> , however one small piece ended up in the perfume</li>
            <li> I can still use the oil as none got spilled, but the vial I have to position upright in a small box with the stopper inserted.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but Fancy Glass Bottle was broken in shipping so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So delicate that it broke within a couple months of me having it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if I received one that was just bad or not I sent this item back.</li>
            <li> But once I got it and actually smelled it, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what was in the bottle; it vaguely smelled of patchouli.</li>
            <li> The odor or scent was weak.  </li>
            <li> After awhile you will get confused on even knowing what you like.</li>
            <li> The base of the bottle was crooked, and it never sat flat on the shelf I had it on, and one day it fell off the shelf and the base of the bottle shattered.</li>
            <li> is very weak</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> Part of the plastic stopper remained stuck in the neck of the bottle, making it nearly impossible to use the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> is bad</li>
            <li> I hated the Patchouli oil, smelled nothing like I thought it was going to.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this perfume, not only for the perfume, but for the bottle,too.  My sister in Texas is a Patchouli fan and is very picky on the scent.  Not only did she love the perfume, but she really loves the bottle! Thank-you soooo much for making her birthday a very happy one! Tom&#x27;s Incense and Amazon.com are my heroes!</li>
            <li> My wife has had a lot of patchouli oils over many years, and she ranks this the best.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected.  Love it</li>
            <li> I have been testing a varity of brands of sandalwood aroma oils and smartly decided to try this Patchouli oil. The sandalwood oil by Song of India I rated the best of all the brands I tried. It is no wonder I find the Patchouli oil by Song of India to be awesome also. I would definately buy this brand again. The aroma is sweet and delicious.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The bottle is cute and reusable. The oil smells wonderful and it was worth every cent spent for this scent!! Great product! Will order again.</li>
            <li> A nice scent of patchouli. The bottle is unique but a little challenging to open if you do not read the instructions thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely yummy. Patchoulli lovers will love this one.</li>
            <li> Bottle extremely breakable! Great scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered four items shipped through Amazon, two one day and two the next. This one was one of the ones from the second day and it was the first item to arrive. The shipping was super fast. The bottle arrived intact and unopened. The wax seal on the bottle was confusing until I found the paper tucked in the box that tells you to run the seal under warm water until you can twist the stopper out... I just used my fingernail to pull the wax seal off.  As to the actual oil... it smells divine. I&#x27;m picky about my patchouli and this stuff is great. I also have very sensitive skin and found no problem with this oil (always a plus). The only thing I&#x27;d say is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger \\&quot;all day\\&quot; as some have said. I can say that with surety because patchouli is a scent that tends to cling to me for over 24 hours. I&#x27;ve put some on before and gotten a shower that night to find the scent of it still lingering... this one fades dramatically after about 12 hours. But it&#x27;s still very nice. Love it.</li>
            <li> At first appearance I was not overly impressed with the &amp;#34;cute little bottle&amp;#34; it was thin glass and a little uneven. However, I remind myself I&#x27;m buying what&#x27;s inside. Be sure to run the top of the cork under hot water before trying to open. As soon as I removed the stopper I could smell the patchouli. This was it , finely after trying 3 different oils I found the real patchouli sent I was after. Strong woody , earthy smell I love. Its easy to find patchouli oil its hard to find the one that smells like true patchouli. I have been wearing this sent for 20 years. I ran out of patchouli I have been wearing the last 5 years and was unable to get the same kind. I have been let down by many other kinds until now. I will now buy about 5 more bottle and stock up. 5 stars all the way. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love patchouli, and when I saw this I got excited. The lovely patchouli scent in a gorgeous bottle instead of the standard round or square one? I was totally in. But once I got it and actually smelled it, I was a bit disappointed. The scent is not very strong in my opinion. It&#x27;s still a great smell, but not as strong as I had hoped for. The bottle makes up for it though, since I can probably refill it with my usual oil once the original oil is gone.</li>
            <li> This small bottle of patchouli oil has a wonderful, earthy-sweet aroma.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I hated the Patchouli oil, smelled nothing like I thought it was going to. And it is just a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> the bottle is nice. I have bought Patchouli over 20 years mostly in  healthfood stores or Whole Foods. ie. product brand &amp;#34; NOW&amp;#34;essential oils. I bought this based on the reviews posted here. however when I got it .. its not the smell I am used too . across the board tthe scent should be the same. but this is not even the scent.</li>
            <li> I have always been a patchouli fan and one takes a chance when buying as there are so many different varations.  This definitely is not one that I liked.</li>
            <li> This product would have received five stars if it had worked properly when I tried to open it.  Part of the plastic stopper remained stuck in the neck of the bottle, making it nearly impossible to use the fragrance.  I&#x27;m having my husband try to pry it out with some or another of his tools, because I love the fragrance and am willing to work a bit to use it.  The fragrance starts out tart and morphs into a fragrance redolent of the old men&#x27;s cologne Kourous (which I always loved).  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - it&#x27;s not a masculine scent by any means.  I would recommend with the caveat to be very careful when removing the cap of this bottle so that you do not end up working as hard to use the fragrance as I have.  Besides that little quirk, I&#x27;m very happy and would order again.</li>
            <li> this item is absolutely lovely.  the bottle broke on me right away, but luckily it didn&#x27;t spill the product.  i love patchouli and would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> luck luck luck !!!  everywere i go thats i was looking for finaly i got it here in amazon&#x27;s #1</li>
            <li> This oil had no smell other than motor oil smell. Im not sure if I received one that was just bad or not I sent this item back.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Girlfriend and she said, &amp;#34;I know, right.&amp;#34; which means good.  She is an aging hippie type and she loves the reminiscent aroma.</li>
            <li> not the great patchouli scent I am used to. the bottle is the best part but very difficult to open with the wax seal.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  The glass bottle is a beautiful addition to my vanity table, but the fragrance is sumptuous!  Just a small dab to the insides of the wrists, and behind the ears, along with your favorite cologne, makes your fragrance uniquely yours.  Alone, it is the classic fragrance I love, and because it is an oil, it lasts a long time.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but Fancy Glass Bottle was broken in shipping so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle!  Smelled stronger and more pungent than I thought it would but after a time, it smells really good!  I didn&#x27;t get this for &#x27;perfume&#x27;, I got it to refresh a patchouli potpourri container that I had! :)</li>
            <li> smells rad and is very potent.. highly recommend</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and the smell is awesome! I keep the bottle at work &amp; have recieved compliments on the smell and the bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and the smell was of classic patchouli but was very weak i have bought of a coupld of song of india products and im starting to think theyre quality is bad i have bought some india temple incense a patchouli solid perfume and this bottle and i would rate them 2 stars for being ok smell is very weak but my mom loved the bottle and i would recommend the nandita patchouli it is alot better but the thing is that these smells can evaporate or lose potency with prolonged storage</li>
            <li> GREAT SCENT. PEOPLE ASK WHAT IT IS ALL THE TIME!  ▄▀▄▀ █▓▒░ 1ST CLASS ░▒▓█ ▀▄▀▄</li>
            <li> Love it and can&#x27;t wait to use the bottle for other things when I&#x27;m done with this wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Decent, considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent was very strong at first, but after a couple of hours, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.  Definitely smells like patchouli though, that&#x27;s for sure.  Be aware that, once opened, this is a stand up bottle.  AKA, you CANNOT store this on its side (such as in a purse), or it will leak.  &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the scent lasted longer, but for the price, I feel I got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also fairly small, so that, along with the short \\&quot;life\\&quot; of the scent, makes me expect it not to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others, just be aware that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my fancy glass Patchouli,, received and couldn&#x27;t wait to open my package. Finally got the bottle open and it STUNK TO HIGH HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smelt like motor oil with a touch of Patchouli.  It sits in my medicine cabient and I will never use it.  IT Stinks... thanks for the reminder to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;I would never order Patchouli, through Amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to Vitamin Cottage and bought Patchouli and others can smell it and it smells like Patchouli and it&#x27;s organic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER ORDER THIS FANCY GLASS..Because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The seller was great,arrived fast,shipped in very secure box.Now as for the Oil.I have been using patchouli since 1969,I&#x27;m not sure what brand back then.Started back wearing it about 16 years ago,since then it&#x27;s been Spritual Sky.I found it was a brand I liked and it was cheap,also had compliments all of the time.It reminded me of what I used back in the day.Then I started trying different brands here recently.Someone wrote stating Spiritual Sky have changed there formula.The last bottle I bought it was a little different.I have tried patch oils  by Plant Life,and NOW brands 100% oils,they are both very good,very heavy.Got my bottle of Song of India today and for &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; I do not like it.Here&#x27;s my collusion of patch oils,bottom line is no matter what you read in any review,on any oil,you have to find what you like best.experiment.I find that easier not spending alot money.After awhile you will get confused on even knowing what you like.For me right now I still like Spiritual Sky and NOW brand.I mixed a little Now brand with the newer formula Spiritual Sky and I am happy.Song of India is different not for me, but maybe for you.All this coming from an old patch head. Keep on trying.  Michael.</li>
            <li> My three stars go to the bottle. I&#x27;m and aromatherapist and didn&#x27;t really think I&#x27;d get quality essential oil here and I was right. I&#x27;m not really sure what was in the bottle; it vaguely smelled of patchouli. I&#x27;ve since cleaned the bottle  and rinsed it with alcohol and dried it and refilled it with an essential oil perfume blend. Pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I want more more more!!! My favorite scent!! Thank You for introducing Song of India to me.  Buy it and try it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this Patchouli. I wish it was a spray.</li>
            <li> These precious oils come in many different qualities.  Sandalwood purified is not going to be clear as this oil was almost clear.  The odor or scent was weak.  Good oil concentrates are pricey and it takes very little to do the job.  The pachouli oil was much better.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very fragile bottle that is capped with was around the small stopper. When I tried to release the stopper, the delicate glass broke and sliced my finger wide open and spilled the oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Smells good, subtle yet lasting. Don&#x27;t know what else to say except that is a good value for the money,</li>
            <li> wonderful gift and quality for special gift ideas. Oil dark and strong. No problem getting the wax seal off. Great!</li>
            <li> This is just the right amount of strong.  Might not last 24 hours, but will last at least 12.  I put a little on the back of my neck and on my chest and smell good all day at work.  I have tried a few other brands and this one is the best so far.  And for $12, it is a great product.  Excited to try some of the other scents from this company.</li>
            <li> this is a great perfume oil gave it to my gf i love it when she puts it on it smells really good on her</li>
            <li> broke in transit thin glass and patchouli stained my front porch terracotta tile was apparently damaged but left for dead on doorstep</li>
            <li> This is basically a deep patchouli essential oil in a fancy glass bottle: you will either love or hate the scent. The bottle is a little tricky to open I recommend having a preferably long wooden Qtip and a small pairing knife handy along with a glass of hot water!  The wax seal on mine was inside the long neck as well as around the edge. I tipped upside down ( do this first to make sure seal has not broken) then placed in hot water it took 2 attempts about 1-2 minutes total the wax had loosen enough that I (with pairing knife) gently loosened the peeled wax from outer neck which enabled me to pull off the wax and remove dabber(top) . Then I took the Qtip dipped in the hot water and squeezed out any water and ran the tip inside the rim to remove any left over wax this seemed to work well, however one small piece ended up in the perfume so I took another dry Qtip got the piece and some perfume which I spread on my wrist- so not to waste the $ I just spent lol. Worked well hope this helps someone one the fence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this beautiful little item a 5-star rating as it arrived in perfect condition, the container is lovely, and the scent I bought (Patchouli) is very nice and not overpowering.  I wanted to write a review to caution those that purchase this item to use great care in removing the sealant!  This I can&#x27;t stress enough as the glass vial is very delicate.  You need to soak the area around the sealant in some warm water to loosen it so that you can gently twist the stopper to open.  I was not careful enough and broke the glass at the point where the stopper and neck meet as well as the foot.  This was absolutely my fault in being too hasty to open.  I can still use the oil as none got spilled, but the vial I have to position upright in a small box with the stopper inserted.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and the bottle is very intricate and delicate. So delicate that it broke within a couple months of me having it. The base of the bottle was crooked, and it never sat flat on the shelf I had it on, and one day it fell off the shelf and the base of the bottle shattered.</li>
