    <ol>
            <li>(BEST!!!!), eye cream and a balancing serum.</li>
            <li>is awesome since it is being soaked up by your skin and into your blood stream!    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work or represent Suki in any way; I am just a very happy customer.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best moisturizers I have found.  </li>
            <li>This is the best!</li>
            <li>IMPRESSED does not even begin to describe how I feel about this line.  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found since.</li>
            <li>Great for night night nourishment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a great product…just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;balancing&#x27; oil is amazing and smells delightful..</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>But my girlfriend who suggested it has GORGEOUS skin</li>
            <li>It is soothing without being too greasy and it smells good.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>but I still love it!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing &amp; makes my skin radiant.</li>
            <li>Not to say I don&#x27;t eat at MickeyD&#x27;s every once in awhile or love a good cheeto.</li>
            <li>I liked the balancing day one</li>
            <li>the moisture rich cleansing lotion works great as a cold/hot cream.     </li>
            <li>Suki makes great products and the ones I have tried have been worth the money.</li>
            <li>I admit, I was worried about putting oil on my face, but it soaks right in and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Suki about four years ago and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford this many products get the day moisture and oil and use a toner you have at home (without alcohol).</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers work for a couple weeks then</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love Suki products.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the exfoliating foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this oil smells, but even better the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I do live in the arid great basin, so</li>
            <li>as well it smells better than this one, but for me and my needs this is a better fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, smells pretty nice and earthy.</li>
            <li>It doesnt absorbas easily and again..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved using essential oil treatments since my 30&#x27;s but the company that I really liked was bought out (Natus).</li>
            <li>By far the most favorite skincare product I own and have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>There will be many products that they recommend but not all are required right away.  </li>
            <li>First time to try this one, its perfect for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to really hydrate those fine lines and give me a glowy youthful look.</li>
            <li>All of the products, including the pure facial moisture have a nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I found that the products really are specific to different skin types by trial and error, but switching to my \\&quot;prescription has been the best combination for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Then expand as you also fall in love with the feeling and nourishment of the natural vegan suki products.  </li>
            <li>I hope you give suki a try as it is a great company that is trying to champion the use of real products with minimal processing.  </li>
            <li>It is nice enough to use in both the winter and the summer and doesn&#x27;t leave one feeling too oily.  </li>
            <li>So far its ok</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin is super soft and the oil feels so light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Now I have a nice rotation of cleanser, toner, intensive brightening cream, pure facial moisture</li>
            <li>Ok - my rating obviously is 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li>, we&#x27;ll keep using and make more comments later on..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what it did to my skin after even first use.</li>
            <li>It is soft, smooth, skin tone is even and it is glowing.</li>
            <li>pure nourishing has not caused any problems.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any anti-aging effects yet</li>
            <li>Absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much difference it makes</li>
            <li>I very distinctive smell you have to get used to...</li>
            <li>In full disclosure I do not wear makeup on a daily basis, so I am not often cleaning away products or pulling on my face.  </li>
            <li>I personally try to reduce contact with as many processed chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it directly from Suki next time during their buy one get one free sale</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be odd since it&#x27;s an oil, but it blends right in right away.  </li>
            <li>Finally, it has a subtle, pleasant fragrance that not linger.      </li>
            <li>This oil helps balance out my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love most Suki profucts but the smell of this oil is hard for me to get past.</li>
            <li>The pure facial moisture is the first oil I have used on my face that soaked right in and provided instant relief to dry skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the facial moisture would be too heavy for my skin, but it goes on really light.  </li>
            <li>I find I go through the brightening cream and pure facial</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft not greasy.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, it is nothing like greasy, it is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would start with a cleanser, toner, pure facial moisture (night oil) and a day cream and no other synthetic products.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment if you value your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this oil despite trying out other &amp;quot;organic&amp;quot</li>
            <li>You use a very small amount 1-2 drops for most people, remember to apply while skin is still moist.</li>
            <li>The fine lines which started in my late 20&#x27;s are now gone from my forehead, brow, eyes and mouth at age 35.</li>
            <li>It has actually cleared up old scars and helps keep blemishes at bay.</li>

            <li> As for use, spray your tonic and while skin is still wet, rub one or two drops of oil in it.</li>
            <li> I use it after being outside on a cold winters day and right after the gym and sauna and feel refreshed and non-oily on both occasions.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little sticker shocked by the number of products I would need at $25-$75 a pop.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all you need!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past that.</li>
            <li> Thesmell is awful (although it does go away quickly After applcation)</li>
            <li> The Suki line is the bomb but a bit expensive</li>
            <li> This product has a somewhat rancid smell, like a dirty ashtray.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an idea how it would work on skin and was afraid it would make my face oily and greasy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s probably a great product…just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  But my girlfriend who suggested it has GORGEOUS skin and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love most Suki profucts but the smell of this oil is hard for me to get past. The &#x27;balancing&#x27; oil is amazing and smells delightful.. Ordered this &#x27;nourishing&#x27; oil by mistake but decided to keep it.. It doesnt absorbas easily and again.. Thesmell is awful (although it does go away quickly After applcation)</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Suki about four years ago and fell in love.  At first I was a little sticker shocked by the number of products I would need at $25-$75 a pop.  Now I have a nice rotation of cleanser, toner, intensive brightening cream, pure facial moisture (BEST!!!!), eye cream and a balancing serum. I find I go through the brightening cream and pure facial moisture the fastest which makes sense because my skin craves them!      The pure facial moisture is the first oil I have used on my face that soaked right in and provided instant relief to dry skin. I use it after being outside on a cold winters day and right after the gym and sauna and feel refreshed and non-oily on both occasions.  The fine lines which started in my late 20&#x27;s are now gone from my forehead, brow, eyes and mouth at age 35. I am often told I look \\&quot;so young\\&quot; and I think suki since 31 has definitely been a factor. In full disclosure I do not wear makeup on a daily basis, so I am not often cleaning away products or pulling on my face.  On the occasions that I wear mascara, eyeliner and foundation the moisture rich cleansing lotion works great as a cold/hot cream.     I recommend visiting the suki website and getting your skin type \\&quot;prescription\\&quot;.  I found that the products really are specific to different skin types by trial and error, but switching to my \\&quot;prescription has been the best combination for my skin.  There will be many products that they recommend but not all are required right away.  I would start with a cleanser, toner, pure facial moisture (night oil) and a day cream and no other synthetic products. If you can&#x27;t afford this many products get the day moisture and oil and use a toner you have at home (without alcohol). Then expand as you also fall in love with the feeling and nourishment of the natural vegan suki products.  I especially appreciate the vegan minimal processed ingredients.  I often think as I am using them, \\&quot;I could eat this and not call poison control or drink charcoal!\\&quot;Which is awesome since it is being soaked up by your skin and into your blood stream!    I hope you give suki a try as it is a great company that is trying to champion the use of real products with minimal processing.  I don&#x27;t work or represent Suki in any way; I am just a very happy customer.  I am a research scientist in oncology and with cancer rates on constant rise I personally try to reduce contact with as many processed chemicals as possible.  Environment is the largest factor in cancer. Not to say I don&#x27;t eat at MickeyD&#x27;s every once in awhile or love a good cheeto. I just try to keep down the high chemical and processed contents in everyday products and your face and hair products are used every day.    Ok - my rating obviously is 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have found.  I admit, I was worried about putting oil on my face, but it soaks right in and feels great.  I do live in the arid great basin, so I don&#x27;t know if it would soak in as well in a humid conditions.  I also have sensitive skin.  Most moisturizers work for a couple weeks then cause breakouts or reddening.  Suki pure nourishing has not caused any problems.  Finally, it has a subtle, pleasant fragrance that not linger.      Suki makes great products and the ones I have tried have been worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel. It has actually cleared up old scars and helps keep blemishes at bay. I don&#x27;t really see any anti-aging effects yet but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Have used this off and on for several years but recently, started using it again regularly. It is nice enough to use in both the winter and the summer and doesn&#x27;t leave one feeling too oily.  Absorbs really well. Just a few drops is all you need! Well worth the investment if you value your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this oil despite trying out other &amp;quot;organic&amp;quot; products that may be cheaper. This is the best!</li>
            <li> By far the most favorite skincare product I own and have ever tried.  I received a sample of this which is how I heard about it. The morning after I put it on, my skin was just glowing.  I immediately went out and bought it and have been using it for months.  I LOVE it.  I thought it would be odd since it&#x27;s an oil, but it blends right in right away.  I wear it under make-up almost daily and my skin never feels oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much difference it makes</li>
            <li> I use this lotion along with the facial oil.  It is soothing without being too greasy and it smells good.</li>
            <li> My daughter does demos of this product and turned me onto it. My hairdresser noticed the difference in my skin with out me saying a word. I Am 57. The Suki line is the bomb but a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Very hydrating for my super dry skin. Love Suki products. My favorite is the exfoliating foaming cleanser.  This oil helps balance out my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> So far its ok but i dont notice any difference as yet, we&#x27;ll keep using and make more comments later on..</li>
            <li> Wife use regularly thank you</li>
            <li> I started using the Suki skincare line for acne prone/oily skin about a month ago. IMPRESSED does not even begin to describe how I feel about this line.  All of the products, including the pure facial moisture have a nice, light fragrance.  At first, I thought the facial moisture would be too heavy for my skin, but it goes on really light.  While I&#x27;ve had one or two pimples pop up, just one dab of the cleansing clay at night clears them up instantly.  My face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  This line is not cheap, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First time to try this one, its perfect for my dry sensitive skin. I liked the balancing day one as well it smells better than this one, but for me and my needs this is a better fit.</li>
            <li> This item moisturizes my skin well without making it oily. I will buy it directly from Suki next time during their buy one get one free sale, it&#x27;s cheaper then.</li>
            <li> This product has a somewhat rancid smell, like a dirty ashtray. I couldn&#x27;t get past that.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil smells, but even better the way it makes my skin feel. When I wake up in the morning my skin is super soft and the oil feels so light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved using essential oil treatments since my 30&#x27;s but the company that I really liked was bought out (Natus). This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found since. You use a very small amount 1-2 drops for most people, remember to apply while skin is still moist. It helps tah essential oils to absorb in and spreads it the way it should. Great product. My skin looks about 10 -15 years younger when I use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, smells pretty nice and earthy. I have dry to combination skin. Breaks me out sometimes. I was looking for a product to really hydrate those fine lines and give me a glowy youthful look. Not as good as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been using Suki products for several years, but never tried facial oil. I didn&#x27;t have an idea how it would work on skin and was afraid it would make my face oily and greasy.Indeed, it is nothing like greasy, it is soft and moisturized. I should have tried this earlier. I can&#x27;t believe what it did to my skin after even first use. It is soft, smooth, skin tone is even and it is glowing.Oil has herbal smell which I personally like. As for use, spray your tonic and while skin is still wet, rub one or two drops of oil in it.</li>
            <li> Great for night night nourishment! I very distinctive smell you have to get used to...</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I tried a friends and I was hooked. Smells amazing &amp; makes my skin radiant.</li>
