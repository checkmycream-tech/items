            <li>This product is perfect for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not oily as well.</li>
            <li>Barrier repair is great to use during the course of a day in order to make your skin look fresh and glowing.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica and has found it helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is water-free, as you may have noticed, and it goes on more like a make-up primer than anything else.</li>
            <li>If there are parts of your face that are drier than others (for me, it&#x27;s the skin around my nostrils), you&#x27;ll still need to put on a more moisturizing moisturizer (like a lotion) to hydrate the skin in that area.</li>
            <li>Love most Dermalogica products, despite their cost.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a night cream, over their toner, and love it.</li>
            <li>It was not my favorite.</li>
            <li>from the first time i tried it I loved it.</li>

            <li>Feels light as a feather.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry skin silky smooth and even when I wake in the morning my skin still feels great.  </li>
            <li>With the price I would expect a more consistent result.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Bonus of buying thru amazon, you save a significant amount of money versus buying from a spa, salon, or boutique.</li>
            <li>I started using this underneath my moisturizers and my skin has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This product in particular of the UltraCalming line is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I like these products better and the lotion is thick, which is nice on when the face is damp after cleansing because it lets the lotion sink it better.</li>
            <li>I love pretty much everything else in the calming line.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and not goopy, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very light on my face like it&#x27;s baby soft.</li>

            <li>I use this product as the first of two layers of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Sealed and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and clear and disappears - no greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>It makes the face feel smooth and soft and protects as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was delivered at a reasonable speed and it does exactly what the label claims.</li>
            <li>pretty much works for my 12-14 hour day.</li>
            <li>Although I bought this bottle, I&#x27;m still using the tiny sample from the travel kit and after a month, its almost still full!  </li>
            <li>It really does help keep my skin smooth and not dry.  </li>
            <li>My face looks and feels so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really repairs any of my blemishes though.</li>
            <li>it is so much cheaper than the spa.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even believe how much my skin has improved since I&#x27;ve started using Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>It really feels protective on my face and soothes and flare ups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very calming.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>good for sensitive skin that is prone to small break outs.  </li>
            <li>My close family asked if I started seeing a new dermatologist!</li>
            <li>I have walked away from this product a year ago because I thought the price was a little high, but after trying various other moisturizers, this works the best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, most products either burn my skin (leaving red blotches on my face for days) or it dries out my skin (oddly enough.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GOOD, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>Its quick to dry and doesn&#x27;t leave you with greasy skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I recommended for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This helps the redness only slightly, but it makes my skin very smooth and refreshed looking.</li>
            <li>( sensitive)</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so silky soft and if used sparingly its not greasy either.</li>
            <li>Im 64 yrs old</li>
            <li>anytime i travel, or am sensitive to anything, i apply this line and immediately inflammation improves</li>
            <li>Takes only a tiny bit and covers a large surface.</li>
            <li>Only need a little ,skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels like it absorbs on first contact, and therefore you&#x27;re not sure if it&#x27;s smoothing over your whole face.</li>
            <li>Not sure because it is so unlike a standard moisturizer in terms of how lightly it spreads.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for people with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Did a great job to help my dry and flaky skin especially during cold winters.</li>
            <li>the only cream that  has worked well for my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Too little, too much?</li>

            <li> Too little, too much?</li>
            <li> I like the finish it gives and qill definitely be using it for a long time</li>
            <li> Foundation and other makeup just glides easily over my skin after a thin layer of application of the Demalogica Barrier Repair.  </li>
            <li> Been using the product for years as a base to my liquid makeup (allow you to use much less of this pore clogging foundation) and it&#x27;s been great for repelling pollution too.</li>
            <li> other products I would find my skin was oily and red by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have t-zone oil and slight eczema on my eyes so finding a product that works is a constant challenge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Must use everyday and night and get a facial with demalogica</li>
            <li> Redness minimal and no acne.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also makes the makeup go farther as I have to use less of it since the foundation just glides over it.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin if pretty damaged from the cold weather</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema and the product has cleared up some trouble areas on my face but it also made other trouble areas worse/</li>
            <li> If you have bad skin or just want to use something to protect your skin from damaging, this is the right product to use.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have to worry about uneven foundation application or having makeup streaks on my face!</li>
            <li> Giving it only 4 stars because I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> When I put Barrier Repair on, I almost imagine a shield going up around my face because it protects me from everything that my skin normally reacts badly to.</li>
            <li> I also bought the much less expensive Aveeno ultra calming foaming face cleanser ($10)and lotion ($15).</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how well this works!</li>
            <li> no matter how difficult!</li>

            <li> Excellent stuff, will be even more useful when winter starts and skin gets drier.</li>
            <li> Just started using Dermalogica Barrier and it&#x27;s wonderful.  My face looks and feels so soft and fresh. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a sample in an Ultracalming product sample pack with the cleanser, masque, serum concentrate and spray mist. It was a great deal to try it at $40 or so. I bought this product because I am on a number of medications that make my skin red and blotchy in the cheeks.     I love this product because it is so silky smooth and goes on really well under makeup making it an ideal barrier between the skin and makeup as well. It also makes the makeup go farther as I have to use less of it since the foundation just glides over it.    I also bought the much less expensive Aveeno ultra calming foaming face cleanser ($10)and lotion ($15). I like these products better and the lotion is thick, which is nice on when the face is damp after cleansing because it lets the lotion sink it better. Aveeno also has a masque, which I have not tried yet.     I only score it a 4 because of the cost.    Please also see my review of the Dermalogica UltraCalming Serum Concentrate - [[ASIN:B003QDAZAI Dermalogica UltraCalming Serum Concentrate - 1.7 oz]]</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not oily as well. I don&#x27;t think it really repairs any of my blemishes though.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my skin feel really smooth and velvety.  Foundation and other makeup just glides easily over my skin after a thin layer of application of the Demalogica Barrier Repair.  A little goes a long way and I no longer have to worry about uneven foundation application or having makeup streaks on my face!</li>
            <li> My niece told me about this product because we have the same skin type. ( sensitive) from the first time i tried it I loved it. Makes your skin feel so silky soft and if used sparingly its not greasy either. Wonderful moisturizer, the only one that I will use.</li>
            <li> My go-to when recovering from an allergic reaction causing atopic dermatitis/eczema breakouts.</li>
            <li> It was delivered at a reasonable speed and it does exactly what the label claims. I&#x27;ve been using it for three years now and I will never stop. It&#x27;s perfect for on-the-go and works wonders with your skin- no matter how difficult!</li>
            <li> love it ! it is so much cheaper than the spa. It makes your skin very smooth and stops the irritations.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin feels wonderfully smooth and makeup flows on easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dermalogic products for about 23  years and they are wonderful in keeping skin youthful and moist.  Barrier repair is great to use during the course of a day in order to make your skin look fresh and glowing.  Must use everyday and night and get a facial with demalogica products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kept my skin looking amazing.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for years as a base to my liquid makeup (allow you to use much less of this pore clogging foundation) and it&#x27;s been great for repelling pollution too.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry skin silky smooth and even when I wake in the morning my skin still feels great.  Im 64 yrs old and this is the only product that does this for me.  I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with irritation.  will buy again</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema and the product has cleared up some trouble areas on my face but it also made other trouble areas worse/no change. With the price I would expect a more consistent result.</li>
            <li> love this product. the only cream that  has worked well for my sensitive, dry skin. easy to apply and not goopy, smooth and soft. love it.</li>
            <li> I adore this product. Takes only a tiny bit and covers a large surface. Also great for sunburns!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of Barrier Repair.  Looks like Vaseline but it is so light and not greasy!  Great for sensitive skin (I have acne/rosacea).</li>
            <li> love this!!!!!!!!!! anytime i travel, or am sensitive to anything, i apply this line and immediately inflammation improves</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My skin looks so smooth and feels so healthy when I use it.mi have dry skin prone to redness. This helps the redness only slightly, but it makes my skin very smooth and refreshed looking. I use it after the mist. They work best in combination.</li>
            <li> I have t-zone oil and slight eczema on my eyes so finding a product that works is a constant challenge.&lt;br /&gt;I find something that works and as soon as the seasons change, I have to start looking again.&lt;br /&gt;With other products I would find my skin was oily and red by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;This pretty much works for my 12-14 hour day. A little goes a long way. Although I bought this bottle, I&#x27;m still using the tiny sample from the travel kit and after a month, its almost still full!  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin that is prone to small break outs.  this item is pricey but good for barrier repair. does what it advertised</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Feels light as a feather.  I saw an instant change in my skin.  Redness minimal and no acne.  I have combination skin where moisturizer lotions can clog pores and cause breakouts.  Like this gel alternative.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I can&#x27;t even believe how much my skin has improved since I&#x27;ve started using Dermalogica. I am going to be using this stuff forever! When I put Barrier Repair on, I almost imagine a shield going up around my face because it protects me from everything that my skin normally reacts badly to. I can&#x27;t wait to get all my friends hooked on Dermalogica as well!</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how well this works! My close family asked if I started seeing a new dermatologist! Its quick to dry and doesn&#x27;t leave you with greasy skin. This has immediately been added to my morning arsenal. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I like the finish it gives and qill definitely be using it for a long time</li>
            <li> So I feel like I like this product, but I don&#x27;t quite understand if I&#x27;m using it correctly. Too little, too much? Not sure because it is so unlike a standard moisturizer in terms of how lightly it spreads. It feels like it absorbs on first contact, and therefore you&#x27;re not sure if it&#x27;s smoothing over your whole face. Odd.</li>
            <li> My skin if pretty damaged from the cold weather and I also have sun damage on my skin.  I started using this underneath my moisturizers and my skin has improved tremendously.  It really does help keep my skin smooth and not dry.  If you have bad skin or just want to use something to protect your skin from damaging, this is the right product to use.</li>
            <li> Only thing that helps my rosacea.  Giving it only 4 stars because I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Use it sometimes on my kids when they have a healing abrasion.</li>
            <li> the product is very good and does what it states it will  - not a  well know brand. but should be recognized</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel like silk. It is the best product I have ever used! I highly recommend it, though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only need a little ,skin feels smooth. I put it on first then I put on my makeup. I put it on at night before I go to bed. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica and has found it helps my rosacea. This product in particular of the UltraCalming line is my favorite. It really feels protective on my face and soothes and flare ups. My mom even borrows it and uses it under her eyes if her allergies have been bothering her and her eyes are puffy. It&#x27;s very calming.</li>
            <li> I have walked away from this product a year ago because I thought the price was a little high, but after trying various other moisturizers, this works the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light on my face like it&#x27;s baby soft. Did a great job to help my dry and flaky skin especially during cold winters.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin product ever!  It nourishes and protects unlike any product I have tried.  My red prone skin is soothed instantly.  I recommended for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  My skin is not oily anymore so don&#x27;t have to worry about zits.</li>
            <li> I love dermalogica ! I have been using their product line for 14 yrs. I am never disappointed. This is the first product i put on my face after it&#x27;s been cleaned and after hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, most products either burn my skin (leaving red blotches on my face for days) or it dries out my skin (oddly enough.) I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica products for about a year now, and it works great and I have never had a reaction to this product. I definitely recommend for people with extremely sensitive skin. Bonus of buying thru amazon, you save a significant amount of money versus buying from a spa, salon, or boutique.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Dermalogica fan, but this moisturizer isn&#x27;t very impressive. It&#x27;s GOOD, but it&#x27;s not great.I love pretty much everything else in the calming line. This moisturizer is water-free, as you may have noticed, and it goes on more like a make-up primer than anything else. If there are parts of your face that are drier than others (for me, it&#x27;s the skin around my nostrils), you&#x27;ll still need to put on a more moisturizing moisturizer (like a lotion) to hydrate the skin in that area. The benefits are that it&#x27;s definitely non-greasy and lightweight. The 1 ounce tube lasts me about two months, using it every morning.</li>
            <li> For a while i&#x27;d have some problems with my chin. Its been red and i had a lot of pimples. Using barrier repair UNDER the serum concentrate the redness dissapeared after a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  I use this product as the first of two layers of moisturizer.  I really like it and it does not make my face break out.</li>
            <li> Sealed and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great purchase and service</li>
            <li> Love most Dermalogica products, despite their cost.  I use this as a night cream, over their toner, and love it. Goes on smooth and clear and disappears - no greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as it was supposed to be. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> It was not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Barrier repair is a must for daily skin care!  It makes the face feel smooth and soft and protects as well.  I wear it under make-up for a smoother look.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it for even one day!  Thanks!</li>
