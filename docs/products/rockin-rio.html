            <li>This  is a great Summer fragrance wish it had better lasting power.</li>
            <li>Smells too strong...like bathroom spray...definitely unwearable sprayed on my self too strong...sprayed on pillow still too strong...</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite fragrance ever!!!!</li>
            <li>I went on amazon and found it 10.00 cheap than the store I was in.</li>
            <li>Defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes a light scented perfume.</li>
            <li>If you like fruity fresh scents, this is the perfume for you!  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I could find a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was a good price for the larger size bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fresh, clean and makes you feel happy!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The scent fades away super quick.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent its so sweet and fresh and reminds me if a tropical summer day I get lots of compliments on what my perfume is .</li>
            <li>When I heard that escada was bringing back my all time favorite perfume ever Rockin Rio, I knew I had to repurchase it immediately!</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and I am fairly certain it is authentic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and playful and reminds me of being a teenager.</li>
            <li>But designer more high end fragrances I don&#x27;t think they are real.</li>
            <li>I was a fan when it first came out years ago.  </li>
            <li>So glad escada rio is back.</li>
            <li>10 years ago i stumbled upon this beauty and instantly knew it was love.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a problem when I first started wearing these fragrances in 2003</li>
            <li>Better grab one fast because they sell out and who knows if it&#x27;s coming back again!</li>
            <li>Not distinquishable scent really....</li>
            <li>I however do believe fragrances by celebrities maybe the real deal.</li>
            <li>it is very energizing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet very fruity scent that I just can&#x27;t get enough and always get compliments on.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>My husband picks out my perfume, he has a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>Similar to the previous rock in rio, but with a new and fresh touch!</li>
            <li>this new bottle smelled the regular ones.</li>
            <li>some said the new packaging is different sent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more money but keep smelling good for at least have of the day and not 30 minutes. :(</li>
            <li>I just barely found out that Escada brought back Rockin Rio again!  </li>

            <li> I just barely found out that Escada brought back Rockin Rio again!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real fragrances.</li>
            <li> Because it is a lighter fragrance it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some others, but I think that is the nature of lighter, summery scents.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear it I get complements and the smell lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I passed it the other day in the store, i had to do a double take.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long 10 years without it!  </li>
            <li> Not all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from amazon and not one of the other sellers.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve made due over the years with other perfumes, but none came close to Rockin Rio!  </li>
            <li> I was sad when Escada discontinued it several years ago and was elated when I saw that they had brought it back.</li>
            <li> but I guess Escada has changed their formula a little bit.</li>
            <li> it everyday....</li>
            <li> was not sure about this ...</li>
            <li> Usually the small bottles cost that.  </li>
            <li> I will wear everyday!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s discontinued, and hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but my wife (who wears it) and I are not happy with the fragrance</li>
            <li> So imagine my disappointment when i realized it had been discontinued!  </li>

            <li> I love this perfume and it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> was not sure about this ... but when i got it in and my wife used it... great!!</li>
            <li> It came on time..my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I was a fan when it first came out years ago.  I just barely found out that Escada brought back Rockin Rio again!  It&#x27;s a sweet very fruity scent that I just can&#x27;t get enough and always get compliments on.  Better grab one fast because they sell out and who knows if it&#x27;s coming back again!</li>
            <li> Not all what I expected. Will never wear it. Said it smells like a pina colada...it doesn&#x27;t. Not distinquishable scent really....just....chemicals. Yuck</li>
            <li> I love this spray!  Whenever I wear it I get complements and the smell lasts for a long time.  I was so glad I could find a large bottle.  My husband and I think it smells like fruit or mangoes.</li>
            <li> I seen this in a store and had to have it. I went on amazon and found it 10.00 cheap than the store I was in. Totally love the smell. So glad escada rio is back.</li>
            <li> 10 years ago i stumbled upon this beauty and instantly knew it was love.  I wore it all the time and always got comments.  So imagine my disappointment when i realized it had been discontinued!  I was devastated!  i&#x27;ve made due over the years with other perfumes, but none came close to Rockin Rio!  When I passed it the other day in the store, i had to do a double take.  This couldn&#x27;t be the same one coud it?  So I smelled, and smelled, and smelled and realized my eyes did not deceive me!  Rockin Rio is back!  I am so excited!  It is a light, fruity, flirty, and sexy fragrance and i will be stocking up while I can!  Please keep this scent out!  It&#x27;s been a long 10 years without it!  (Also, for those of you living overseas like me, it seems like they only ship it to America, and no FPO/APO boxes!)</li>
            <li> Smells too strong...like bathroom spray...definitely unwearable sprayed on my self too strong...sprayed on pillow still too strong...my sis thought it smelt good in bottle then I sprayed it and she started coughing and left the room</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite fragrance ever!!!! I will never purchase anything outside of Escada when buying perfume.  It&#x27;s so delicious!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! The perfume arrived on time and is a great deal!!! I&#x27;d definitely get this product again. It smells great and is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the prices from frangance.net but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real fragrances. I won&#x27;t be buying anymore scents from the company I however do believe fragrances by celebrities maybe the real deal. But designer more high end fragrances I don&#x27;t think they are real. This  is a great Summer fragrance wish it had better lasting power.</li>
            <li> If you like fruity fresh scents, this is the perfume for you!  I was sad when Escada discontinued it several years ago and was elated when I saw that they had brought it back.</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite perfume for the Summer.  It just puts me in the best mood and the smell of it is out of this world. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it.  Its between a great drink and summertime fruit.  Its the best!</li>
            <li> I love Escada&#x27;s Rockin Rio, Sunset Heat and Island Kiss, this big bottle of perfume was about 35 bucks which is an awesome price!  Usually the small bottles cost that.  I have a very sensitive nose and these three Escada scents do not give me a headache at all, great seller and a great product!</li>
            <li> Loved it! What a great scent! Similar to the previous rock in rio, but with a new and fresh touch! I will wear everyday!</li>
            <li> Escada makes the best fragrances. The price was good on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent its so sweet and fresh and reminds me if a tropical summer day I get lots of compliments on what my perfume is . It shipped quickly and was a good price for the larger size bottle</li>
            <li> This perfume smelled much better in the store than it does from the bottle we purchased. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but my wife (who wears it) and I are not happy with the fragrance and we both seem to be somewhat allergic to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a bottle of Escada EDT in this size. I have always loved Escadas special edition scents because I always wore them while visiting my family in Hawaii and now it makes me think about the islands with every spritz. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who likes tropical and fruity types of scents. The only thing that bugs me is the lasting power of the fragrance because it wears off in about an hour. This wasn&#x27;t a problem when I first started wearing these fragrances in 2003 but I guess Escada has changed their formula a little bit. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great perfume!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my wife and she loves it</li>
            <li> Smell great! I love it. Saprena</li>
            <li> I was so happy Escada &amp;#34;remade&amp;#34; this fragrance...had so many compliments about it.&lt;br /&gt;It is fresh, clean and makes you feel happy!&lt;br /&gt;Love it everyday....it is very energizing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My husband picks out my perfume, he has a sensitive nose. I love this scent. It&#x27;s fun and playful and reminds me of being a teenager. The scent stays all day, as does all my Escada frangrances. I will wear this all summer!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious but it only lasts about 30 minutes.  I won&#x27;t buy a perfume on Amazon anymore because i&#x27;ve had the same luck with several perfumes. The scent fades away super quick.  I&#x27;d rather pay more money but keep smelling good for at least have of the day and not 30 minutes. :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s discontinued, and hard to come by. this new bottle smelled the regular ones. some said the new packaging is different sent but I didn&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Great light fruity scent - both my daughter and I get a LOT of compliments when we wear it.  Very large bottle - great purchase</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Arrived quickly. Very light citrus smell. Great price for bottle size. Defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes a light scented perfume.</li>
            <li> Great summer fragrance! Will order again. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when using this fragrance. I highly recommend this fragrance! Awesome</li>
            <li> I ❤️❤️❤️ the way this smells...perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> When I heard that escada was bringing back my all time favorite perfume ever Rockin Rio, I knew I had to repurchase it immediately! I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s an amazing fruity and sweet fragrance and it smells like all of the best summer fruits into one bottle! If you like fruity, you&#x27;ll LOVE this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a friend but couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores. I ordered it from amazon and not one of the other sellers. It shipped fast and I am fairly certain it is authentic. Because it is a lighter fragrance it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some others, but I think that is the nature of lighter, summery scents. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
