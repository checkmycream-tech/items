            <li>The material is very soft and the print is so cute!!!</li>
            <li>Looks adorable on my kitty loving friend.</li>
            <li>Silky and soft with a wonderful drape, this is more of a &amp;#34;fashionable accessory scarf&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;keep</li>
            <li>Soft/smooth fabric &amp; cute print.</li>
            <li>I bought this more for fashion purposes</li>
            <li>For the price I feel satisfied :-)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>We love scarfs.  </li>
            <li>I love cats and gave this as a gift too.  </li>
            <li>They also love the scarf.</li>
            <li>Matches most of my outfits and it&#x27;s not an infinity scarf</li>
            <li>This scarf is way better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>really light but keeps you warm.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been more then a month.</li>
            <li>It arrived as said, so I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>If you are a cat lover or just like cute scarves this is for you.  </li>
            <li>She claims it got her a promotion at work :)</li>
            <li>Love the colors and cat print, but I do wish that they were longer &amp; a bit thicker material.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite scarves, and i have many.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Wish I had got more than one.</li>
            <li>Love these scarfs give as gifts and every one loves them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m having a great time playing with the options---check &amp;#34;personal video&amp;#34; sites for inspiration---that longer scarves allow and, all things considered, I&#x27;m as happy with this scarf as I am those in my other orders.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, and very soft.</li>
            <li>Super cute scarf with kitties on it!</li>
            <li>but despite that ALL ARRIVED a good bit SOONER than the first date of each span</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, but ok for the price.  </li>
            <li>It actually is pretty warm if you keep it layered and bunched up.</li>
            <li>Ends weren&#x27;t done properly but beautiful fabric</li>
            <li>Super pleased.</li>
            <li>It is super cute, and I wish I&#x27;d gotten one for myself as well.</li>
            <li>I love this scarf its so soft and cute!</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and</li>
            <li>I was wearing one and my friend liked it so much</li>
            <li>And the delivery from Asia was smooth</li>
            <li>Great for daily wear.</li>
            <li>I love having fun with my clothes</li>
            <li>I was excited for this item because of how cheap it was plus its a light scarf with cats :</li>
            <li>So light and soft, the design is adorable, wrap around once or twice, super cute look with a dress or leather jacket.</li>
            <li>other wise it&#x27;s really cute .</li>
            <li>Feels soft and she liked that.</li>
            <li>Good birthday present for cat people.</li>
            <li>Amazon has such good prices on scarfs.  </li>
            <li>here(at least it was for me), but the material is good and it&#x27;s super cute :)</li>
            <li>Beautiful print of cats on black background.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s super cute, it did have a bit of a funky smell, but once removed from package and aired out a bit, it is just fine.</li>
            <li>seriously, this scarf IS perfect.</li>
            <li>Ships quick.</li>
            <li>Super cute scarf, a decent size</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and such a cute scarf!!</li>
            <li>Super cute super soft!</li>
            <li>Such an adorable scarf!</li>
            <li>Just a great little scarf for the price.</li>
            <li>Must look close to see the playful kittys and its a fun scarf.</li>
            <li>This took a while to get, but is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and it adds that extra bit of fun but doesn&#x27;t go over the top.</li>
            <li>the exception of one scarf which was shorter than I expected which limited its use somewhat, all are attractive and of good quality, especially CONSIDERING THEIR PRICE.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Anyone buying these scarves should be aware there&#x27;s going to be a wait</li>
            <li>time I received one parcel from overseas containing the majority of the scarves on the order---admittedly all bunched together in a paper shipping envelope but individually packaged in cellophane---and all arrived safely with no ironing required before wearing.  </li>
            <li>Only issue is that there was a lot of static</li>
            <li>Its silky and just as pretty as the picture</li>
            <li>(Im pretty sure the third will be in tomorrow), so the shipping was a lot quicker than estimated.</li>
            <li>I ordered another exact same one, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Thin and light, perfect to add a little extra to any top, could be a bit longer...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain I won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>so far has been holding up pretty well!</li>
            <li>I really like this scarf</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And the quality is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and has a cat pattern all over it.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>However, I did purchase them from a different seller, but I couldn&#x27;t find the original seller I purchased them from</li>
            <li>In stores you&#x27;d probably pay the same price to buy all three of them for only one plus you get free shipping!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I thought pretty fast, actually.</li>
            <li>Very soft material.</li>
            <li>It has a silky feel to it, very soft.</li>
            <li>and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>I am pretty skeptical of most the items from China available on Amazon because they tend to get bad reviews.. however this scarf is great.</li>
            <li>expected to wait several weeks before placing each order because of what other reviewers experienced, along with the span of the projected arrival dates given when the scarves were actually shipped.  </li>
            <li>Shipping took about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks, but that&#x27;s pretty dang fast considering it&#x27;s coming from the other side of the world.</li>
            <li>This scarf is so soft.</li>
            <li>soft material</li>
            <li>The fabric is amazingly soft and billowy... and has cats on it.</li>
            <li>is far and I been patient</li>
            <li>Completely recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li>Cute, but not as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the scarf is very thing, but it&#x27;s long so it can be wrapped a number of times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to leave this blanket review for the 3 orders of scarves, that I purchased from different sellers for myself and a friend a few weeks ago, because there were many and my experience overall applies to all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thin material, so it&#x27;s OK for spring/summer.</li>
            <li>very pretty..should have bought other colors also</li>
            <li>I ordered all three colors available (beige, pink, &amp; black) only 10 days ago, and two out of three came in today</li>
            <li>i wear this everywhere, work, dinners, social events, etc</li>
            <li>but i rubbed it down with a dryer sheet a few times and it was fine.</li>
            <li>but once it was open and unfolded, it was ready-to-wear with barely a wrinkle(!).</li>
            <li>I do better with the infinity scarfs or the long thin ones like this one.</li>

            <li> Anyone buying these scarves should be aware there&#x27;s going to be a wait</li>
            <li> time I received one parcel from overseas containing the majority of the scarves on the order---admittedly all bunched together in a paper shipping envelope but individually packaged in cellophane---and all arrived safely with no ironing required before wearing.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is that there was a lot of static</li>
            <li> Its silky and just as pretty as the picture</li>
            <li> (Im pretty sure the third will be in tomorrow), so the shipping was a lot quicker than estimated.</li>
            <li> I ordered another exact same one, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Thin and light, perfect to add a little extra to any top, could be a bit longer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain I won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> so far has been holding up pretty well!</li>
            <li> I really like this scarf</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And the quality is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and has a cat pattern all over it.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> However, I did purchase them from a different seller, but I couldn&#x27;t find the original seller I purchased them from</li>
            <li> In stores you&#x27;d probably pay the same price to buy all three of them for only one plus you get free shipping!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I thought pretty fast, actually.</li>
            <li> Very soft material.</li>
            <li> It has a silky feel to it, very soft.</li>
            <li> and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> I am pretty skeptical of most the items from China available on Amazon because they tend to get bad reviews.. however this scarf is great.</li>
            <li> expected to wait several weeks before placing each order because of what other reviewers experienced, along with the span of the projected arrival dates given when the scarves were actually shipped.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks, but that&#x27;s pretty dang fast considering it&#x27;s coming from the other side of the world.</li>
            <li> This scarf is so soft.</li>
            <li> soft material</li>
            <li> The fabric is amazingly soft and billowy... and has cats on it.</li>
            <li> is far and I been patient</li>
            <li> Completely recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> Cute, but not as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the scarf is very thing, but it&#x27;s long so it can be wrapped a number of times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to leave this blanket review for the 3 orders of scarves, that I purchased from different sellers for myself and a friend a few weeks ago, because there were many and my experience overall applies to all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin material, so it&#x27;s OK for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> very pretty..should have bought other colors also</li>
            <li> I ordered all three colors available (beige, pink, &amp; black) only 10 days ago, and two out of three came in today</li>
            <li> i wear this everywhere, work, dinners, social events, etc</li>
            <li> but i rubbed it down with a dryer sheet a few times and it was fine.</li>
            <li> but once it was open and unfolded, it was ready-to-wear with barely a wrinkle(!).</li>
            <li> I do better with the infinity scarfs or the long thin ones like this one.</li>
            <li> the only downside was it took to long to receive.</li>
            <li> lesser quality than expected</li>
            <li> This scarf was exactly as expected, and it arrived much earlier than was estimated.</li>
            <li> The remainder followed not too long afterwards, either singly or with 2 or 3 in a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seams are a little crooked, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I thought it was white and black.  </li>
            <li> a little short, but cant complain because of the price....</li>
            <li> Item was received as expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was worried by some of the other reviews, but I found no flaws.</li>
            <li> This is tan and black.  </li>
            <li> I bougth this scarf in cream and black.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few of them to give as door prizes to one of our events.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, Not fluffy like the photo at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say bad is that it has a bit of a smell to it but its not very off-putting</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thin in material but</li>
            <li> Especially for a crazy cat lady like me.</li>
            <li> It is really thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I lost it in a restaurant.</li>

            <li> Very cute scarf and I look forward to wearing this later on.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and such a cute scarf!! Such a great deal and so far has been holding up pretty well!</li>
            <li> very pretty..should have bought other colors also</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Soft/smooth fabric &amp; cute print.</li>
            <li> lesser quality than expected</li>
            <li> This scarf is so soft. I absolutely love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I bought this more for fashion purposes so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to keep me warm or anything. It actually is pretty warm if you keep it layered and bunched up. I am giving this item 5 stars because it is adorable, comfortable, and perfect for every season.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! soft material</li>
            <li> Thin and light, perfect to add a little extra to any top, could be a bit longer...</li>
            <li> I really like this scarf it&#x27;s a little thin in material but other wise it&#x27;s really cute . For the price I feel satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> This is not a scarf to keep you warm - it is a fashion statement .  An accessory to your outfit.  Very Cute.  I ordered a few of them to give as door prizes to one of our events.  I was wearing one and my friend liked it so much I took it off my neck and gave it to her. :)  she was so happy.</li>
            <li> Cute kitty scarf!!!! Very soft material. Great buy. Fashionable and people think it&#x27;s so cute! I reccomend this scarf it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I bought this scarf as a give away at Christmas time for my sisters. We love scarfs.  Any kind of scarf is perfect for us.  The cat print is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Looks adorable on my kitty loving friend.</li>
            <li> It is really thin. I like the print, just not the material or the amout of material. It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I was worried by some of the other reviews, but I found no flaws. I love cats and gave this as a gift too.  They also love the scarf.</li>
            <li> I love it! the cat pattern is so cute! I&#x27;m so sad that I lost it in a restaurant. I ordered another exact same one, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> This scarf is cute! Perfect for my excentric cat-lady costume! It&#x27;s a thin material, so it&#x27;s OK for spring/summer. The seams are a little crooked, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Shipping took about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks, but that&#x27;s pretty dang fast considering it&#x27;s coming from the other side of the world.</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these - one for me and one for my mom as a &#x27;thank you for everything&#x27;/just-because type of gift. It came in the tiniest package I&#x27;ve ever received in the mail but once it was open and unfolded, it was ready-to-wear with barely a wrinkle(!). Very stylish and chic.</li>
            <li> Ohmigosh. This scarf is PURR-FECT!! (See what I did there?)&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this scarf IS perfect. Especially for a crazy cat lady like me. ;)</li>
            <li> For the price this is really just awesome. The fabric is amazingly soft and billowy... and has cats on it. I ordered another very similar one in beige as well. Super pleased. And the delivery from Asia was smooth and I thought pretty fast, actually.</li>
            <li> The scarf is nice. Beautiful print of cats on black background. I have a good impression of this scarf although I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use it yet.</li>
            <li> Super cute scarf with kitties on it! Matches most of my outfits and it&#x27;s not an infinity scarf so there are tons of different ways to wear it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. She loves cats and this was perfect for her. Great material and quality. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It is always nice to see a stocking stuffer for Christmas is enjoyed by my cat loving child. This gift was wore all day.</li>
            <li> This scarf is way better quality than I was expecting. The material is very soft and the print is so cute!!! No smell to it or anything like that. I would highly recommend this item :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to leave this blanket review for the 3 orders of scarves, that I purchased from different sellers for myself and a friend a few weeks ago, because there were many and my experience overall applies to all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to wait several weeks before placing each order because of what other reviewers experienced, along with the span of the projected arrival dates given when the scarves were actually shipped.  Anyone buying these scarves should be aware there&#x27;s going to be a wait but despite that ALL ARRIVED a good bit SOONER than the first date of each span given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I received one parcel from overseas containing the majority of the scarves on the order---admittedly all bunched together in a paper shipping envelope but individually packaged in cellophane---and all arrived safely with no ironing required before wearing.  The remainder followed not too long afterwards, either singly or with 2 or 3 in a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of one scarf which was shorter than I expected which limited its use somewhat, all are attractive and of good quality, especially CONSIDERING THEIR PRICE.  Had these been pricey scarves I would have never ordered several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I&#x27;m having a great time playing with the options---check &amp;#34;personal video&amp;#34; sites for inspiration---that longer scarves allow and, all things considered, I&#x27;m as happy with this scarf as I am those in my other orders.</li>
            <li> Such an adorable scarf! really light but keeps you warm. Only issue is that there was a lot of static but i rubbed it down with a dryer sheet a few times and it was fine.</li>
            <li> This is tan and black.  I thought it was white and black.  It&#x27;s cute for the price though!</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter who is 13 and likes cats.  It&#x27;s nothing special, but ok for the price.  Feels soft and she liked that.</li>
            <li> Ends weren&#x27;t done properly but beautiful fabric</li>
            <li> I was excited for this item because of how cheap it was plus its a light scarf with cats :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT,.........I never received the scarf and it&#x27;s been more then a month. I sended a email to the seller and haven&#x27;t heard anything. I&#x27;m certain I won&#x27;t get it. I understand where the package is coming from is far and I been patient but now I don&#x27;t bother checking the mail anymore.so purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Great scarf, feels good, looks good and can&#x27;t beat the price...just buy it!</li>
            <li> This scarf was exactly as expected, and it arrived much earlier than was estimated. As others have said, the scarf is very thing, but it&#x27;s long so it can be wrapped a number of times. Great product for this price!</li>
            <li> Super cute super soft! Great for daily wear. Nice construction</li>
            <li> Item was received as expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> I bougth this scarf in cream and black. The price is incredible... And the quality is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times since I got it. It has a silky feel to it, very soft. It arrived as said, so I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Ships quick.</li>
            <li> If you are a cat lover or just like cute scarves this is for you.  Very lightweight and has a cat pattern all over it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this item as a Christmas gift. She claims it got her a promotion at work :)</li>
            <li> Love very light dainty and beautiful  for cat lovers</li>
            <li> I am pretty skeptical of most the items from China available on Amazon because they tend to get bad reviews.. however this scarf is great. Its silky and just as pretty as the picture and I also recieved it in only a couple of weeks. The only thing I can say bad is that it has a bit of a smell to it but its not very off-putting</li>
            <li> I ordered all three colors available (beige, pink, &amp; black) only 10 days ago, and two out of three came in today (Im pretty sure the third will be in tomorrow), so the shipping was a lot quicker than estimated. However, I did purchase them from a different seller, but I couldn&#x27;t find the original seller I purchased them from so I just thought I&#x27;d post my review on here. These scarves are so adorable! Love the colors and cat print, but I do wish that they were longer &amp; a bit thicker material. They can wrap once around the neck. The price is amazing! In stores you&#x27;d probably pay the same price to buy all three of them for only one plus you get free shipping! Completely recommend for everyone. (These aren&#x27;t meant for keeping you warm in winter)</li>
            <li> Beautiful, and very soft. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality, arrived quickly, every cat fan should have it!</li>
            <li> It showed up and she liked it. Good birthday present for cat people.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scarves, and i have many. the price is just an added bonus! its on the thinner side.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a cousin, and she LOVED it. It is super cute, and I wish I&#x27;d gotten one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> I like solid scarfs or two color scarfs.  I just started wearing them and kind of went nuts.  This one was a great price and is beautiful. Amazon has such good prices on scarfs.  I do better with the infinity scarfs or the long thin ones like this one. The cats make a nice design without making me look like a crazy cat lady.  You would have to look closely to see the cats. This is the softest scarf I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Must look close to see the playful kittys and its a fun scarf. Can be worn in several different ways.</li>
            <li> Cute! I sewed the ends together and now I wear it as an infinity scarf.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably order another one in white.</li>
            <li> I love this scarf its so soft and cute! I get a lot of compliments :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Super cute scarf, a decent size and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> Great scarf for cat lover.</li>
            <li> So light and soft, the design is adorable, wrap around once or twice, super cute look with a dress or leather jacket. i wear this everywhere, work, dinners, social events, etc</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here(at least it was for me), but the material is good and it&#x27;s super cute :)</li>
            <li> Silky and soft with a wonderful drape, this is more of a &amp;#34;fashionable accessory scarf&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;keep you warm scarf.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift and was very happy with it.  My friend loved it.  I would buy another in cream also.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd scarf that matches the tan one I bought.  I love having fun with my clothes and it adds that extra bit of fun but doesn&#x27;t go over the top.</li>
            <li> Just a great little scarf for the price.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. Wish I had got more than one. Really good size.</li>
            <li> a little short, but cant complain because of the price....</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s super cute, it did have a bit of a funky smell, but once removed from package and aired out a bit, it is just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, Not fluffy like the photo at all.</li>
            <li> Love these scarfs give as gifts and every one loves them. Very nice size and fabric is very nice.</li>
            <li> This has received numerous compliments - It was a gift for my friend and she loves wearing it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, my friend loved it. the only downside was it took to long to receive.</li>
            <li> Cute, but not as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This took a while to get, but is worth the wait.</li>
