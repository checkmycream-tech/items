            <li>/&gt;It makes for a nice complement to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Turn it on and it works, what a concept :).</li>
            <li>Love this for taking out seams when sewing quilts.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>

            <li>Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>This little tool is great for &amp;#34;unsewing&amp;#34; while I&#x27;m quilting.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, especially for traveling!!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, after about 1-year of usage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still be using the first one, but, can you say Grand-kids?</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, it stopped working</li>
            <li>The products came in a sealed blister so you know you are getting it &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34;  Delivery was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>well... not to much to say..</li>
            <li>Love this little item.  </li>
            <li>I love this little clipper.  </li>
            <li>This new design corrects the switching problem with a slide &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; which locks it in either position.  </li>
            <li>so maybe Wahl is having a new company manufacture the blade?</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the blade does dull a bit more quickly than it used to</li>
            <li>BATTERY OPERATED.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: VERY LOUD.</li>
            <li>It comes with several length adapters for trimming your beard/mustache, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for \\&quot;large area\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Smaller and much quieter, but if you take your time, you COULD give yourself a buzz with it.</li>
            <li>Changed from the old one.</li>
            <li>: loud, no cover to protect the blades</li>
            <li>then the next day the first one developed the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Needed a clipper small and compact, primarily for sideburns.</li>
            <li>small, takes batteries, batteries last long, not to sharp but good enough to get a decent beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little trimmer does that job VERY well indeed!!</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this product (10 years old) which had worked extremely well</li>
            <li>BUT this one is the noisiest of them all (which I don&#x27;t care for) and isn&#x27;t near as sharp or good at cutting as the previous ones of the same brand and model that were years older.</li>

            <li> One for sewing room and the other for the traveling case.</li>
            <li> Price was right, but I bought it for cutting the threads under an unwanted embroidery.  </li>
            <li> TYPICALLY WE HAVE TO REPLACED IT EVERY YEAR.</li>
            <li> I shopped all over trying to find this little jewel..</li>
            <li> This little gem is every bit a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but for no longer than it takes to trim the noise doesn&#x27;t matter at all.</li>
            <li> This makes the job of cutting threads so much easier.</li>
            <li> just after 30 days has past I contacted seller and they advice to contact Wahl for the 1yr warranty.</li>
            <li> but the only flaw was you always accidentally turn the trimmer &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; because of the toggle switch being in the wrong location.  </li>
            <li> A little tough to get used to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the switch malfunctioned and you had to hold it down on the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position to make it work.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and unable to replace because product is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> cause I bought it to replace the broken one I&#x27;d been using for probably 10+ years.</li>
            <li> Unable to start trimmer.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Wahl home hair cutting products for decades saving thousands in hair cuts for me and our 4 sons.</li>

            <li> Bought one and it worked for a few days so we elected to buy a second.  It was DOA and then the next day the first one developed the same problem.  Switch was broken and there was a distinct rattle inside.  Returned both for full refund.</li>
            <li> Price was right, but I bought it for cutting the threads under an unwanted embroidery.  It didn&#x27;t work for me for that purpose</li>
            <li> Works great, simple and easy to use for light trims. It&#x27;s funny, after about 1-year of usage I never think about using it. It just sits in a Chinese tea cup on the bathroom sink counter I use for various things like this (I&#x27;m a guy, not much overhead). Turn it on and it works, what a concept :). I use rechargeable batteries, so every often it gets a battery refresh.</li>
            <li> I shopped all over trying to find this little jewel.. I knew I&#x27;d like it, cause I bought it to replace the broken one I&#x27;d been using for probably 10+ years. I&#x27;d still be using the first one, but, can you say Grand-kids? Great little trimmer. Kinda like those barber shop shears mini version. Smaller and much quieter, but if you take your time, you COULD give yourself a buzz with it. ;)</li>
            <li> Love this for taking out seams when sewing quilts.  Yes, quilter&#x27;s make mistakes!  Have two.  One for sewing room and the other for the traveling case.</li>
            <li> Construction quality is not the best, but for the price it may be appropriate. It will get the job done for trimming sideburns. It comes with several length adapters for trimming your beard/mustache, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for \\&quot;large area\\&quot; jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes for a nice complement to the [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, it stopped working just after 30 days has past I contacted seller and they advice to contact Wahl for the 1yr warranty. Wahl didn&#x27;t ask for proof of purchase, all I paid was shipping and I received product within 3weeks. FYI, I happened to cut my hair with this trimmer and it took a while but it did the job.</li>
            <li> Needed a clipper small and compact, primarily for sideburns. This was perfect.</li>
            <li> This works fantastically as a seam ripper.</li>
            <li> Works great on your mustache. Only problem is the on/off switch. Changed from the old one. A little tough to get used to.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Wahl home hair cutting products for decades saving thousands in hair cuts for me and our 4 sons. This little gem is every bit a quality trimmer. I recently switched from Norelco shavers to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; saving DE razor,brush and all which means I now needed a trimmer for over my ears and such. This little trimmer does that job VERY well indeed!! It&#x27;s a little noisy but for no longer than it takes to trim the noise doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Oh yes, This product REALLY needs frustration free packaging!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it used at a quilting retreat for ripping out seams!  Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Love this little item.  Travels easy.  Keeps the hair line neat and clean.  From previous experience, I can say that they have a long life.  Bought them before, and will buy again when I need to replace the clipper.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have ordered. The 1st one I ordered was for taking out seams when I sew. But is super great for trimming neck hair!!! Did not use for sewing but use it for trimming my husband hair!! This was bought for my son who likes the convenience of this trimmer, so this was part of Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Nice trimmer, especially for traveling!!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tool that I have bought in along time. I must explain I did not buy it for trimming hair.  I use it for seam ripping in the sewing world. One needs to look on uTube to see how it works. This makes the job of cutting threads so much easier. But one has to be careful. It will cut material. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Awesome little trimmer! Perfect.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this product (10 years old) which had worked extremely well but the only flaw was you always accidentally turn the trimmer &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; because of the toggle switch being in the wrong location.  Unfortunately the switch malfunctioned and you had to hold it down on the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position to make it work.  So I decided to order two of these (one for home and one for travel).  This new design corrects the switching problem with a slide &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; which locks it in either position.  This product is great since you can travel on the road and trim your hair or beard with a normall &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery (I use a rechargeable lithium).  The products came in a sealed blister so you know you are getting it &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34;  Delivery was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> well... not to much to say.. it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Defective. Unable to start trimmer.  Very disappointed and unable to replace because product is no longer available.  Cannot rate product in use.</li>
            <li> I love this little clipper.  I use it to trim my dachshund&#x27;s paws and it works fantastic.  The only downside is that the blade does dull a bit more quickly than it used to so maybe Wahl is having a new company manufacture the blade?</li>
            <li> This little tool is great for &amp;#34;unsewing&amp;#34; while I&#x27;m quilting. It&#x27;s the same shaver as the one that is also sold for quilting, but this one costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these I&#x27;ve had over the years and I&#x27;ve loved them BUT this one is the noisiest of them all (which I don&#x27;t care for) and isn&#x27;t near as sharp or good at cutting as the previous ones of the same brand and model that were years older.</li>
            <li> WE BUY THESE FOR SHAVING MY HUSBANDS HEAD TWICE PER WEEK.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: EASY TO TRAVEL WITH. INEXPENSIVE. BATTERY OPERATED.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: VERY LOUD. TYPICALLY WE HAVE TO REPLACED IT EVERY YEAR.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Recommend,  compact very nice for trip</li>
            <li> PROS: small, takes batteries, batteries last long, not to sharp but good enough to get a decent beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: loud, no cover to protect the blades</li>
            <li> I use it as a seam ripper for quilting.  It does an excellent job!</li>
