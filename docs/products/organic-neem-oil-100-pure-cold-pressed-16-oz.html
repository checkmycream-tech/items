            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>If it werenâ€™t for Neem oil, Iâ€™d have probably lost most of my plants to fungal diseases of one kind or another before the summer was over.</li>

            <li>I found that putting it with a cloudy apple juice or apple and green juice worked best..</li>

            <li>pure neem oil for sure...</li>
            <li>As a foliar spray, the plants soak it up like a sponge and quickly take on a shiny, waxed look.</li>
            <li>Then spray the entire plant top to bottom, on top of the leaves and under too, as well as the ground around the plant.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to live a day without Neem oil and this a fabulous buy!</li>
            <li>PURE OIL.. FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>but DEFINITELY do you own research on all that...</li>
            <li>In addition to a powerful lingering stink, this product also stains.</li>
            <li>A pure and good quality neem oil will help cure many skin problems including reduce joint swelling but a cheap and not good quality will do nothing.  </li>
            <li>It was at that point that I tried Neem oil, first from the Bonide company, which has an emulsifier already added so that it mixes well with water.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it has a strange smell that I love.</li>
            <li>Great, multi use include dandruff, toenail fungus, hair clippers irration, dry lips and hair moisturizer when combined with other oils.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, make skin instantly look younger and smoother, and helped heal my itchy insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results have been spectacular, to say the least.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It solidifies a little bit during cool weather just place it in hot water to liquify.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All my plants are under constant attack by a fast growing fungal blight that infects the leaves and stems, and can kill a plant in under a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 2 so far</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product but so far I am seeing a difference with the aphids on my plants.</li>
            <li>DO NOT give this to children or keep it ANYWHERE near their reach.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it for my skin, but it feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the 100% pure cold pressed Neem oil; I&#x27;ve used it as a natural insecticide on my vegetable and fruit plants and so far am pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>recipe: water, a little alcohol, a cap full of Neem oil, and peppermint extract into a spray bottle</li>
            <li>My recipe: water, a little alcohol, a cap full of Neem oil, and peppermint extract into a spray bottle</li>
            <li>I also made a natural insect repellant with it and some other natural ingredients, and although I have not had a chance to try it yet, I feel very hopeful about it because of Neem oil&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical island where my dogs and I are constantly being bitten by bugs and insects</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of scary</li>
            <li>Leaf die-off slowed down &amp; stopped very quickly, with only a little yellowing from new infection.</li>
            <li>I canâ€™t recommend the oil highly enough to other gardeners like myself whoâ€™d prefer an organic, but still effective weapon against a range of serious pests.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve tried raw sulfur powder, copper sulfate sprays, Captan and Fung-Onil sprays from Bonide, and Serenade biocide, all with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand of neem oil that I would buy from Amazon because I know that it is cold pressed and good quality.  </li>

            <li> great product!, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work,  Would like a refund, but unsuccessful contacting SAAQIN.</li>
            <li> My experience with Neem oil is only using it as a plant fungicide and insecticide. Iâ€™ve been trying to create a Southern California backyard garden out of a few narrow planters and a concrete slab. My plants of choice are mostly peppers - some sweet bells, some hot ones like Scotch Bonnets, Manzanoâ€™s, Carolina Reapers and others. My primary interest though, are Brazilian Starfish peppers, of which I have about 40 to 50 specimens. All my plants are under constant attack by a fast growing fungal blight that infects the leaves and stems, and can kill a plant in under a week. Iâ€™ve tried raw sulfur powder, copper sulfate sprays, Captan and Fung-Onil sprays from Bonide, and Serenade biocide, all with varying degrees of success. The blight always comes back though, and the chemical sprays were getting out of hand. It was at that point that I tried Neem oil, first from the Bonide company, which has an emulsifier already added so that it mixes well with water. Then I started using the raw oil sold above, and just adding a little dish soap to make it mixable with water. The results have been spectacular, to say the least. As a foliar spray, the plants soak it up like a sponge and quickly take on a shiny, waxed look. The plants also get darker and seem to get a burst of energy and accelerated growth. For plants that seemed terminally infected, I poured the oil &amp; soap solution directly around the roots. Leaf die-off slowed down &amp; stopped very quickly, with only a little yellowing from new infection. Iâ€™ve also been diligent about removing infected leaves and not letting any fallen ones stay on the ground too long. The foliar applications were made using a 2 gallon pump spayer, with 4 teaspoons per gallon of Neem oil and a few small squirts of dish soap added to allow mixing with water. Then spray the entire plant top to bottom, on top of the leaves and under too, as well as the ground around the plant. Just soak everything. Plants tolerate the concoction well and quicklystart look healthier very quickly. If it werenâ€™t for Neem oil, Iâ€™d have probably lost most of my plants to fungal diseases of one kind or another before the summer was over. Add in that itâ€™s natural and non-toxic to mammals, and itâ€™s perfect for my garden - the only downside being that it breaks down in under a week, so the plants become vulnerable again. Spraying and root-soaking with Neem oil solution every one to two weeks has let my peppers thrive, and as an added bonus, kept the bugs away. I canâ€™t recommend the oil highly enough to other gardeners like myself whoâ€™d prefer an organic, but still effective weapon against a range of serious pests. Use it even if your plants look healthy and theyâ€™ll thank you for it.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this neem oil.  This is the only brand of neem oil that I would buy from Amazon because I know that it is cold pressed and good quality.  I&#x27;ve purchased a less expensive neem oil that I can&#x27;t use for myself and my dogs because of poor quality.  I use this neem oil for insect bites, rashes, mosquito bites and other skin disorders both for me and my 6 small dogs.  I specially use this neem oil to help reduce pain from bursitis and arthritis.  A pure and good quality neem oil will help cure many skin problems including reduce joint swelling but a cheap and not good quality will do nothing.  I live in a tropical island where my dogs and I are constantly being bitten by bugs and insects so we have to have a good supply of this good quality neem oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells and appears to be a good quality neem oil</li>
            <li> If I could give this product more stars I would. It&#x27;s amazing! The consistency and quality is superb. THIS STUFF WORKS WONDERS ON ITCHING FROM ANY TYPE OF INSECT BITES!!! I&#x27;ve purchased 2 so far and I will be purchasing a third one!!!!</li>
            <li> Met my expectations and using it for gardening.</li>
            <li> smells like burnt peanuts works like flipping magic. effective against bugs, dandruff, hexes, and smelling pleasant. +2 against guys in business suits -3 charisma</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> INSECT REPELLENT: My car recently got INFESTED with Ants! I was so glad I had this on hand!&lt;br /&gt;My recipe: water, a little alcohol, a cap full of Neem oil, and peppermint extract into a spray bottle and they have not come back since. SPRAY THE TIRES because that is how they climb up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***INTERNALLY: It smells awful and taste awful... But it can be done! I found that putting it with a cloudy apple juice or apple and green juice worked best.. you actually get used to the taste after a few days believe it or not,lol. But I literally only used a few drop in the cap, and only once a day for only 3 days at a time to help balance blood sugar for diabetes and can be used as contraceptive as well</li>
            <li> Yes I love the product and the size ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> pure neem oil for sure...</li>

            <li> I have just started using this product but so far I am seeing a difference with the aphids on my plants. It came earlier than I expected it. Very strong.</li>
            <li> Just a dub on the the acne and acne begone. will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> it seems to smell terrible no matter what you do.  It is awesome , if only not to smell so yuck!!!!</li>
            <li> Besides it beneficial properties on the body.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective for insect control and powdery mildew on most plants. Not Toxic all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It solidifies a little bit during cool weather just place it in hot water to liquify.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my dogs shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrible but the benefits outweigh the smell.</li>
            <li> There is not enough research posted about it. On the bottle it says be careful if ingesting, and then other sites say don&#x27;t ingest at all. It&#x27;s kind of scary but I believe the people of India have been using it and chewing on the leaves for a long long time..  If you are not very familiar with it I would suggest buying supplements or the tea, because the dosage is already predetermined and measured for you. You don&#x27;t want to mess around with dosages with things that this if you are not aware. DO NOT give this to children or keep it ANYWHERE near their reach. I have read too many scary things about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***ON SKIN: It feels nice, make skin instantly look younger and smoother, and helped heal my itchy insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***INSECT REPELLENT: My car recently got INFESTED with Ants! I was so glad I had this on hand!&lt;br /&gt;  My recipe: water, a little alcohol, a cap full of Neem oil, and peppermint extract into a spray bottle and they have not  come back since.  SPRAY THE TIRES because that is how they climb up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***INTERNALLY:  It smells awful and taste awful... But it can be done!  I found that putting it with a cloudy apple juice or apple and green juice worked best.. you actually get used to the taste after a few days believe it or not,lol.  But I literally only used a few drop in the cap, and only once a day for only 3 days at a time to help balance blood sugar for diabetes and can be used as contraceptive as well but DEFINITELY do you own research on all that...</li>
            <li> Powerful to say the least. Works on almost any ailment.</li>
            <li> I used it as a diluted (1 tsp. oil to 20 oz. water, little squirt of dish soap) spray to kill the mites in our hen house. It works great!  I have not tried it for my skin, but it feels soft.  The smell is not pleasant but I&#x27;ve read that people use other essential oils to help mask the odor.  Shipping and service was timely.</li>
            <li> I bought it for some kind of holistic remedy unrelated to the product&#x27;s quality.  No one mentioned this stuff has the worst stink of any quasi-food related item I have ever encountered, only use in a ventilated area.  In addition to a powerful lingering stink, this product also stains.</li>
            <li> neem oil was just an experimint .i would like to find more ways to use it..</li>
            <li> Used this to get rid of spider mites in my indoor apartment garden. Worked with a mix of soap &amp; water in about 1.5 weeks time. Use it regularly now in my garden as it makes leaves look great!</li>
            <li> I want to ask if this is 100% pure and cold extracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s on a slightly cold temperature will it harden?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the oil cleansing method and as a nighttime moisturizer, and it seems to be effective in keeping my skin calm and moisturized. It smells a lot like peanuts to me, and while it&#x27;s not a very appealing smell, it doesn&#x27;t disgust me. I only use it in the evening and use a cleanser in the morning to get rid of any lingering smell. I&#x27;ve been keeping the bottle in the fridge and a small portion of it in a container under my bathroom sink. It&#x27;s going to last me a while!</li>
            <li> Great, multi use include dandruff, toenail fungus, hair clippers irration, dry lips and hair moisturizer when combined with other oils. Love this product</li>
            <li> Very good product. Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> This is stinky but it sure seems to work.</li>
            <li> I use this for a plant spray for pests and also for dry skin on my face. it has a strange smell that I love. kind of a nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to live a day without Neem oil and this a fabulous buy!</li>
            <li> PURE OIL.. FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li> neem oil really works, I used it on my border collie who has very bad skin issues and it actually worked.</li>
