            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy for the quality.</li>
            <li>It matches my fair complexion well.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and always have blemishes to cover.</li>
            <li>I get good coverage and it matches my skintone so well that I sometimes don&#x27;t even wear foundation with it, I just conceal and set with powder.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a light toned women.</li>
            <li>Good coverage</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>This shade is the lighter, so is for fair skin.</li>
            <li>It sometimes comes off as orange if I spot conceal with it on my fair skin</li>
            <li>(Fair skin).</li>
            <li>I got #15 fair</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Great for the price, I enjoy it</li>
            <li>this concealer has really great coverage and feels so light.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li>I like it because its not drying and it has a nice coverage.</li>
            <li>Smooths on skin nice to hide imperfections.  </li>
            <li>Good for either using under foundations or on top</li>
            <li>Under the eyes, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>nice color but stung under the eyes</li>
            <li>It blended so nicely with my skin tone that I started to use this concealer exclusively.</li>
            <li>Nice texture - not greasy or watery.</li>
            <li>packaging is kind of neat, I think.</li>
            <li>but I was lucky and it covered great.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t tell by looking that it was there, but it does rub off if you touch it or transfer very easily.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, perfect for dark circles or stubborn blemishes.</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve found thus far.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the fair color matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>For reference, shade 15 Fair is lighter than 10 Light.</li>
            <li>the product, is easy to apply, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before expected, in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Love this color works greats very easy to use fits my color no issues</li>
            <li>The packaging is very comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and was looking for something that blended and looked natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is great for the price!</li>
            <li>Now i want more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it compared to Nars and while I&#x27;ve never tried that myself, they sure do seem to be imitating the packaging...</li>
            <li>Make sure to set it with powder to ensure it stays during the day.  </li>
            <li>For me this concealer is just ok.</li>
            <li>I love to use this to highlight under my eye.</li>
            <li>This is probably my most preferred concealer to date and it does not leave orange blotches on my skin, like others do even when they are the fairest option.  </li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>So I tried maybelline and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again :)</li>
            <li>I saw lots of the beauty gurus I follow on Youtube using and loving the Maybelline Fit</li>
            <li>Either way LOVE this concealer.  </li>
            <li>Love maybelline.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have bought it for some time from the store, all packaged and sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite concealers.</li>
            <li>My favorite concealer.  </li>
            <li>So that being said, it was just ok.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I do not have to reapply it throughout the day or 2 minutes after I put foundation on top of it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the coverage.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>My favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to use this one around your eyes, because it&#x27;s very gentle and oily, which is good for eye</li>
            <li>Soaks into skin quickly, which one hand is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, smooth and the color is good, I wish it were more opaque, but for little spots it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Also is on the pink side, which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This satisfied my need for a light concealer and met every expectation I had.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines, though you can easily use a primer with it if you want for more assurance.</li>
            <li>so excited over this that I wish I could give it more than five stars.</li>
            <li>Not a bad concealer!</li>
            <li>Blends well and covers easily.</li>
            <li>It is medium coverage, and doesn&#x27;t cake easily.</li>
            <li>It applies easily with the tip of my finger, and doesn&#x27;t settle into creases like some others do.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty nice concealer.</li>
            <li>The fantastic thing about this concealer is that it looks about as good by the time I go to bed as it looked when I first put it on fresh.  </li>
            <li>I bought the fair shade because I had purchased the light shade previously and it seems to me that 15 fair is lighter than 10 light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been hard to guess at, but I&#x27;m just sure this one being delivered will be perfect!!</li>
            <li>and it was cheap price.</li>
            <li>I bought these after watching maybelline videos and they do FIT me.</li>
            <li>it out&amp;#34; smooth again.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s too light for me</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>I also purchased a shade too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>SINCE MABELINE TOOK AWAY SHINE FREE--</li>
            <li>so it goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Works great, never creases and last all day.</li>
            <li>After I put on my foundation , I always reach for the Maybeline fit me Concealer.</li>
            <li>The color was way too light for me.</li>
            <li>too light and got powdery...</li>
            <li>I use the shade 15 Fair, which actually matches my skin better than the Ivory did.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect, i have pale skin and</li>
            <li>Perfect for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>the color matched nicely and it concealed blemishes and dark spots very nicely, but to the touch, it didn&#x27;t really blend in, it just sat on the top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product because of the rave it got on makeup review sites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for covering small spots and under-eye bags.</li>
            <li>Maybelline, as many problems as we&#x27;ve had over the years, you have made the only drugstore concealer that is any good for all purposes and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t if those that are quite oily will enjoy this or if it will have that great of lasting power on pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>very good covering dark circles, and I have quite a lot of it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good enough product that I&#x27;m not disappointed that I tried it</li>
            <li>This concealer has amazing coverage and is creamy but dries to a soft matte.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer in Fair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it as a good drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s quite true to color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is not really really bad.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of concealers I have have to say this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Kinda runs out quick, but then again I use it every day, some times twice if I&#x27;m reapplying make up to go out for the night.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating, not cakey at all, don&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li>This concealer works well and matches my skin tone pretty accurately.</li>
            <li>this works well on its own and is very comparable to high end concealers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers throughout the years and this is the ONE concealer that I&#x27;ve found that can cover them completely!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, that is also a difficult to match color (I have very fair skin, but it has a warm quality to it as well, rather than having the white or pinkish shade like a lot of fair skin seems to have).</li>
            <li>For the price point this is a great all round concealer.</li>
            <li>I also find that it creases under my eyes when I smile throughout the day, so I have to go over my makeup with a damp makeup sponge to &amp;#34;pat</li>
            <li>most concealers, even when fair enough, are too yellow.</li>
            <li>Most mornings I dab a tiny bit on each of my blemishes and lightly blend it in.  </li>
            <li>Not in love with it and prefer to use my old stuff.</li>
            <li>I can never find the right concealer or color.</li>
            <li>Bought it on a whim not knowing if it was the right color</li>
            <li>-it blends right in and doesn&#x27;t seem to be noticeable.</li>
            <li>it works great under eyes better than  expensive makeuo counter brands</li>
            <li>The ones I purchased were kind of dry and did not blend well into the color of my skin (and I used a concealer brush at that).</li>
            <li>It covers better than the Nars concealer, all your blemishes, fine lines and dark circles will disappear with this baby.</li>
            <li>my first time using this</li>
            <li>My absolutely favorite product on this entire site.</li>
            <li>i think before you buy this ones, better tried them in the stores and keep restocking, this was like white concealer</li>
            <li>Does the job and a real value!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that these work for some people</li>
            <li>but it most definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and it does not conceal much!</li>
            <li>It actually has more coverage than the NARS wand concealer and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is a very blendable concealer with a good consistency, but it irritates my eyes a little.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price, these are worth a look.</li>
            <li>I like it very much because you can let it dry and put mineral makeup on top.</li>
            <li>and we both noticed it kind of burning under our eyes when we used it to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the brush and brightens the skin without being obvious.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let its thin design fool you; there&#x27;s quite a lot of product in this, not to mention the great pigmentation means you don&#x27;t have to use so much in the first</li>
            <li>This is something that works fine, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again at the same time.</li>
            <li>a nice alternative to the much more expensive clinique version</li>
            <li>It also blends really well and doesn&#x27;t cake at all.</li>
            <li>really works well on concealing wrinkles would recommend</li>
            <li>I really like this concealer</li>
            <li>, it is so creamy and blends really well.</li>
            <li>However, it does cover up these things very well.</li>
            <li>It moves very well in the face.</li>
            <li>I fell deeply in love with this concealer because the lighter tones don&#x27;t tend to have worse/sheerer coverage, which is a trend I notice with other concealers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very minimalist and chic, and you can very easily travel with it since the lid is actually quite tight and the tube is pretty durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less oily and MORE pigmented than this one.</li>
            <li>but it has decent coverage.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this concealer for everyone to try</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have very dark circles due to my fair skin and heredity.  </li>
            <li>This works best if I prime my under eye area with L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic Perfecting Base, which is a fluffy silicone formula that helps keep things matte.</li>
            <li>If it were more yellow, it would be easier to blend and hide blemishes and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Because some areas on my face are oily, and other areas are dry, I always apply Olay face lotion first before applying this Fit</li>
            <li>The only tip I can offer is that if you dont set it with some sort of loose powder or setting powder it will settle into the fine lines under the eye area.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot in the past and some a lot more expensive than this one that didn&#x27;t give me nearly as good coverage.</li>
            <li>this fit me and wanted one a little darker so decided to buy the 15 well when comparing the two</li>
            <li>My very first concealer, so i don&#x27;t know how is it compare to the other brands.</li>
            <li>Also, I was pleasantly surprised this was in a pack of two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was a mistake to buy this from Amazon because it was NOT sealed nor packaged, and it looked as if a considerable amount of concealer had been used already.</li>
            <li>It has a light coverage serves for everyday wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I got the FAIR by suggestion of my makeup artists and it just looks weird on my face.</li>
            <li>it is light, but i ordered a lighter shade.&lt;br /&gt;im ordering a darker next week to see if it covers my dark circles.</li>
            <li>It works better than more expensive products for concealing my undereye circles, along with a little powder.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but not very good coverage.</li>
            <li>To cover red zits, I don&#x27;t want a pink toned concealer - it just makes it more pink and not necessarily similar to my skin color.</li>
            <li>especially if set with some kind of powder.&lt;br /&gt;The only very tiny problem with it is that the tube makes the concealer look very slightly darker than it really is, but it&#x27;s really not a huge deal or something you can avoid with any brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two of these so far, and the third will be delivered today.  </li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from the beginning, given the price.</li>
            <li>It was a little lighter than I expected but it works just fine at concealing the bags under my eyes and also any blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the easiest and smoothest formula of concealer I&#x27;ve worked with and despite the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; color being a pink undertone and therefore not a perfect match for my yellow toned super light porcelain skin</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a decent concealer for the price.</li>
            <li>I was using a really expensive department store brand concealer that I really liked, but wasn&#x27;t able to afford to pay that much for a new tube, so I tried to find something a little less expensive.</li>
            <li>when things are looking particularly purple (I have those genetic dark circles) and after that, apply this concealer.</li>
            <li>However, just a little bit too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> VERY GOOD COVERAGE without a &amp;#34;white stain&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Very good both under eyes and on blemishes or acne scars.</li>
            <li> It has incredible coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t crease or look cakey.</li>
            <li> I hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue this anytime soon, because they&#x27;ve made an incredible product here.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the shade Fair, and I could probably use it as a highlight!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Beautiful finish and great coverage</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> I have used it both ways and its great</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;ve made a concealer</li>
            <li> It comes out a great color</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The product works great for its purpose.</li>

            <li> Love it, blends wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This is easily the BEST concealer I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I am very fair, so I have darkness whether I am well-rested or not, so I need something a bit more substantial than this.</li>
            <li> Oh plus she looks good wearing it..</li>
            <li> it makes you look good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy for the quality.</li>
            <li> It matches my fair complexion well.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and always have blemishes to cover.</li>
            <li> I get good coverage and it matches my skintone so well that I sometimes don&#x27;t even wear foundation with it, I just conceal and set with powder.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a light toned women.</li>
            <li> Good coverage</li>
            <li> GOOD</li>
            <li> This shade is the lighter, so is for fair skin.</li>
            <li> It sometimes comes off as orange if I spot conceal with it on my fair skin</li>
            <li> (Fair skin).</li>
            <li> I got #15 fair</li>
            <li> it has great coverage and its even waterproof in the pool I love it</li>
            <li> It is great, if you donÂ´t believe me, check YouTube :)</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase :]</li>
            <li> Great deal, easily to apply, looks good.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, I enjoy it</li>
            <li> this concealer has really great coverage and feels so light.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li> I like it because its not drying and it has a nice coverage.</li>
            <li> Smooths on skin nice to hide imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Good for either using under foundations or on top</li>
            <li> Under the eyes, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> nice color but stung under the eyes</li>
            <li> It blended so nicely with my skin tone that I started to use this concealer exclusively.</li>
            <li> Nice texture - not greasy or watery.</li>
            <li> packaging is kind of neat, I think.</li>
            <li> but I was lucky and it covered great.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t tell by looking that it was there, but it does rub off if you touch it or transfer very easily.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, perfect for dark circles or stubborn blemishes.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve found thus far.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and the fair color matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> For reference, shade 15 Fair is lighter than 10 Light.</li>
            <li> the product, is easy to apply, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before expected, in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Love this color works greats very easy to use fits my color no issues</li>
            <li> The packaging is very comfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and easy.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and was looking for something that blended and looked natural.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is great for the price!</li>
            <li> Now i want more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard it compared to Nars and while I&#x27;ve never tried that myself, they sure do seem to be imitating the packaging...</li>
            <li> Make sure to set it with powder to ensure it stays during the day.  </li>
            <li> For me this concealer is just ok.</li>
            <li> I love to use this to highlight under my eye.</li>
            <li> This is probably my most preferred concealer to date and it does not leave orange blotches on my skin, like others do even when they are the fairest option.  </li>
            <li> I love this concealer.</li>
            <li> So I tried maybelline and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> I saw lots of the beauty gurus I follow on Youtube using and loving the Maybelline Fit</li>
            <li> Either way LOVE this concealer.  </li>
            <li> Love maybelline.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have bought it for some time from the store, all packaged and sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite concealers.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer.  </li>
            <li> So that being said, it was just ok.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I do not have to reapply it throughout the day or 2 minutes after I put foundation on top of it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to use this one around your eyes, because it&#x27;s very gentle and oily, which is good for eye</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin quickly, which one hand is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, smooth and the color is good, I wish it were more opaque, but for little spots it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Also is on the pink side, which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> This satisfied my need for a light concealer and met every expectation I had.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines, though you can easily use a primer with it if you want for more assurance.</li>
            <li> so excited over this that I wish I could give it more than five stars.</li>
            <li> Not a bad concealer!</li>
            <li> Blends well and covers easily.</li>
            <li> It is medium coverage, and doesn&#x27;t cake easily.</li>
            <li> It applies easily with the tip of my finger, and doesn&#x27;t settle into creases like some others do.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty nice concealer.</li>
            <li> The fantastic thing about this concealer is that it looks about as good by the time I go to bed as it looked when I first put it on fresh.  </li>
            <li> I bought the fair shade because I had purchased the light shade previously and it seems to me that 15 fair is lighter than 10 light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to guess at, but I&#x27;m just sure this one being delivered will be perfect!!</li>
            <li> and it was cheap price.</li>
            <li> I bought these after watching maybelline videos and they do FIT me.</li>
            <li> it out&amp;#34; smooth again.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too light for me</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> I also purchased a shade too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> SINCE MABELINE TOOK AWAY SHINE FREE--</li>
            <li> so it goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Works great, never creases and last all day.</li>
            <li> After I put on my foundation , I always reach for the Maybeline fit me Concealer.</li>
            <li> The color was way too light for me.</li>
            <li> too light and got powdery...</li>
            <li> I use the shade 15 Fair, which actually matches my skin better than the Ivory did.  </li>
            <li> The color is perfect, i have pale skin and</li>
            <li> Perfect for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> the color matched nicely and it concealed blemishes and dark spots very nicely, but to the touch, it didn&#x27;t really blend in, it just sat on the top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product because of the rave it got on makeup review sites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for covering small spots and under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> Maybelline, as many problems as we&#x27;ve had over the years, you have made the only drugstore concealer that is any good for all purposes and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t if those that are quite oily will enjoy this or if it will have that great of lasting power on pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> very good covering dark circles, and I have quite a lot of it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good enough product that I&#x27;m not disappointed that I tried it</li>
            <li> This concealer has amazing coverage and is creamy but dries to a soft matte.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer in Fair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it as a good drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s quite true to color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is not really really bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of concealers I have have to say this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Kinda runs out quick, but then again I use it every day, some times twice if I&#x27;m reapplying make up to go out for the night.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, not cakey at all, don&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> This concealer works well and matches my skin tone pretty accurately.</li>
            <li> this works well on its own and is very comparable to high end concealers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers throughout the years and this is the ONE concealer that I&#x27;ve found that can cover them completely!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is also a difficult to match color (I have very fair skin, but it has a warm quality to it as well, rather than having the white or pinkish shade like a lot of fair skin seems to have).</li>
            <li> For the price point this is a great all round concealer.</li>
            <li> I also find that it creases under my eyes when I smile throughout the day, so I have to go over my makeup with a damp makeup sponge to &amp;#34;pat</li>
            <li> most concealers, even when fair enough, are too yellow.</li>
            <li> Most mornings I dab a tiny bit on each of my blemishes and lightly blend it in.  </li>
            <li> Not in love with it and prefer to use my old stuff.</li>
            <li> I can never find the right concealer or color.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim not knowing if it was the right color</li>
            <li> -it blends right in and doesn&#x27;t seem to be noticeable.</li>
            <li> it works great under eyes better than  expensive makeuo counter brands</li>
            <li> The ones I purchased were kind of dry and did not blend well into the color of my skin (and I used a concealer brush at that).</li>
            <li> It covers better than the Nars concealer, all your blemishes, fine lines and dark circles will disappear with this baby.</li>
            <li> my first time using this</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite product on this entire site.</li>
            <li> i think before you buy this ones, better tried them in the stores and keep restocking, this was like white concealer</li>
            <li> Does the job and a real value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that these work for some people</li>
            <li> but it most definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and it does not conceal much!</li>
            <li> It actually has more coverage than the NARS wand concealer and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is a very blendable concealer with a good consistency, but it irritates my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price, these are worth a look.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because you can let it dry and put mineral makeup on top.</li>
            <li> and we both noticed it kind of burning under our eyes when we used it to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the brush and brightens the skin without being obvious.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let its thin design fool you; there&#x27;s quite a lot of product in this, not to mention the great pigmentation means you don&#x27;t have to use so much in the first</li>
            <li> This is something that works fine, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again at the same time.</li>
            <li> a nice alternative to the much more expensive clinique version</li>
            <li> It also blends really well and doesn&#x27;t cake at all.</li>
            <li> really works well on concealing wrinkles would recommend</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer</li>
            <li> , it is so creamy and blends really well.</li>
            <li> However, it does cover up these things very well.</li>
            <li> It moves very well in the face.</li>
            <li> I fell deeply in love with this concealer because the lighter tones don&#x27;t tend to have worse/sheerer coverage, which is a trend I notice with other concealers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very minimalist and chic, and you can very easily travel with it since the lid is actually quite tight and the tube is pretty durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less oily and MORE pigmented than this one.</li>
            <li> but it has decent coverage.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this concealer for everyone to try</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles due to my fair skin and heredity.  </li>
            <li> This works best if I prime my under eye area with L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic Perfecting Base, which is a fluffy silicone formula that helps keep things matte.</li>
            <li> If it were more yellow, it would be easier to blend and hide blemishes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Because some areas on my face are oily, and other areas are dry, I always apply Olay face lotion first before applying this Fit</li>
            <li> The only tip I can offer is that if you dont set it with some sort of loose powder or setting powder it will settle into the fine lines under the eye area.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot in the past and some a lot more expensive than this one that didn&#x27;t give me nearly as good coverage.</li>
            <li> this fit me and wanted one a little darker so decided to buy the 15 well when comparing the two</li>
            <li> My very first concealer, so i don&#x27;t know how is it compare to the other brands.</li>
            <li> Also, I was pleasantly surprised this was in a pack of two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was a mistake to buy this from Amazon because it was NOT sealed nor packaged, and it looked as if a considerable amount of concealer had been used already.</li>
            <li> It has a light coverage serves for everyday wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I got the FAIR by suggestion of my makeup artists and it just looks weird on my face.</li>
            <li> it is light, but i ordered a lighter shade.&lt;br /&gt;im ordering a darker next week to see if it covers my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It works better than more expensive products for concealing my undereye circles, along with a little powder.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but not very good coverage.</li>
            <li> To cover red zits, I don&#x27;t want a pink toned concealer - it just makes it more pink and not necessarily similar to my skin color.</li>
            <li> especially if set with some kind of powder.&lt;br /&gt;The only very tiny problem with it is that the tube makes the concealer look very slightly darker than it really is, but it&#x27;s really not a huge deal or something you can avoid with any brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two of these so far, and the third will be delivered today.  </li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from the beginning, given the price.</li>
            <li> It was a little lighter than I expected but it works just fine at concealing the bags under my eyes and also any blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the easiest and smoothest formula of concealer I&#x27;ve worked with and despite the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; color being a pink undertone and therefore not a perfect match for my yellow toned super light porcelain skin</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a decent concealer for the price.</li>
            <li> I was using a really expensive department store brand concealer that I really liked, but wasn&#x27;t able to afford to pay that much for a new tube, so I tried to find something a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> when things are looking particularly purple (I have those genetic dark circles) and after that, apply this concealer.</li>
            <li> However, just a little bit too much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, but this concealer does a good job covering my worst blemishes.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to only apply in a single area and then blend before moving on to another problem area.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I found that this concealer has sort of a strange waxy texture to it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have to buy enough backups to last for the next few decades.</li>
            <li> me tell you something about my dark circles for a second.</li>
            <li> However, one needs to be quick with the concealer brush before it just becomes too difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> a little too red for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars only because it dries my skin out a little.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re absolutely terrible, and no amount of makeup has ever been able to make them go away or be reduced by much.</li>
            <li> I find that it is a bit thin for my liking and doesn&#x27;t cover much of my undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> Color was as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long</li>
            <li> Not drying or irritating for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other concealer seem to fade away or make me look like I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Covers dark circles well, doesn&#x27;t show lines as much as other liquid concealers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it is a little bit too pink undertone for me.</li>
            <li> In reality, I had no makeup on and he was referring to my horrendously dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover my dark eye circles and it does wonders.  </li>
            <li> I always have dark circles abd</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> I use this for blemishes, redness, and dark</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as much as I expected, it&#x27;s too pale.</li>
            <li> My nose gets pink whenever I get too hot or too cold, so I always blend a little of this concealer on it in the morning to maintain even coloring in my face.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> I give this four stars since it does tend to disappear after a few hours on the oily parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> : So I guess I have to wait until I get pale again.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale, but this worked well for me.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not easy to get off, either.</li>
            <li> and I usually just use concealer sticks to prime my eyes.</li>
            <li> I need a small concealer to hide some blemishes and didn&#x27;t want to use a face cover.  </li>
            <li> Like an alien.</li>
            <li> the 10 is darker than the 15 :/  </li>
            <li> If you are not sure what color you need go somewhere you can test before buying</li>
            <li> /&gt;FAIR color is too white, I was wrong to ask that tone, I will use the illuminator.</li>
            <li> It stays opaque and all you have to do is lightly pat it around the horrible gray/purple/ohgodwhyme colored area with your ring fingers.</li>
            <li> THAT OFTEN SO THE EXTRA COST WON&#x27;T BE SO BAD.</li>
            <li> It could be that we just have broken capillaries, but the product burns.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it has great coverage and its even waterproof in the pool I love it it works great under eyes better than  expensive makeuo counter brands</li>
            <li> My boyfriend once told me that I had smeared eyeliner all under my eyes. In reality, I had no makeup on and he was referring to my horrendously dark undereye circles. I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers throughout the years and this is the ONE concealer that I&#x27;ve found that can cover them completely! It has incredible coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t crease or look cakey. I hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue this anytime soon, because they&#x27;ve made an incredible product here.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and coverage. Hides my under eye circles and I use it to put a highlight on the bridge of my nose.  Blends well and covers easily.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drug store concealer!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted it. I only got it so she wouldn&#x27;t complain about all the stuff I ordered from Amazon. It worked. I dont hear her yelling at me as im installing my TV wall mount bracket. Oh plus she looks good wearing it.. so there is that. I guess what im saying is.. it makes you look good and it was cheap price. Yea.. thats it.</li>
            <li> very nice! my first time using this and I love it! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a setting powder, mine sometimes gets cakey. this works well on its own and is very comparable to high end concealers</li>
            <li> Its a pretty nice concealer. I like it because its not drying and it has a nice coverage. Overall it is great for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought these after watching maybelline videos and they do FIT me. Now i want more. The color is perfect, i have pale skin and the zone under my eyes is...well...violet, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> Not a bad concealer! It&#x27;s no miracle product but the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade I got is beige-based, which is what I needed. I was looking for something just to use as concealer, not as part of a full-face of makeup because I don&#x27;t use foundation. This works best if I prime my under eye area with L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic Perfecting Base, which is a fluffy silicone formula that helps keep things matte. Also sometimes use a couple dots of yellow liquid corrector over that (e.l.f. cheapie) when things are looking particularly purple (I have those genetic dark circles) and after that, apply this concealer. It&#x27;s a good buy for the quality. I&#x27;ve heard it compared to Nars and while I&#x27;ve never tried that myself, they sure do seem to be imitating the packaging... For such a cheap price, these are worth a look.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite product on this entire site. Great deal, easily to apply, looks good. Buy, buy, buy.</li>
            <li> My very first concealer, so i don&#x27;t know how is it compare to the other brands. It lasts about 6 hours??? Which is not really really bad. I will repurchase it again and also I will go one shade darker.</li>
            <li> Love this color works greats very easy to use fits my color no issues</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as much as I expected, it&#x27;s too pale.</li>
            <li> Just like from the store without the price!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> I use this to cover my dark eye circles and it does wonders.  Make sure to set it with powder to ensure it stays during the day.  It matches my fair complexion well.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, perfect for dark circles or stubborn blemishes.</li>
            <li> i think before you buy this ones, better tried them in the stores and keep restocking, this was like white concealer</li>
            <li> This is a very blendable concealer with a good consistency, but it irritates my eyes a little. For me this concealer is just ok.</li>
            <li> I love to use this to highlight under my eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, smooth and the color is good, I wish it were more opaque, but for little spots it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two of these so far, and the third will be delivered today.  I&#x27;m not giving up on the color!  It&#x27;s been hard to guess at, but I&#x27;m just sure this one being delivered will be perfect!! LOL</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and was looking for something that blended and looked natural.  This is probably my most preferred concealer to date and it does not leave orange blotches on my skin, like others do even when they are the fairest option.  I will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. I have tried a lot in the past and some a lot more expensive than this one that didn&#x27;t give me nearly as good coverage. For the price point this is a great all round concealer. It was a little lighter than I expected but it works just fine at concealing the bags under my eyes and also any blemishes on my skin. It also blends really well and doesn&#x27;t cake at all. I love this concealer!</li>
            <li> I always have dark circles abd I can never find the right concealer or color. So I tried maybelline and absolutely love it. Other concealer seem to fade away or make me look like I was wearing makeup. I like that with this concealer it blended into my skin.  I&#x27;m extremely happy I decided to try this. I will never go without it now!</li>
            <li> This concealer works well and matches my skin tone pretty accurately.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin quickly, which one hand is nice. However, one needs to be quick with the concealer brush before it just becomes too difficult to blend. Would recommend to only apply in a single area and then blend before moving on to another problem area.</li>
            <li> Does the job and a real value!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and always have blemishes to cover. This works great.</li>
            <li> Love it, blends wonderfully! Can&#x27;t beat the convenience and price ordering through amazon</li>
            <li> perfect color just what I wanted.  Goes on nice and easy.  Smooths on skin nice to hide imperfections.  Good for either using under foundations or on top I have used it both ways and its great</li>
            <li> To clarify, I have hooded lids and I usually just use concealer sticks to prime my eyes. I decided to try my hand at a liquid primer since I never tried one before. The ones I purchased were kind of dry and did not blend well into the color of my skin (and I used a concealer brush at that). It just looked like I ran a miniature paint roller over my eyelids. At that point I didn&#x27;t bother with shadow, I just wiped it off. And it&#x27;s not easy to get off, either. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from the beginning, given the price. I&#x27;m aware that these work for some people but it most definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, I enjoy it</li>
            <li> This covers my under eye circles perfectly and doesn&#x27;t crease after all day wear. I will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> I need a small concealer to hide some blemishes and didn&#x27;t want to use a face cover.  This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> really works well on concealing wrinkles would recommend</li>
            <li> I saw lots of the beauty gurus I follow on Youtube using and loving the Maybelline Fit Me concealer and thought I would give it a go. I find that it is a bit thin for my liking and doesn&#x27;t cover much of my undereye darkness. I am very fair, so I have darkness whether I am well-rested or not, so I need something a bit more substantial than this. I also find that it creases under my eyes when I smile throughout the day, so I have to go over my makeup with a damp makeup sponge to &amp;#34;pat it out&amp;#34; smooth again. It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair - we&#x27;re talking nc15. I bought this in the shade Fair, and I could probably use it as a highlight! While it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;ve made a concealer that&#x27;s too light for me, I don&#x27;t want to put this on my scarring. Under the eyes, it&#x27;s nice. I mix it with my Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer in Fair. It comes out a great color and I think they have the same coverage for under the eyes. Also, I was pleasantly surprised this was in a pack of two.</li>
            <li> I bought the fair shade because I had purchased the light shade previously and it seems to me that 15 fair is lighter than 10 light.  Either way LOVE this concealer.  It goes on so smooth and it is my go-to concealer.</li>
            <li> I use this for contouring. Great product. Love maybelline. Blends well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, but this concealer does a good job covering my worst blemishes.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but not very good coverage. It&#x27;s also not dewy, and dries powdery. I also purchased a shade too light for my skin tone. D: So I guess I have to wait until I get pale again.</li>
            <li> The product works great for its purpose. I have a friend who bought the same one and we both noticed it kind of burning under our eyes when we used it to cover dark circles. It could be that we just have broken capillaries, but the product burns.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it to highlight my face. It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the brush and brightens the skin without being obvious. A little goes a long was so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of concealers I have have to say this is the best one yet.Very good coverage,shade I chose matches my skin tone well.The only tip I can offer is that if you dont set it with some sort of loose powder or setting powder it will settle into the fine lines under the eye area.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have bought it for some time from the store, all packaged and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was a mistake to buy this from Amazon because it was NOT sealed nor packaged, and it looked as if a considerable amount of concealer had been used already.</li>
            <li> I have the worst time finding concealers since I have a pale pink skintone- most concealers, even when fair enough, are too yellow. This one was great though. I get good coverage and it matches my skintone so well that I sometimes don&#x27;t even wear foundation with it, I just conceal and set with powder. I would definitely recommend it as a good drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> This concealer is awesome for contouring. I get compliments on my makeup whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles due to my fair skin and heredity.  This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve found thus far.  It goes on smooth and the fair color matches my skin tone well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a light toned women. Good coverage</li>
            <li> a little too red for me</li>
            <li> If you have any second thought about buying this product. FORGET IT! It is great, if you donÂ´t believe me, check YouTube :)</li>
            <li> For reference, shade 15 Fair is lighter than 10 Light. I really like this concealer, it is so creamy and blends really well. It&#x27;s perfect for under eye as well as blemishes and discoloration. It is medium coverage, and doesn&#x27;t cake easily.</li>
            <li> GOOD AT COVERING BLEMISHES.  SINCE MABELINE TOOK AWAY SHINE FREE--THE ORIGIONAL THIN FOUNDATION, I&#x27;M CONSIDERING USING THIS AS A FOUNDATION. IT LEAVES MY FACE SHINY THOUGH. I DONT USE MAKEUP THAT OFTEN SO THE EXTRA COST WON&#x27;T BE SO BAD.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim not knowing if it was the right color but I was lucky and it covered great. One of my favorite concealers. Kinda runs out quick, but then again I use it every day, some times twice if I&#x27;m reapplying make up to go out for the night. Great price though.</li>
            <li> nice color but stung under the eyes</li>
            <li> I would recommend to use this one around your eyes, because it&#x27;s very gentle and oily, which is good for eye skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have acne or want to use concealer around your nose I still suggest Maybelline 24HR stay Concealer.It&#x27;s less oily and MORE pigmented than this one.</li>
            <li> I like this. a nice alternative to the much more expensive clinique version and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I got the FAIR by suggestion of my makeup artists and it just looks weird on my face. Like an alien. Get the darker skin toned ones.</li>
            <li> Hides under eye circles and blemishes. It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
            <li> This is easily the BEST concealer I have ever used!  Once upon a time when Maybelline still made their Mineral Power concealer in my color (Ivory) I thought I had found the best concealer.  But when I switched to this one, I realized that THIS was the best affordable concealer out there.  I use the shade 15 Fair, which actually matches my skin better than the Ivory did.  Most mornings I dab a tiny bit on each of my blemishes and lightly blend it in.  My nose gets pink whenever I get too hot or too cold, so I always blend a little of this concealer on it in the morning to maintain even coloring in my face.  The fantastic thing about this concealer is that it looks about as good by the time I go to bed as it looked when I first put it on fresh.  Because some areas on my face are oily, and other areas are dry, I always apply Olay face lotion first before applying this Fit Me concealer so it goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer.  Covers dark circles well, doesn&#x27;t show lines as much as other liquid concealers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> very good covering dark circles, and I have quite a lot of it!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Heard about this concealer and had to buy one. This shade is the lighter, so is for fair skin. Also is on the pink side, which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, is easy to apply, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before expected, in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> It sometimes comes off as orange if I spot conceal with it on my fair skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is also a difficult to match color (I have very fair skin, but it has a warm quality to it as well, rather than having the white or pinkish shade like a lot of fair skin seems to have). I was using a really expensive department store brand concealer that I really liked, but wasn&#x27;t able to afford to pay that much for a new tube, so I tried to find something a little less expensive. This is something that works fine, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again at the same time. I like to dab on concealer with my finger and then finish blending with a sponge and I found that this concealer has sort of a strange waxy texture to it. When I put it on it blended in well...the color matched nicely and it concealed blemishes and dark spots very nicely, but to the touch, it didn&#x27;t really blend in, it just sat on the top of my skin. You couldn&#x27;t tell by looking that it was there, but it does rub off if you touch it or transfer very easily. So that being said, it was just ok. It&#x27;s a good enough product that I&#x27;m not disappointed that I tried it and I will use it until it is gone, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer all over my face on any blemishes and as an under eye concealer as well.  Works great, never creases and last all day.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Only concealer that works for my skin tone. (Fair skin).</li>
            <li> I give this four stars since it does tend to disappear after a few hours on the oily parts of my skin. It stays put under my eyes, but not on my nose.</li>
            <li> Make-up artist used this concealer on my face. It blended so nicely with my skin tone that I started to use this concealer exclusively. Nice texture - not greasy or watery. VERY GOOD COVERAGE without a &amp;#34;white stain&amp;#34; look. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my pale skin. I use it on the occasional blemish and in the corners of my eyes to brighten. It applies easily with the tip of my finger, and doesn&#x27;t settle into creases like some others do. Happy with my purchase :]</li>
            <li> So I had the 10 for this fit me and wanted one a little darker so decided to buy the 15 well when comparing the two the 10 is darker than the 15 :/  Going to just stick with the 10. If you are not sure what color you need go somewhere you can test before buying</li>
            <li> Not in love with it and prefer to use my old stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because you can let it dry and put mineral makeup on top. Color was as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer. I&#x27;ve bought it for years. It works better than more expensive products for concealing my undereye circles, along with a little powder. I have olive-Mediterranian skin.</li>
            <li> I use this to brighten under my eyes and it works great!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product because of the rave it got on makeup review sites. I got #15 fair and it is a little bit too pink undertone for me. To cover red zits, I don&#x27;t want a pink toned concealer - it just makes it more pink and not necessarily similar to my skin color. If it were more yellow, it would be easier to blend and hide blemishes and dark circles. However, it does cover up these things very well. I do not have to reapply it throughout the day or 2 minutes after I put foundation on top of it. I am pleased with the coverage. I may repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale, but this worked well for me. However, just a little bit too much and it looks caked on. It&#x27;s perfect for covering small spots and under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> its sooooo dryy! maybe i chose the lighter tone.. and it does not conceal much! i would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> it is light, but i ordered a lighter shade.&lt;br /&gt;im ordering a darker next week to see if it covers my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. Not worth the hype. It comes off and I have reapply a lot.</li>
            <li> Perfect match. Will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> After I put on my foundation , I always reach for the Maybeline fit me Concealer. It covers better than the Nars concealer, all your blemishes, fine lines and dark circles will disappear with this baby.</li>
            <li> Very nice coverage. Just got the wrong shade but it has decent coverage.</li>
            <li> love it! makes me look awake when I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep, and stays on to cover zits.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer. I&#x27;m onto my second tube, and I have no plans to switch. It has a mouse-y texture, it doesn&#x27;t settle in my wrinkles, and this color matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li> The color was way too light for me.</li>
            <li> This satisfied my need for a light concealer and met every expectation I had. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> too light and got powdery...</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, not cakey at all, don&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> This concealer has amazing coverage and is creamy but dries to a soft matte. It actually has more coverage than the NARS wand concealer and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so great since it&#x27;s not that expensive, and I tried the Fit Me foundation and hated it.&lt;br /&gt;But this concealer has really great coverage and feels so light. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines, though you can easily use a primer with it if you want for more assurance. I use this for blemishes, redness, and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something about my dark circles for a second. They&#x27;re absolutely terrible, and no amount of makeup has ever been able to make them go away or be reduced by much. I fell deeply in love with this concealer because the lighter tones don&#x27;t tend to have worse/sheerer coverage, which is a trend I notice with other concealers. It stays opaque and all you have to do is lightly pat it around the horrible gray/purple/ohgodwhyme colored area with your ring fingers. It doesn&#x27;t look unnaturally heavy and it stays really well, especially if set with some kind of powder.&lt;br /&gt;The only very tiny problem with it is that the tube makes the concealer look very slightly darker than it really is, but it&#x27;s really not a huge deal or something you can avoid with any brand. I would say it&#x27;s quite true to color.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is kind of neat, I think. It&#x27;s very minimalist and chic, and you can very easily travel with it since the lid is actually quite tight and the tube is pretty durable. Don&#x27;t let its thin design fool you; there&#x27;s quite a lot of product in this, not to mention the great pigmentation means you don&#x27;t have to use so much in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited over this that I wish I could give it more than five stars. Maybelline, as many problems as we&#x27;ve had over the years, you have made the only drugstore concealer that is any good for all purposes and is definitely worth the money. I think I&#x27;ll have to buy enough backups to last for the next few decades. Talk about a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer. Very good both under eyes and on blemishes or acne scars. Not drying or irritating for dry and sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause me acne. It&#x27;s the easiest and smoothest formula of concealer I&#x27;ve worked with and despite the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; color being a pink undertone and therefore not a perfect match for my yellow toned super light porcelain skin-it blends right in and doesn&#x27;t seem to be noticeable. I would highly recommend this concealer for everyone to try but I don&#x27;t if those that are quite oily will enjoy this or if it will have that great of lasting power on pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars only because it dries my skin out a little. Other than that it is a decent concealer for the price.</li>
            <li> You need this concealer in your life! Beautiful finish and great coverage, I use it to highlight and conceal.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very comfortable to apply. It has a light coverage serves for everyday wear makeup. It moves very well in the face. The price seems great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAIR color is too white, I was wrong to ask that tone, I will use the illuminator.</li>
