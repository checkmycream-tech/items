            <li> This container is smaller than I expected, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> it tends to be really wet and comes off too much and when dries sometimes leaves white resedew.it is a small bottle</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is that SO much of the product comes out on the wand and it gets a little messy.</li>
            <li> This keeps your brows where you want them to be all day long!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to firmly hold my brows in place--I use brow wax and powder and I wanted a product that would hold my natural brow hairs in place, drying clear and a little stiff (like hair apray)</li>
            <li> Its hard to find clear brow gel</li>
            <li> I usually scrape 99% of it back into the bottle before I apply it to my brows.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, to bad its package so small.</li>
            <li> MARY KAY NEVER LETS YOU DOWN</li>
            <li> I wd recommend this product to a friend.i tried other brands &amp; this 1 is the winner!</li>
            <li> Wouldnt expect anything less from Amazon and Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> i have very thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed. Bought it from recomendation in a beauty magazine, but it does absolutely nothing. I have applied more than one coat and still brows go right back to natural shape. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> i have very thin eyebrows so this allows me to fill them in with eyebrow pencil then apply this product and my brows stay in place</li>
            <li> This product definitely keeps my brows in place. It doesn&#x27;t gum up or flake. My only problem with it is that SO much of the product comes out on the wand and it gets a little messy. I usually scrape 99% of it back into the bottle before I apply it to my brows. The product itself works great though!</li>
            <li> I am always a big fan of mary kay products and this brow get is no different keeps my brow in place for the day.</li>
            <li> Luv it. Makes my eyebrows have volume.</li>
            <li> I love this brow gel.  Its hard to find clear brow gel and this is the perfect addition to my makeup regiment!</li>
            <li> Never used Brow Gel before and I love it.  Even brows have a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; and this gel keeps them in place all day.  Adds to the outline of the brow.  Would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> It goes on natural, not greasy! I wd recommend this product to a friend.i tried other brands &amp; this 1 is the winner!</li>
            <li> This gel was not what I was looking for. I wanted a gel that had some color to it. However, if you want a gel to hold your eyebrows in place this is a good gel.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to firmly hold my brows in place--I use brow wax and powder and I wanted a product that would hold my natural brow hairs in place, drying clear and a little stiff (like hair apray)</li>
            <li> This product has a pretty good applicator and i like it&#x27;s small size. the thing i dont like about it.is that you get the white flaky stuff when it dryies up.</li>
            <li> .  I will use it until it runs out but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I like this alot, does what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, to bad its package so small. This stays put all day long and helps my brows look GREAT!</li>
            <li> This container is smaller than I expected, but it works very well. No flakes or residue. Next time I will purchase multiple tubes.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay Brow Gel for quite a while and love it.  It goes on clear and dries clear and stays on all day.  I would not use anything else.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works well but it has parabens. If I knew this I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it. I wont be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Very good product .. works wonderfully.  Wouldnt expect anything less from Amazon and Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> MARY KAY NEVER LETS YOU DOWN</li>
            <li> This keeps your brows where you want them to be all day long!! Did just what I wanted it to do ! very good product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before used a brow gel, rather allowing my hairs to do their own thing, but hearing about this product from a friend, I decided to order it.  Amazon made it easy since I was already in the middle of an order and it was an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very glad to be able to look more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; after applying my makeup.  Such a wonderful application.</li>
            <li> i like this brow gel because it lasts for a decent amount of time, it dont last 12 hours....more like 5...when i apply it sometimes it takes off the color underneath. it tends to be really wet and comes off too much and when dries sometimes leaves white resedew.it is a small bottle but i was glad i got this.sorry for all the negative feedback....just trying to inform everyone.</li>
