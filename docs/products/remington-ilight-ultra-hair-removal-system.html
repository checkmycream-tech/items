            <li>Gotta go order more bulbs!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Remington iLight Pro!  </li>
            <li>I definitely love it for bikini season!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t elaborate more except when the wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li>This laser is the best price &amp; works great &amp; is far better price than the Flash &amp; Go</li>
            <li>this is an amazing item..</li>
            <li>But honestly, I&#x27;ve done that 1 out of 18 I&#x27;ve ordered (if that eases anyone&#x27;s mind).</li>
            <li>Handy way</li>
            <li>o getting your own hair removal with the laser technology.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the refill is just as good.</li>
            <li>Guys,stay tidy, if you do not like being \\&quot;hairy\\</li>
            <li>and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>it is a excellent product and it work very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe the was an honest mistake from the company.</li>
            <li>Some kind of glitch between this item and the manufacturers equipment of the laser.</li>
            <li>love the iLight, and these refills are pretty cheap (Subscribe &amp; Save!!!!!)</li>
            <li>Easy to install and lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>The cartridge is very easy to replace.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Is very good, I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li>It works really good on areas that are realy have light color skin</li>
            <li>so I have been really surprised and impressed at the results.  </li>
            <li>I recommended the product to 02 more friends, they are also bought and loving the results of the product......</li>
            <li>So, so far this zapping system does seem to work best.  </li>
            <li>The first replacement light did not even do one leg lower leg, maybe 40-50 pulses, as best.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good, and the hair does stay away for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>These were priced about $5 lower than most stores and with free shipping, made it a good buy.</li>
            <li>Works great, if you stay consistent.</li>
            <li>It works just fine!</li>
            <li>Everything went very smooth.</li>
            <li>With their free shipping on $25, you&#x27;ll save on shipping if you can just find something for $5 more!  </li>
            <li>Did underarms 2 times, and that&#x27;s it , the light burned out !</li>
            <li>Okay, I have gone through two cartridges since I have had my iLight.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I am going to add these replacements on my gift list for people to buy me! :)</li>
            <li>Thank You! :)</li>
            <li>Love the I-Light pro</li>
            <li>I love the Remington iLight.  </li>
            <li>I have been using laser hair remover more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>More to come.</li>
            <li>It has taken more treatments than was instructed to achieve minimum results.</li>
            <li>I find that with the cost of the machine, and replacing bulbs once a month, that eventually I would be better off with a Groupon for laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more when I will need them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be contacting Remington this week and hope for a better outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, I was able to cover my legs, thighs, stomach and chest one just one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought another, going to retreat.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to that as of yet, but I will revise this review once I start using this more.</li>
            <li>but i wanted to try for more sessions</li>
            <li>Love the machine.</li>
            <li>It works better with the darker hair for sure.  </li>
            <li>I also use it much more often than instructed, probably every 2-3 days on the highest strength.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this home laser system and could not be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Remington hair removal system.</li>
            <li>I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen to most, but felt the need to post this review as something to consider.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times  </li>
            <li>love it works wonders and seller is great fast delivery</li>
            <li>Love my I-light Pro.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Still love this.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did anyway.  </li>
            <li>Works great and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love what this product does, but the bulbs are inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>Okay price on a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it with no issues as they stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I know what thay&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I would like this machine better</li>
            <li>I was sure it was not going to work, and have been amazed.  </li>
            <li>-and legs are smooth for days!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I happy with the product, thanks</li>
            <li>but I was able to get it to work again</li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to do my own hair removal when I have the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it WAY more than it says to achieve hair loss, and I have yet to see results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Using a longer flash interval of probably 6 - 8 seconds would probably be okay for continuous use.</li>
            <li>From my experience I think you&#x27;ll be able to extend the lamp&#x27;s life</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>It was very easy tu buy the product and everythin went fine.</li>
            <li>The hair is still coming in thinner, which I greatly appreciate, but I liked it better when it actually went away for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Would say I&#x27;m generally happy -- and generally smooth haha -- with</li>
            <li>I bought it for 300 Australian Dollars, in a very good deal.</li>
            <li>I am glad that this cartridge is still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge does seem to need to be replaced sooner than the 1300 or so light pulses it claims, but I may have used it more than I realized.</li>
            <li>perfect arrived faster than expected will buy again</li>
            <li>If it gets anywhere near the 1500 flashes if will be great.</li>
            <li>I used the first cartridge in one prolonged setting, where I was able to do both legs WITHOUT being able to start the bikini or top of legs; and (fore) arms.</li>
            <li>They burn up too easily.  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>so i got another replacement cartiladge, they are really easy to switch out</li>
            <li>Cartridges are easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Easy to change.</li>
            <li>The system itself costs over $200 and when you&#x27;re paying over $20 for each bulb it gets costly very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy the device works</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, does the job as described</li>
            <li>Price was good too!&lt;br /&gt;Really nice to find something this personal to do at home.</li>
            <li>Now, after 4th session, the treated area are rather becoming free of hair.</li>
            <li>Everything worked fine</li>
            <li>i have dark hair, light skin, just perfect for this.</li>
            <li>Buy cartridges on Amazon, cheap and easy to get with Prime.  </li>
            <li>but if u use safety lenses aka/tanning booth its fine i use it on my face..</li>
            <li>is working really good, the bulb light has been wroking without any issue, and the ressults are going as the promissed, so far, is a 5 star review!</li>
            <li>the manual said that this item is damage, because the i light pro sound but do not flash the light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was amazing fast.</li>
            <li>Had to replace my light cartridge today.  </li>
            <li>If you are a hairy person this will take a lot of light bulb replacements.</li>
            <li>have a more exciting side benefit.  </li>
            <li>Light skin and brown hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, used it a few times and can see the results.</li>
            <li>This brings up an important debate.  </li>
            <li>Does this light yield 1500 flashes?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 90% hair free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have an effective 2 uses than an ineffective 5 uses.  </li>
            <li>it does take a bit of your free time to cover the areas of hair removal you want.</li>
            <li>I normally am happy with these but the last one is a dude.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews say you can overheat the light and crack it.</li>
            <li>Keeping track of the light flashes since that has been an issue for some making posts.</li>
            <li>am using I light hair removal</li>
            <li>so now i have a couple of smooth patches in my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paying for professional laser treatment would&#x27;ve been more cost effective.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!i really love it and for sure</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned in my review of the IPL machine it significantly extends the time between shavings but doesn&#x27;t even come close to three months of being hair free.</li>
            <li>My best results were with laser light treatment in the past</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good design as far as keeping the lamp cool</li>
            <li>I am excited to hear and see others results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I managed to purchase 3-pack in such a good price - almost same as a 2-pack.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 months, hair growth on my chest is still there but slowed significantly.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Works just like the original.</li>
            <li>She is still useing the original cartridge that came with the machine.</li>
            <li>The first light that came with my machine let me do my legs, top and bottom, my underarms and my bikini line for 3 full treatments.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a week, doubling up on each area  for each session, and after about 3 months had significant hair reduction.  </li>
            <li>I have had professional laser hair removal performed at my dermatologist&#x27;s medical spa with excellent results, but the cost adds up.</li>
            <li>I have it fixed in Melbourne for many more $.</li>
            <li>Easy and economical replacement lights</li>
            <li>Like most reviewers here, my first bulb lasted just about 2 full uses, but it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they said to clean the cone and when that didn&#x27;t work to call.</li>
            <li>, I keep cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol on hand while using the unit, to clean the vaporized debris off of the lens whenever anything is seen on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To clean that off I remove the lamp.</li>
            <li>To clean that off I remove the lamp.</li>
            <li>Definitely effective, although several (more than three) repeats were needed.</li>
            <li>I have experienced limited results.</li>
            <li>The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts.</li>
            <li>The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the cartridge it was working fine before the new one.</li>
            <li>This device is amazing and saved me $1000s on getting professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li>This is a good deal and will keep buying however my unwanted hair is not coming back</li>
            <li>I do feel that they last a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>What more do you really need to know?</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I love this thing so much</li>
            <li>The hair there was quite think and full.</li>
            <li>got a replacement bulb here at Amazon and it worked for about 5 full uses, but not as well.  </li>
            <li>The second light I was able to finish my legs and do my underarms and most of my bikini line and than it too stopped.</li>
            <li>However, the hair is taking a looooonnng time to grow back, which is good.  </li>
            <li>The product appears to operate as advertised but I am unsure of results as I have not used for the full length of the recommended time period.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I will keep working with it and live a hair free life. :)</li>
            <li>Happy they are more reasonable than the other laser treatment machines.</li>
            <li>Unit is easy to use, results already evident.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones, so I can&#x27;t compare them, but I like this one and these refills are great.</li>
            <li>I did get pregnant and stopped using it....</li>
            <li>With this many issues, I don&#x27;t want to invest in even more cartridges for a possibly defective machine.  </li>
            <li>Works well, and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt and is quick to use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve skipped probably four weeks now because of how quickly these bulbs die.  </li>
            <li>Try several times, the feeling is very good, for the axillary and Bikini effect is very obvious, with some fine hair effect is not obvious, will continue to use, very love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remington, please change your product description to be more honest and upfront about what your product can actually do on a reliable basis, rather than what it might be capable of in some fantasy universe you&#x27;ve dreamed up.</li>
            <li>With lower power it takes longer but last longer too other wise the device works good as a replacement. .</li>
            <li>Love my Remington, Had to find a new place to get replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I thought that was about right because it said 2-3 full treatments.  </li>
            <li>So far have had it for 3 months and seems to be pretty effective.</li>
            <li>The first four were good, but the last one just burst out whileI was using it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am positive there is no way it gave the number of light emissions it claimed it would.  </li>
            <li>Used exactly as directed didn&#x27;t see any results and I was patient!</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, this product works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>The I Light system works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already reviewed the machine these are made for (the more important factor), so I&#x27;ll be brief here.</li>
            <li>I used level 5 the entire time and to be honest, some areas flashed</li>
            <li>I purchase these refills because I obviously own the Remington iLight hair removal system, so my opinion is directly related to the system itself.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>says 3 hole body treaent worth phffttt did underarms bikinni area</li>
            <li>These bulbs and the remington pro machine was worth just for that.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth that price.</li>
            <li>(all hair doesn&#x27;t grow at once, each follicle has its&#x27; own cycle, and you have to hit each cycle with the laser a couple/few times in order to penetrate - hence multiple times over a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works..but only kind of.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it was no where near the 1500 flashes</li>
            <li>Clearly, the replacement cartridges are an issue as it&#x27;s noted in many reviews, maybe it&#x27;s time to fix the problem</li>
            <li>Keep a spare on hand to avoid not being able to complete a treatment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and actually works, but it runs out way too fast</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used the I-Light device that much, so I am still on the original light bulb.</li>
            <li>With the original bulb that came with the machine I was able to do my legs, bikini and my husband&#x27;s back three times over.</li>
            <li>just received and tested, and packaging was all right.</li>
            <li>I did use up one full cartridge and was glad to have a second on hand.  </li>
            <li>If they lasted longer, it would be better, but they need a little more power as well.</li>
            <li>I have large spots without hair!</li>
            <li>Purchased for adult daughter&#x27;s use, haven&#x27;t heard much about it so it must be okay...</li>
            <li>I have empty patches of hair whenever I use it which I think is great because I don&#x27;t feel I have to shave as frequently as I did before I started using the Remington iLight</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well, and burn out super fast.</li>
            <li>Used regularly, this product works amazing and will save so much money rather than visiting the laser clinic.</li>
            <li>to keep it totally fuzz free and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This unit really should have been designed with a much higher airflow to cool the lamp and maybe have incorporated some heatsinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came also very fast with no problems.</li>
            <li>The first one came with the machine.</li>
            <li>I have not found better pricing for these refills outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Only have to touch up spots with a razor in the shower every 4-5 days versus a full shave every 2-3 days to stay hair free.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge lasts longer, if you do not allow it to get too hot during treatment by using it for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>I used it 3 times in the first 2 weeks then once a week afterward.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working but by the end of the week, there was noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>She loves it, uses it weekly, and still hasn&#x27;t burned out the first cartridge it came</li>
            <li>they work great.need to order more actually.</li>
            <li>It may work - but really really hurts!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So far I am totally smooth under my arms, and almost all leg hair is gone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first cartridge that came with the unit lasted me 2 1/2 treatments.  </li>
            <li>My first time replacing the bulb in my I-Light.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>The replacement cartridges don&#x27;t last more than 500 flashes.  </li>
            <li>(and my hair is pin straight!).  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>needs a higher setting i can take the pain.  </li>
            <li>Must shave first then use laser after.</li>
            <li>The previous light lasted a bit more than 1500 flashes.</li>
            <li>The replacement cartdridge has worked so far as well as the original cartridge worked.</li>
            <li>I have lots of thick, black hair on light skin, so that&#x27;s perfect for the system; it won&#x27;t work as well on lighter hair or darker skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, if you have specific areas your looking for help with, this is a good option in my opinion</li>
            <li>disposable cartridge provides 1,500 flashes for 2-3 full body treatments.&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one third of that</li>
            <li>The best part is that I have dark hair, and you can always see the black dots of hair even after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have done three full treatments and one partial and am still on the first light cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I see that could be possible except the first replacement light did not even get the change to get hot</li>
            <li>I have used the machine on my full body around 9 times so far.</li>
            <li>She could get flashes somewhere in the range of 1,000 pulses, but only the first 500s are super powerful; they still work after that, but they lose their power gradually.</li>
            <li>Although it is not meant for the pubic region, it can be done if this is your goal but be warned some areas are SUPER sensitive.</li>
            <li>This item was fairly easy to use, but after almost 3 months and ordering a second cartridge I still was not getting the results advertised.</li>
            <li>That leaves me free from shaving or lasering for the next couple of months - really!  </li>
            <li>And the results certainly aren&#x27;t permanent.  </li>
            <li>Use only on my legs and under arms and will last about 3 full sessions for the most part.</li>
            <li>The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM.</li>
            <li>The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my legs are not very large, so I couldn&#x27;t have used that many pulses.</li>
            <li>Seems to be fine, although I am using it moderately.</li>
            <li>This will be fine as a maintenance tool but not so much for the initial job.</li>
            <li>much prefer the Bella light system from Israel, large coverage area, cartridges last quite a while at maximum setting  </li>
            <li>_ i.e., does it really work to stop hair growth?</li>
            <li>but I really like my Remington hair remover.</li>
            <li>The product as a whole (Bulb and Unit) is a dud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more in bulbs than I did for the unit</li>
            <li>It is really works.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works.</li>
            <li>but it seems to really work - hardy have to shave at all at this point.</li>
            <li>People might not have real expectations for lazer hair removal</li>
            <li>The light is suppose to last for 1500 pulses, I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 of the lights and none of them have lasted for 1500 pulses.  </li>
            <li>Remington really missed the boat on this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>This is just a replacement light, but the overall IPL product works well.</li>
            <li>Recommend the whole system</li>
            <li>You have to use it a lot to see professional outcomes, however it is still useful and it&#x27;s convenient to have it at home.</li>
            <li>Yesterday the yellow light warning was on again.</li>
            <li>The light cartridge that my I-Light Pro came with lasted for several applications (each under arm area).</li>
            <li>If you get one of these be prepared to buy a dozen cartridges before you see any real results.</li>
            <li>The product does work, but the light cartridges don&#x27;t last as they should -</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get rid of the hair, but if you keep at it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>It really slows hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>I had looked at the price of the replacement cartridge before I bought the system and that really helped me make the decision to go ahead and buy the I-light Pro hair removal system.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s worth it even at 1 treatment per cartridge</li>
            <li>And 1500 flashes does not cover nearly as much as they say.</li>
            <li>and then if I keep trying it does a real flash.</li>
            <li>My wife really raves about it, so it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This really does work well.</li>
            <li>I really like not having to shave so often.  </li>
            <li>Between shaves, I just get back a light number of hairs on legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li>In my whole life, I&#x27;ve had razor stubble and burn, so this is a delight.  </li>
            <li>very spotty,  </li>
            <li>The whole hair removal system is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>To get much success out of this product, I had to completely ignore the directions.  </li>
            <li>Crank it straight up to max each time.  </li>
            <li>I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was not the whole system.</li>
            <li>Having read the reviews, I felt informed and had what I thought to be reasonable expectations.</li>
            <li>The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used others remove hair sistems but was very painfull, with the Remington IPL Pro no pain.</li>
            <li>first one 2 full treatments, 2nd one, one treatment</li>
            <li>By the time you are done with the number of sessions you need, you&#x27;ll actually spend more than paying for professional hair removal.</li>
            <li>The hair is very fine and much of it grows at a super slow rate.</li>
            <li>It does cause some considerable pain if not set at the right level.</li>
            <li>I was busy though and so hadn&#x27;t used it right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with long cords, both from the outlet and to the hand held zapper.</li>
            <li>the results are more visible after the second or third session, but i dont know how many sessions until the long term results</li>
            <li>Some locations hurt more than others, without a doubt, but it&#x27;s definitely bearable, and we&#x27;ve seen no ill effects anyplace (though it&#x27;s possible to singe your skin a bit with the super-bright flashes, so beware!).</li>
            <li>The original bulb lasted 5-6 treatments, but the replacement bulb only lasted one treatment.  </li>
            <li>Okay, we all think we are smarter than the directions, so if you start out on a higher level, you do get a little zap...</li>
            <li>The replacement seems to be lasting longer than the original cartridge that came with the laser.  </li>
            <li>Fair skin, dark hair... technically this system should really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Between uses pull the hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  In full disclosure, I had to send my machine back to Remington while it was still under warranty.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is supposed to last for 3 full body applications and was not sufficient for two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it still has developed a fine tangle of tiny fractures all around the cathode</li>
            <li>Light works great, too bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve counted pulses as well and mine usually only last for 700 pulses at most.  </li>
            <li>The light won&#x27;t flash most of the time and it&#x27;s frustrating.  </li>
            <li>Some people complaint about short lamp life, which I too have experienced.</li>
            <li>have been using the iLight for a couple years, and while my hair still pretty much grows back, I have actually noticed that the backs of my calves are completely hair free, my bikini line is thinner, and my underarm hair is much finer.  </li>
            <li>Uggggg High Cost but does work.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After the first few times of use, I went through the first bulb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping the flash intervals at greater than 4 seconds with rest periods of a minute if I feel any little amount of warmth of the air venting out of the hand unit.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, too - I have used 6-7 times in 6 months and not all hair is gone, but its a lot less and much easier to shave.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t cool very fast because no real airflow is happening within the confines of the reflectors to cool the center section of the tube.</li>
            <li>wow didnt even get one whole treament oop that was meant for the system i just got</li>
            <li>While my legs did not stay as smooth as daily shaving, after 4 treatments the hair growth is much thinner, lighter and I only have to shave once a week in bathing suit weather to stay looking hairless.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, it&#x27;s like the professional machines.</li>
            <li>been using this thing for about a year; between the two of us, we&#x27;ve probably used it on pretty much every square inch of the human body.  </li>
            <li>I love this machine - in just a few months</li>
            <li>Overall, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Your hair must be really dark (practically black) for it to really work, unlike professional which will pick up more lightly colored hair.</li>
            <li>JUst make sure to shave first, or it smells like burning hair and is a bit more painful.</li>
            <li>, I have to buy other one, because I need replaice this light.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m probably out of luck unless I want to gamble on a new one.  </li>
            <li>i fitted a new globe and still did not work</li>
            <li>And I need a new replacement cartridge to continue.</li>
            <li>If you are diligent and cover every inch, then you&#x27;ll have to buy a new cartridge after every use.</li>
            <li>and if that isn&#x27;t it I&#x27;d need to buy a new cone.</li>
            <li>Obviously, we&#x27;ve found that they last longer if you use the lower light level...</li>
            <li>Once the unit&#x27;s yellow light came on (indicating the life of the cartridge nearing the end), there were maybe 30 pulses left.  </li>
            <li>Waxing may be very smooth for a few days but really, when the hairs grown back it&#x27;s ingrown all the time</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re planning on going somewhere and paying for $1000s, try this first, it&#x27;s the same lazer!</li>
            <li>it was as expected, good thing that i ordered this item in advance because the cartridge of the unit i bought dies earlier as expected</li>
            <li>I am light skinned with black hair on my legs</li>
            <li>I purchased this second light when I bought the main unit knowing that I would eventually need it, in stalled t today and it fits and works as expected.</li>
            <li>The second cartridge was usable for two half-legs (top of knees down) and arms before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy the system after reading some of the reviews about the light not lasting very long.  </li>
            <li>Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.e hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>have white skin and very dark hair, so I expected good results on my body.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned this cartridge performs as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 18th</li>
            <li>This is the second buy of this product and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First light cartridge did not last as long as expected.</li>
            <li>The end results are still far from my liking, but with perseverance might get there.</li>
            <li>order this lam for the Remington professional IPL hair removal system lamp did worked for 1500 pulses then died off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of hair, but nothing compared to professional results.</li>
            <li>So far I have not shed any hair yet.  </li>
            <li>But it is still a lot cheaper than professional services.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve emailed them, but my machine is over 1 year old</li>
            <li>my armpit skin is smoothe and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>The I-Light Pro eliminated that completely</li>
            <li>and wow you can tell it is working.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing compared to professional laser.</li>
            <li>IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System]] as a gift for my wife in January 2012, and</li>
            <li>My hair has been growing back much slower and thinner.</li>
            <li>only concern is that cartridges are very variable...</li>
            <li>there were no where near 1500 flashes in each cartridge, and I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product for people who wants a longer lasting hair removal and don&#x27;t want to deal with the wax products.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work just like the professional ones do.</li>
            <li>I have shaved my hairy areas maybe once in the last two years...and much of the hair has never returned.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, this has cut the leg hair to about 1/3 of what I had and underarm hair (which was a LOT) is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it hurts like hell on any sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>Shaving straight alone leads to razor burn by the next day.  </li>
            <li>such a great product has this flaw, but at least it can be partially worked around.</li>
            <li>This last so much longer.  </li>
            <li>My underarms have not been so lucky, but I believe that this is because I epilated about a month before receiving my machine and this hair hadn&#x27;t yet become active.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my Remington unit, but I just bought this replacement cartridge and it only worked for a few pulses...</li>
            <li>To do 2 sessions a week - if you have a fair amount of hair and are trying to cover all -  is going to require 2 cartridges a week - another $50/wk+ --- which is expensive.</li>
            <li>I am extremely skeptical now and am unsure if it would be wise to purchase another replacement cartridge from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I almost got two full body treatments (underarm, bikini, and legs from mid-thigh down) from one cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Never really worked and boke right after the month warranty.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to complete the job of the recommended 3 sessions, so be sure to buy multiple.</li>
            <li>On the 2nd or 3rd highest setting never tried anything higher.  </li>
            <li>the cartridges don&#x27;t last for more than 3-5 uses on SMALL areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Power seems to low, only some hairs are burned and others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After several months using it as instructed, and sometimes applying more than one time in the same area in the same day</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend this product to remove hair, though it does not work well on blonde hairs</li>
            <li>I have gone thru 3 or 4 cartridges, though, as I have a lot of thick hair, and have done both arms, legs (upper and lower) and bikini line, and under arms, and fingers, toes (seriously) and even though it says its not for face, I used on upper lip with great success and no problem.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;i used it six months ago it is economic and till now solve problem partially hope by frequent use solve it completely</li>
            <li>This might be intentional as the company will make more profits selling the cartridges than the product itself or this cartridges are really not good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend not buying this one and instead going for their new device, which can last for 30,000 flashes.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed the bulbs did not last as long as advertised, but i thing there close to 1500.  </li>
            <li>Light blinks yellow instead of green.</li>
            <li>The hairs are actually quite thick and many of them.</li>
            <li>A full series of three treatments, and I am down to only needing to shave once a week.</li>
            <li>followed all the directions and only use it on max power level and still getting growth back in certain areas that have been treated multiple times after nearly 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>But anything higher than 500 dollars, I would consider it closely and compare with some other options.</li>
            <li>First bulb didn&#x27;t last as long as expected but the product absolutely helps reduce the thickness and quantity of hair on treated areas.</li>
            <li>Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.</li>
            <li>This part of the product description is a complete and utter lie: &amp;#34;Each</li>
            <li>I think that so far all the cartridges i got are lasting up to 1,500 shots as stated.</li>
            <li>So far I can not see a big improvement.</li>
            <li>So, when I received my replacement, I figured I would get nearly the same quality.</li>
            <li>I have not counted, but apparently it does not.  </li>
            <li>I waited too long for a replacement cartridge but to try a new one</li>
            <li>The first lamp lasted less than 100 lights.</li>
            <li>It is a bit painful at first, but very easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>Of course, if you have a Remington iLight Pro you want to use, you don&#x27;t really have any other choice but to buy these cartridges.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve burned through 2 lamp cartridges (on my 3rd) and have only attempted to treat my hands and arms (not arm pits mind</li>
            <li>I definitely did not get anywhere near that amount of use with the bulb that came standard with the actual iLight unit.</li>
            <li>The lights are a little expensive but worth it to have such smooth legs!</li>
            <li>But my hair is very stubborn from previous laser hair removals.  </li>
            <li>Well, It does last as long as it says and I have never had one die early.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>ive been using the remington for 6 months once a week on my second replacement head this system doesnt work and is a waste of money i have light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>A like it works but not long enough</li>
            <li>No defects, consistent pulses, and so far, in the 3 sessions I&#x27;ve performed, I&#x27;ve used at least 100-150 pulses in total...</li>
            <li>I have hated dark hair, fair skin combo on my legs for 40 years....too cheap for pro laser....</li>
            <li>even though the product really works, the cartridges don&#x27;t last even 500 flashes, maybe even less</li>
            <li>The price of the replacement lights is very high for what little results are produced.  </li>
            <li>Bought this due to my new unit misfiring.</li>
            <li>Light bulb fits well and is again working, however, they seem to have a short life which is disappointing, thanks</li>

            <li> I absolutely love my Remington iLight Pro!  </li>
            <li> I definitely love it for bikini season!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t elaborate more except when the wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> This laser is the best price &amp; works great &amp; is far better price than the Flash &amp; Go</li>
            <li> this is an amazing item..</li>
            <li> But honestly, I&#x27;ve done that 1 out of 18 I&#x27;ve ordered (if that eases anyone&#x27;s mind).</li>
            <li> Handy way</li>
            <li> o getting your own hair removal with the laser technology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the refill is just as good.</li>
            <li> Guys,stay tidy, if you do not like being \\&quot;hairy\\</li>
            <li> and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> it is a excellent product and it work very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe the was an honest mistake from the company.</li>
            <li> Some kind of glitch between this item and the manufacturers equipment of the laser.</li>
            <li> love the iLight, and these refills are pretty cheap (Subscribe &amp; Save!!!!!)</li>
            <li> Easy to install and lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Is very good, I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li> It works really good on areas that are realy have light color skin</li>
            <li> so I have been really surprised and impressed at the results.  </li>
            <li> I recommended the product to 02 more friends, they are also bought and loving the results of the product......</li>
            <li> So, so far this zapping system does seem to work best.  </li>
            <li> The first replacement light did not even do one leg lower leg, maybe 40-50 pulses, as best.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good, and the hair does stay away for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> These were priced about $5 lower than most stores and with free shipping, made it a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works great, if you stay consistent.</li>
            <li> It works just fine!</li>
            <li> Everything went very smooth.</li>
            <li> With their free shipping on $25, you&#x27;ll save on shipping if you can just find something for $5 more!  </li>
            <li> Did underarms 2 times, and that&#x27;s it , the light burned out !</li>
            <li> Okay, I have gone through two cartridges since I have had my iLight.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I am going to add these replacements on my gift list for people to buy me! :)</li>
            <li> Thank You! :)</li>
            <li> Love the I-Light pro</li>
            <li> I love the Remington iLight.  </li>
            <li> I have been using laser hair remover more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> More to come.</li>
            <li> It has taken more treatments than was instructed to achieve minimum results.</li>
            <li> I find that with the cost of the machine, and replacing bulbs once a month, that eventually I would be better off with a Groupon for laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more when I will need them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be contacting Remington this week and hope for a better outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, I was able to cover my legs, thighs, stomach and chest one just one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought another, going to retreat.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to that as of yet, but I will revise this review once I start using this more.</li>
            <li> but i wanted to try for more sessions</li>
            <li> Love the machine.</li>
            <li> It works better with the darker hair for sure.  </li>
            <li> I also use it much more often than instructed, probably every 2-3 days on the highest strength.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this home laser system and could not be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Remington hair removal system.</li>
            <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen to most, but felt the need to post this review as something to consider.</li>
            <li> I have used this many times  </li>
            <li> love it works wonders and seller is great fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love my I-light Pro.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Still love this.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did anyway.  </li>
            <li> Works great and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love what this product does, but the bulbs are inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> Okay price on a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it with no issues as they stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I know what thay&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I would like this machine better</li>
            <li> I was sure it was not going to work, and have been amazed.  </li>
            <li> -and legs are smooth for days!  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I happy with the product, thanks</li>
            <li> but I was able to get it to work again</li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to do my own hair removal when I have the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it WAY more than it says to achieve hair loss, and I have yet to see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Using a longer flash interval of probably 6 - 8 seconds would probably be okay for continuous use.</li>
            <li> From my experience I think you&#x27;ll be able to extend the lamp&#x27;s life</li>
            <li> Love the results.</li>
            <li> It was very easy tu buy the product and everythin went fine.</li>
            <li> The hair is still coming in thinner, which I greatly appreciate, but I liked it better when it actually went away for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Would say I&#x27;m generally happy -- and generally smooth haha -- with</li>
            <li> I bought it for 300 Australian Dollars, in a very good deal.</li>
            <li> I am glad that this cartridge is still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge does seem to need to be replaced sooner than the 1300 or so light pulses it claims, but I may have used it more than I realized.</li>
            <li> perfect arrived faster than expected will buy again</li>
            <li> If it gets anywhere near the 1500 flashes if will be great.</li>
            <li> I used the first cartridge in one prolonged setting, where I was able to do both legs WITHOUT being able to start the bikini or top of legs; and (fore) arms.</li>
            <li> They burn up too easily.  </li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> so i got another replacement cartiladge, they are really easy to switch out</li>
            <li> Cartridges are easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Easy to change.</li>
            <li> The system itself costs over $200 and when you&#x27;re paying over $20 for each bulb it gets costly very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like how easy the device works</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does the job as described</li>
            <li> Price was good too!&lt;br /&gt;Really nice to find something this personal to do at home.</li>
            <li> Now, after 4th session, the treated area are rather becoming free of hair.</li>
            <li> Everything worked fine</li>
            <li> i have dark hair, light skin, just perfect for this.</li>
            <li> Buy cartridges on Amazon, cheap and easy to get with Prime.  </li>
            <li> but if u use safety lenses aka/tanning booth its fine i use it on my face..</li>
            <li> is working really good, the bulb light has been wroking without any issue, and the ressults are going as the promissed, so far, is a 5 star review!</li>
            <li> the manual said that this item is damage, because the i light pro sound but do not flash the light</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was amazing fast.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my light cartridge today.  </li>
            <li> If you are a hairy person this will take a lot of light bulb replacements.</li>
            <li> have a more exciting side benefit.  </li>
            <li> Light skin and brown hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, used it a few times and can see the results.</li>
            <li> This brings up an important debate.  </li>
            <li> Does this light yield 1500 flashes?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 90% hair free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have an effective 2 uses than an ineffective 5 uses.  </li>
            <li> it does take a bit of your free time to cover the areas of hair removal you want.</li>
            <li> I normally am happy with these but the last one is a dude.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews say you can overheat the light and crack it.</li>
            <li> Keeping track of the light flashes since that has been an issue for some making posts.</li>
            <li> am using I light hair removal</li>
            <li> so now i have a couple of smooth patches in my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paying for professional laser treatment would&#x27;ve been more cost effective.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!i really love it and for sure</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned in my review of the IPL machine it significantly extends the time between shavings but doesn&#x27;t even come close to three months of being hair free.</li>
            <li> My best results were with laser light treatment in the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good design as far as keeping the lamp cool</li>
            <li> I am excited to hear and see others results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I managed to purchase 3-pack in such a good price - almost same as a 2-pack.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 months, hair growth on my chest is still there but slowed significantly.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Works just like the original.</li>
            <li> She is still useing the original cartridge that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> The first light that came with my machine let me do my legs, top and bottom, my underarms and my bikini line for 3 full treatments.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a week, doubling up on each area  for each session, and after about 3 months had significant hair reduction.  </li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal performed at my dermatologist&#x27;s medical spa with excellent results, but the cost adds up.</li>
            <li> I have it fixed in Melbourne for many more $.</li>
            <li> Easy and economical replacement lights</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers here, my first bulb lasted just about 2 full uses, but it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they said to clean the cone and when that didn&#x27;t work to call.</li>
            <li> , I keep cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol on hand while using the unit, to clean the vaporized debris off of the lens whenever anything is seen on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To clean that off I remove the lamp.</li>
            <li> To clean that off I remove the lamp.</li>
            <li> Definitely effective, although several (more than three) repeats were needed.</li>
            <li> I have experienced limited results.</li>
            <li> The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts.</li>
            <li> The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the cartridge it was working fine before the new one.</li>
            <li> This device is amazing and saved me $1000s on getting professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li> This is a good deal and will keep buying however my unwanted hair is not coming back</li>
            <li> I do feel that they last a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> What more do you really need to know?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I love this thing so much</li>
            <li> The hair there was quite think and full.</li>
            <li> got a replacement bulb here at Amazon and it worked for about 5 full uses, but not as well.  </li>
            <li> The second light I was able to finish my legs and do my underarms and most of my bikini line and than it too stopped.</li>
            <li> However, the hair is taking a looooonnng time to grow back, which is good.  </li>
            <li> The product appears to operate as advertised but I am unsure of results as I have not used for the full length of the recommended time period.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> I will keep working with it and live a hair free life. :)</li>
            <li> Happy they are more reasonable than the other laser treatment machines.</li>
            <li> Unit is easy to use, results already evident.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones, so I can&#x27;t compare them, but I like this one and these refills are great.</li>
            <li> I did get pregnant and stopped using it....</li>
            <li> With this many issues, I don&#x27;t want to invest in even more cartridges for a possibly defective machine.  </li>
            <li> Works well, and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt and is quick to use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve skipped probably four weeks now because of how quickly these bulbs die.  </li>
            <li> Try several times, the feeling is very good, for the axillary and Bikini effect is very obvious, with some fine hair effect is not obvious, will continue to use, very love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remington, please change your product description to be more honest and upfront about what your product can actually do on a reliable basis, rather than what it might be capable of in some fantasy universe you&#x27;ve dreamed up.</li>
            <li> With lower power it takes longer but last longer too other wise the device works good as a replacement. .</li>
            <li> Love my Remington, Had to find a new place to get replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I thought that was about right because it said 2-3 full treatments.  </li>
            <li> So far have had it for 3 months and seems to be pretty effective.</li>
            <li> The first four were good, but the last one just burst out whileI was using it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am positive there is no way it gave the number of light emissions it claimed it would.  </li>
            <li> Used exactly as directed didn&#x27;t see any results and I was patient!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, this product works exactly as described!</li>
            <li> The I Light system works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed the machine these are made for (the more important factor), so I&#x27;ll be brief here.</li>
            <li> I used level 5 the entire time and to be honest, some areas flashed</li>
            <li> I purchase these refills because I obviously own the Remington iLight hair removal system, so my opinion is directly related to the system itself.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> says 3 hole body treaent worth phffttt did underarms bikinni area</li>
            <li> These bulbs and the remington pro machine was worth just for that.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth that price.</li>
            <li> (all hair doesn&#x27;t grow at once, each follicle has its&#x27; own cycle, and you have to hit each cycle with the laser a couple/few times in order to penetrate - hence multiple times over a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works..but only kind of.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it was no where near the 1500 flashes</li>
            <li> Clearly, the replacement cartridges are an issue as it&#x27;s noted in many reviews, maybe it&#x27;s time to fix the problem</li>
            <li> Keep a spare on hand to avoid not being able to complete a treatment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and actually works, but it runs out way too fast</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used the I-Light device that much, so I am still on the original light bulb.</li>
            <li> With the original bulb that came with the machine I was able to do my legs, bikini and my husband&#x27;s back three times over.</li>
            <li> just received and tested, and packaging was all right.</li>
            <li> I did use up one full cartridge and was glad to have a second on hand.  </li>
            <li> If they lasted longer, it would be better, but they need a little more power as well.</li>
            <li> I have large spots without hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased for adult daughter&#x27;s use, haven&#x27;t heard much about it so it must be okay...</li>
            <li> I have empty patches of hair whenever I use it which I think is great because I don&#x27;t feel I have to shave as frequently as I did before I started using the Remington iLight</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, and burn out super fast.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, this product works amazing and will save so much money rather than visiting the laser clinic.</li>
            <li> to keep it totally fuzz free and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This unit really should have been designed with a much higher airflow to cool the lamp and maybe have incorporated some heatsinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came also very fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> The first one came with the machine.</li>
            <li> I have not found better pricing for these refills outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Only have to touch up spots with a razor in the shower every 4-5 days versus a full shave every 2-3 days to stay hair free.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge lasts longer, if you do not allow it to get too hot during treatment by using it for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> I used it 3 times in the first 2 weeks then once a week afterward.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working but by the end of the week, there was noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> She loves it, uses it weekly, and still hasn&#x27;t burned out the first cartridge it came</li>
            <li> they work great.need to order more actually.</li>
            <li> It may work - but really really hurts!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far I am totally smooth under my arms, and almost all leg hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first cartridge that came with the unit lasted me 2 1/2 treatments.  </li>
            <li> My first time replacing the bulb in my I-Light.  </li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges don&#x27;t last more than 500 flashes.  </li>
            <li> (and my hair is pin straight!).  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> needs a higher setting i can take the pain.  </li>
            <li> Must shave first then use laser after.</li>
            <li> The previous light lasted a bit more than 1500 flashes.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartdridge has worked so far as well as the original cartridge worked.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick, black hair on light skin, so that&#x27;s perfect for the system; it won&#x27;t work as well on lighter hair or darker skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you have specific areas your looking for help with, this is a good option in my opinion</li>
            <li> disposable cartridge provides 1,500 flashes for 2-3 full body treatments.&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one third of that</li>
            <li> The best part is that I have dark hair, and you can always see the black dots of hair even after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have done three full treatments and one partial and am still on the first light cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I see that could be possible except the first replacement light did not even get the change to get hot</li>
            <li> I have used the machine on my full body around 9 times so far.</li>
            <li> She could get flashes somewhere in the range of 1,000 pulses, but only the first 500s are super powerful; they still work after that, but they lose their power gradually.</li>
            <li> Although it is not meant for the pubic region, it can be done if this is your goal but be warned some areas are SUPER sensitive.</li>
            <li> This item was fairly easy to use, but after almost 3 months and ordering a second cartridge I still was not getting the results advertised.</li>
            <li> That leaves me free from shaving or lasering for the next couple of months - really!  </li>
            <li> And the results certainly aren&#x27;t permanent.  </li>
            <li> Use only on my legs and under arms and will last about 3 full sessions for the most part.</li>
            <li> The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM.</li>
            <li> The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my legs are not very large, so I couldn&#x27;t have used that many pulses.</li>
            <li> Seems to be fine, although I am using it moderately.</li>
            <li> This will be fine as a maintenance tool but not so much for the initial job.</li>
            <li> much prefer the Bella light system from Israel, large coverage area, cartridges last quite a while at maximum setting  </li>
            <li> _ i.e., does it really work to stop hair growth?</li>
            <li> but I really like my Remington hair remover.</li>
            <li> The product as a whole (Bulb and Unit) is a dud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more in bulbs than I did for the unit</li>
            <li> It is really works.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works.</li>
            <li> but it seems to really work - hardy have to shave at all at this point.</li>
            <li> People might not have real expectations for lazer hair removal</li>
            <li> The light is suppose to last for 1500 pulses, I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 of the lights and none of them have lasted for 1500 pulses.  </li>
            <li> Remington really missed the boat on this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement light, but the overall IPL product works well.</li>
            <li> Recommend the whole system</li>
            <li> You have to use it a lot to see professional outcomes, however it is still useful and it&#x27;s convenient to have it at home.</li>
            <li> Yesterday the yellow light warning was on again.</li>
            <li> The light cartridge that my I-Light Pro came with lasted for several applications (each under arm area).</li>
            <li> If you get one of these be prepared to buy a dozen cartridges before you see any real results.</li>
            <li> The product does work, but the light cartridges don&#x27;t last as they should -</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get rid of the hair, but if you keep at it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> It really slows hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I had looked at the price of the replacement cartridge before I bought the system and that really helped me make the decision to go ahead and buy the I-light Pro hair removal system.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s worth it even at 1 treatment per cartridge</li>
            <li> And 1500 flashes does not cover nearly as much as they say.</li>
            <li> and then if I keep trying it does a real flash.</li>
            <li> My wife really raves about it, so it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> This really does work well.</li>
            <li> I really like not having to shave so often.  </li>
            <li> Between shaves, I just get back a light number of hairs on legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li> In my whole life, I&#x27;ve had razor stubble and burn, so this is a delight.  </li>
            <li> very spotty,  </li>
            <li> The whole hair removal system is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> To get much success out of this product, I had to completely ignore the directions.  </li>
            <li> Crank it straight up to max each time.  </li>
            <li> I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was not the whole system.</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I felt informed and had what I thought to be reasonable expectations.</li>
            <li> The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used others remove hair sistems but was very painfull, with the Remington IPL Pro no pain.</li>
            <li> first one 2 full treatments, 2nd one, one treatment</li>
            <li> By the time you are done with the number of sessions you need, you&#x27;ll actually spend more than paying for professional hair removal.</li>
            <li> The hair is very fine and much of it grows at a super slow rate.</li>
            <li> It does cause some considerable pain if not set at the right level.</li>
            <li> I was busy though and so hadn&#x27;t used it right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with long cords, both from the outlet and to the hand held zapper.</li>
            <li> the results are more visible after the second or third session, but i dont know how many sessions until the long term results</li>
            <li> Some locations hurt more than others, without a doubt, but it&#x27;s definitely bearable, and we&#x27;ve seen no ill effects anyplace (though it&#x27;s possible to singe your skin a bit with the super-bright flashes, so beware!).</li>
            <li> The original bulb lasted 5-6 treatments, but the replacement bulb only lasted one treatment.  </li>
            <li> Okay, we all think we are smarter than the directions, so if you start out on a higher level, you do get a little zap...</li>
            <li> The replacement seems to be lasting longer than the original cartridge that came with the laser.  </li>
            <li> Fair skin, dark hair... technically this system should really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Between uses pull the hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  In full disclosure, I had to send my machine back to Remington while it was still under warranty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is supposed to last for 3 full body applications and was not sufficient for two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it still has developed a fine tangle of tiny fractures all around the cathode</li>
            <li> Light works great, too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve counted pulses as well and mine usually only last for 700 pulses at most.  </li>
            <li> The light won&#x27;t flash most of the time and it&#x27;s frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Some people complaint about short lamp life, which I too have experienced.</li>
            <li> have been using the iLight for a couple years, and while my hair still pretty much grows back, I have actually noticed that the backs of my calves are completely hair free, my bikini line is thinner, and my underarm hair is much finer.  </li>
            <li> Uggggg High Cost but does work.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After the first few times of use, I went through the first bulb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping the flash intervals at greater than 4 seconds with rest periods of a minute if I feel any little amount of warmth of the air venting out of the hand unit.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, too - I have used 6-7 times in 6 months and not all hair is gone, but its a lot less and much easier to shave.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t cool very fast because no real airflow is happening within the confines of the reflectors to cool the center section of the tube.</li>
            <li> wow didnt even get one whole treament oop that was meant for the system i just got</li>
            <li> While my legs did not stay as smooth as daily shaving, after 4 treatments the hair growth is much thinner, lighter and I only have to shave once a week in bathing suit weather to stay looking hairless.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s like the professional machines.</li>
            <li> been using this thing for about a year; between the two of us, we&#x27;ve probably used it on pretty much every square inch of the human body.  </li>
            <li> I love this machine - in just a few months</li>
            <li> Overall, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Your hair must be really dark (practically black) for it to really work, unlike professional which will pick up more lightly colored hair.</li>
            <li> JUst make sure to shave first, or it smells like burning hair and is a bit more painful.</li>
            <li> , I have to buy other one, because I need replaice this light.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m probably out of luck unless I want to gamble on a new one.  </li>
            <li> i fitted a new globe and still did not work</li>
            <li> And I need a new replacement cartridge to continue.</li>
            <li> If you are diligent and cover every inch, then you&#x27;ll have to buy a new cartridge after every use.</li>
            <li> and if that isn&#x27;t it I&#x27;d need to buy a new cone.</li>
            <li> Obviously, we&#x27;ve found that they last longer if you use the lower light level...</li>
            <li> Once the unit&#x27;s yellow light came on (indicating the life of the cartridge nearing the end), there were maybe 30 pulses left.  </li>
            <li> Waxing may be very smooth for a few days but really, when the hairs grown back it&#x27;s ingrown all the time</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re planning on going somewhere and paying for $1000s, try this first, it&#x27;s the same lazer!</li>
            <li> it was as expected, good thing that i ordered this item in advance because the cartridge of the unit i bought dies earlier as expected</li>
            <li> I am light skinned with black hair on my legs</li>
            <li> I purchased this second light when I bought the main unit knowing that I would eventually need it, in stalled t today and it fits and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The second cartridge was usable for two half-legs (top of knees down) and arms before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy the system after reading some of the reviews about the light not lasting very long.  </li>
            <li> Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.e hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> have white skin and very dark hair, so I expected good results on my body.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this cartridge performs as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 18th</li>
            <li> This is the second buy of this product and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First light cartridge did not last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> The end results are still far from my liking, but with perseverance might get there.</li>
            <li> order this lam for the Remington professional IPL hair removal system lamp did worked for 1500 pulses then died off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of hair, but nothing compared to professional results.</li>
            <li> So far I have not shed any hair yet.  </li>
            <li> But it is still a lot cheaper than professional services.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve emailed them, but my machine is over 1 year old</li>
            <li> my armpit skin is smoothe and looks really natural.</li>
            <li> The I-Light Pro eliminated that completely</li>
            <li> and wow you can tell it is working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing compared to professional laser.</li>
            <li> IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System]] as a gift for my wife in January 2012, and</li>
            <li> My hair has been growing back much slower and thinner.</li>
            <li> only concern is that cartridges are very variable...</li>
            <li> there were no where near 1500 flashes in each cartridge, and I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product for people who wants a longer lasting hair removal and don&#x27;t want to deal with the wax products.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work just like the professional ones do.</li>
            <li> I have shaved my hairy areas maybe once in the last two years...and much of the hair has never returned.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, this has cut the leg hair to about 1/3 of what I had and underarm hair (which was a LOT) is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it hurts like hell on any sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> Shaving straight alone leads to razor burn by the next day.  </li>
            <li> such a great product has this flaw, but at least it can be partially worked around.</li>
            <li> This last so much longer.  </li>
            <li> My underarms have not been so lucky, but I believe that this is because I epilated about a month before receiving my machine and this hair hadn&#x27;t yet become active.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Remington unit, but I just bought this replacement cartridge and it only worked for a few pulses...</li>
            <li> To do 2 sessions a week - if you have a fair amount of hair and are trying to cover all -  is going to require 2 cartridges a week - another $50/wk+ --- which is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am extremely skeptical now and am unsure if it would be wise to purchase another replacement cartridge from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I almost got two full body treatments (underarm, bikini, and legs from mid-thigh down) from one cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Never really worked and boke right after the month warranty.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to complete the job of the recommended 3 sessions, so be sure to buy multiple.</li>
            <li> On the 2nd or 3rd highest setting never tried anything higher.  </li>
            <li> the cartridges don&#x27;t last for more than 3-5 uses on SMALL areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Power seems to low, only some hairs are burned and others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After several months using it as instructed, and sometimes applying more than one time in the same area in the same day</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend this product to remove hair, though it does not work well on blonde hairs</li>
            <li> I have gone thru 3 or 4 cartridges, though, as I have a lot of thick hair, and have done both arms, legs (upper and lower) and bikini line, and under arms, and fingers, toes (seriously) and even though it says its not for face, I used on upper lip with great success and no problem.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i used it six months ago it is economic and till now solve problem partially hope by frequent use solve it completely</li>
            <li> This might be intentional as the company will make more profits selling the cartridges than the product itself or this cartridges are really not good quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend not buying this one and instead going for their new device, which can last for 30,000 flashes.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed the bulbs did not last as long as advertised, but i thing there close to 1500.  </li>
            <li> Light blinks yellow instead of green.</li>
            <li> The hairs are actually quite thick and many of them.</li>
            <li> A full series of three treatments, and I am down to only needing to shave once a week.</li>
            <li> followed all the directions and only use it on max power level and still getting growth back in certain areas that have been treated multiple times after nearly 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> But anything higher than 500 dollars, I would consider it closely and compare with some other options.</li>
            <li> First bulb didn&#x27;t last as long as expected but the product absolutely helps reduce the thickness and quantity of hair on treated areas.</li>
            <li> Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.</li>
            <li> This part of the product description is a complete and utter lie: &amp;#34;Each</li>
            <li> I think that so far all the cartridges i got are lasting up to 1,500 shots as stated.</li>
            <li> So far I can not see a big improvement.</li>
            <li> So, when I received my replacement, I figured I would get nearly the same quality.</li>
            <li> I have not counted, but apparently it does not.  </li>
            <li> I waited too long for a replacement cartridge but to try a new one</li>
            <li> The first lamp lasted less than 100 lights.</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful at first, but very easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Of course, if you have a Remington iLight Pro you want to use, you don&#x27;t really have any other choice but to buy these cartridges.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve burned through 2 lamp cartridges (on my 3rd) and have only attempted to treat my hands and arms (not arm pits mind</li>
            <li> I definitely did not get anywhere near that amount of use with the bulb that came standard with the actual iLight unit.</li>
            <li> The lights are a little expensive but worth it to have such smooth legs!</li>
            <li> But my hair is very stubborn from previous laser hair removals.  </li>
            <li> Well, It does last as long as it says and I have never had one die early.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> ive been using the remington for 6 months once a week on my second replacement head this system doesnt work and is a waste of money i have light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> A like it works but not long enough</li>
            <li> No defects, consistent pulses, and so far, in the 3 sessions I&#x27;ve performed, I&#x27;ve used at least 100-150 pulses in total...</li>
            <li> I have hated dark hair, fair skin combo on my legs for 40 years....too cheap for pro laser....</li>
            <li> even though the product really works, the cartridges don&#x27;t last even 500 flashes, maybe even less</li>
            <li> The price of the replacement lights is very high for what little results are produced.  </li>
            <li> Bought this due to my new unit misfiring.</li>
            <li> Light bulb fits well and is again working, however, they seem to have a short life which is disappointing, thanks</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing to spend $40 on replacement lights and only 1/3 of the life as the original light.</li>
            <li> the is limited selection option in the site to almost no other options</li>
            <li> /&gt;IPL seems to really work not a quick fix though- takes a long time to do a thorough job</li>
            <li> Thus - even though I ordered one extra cartridge, figuring - based on the manufacturer&#x27;s claims - that this should be enough to try this for near a month, but it has lasted less than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m a guy and have used this on my shoulders and upper arms and the hair has become small and much thinner than it was before.</li>
            <li> Since the I-Light Pro cartridges don&#x27;t last long, I was looking for the lowest price possible on replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I already had one on backup for just such an occurrence as I had heard that the cartridge that comes with the machine did not last as long as replacements.</li>
            <li> Currently, hair is coming in finer, much more slowly and there is much less of it, but I&#x27;m not sure what would be required for complete hair elimination.  </li>
            <li> It quickly became just as expensive as professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li> Also, these cartridges absolutely do not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not lasting as long as it should</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Based on this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s practical to use this on your entire body as it would take too long and bulb use would be costly.  </li>
            <li> These replacements work as advertised, along with the unit, but they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as Remington suggests.  </li>
            <li> I understand companies like Remington make their money on refills, not on initial sales, but geez .... $22 is steep for a product that works a fraction as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> lot of reviewers are stating they don&#x27;t last as long as the manufacturer states.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Wonder how long this bulb is going to last.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t waited long enough?  </li>
            <li> The bulb doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars is it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t last as long as promised.  </li>
            <li> I think the cartridges do seem to last about as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Does not completely eliminate hair but definitely thins it and slows its growth.</li>
            <li> The bulb does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product was defective, the burden is not hard 50 uses and is supposed to have paid a few thousand</li>
            <li> Get lots of cartridges the don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I think the Remington Light Pro is the only system where the parts are not that expensive.</li>
            <li> did read on another review today to slow down and let things cool and that my help the cartridge life.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been to the American lazer center, $1000 for just 4in square areas.</li>
            <li> Time consuming, hurts, takes a long time to kill the hair at the root.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as long as it used to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like the long wait</li>
            <li> However, as long as the product works and is slowing the growth of my hair</li>
            <li> It can sting like a b*tch depending on where you use it, but anything else is a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long, but that is expected with this unit.  </li>
            <li> They work, they just don&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> It delivers a similar sensation to an actual office treatment but is not nearly strong enough, even on the highest setting, to provide hair removal.</li>
            <li> Still need to shave, but there&#x27;s definitely less to shave, and definitely smoooooother than just shaving alone, where hair would come back and always lead to ingrowns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not able to claim any warranty on the product because I live in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While waiting for the Remington testing, I ordered another one from Amazon, and that new cartridge is defective as well, and only delivered 3 flashes before failure.  </li>
            <li> an after reading the OTHER COMMENT ON THE SAME PROBLEM I now know....</li>
            <li> It is definitely easier than other methods.</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other week to keep my hairs from growing back.</li>
            <li> Never get impatient and start flashing it fast for little stint, that could be all you need to overheat the tube.</li>
            <li> You have to do use it for a very long time before you start noticing a reduction in hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27; 6&amp;#34; with very long legs.</li>
            <li> , IT ONLY KEEPS THE HAIR AWAY WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVELY USING THE MACHINE.</li>
            <li> This article does not live 1500 lights ...</li>
            <li> an one whole leg a little over half the other</li>
            <li> Either my machine has developed a sudden unexplained problem, or there is a serious lack of quality control.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience a single strand of hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Limited skin tone and hair color.</li>
            <li> I doubt that Remington is going to do something crazy, like improve the refill, but at the very least they should either 1) reduce the price per refill or 2) give a good price break for purchase of multiple units.  </li>
            <li> My hair literally doesn&#x27;t grow back for months, and I had dark, noticable hair before.</li>
            <li> I started with 3 power/level and I have a white skin with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I only have to shave on average of twice weekly.</li>
            <li> My upper legs have dark hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only gotten an average of two uses from each bulb.  </li>
            <li> However, the statement that one cartridge will provide 2 to 3 full treatments is totally wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get many treatments out of the bulbs, very expensive to replace</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Ninth Session Wednesday August 14th, 2013 with 3rd bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 84 + 1248 from previous sessions.</li>
            <li> how would I even know if this works, the cartridges have only lasted through one and half treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the products directions, but haven&#x27;t noticed less hair or slower growth, even after the second treatment.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if hair regrowth was much less, like only having to shave once every 1-2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these a few times now, they work well with the system and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Then I carefully shake the alcohol off and use a hair dryer to dry the lamp off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I carefully shake the alcohol off and use a hair dryer to dry the lamp off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My advise is to slow down how fast you flash the unit so that the flash tube stays cooler and doesn&#x27;t fracture from overheating and don&#x27;t block the air vents of the hand piece.</li>
            <li> Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the bulb burned out long before the claims of the company.</li>
            <li> cartridge works fine, but the Remington unit is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> are a little thinner and not growing back in some places</li>
            <li> This little machine makes it possible.  </li>
            <li> Works but takes longer than expected</li>
            <li> I do recall the box the cartridge came in having a piece of cellophane tape holding one side closed and hoping that I didn&#x27;t get a used product.</li>
            <li> and I do see some results , they are minimal .</li>
            <li> Cartridge yields around 50% of expected and results are around 20% of promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These heads are a total waste of money, you may as well go get Laser treatment for the cost to keep replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> The machines coverage area for removal of hair is so small and the cartridges don&#x27;t last very long on maximum setting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It just flashes a weak blue and barely does that though now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the hair growth stops as long as they say, but it is less than shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was at first disappointed with how long the included cartridge last and hoped that the replacements would last longer and they do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hoping the replacements I purchase last at least as long!</li>
            <li> I am not at 4 treatments and 3 bulbs later and still very little results.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just mine but the replacement cartridges that I bought last longer than the one that came with the system.</li>
            <li> I called Remington when the first one failed prematurely (after one treatment of my legs and underarms) and was given a case number.  </li>
            <li> as i read by other views, this cartrige did not do 1500 pulses as it said.</li>
            <li> than other sources.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I still have to shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> Other than usage life, I still like the product and will reorder.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> other than the tube failing how does the unit know when the lamp has \\&quot;expired\\&quot; at 1,500 flashes?</li>
            <li> other than the tube failing how does the unit know when the lamp has \\&quot;expired\\&quot; at 1,500 flashes?</li>
            <li> and I was very careful not to block the vents.</li>
            <li> I have hardly any hair left on my legs.</li>
            <li> Their customer service has very limited schedule and are difficult to reach for those of us with normal working hours.  </li>
            <li> This product does appear to permanently remove hair, if used on a regular basis for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Worked for 1 day, my wife tried it once when we got it, when she tried to use it a month later it did not work, and it was too late to return it as it is not covered by amazon&#x27;s protection anymore.</li>
            <li> pain!!i use it 2x a month on average...</li>
            <li> I hate that the bulbs have a counter and quit working after so many flashes.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive and has much stronger flashes than these ones.</li>
            <li> down from shaving every day to just patches twice weekly after 4 treatments....</li>
            <li> The down fall is that you cannot use it on your face at all</li>
            <li> A lot of money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Very annoyed that I shelled out so much money for something that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Time consuming only very small area at a time.</li>

            <li> It took some of my hair longer to fall out than is typical, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I have noticeably less hair, and my legs have almost none.</li>
            <li> I saw results on my legs, the hairs didn&#x27;t disappear but they are less and thinner</li>
            <li> and i have black color hair.</li>
            <li> I have started using it on my chest and stomach and have noticed less hair growth there as well.</li>
            <li> All black hair goon.</li>
            <li> Keep track, and if there is anything that does less than that, the company will give you a replacement.</li>
            <li> I think these should cost less</li>
            <li> Oh and I started at the end of December and half gone through 2 bulbs.  </li>
            <li> typically use the iLight about six or eight times over the course of a month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at about 70-80% less hair and whats there is lighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had system for less than three months.  </li>
            <li> but again half the price</li>
            <li> , I have a lot less hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen about 70% less hair in areas where I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> Just less hair.  </li>
            <li> but 75% less</li>
            <li> i have 85% less hair than before its not overnight...2 years of treatments</li>
            <li> Shadows after shaving are less visible.</li>
            <li> It is going to get very expensive, if the cartridge is only going to last half as long as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do see less and thinner hair that grows a little less faster.</li>
            <li> I tried this on dark hair over 3months and used 2 replacement heads, should have kept my money, don&#x27;t waste your time with this</li>
            <li> I have a birth mark and the hair on it would grow horribly thick and dark with a rough texture.  </li>
            <li> But the regrowth rate is very slow, and the hair that comes back is a bit finer than what was previously there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit here and there in bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I like to buy this product with the little thing to chanche just in case</li>
            <li> I have little to no hair on every inch of my legs</li>
            <li> Well when I had the lamp apart I noticed a little \\&quot;transistor\\&quot; inside.</li>
            <li> Well when I had the lamp apart I noticed a little \\&quot;transistor\\&quot; inside.</li>
            <li> I do not like to rewrite bad review but the system is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Used this not even 300 flashes an its already dead..</li>
            <li> Waste of money; would not purchase again, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> dont waste you money, the machine  doesnt work anyway</li>
            <li> It just worked for me on really thin hair, but it grows back again.</li>
            <li> My skin is not light</li>
            <li> no hair growth after a few tx though...</li>
            <li> I purchased one bulb a few months ago</li>
            <li> Like I said, takes off about 70% of the hair, the rest is daily shaving (and TendSkin... and only ever like 2 random ingrown hairs vs a dozen!)</li>
            <li> but it will still fail prematurely due to lots of tiny heat cracks forming in the tube to a point where they leak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absurd that I have to to repeatedly pay shipping charges to have new cartridges tested due to their poor manufacturing, coupled with the inconvenience of waiting.  </li>
            <li> It DOES HURT badly, but I can tolerate pain pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past few months, it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working up to the bikini area, slowly working that down.  </li>
            <li> No more since I have used the iLight.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cartridge only worked for one under arm application and then never lit again.</li>
            <li> , results are too small, hair is still there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will ever be all gone, but that happens with the pricey office laser hair removal, too - my dau.</li>
            <li> and it covers a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> hold it over a sink and have a small spray bottle with isopropyl alcohol in it that I spray the reflector and tube with.</li>
            <li> if overheated develops small fractures that allow the gas inside to seep out.</li>

            <li> if overheated develops small fractures that allow the gas inside to seep out.</li>
            <li> Save your self the trouble and buy one of these if you just ordered the i-Light!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so frustrated that I&#x27;ve stopped using the device, and now have 3 new cartridges that do not work.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few of these each year but no more waxing!!</li>
            <li> at least it isn&#x27;t injurying anyone so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> so was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I started to see a slow in hair growth after ~3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I started to use the iLight on those patches and the patches are slowly going away.  </li>
            <li> I just used the bulb twice, no more than 20 shots!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> Expensive, and not worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am now starting to use this on my inner thighs as well as my crotch area as shaving in that area causes terrible ingrowns and scarring.</li>
            <li> the reviews we read online suggested that this device might permanently remove the hair, and much less expensively than laser</li>
            <li> Worked MAYBE for a few weeks then all the hair returned just as thick!!</li>
            <li> were a bit painful but overall</li>
            <li> Go get laser treatment -- IPL is NOT a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I suppose we could all take 10 second breaks between shots, hoping to prolong bulb life, but then we&#x27;d have to call in sick to work just to make time to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My wifey loves it, no more expensive trips to beauty salons.</li>
            <li> Does not work on facial hair! :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work, although very slowly.</li>
            <li> and I did it for way less money than going to a salon to have it laser-ed away, as we all know how ridiculously expensive that is!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three replacement bulbs now and none of them has given me the 1200-1500 pulses that it&#x27;s supposed to, and even worse</li>
            <li> She thought it was broken</li>
            <li> a nutshell the problem lies in the way the reflectors in front and behind the tube shroud it from the cooling air</li>
            <li> but it is still less painful than the lasers at the salons.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would be painful, and it can be</li>
            <li> I have found that every one of them are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Europe, so it is sometimes difficult to find a seller who delivers it here.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all hair removal products of this type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting no errors on the device, but it fails to flash.  </li>
            <li> must have to maintain those troubled spots.  </li>
            <li> she got some results on her underarms; unfortunately, she couldn&#x27;t find the required patience in herself to go any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the cartridges are awful, they don&#x27;t last 1,500 pulses like they say.</li>
            <li> There is something really wrong here.</li>
            <li> if replacing bulbs were not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It takes mere minutes to shave now</li>
            <li> /&gt;this machine is expensive and doesnt work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It causes some discomfort but it depends where you are using it how uncomfortable it gets.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the wrong product by mistake so am unable to rate the product..</li>
            <li> I purchased this to avoid electrolysis on a troubled area.</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> and the heat eventually makes it fail prematurely.</li>
            <li> the Lamp Fails (</li>
            <li> the Lamp Fails (</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> in this case i will end up buying one cartrige for each treatment, which is going to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> not too bad, except for the 1500 flash limit.</li>
            <li> each of which have been equally painful.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed my wife said one of the Cartridges died after four shots and another after thirty shots.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This part of the product description is a complete and utter lie: &amp;#34;Each disposable cartridge provides 1,500 flashes for 2-3 full body treatments.&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one third of that before you need to buy yet another replacement. Of course, if you have a Remington iLight Pro you want to use, you don&#x27;t really have any other choice but to buy these cartridges. Seems like a bit of a scam to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington, please change your product description to be more honest and upfront about what your product can actually do on a reliable basis, rather than what it might be capable of in some fantasy universe you&#x27;ve dreamed up.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed my wife said one of the Cartridges died after four shots and another after thirty shots. She has not tried the third cartridge yet.</li>
            <li> The cartridges  are a joke! cartridges don&#x27;t las at all.  Did underarms 2 times, and that&#x27;s it , the light burned out ! Please Remington take care of take problem! I do not like to rewrite bad review but the system is kind of expensive and so are the replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed the machine these are made for (the more important factor), so I&#x27;ll be brief here. No defects, consistent pulses, and so far, in the 3 sessions I&#x27;ve performed, I&#x27;ve used at least 100-150 pulses in total...each of which have been equally painful. Whoa.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Thursday June 27, 2013 Eighth SESSION with 2nd bulb&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 34 + 1388 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 1422&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This covered EVERY area of my crotch both front and back... Although it is not meant for the pubic region, it can be done if this is your goal but be warned some areas are SUPER sensitive. I used level 5 the entire time and to be honest, some areas flashed were a bit painful but overall the treatments and pain are tolerable. As far as I&#x27;m concerned this cartridge performs as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 18th 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now starting to use this on my inner thighs as well as my crotch area as shaving in that area causes terrible ingrowns and scarring. I&#x27;ve also been tracking the cartridge&#x27;s flash life and here it is so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third bulb&lt;br /&gt;First Session Thursday June 27, 2013 with 3rd bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 130.

            <li> My wife likes this. What keeps the wife happy keeps me happy.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work as well as the originals that came with the I-Light Pro unit.  They don&#x27;t last long, but that is expected with this unit.  Since the I-Light Pro cartridges don&#x27;t last long, I was looking for the lowest price possible on replacement cartridges.  These were priced about $5 lower than most stores and with free shipping, made it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the price, packaging and quality of this product.  I am glad that this cartridge is still available on Amazon.  The retail stores have moved on to newer models.</li>
            <li> Uggggg High Cost but does work. Unlike the Flash and Go Units only last a Short time. I Wish Remington would make units that had life time cartridges</li>
            <li> Seems to be fine, although I am using it moderately. A little bit here and there in bikini area and underarms. I will turn in an update as I progress.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this and have no idea about the efficacy of the product_ i.e., does it really work to stop hair growth? However, the statement that one cartridge will provide 2 to 3 full treatments is totally wrong. I used the first cartridge in one prolonged setting, where I was able to do both legs WITHOUT being able to start the bikini or top of legs; and (fore) arms. The second cartridge was usable for two half-legs (top of knees down) and arms before it stopped working. I didn&#x27;t count the flashes - but this seemed shorter than the 1st. Thus - even though I ordered one extra cartridge, figuring - based on the manufacturer&#x27;s claims - that this should be enough to try this for near a month, but it has lasted less than 2 weeks.  To do 2 sessions a week - if you have a fair amount of hair and are trying to cover all -  is going to require 2 cartridges a week - another $50/wk+ --- which is expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the second buy of this product and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this until the hair is permanently removed.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but I really like my Remington hair remover.</li>
            <li> This laser is the best price &amp; works great &amp; is far better price than the Flash &amp; Go</li>
            <li> Love this iLight system!</li>
            <li> Works but takes longer than expected</li>
            <li> Unit is easy to use, results already evident. First light cartridge did not last as long as expected. Have ordered replacements, hope they last longer.</li>
            <li> See my review of the Remington iLight Pro. I got this cartridge as an extra but after 8 weeks have yet to need it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just mine but the replacement cartridges that I bought last longer than the one that came with the system.</li>
            <li> how would I even know if this works, the cartridges have only lasted through one and half treatments. I am on my second one and no results. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> IPL does not work. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Also, these cartridges absolutely do not last as long as advertised. Go get laser treatment -- IPL is NOT a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Does not work!  Used exactly as directed didn&#x27;t see any results and I was patient!</li>
            <li> i ordered by mistake actually wanted remington hair remover</li>
            <li> I will never go back to just shaving! My hair literally doesn&#x27;t grow back for months, and I had dark, noticable hair before. Love it!</li>
            <li> It work for me, asian skin but the frequency must be one treatment per week and after six weeks i can see the result.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was amazing fast.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have gone through two cartridges since I have had my iLight. The first one came with the machine. I used it just over twice, and it gave out. Not too bad. I did underarms, bikini, and lower legs. I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my legs are not very large, so I couldn&#x27;t have used that many pulses. I already had one on backup for just such an occurrence as I had heard that the cartridge that comes with the machine did not last as long as replacements. I got just under two treatments with the replacement cartridge. Please fix this Remington! The iLight is a great product. It took some of my hair longer to fall out than is typical, but it does work. I have noticeably less hair, and my legs have almost none. Maybe about 20 hairs each? Not bad. My underarms have not been so lucky, but I believe that this is because I epilated about a month before receiving my machine and this hair hadn&#x27;t yet become active.  I am debating on whether to try and do touch ups in that area or whether to epilate.</li>
            <li> I saw results on my legs, the hairs didn&#x27;t disappear but they are less and thinner and that&#x27;s what I wanted from it . Did nothing for the bikini line. But!!! I did get pregnant and stopped using it....hopping it will still work on the bikini in the future</li>
            <li> Used this not even 300 flashes an its already dead..there supposed to last 1500...an after reading the OTHER COMMENT ON THE SAME PROBLEM I now know....you suck!</li>
            <li> So far have had it for 3 months and seems to be pretty effective.I was a little worried that it would be painful, and it can be but it is still less painful than the lasers at the salons.</li>
            <li> Perfect price and quality!</li>
            <li> This item was fairly easy to use, but after almost 3 months and ordering a second cartridge I still was not getting the results advertised.</li>
            <li> I think that so far all the cartridges i got are lasting up to 1,500 shots as stated. I do see less and thinner hair that grows a little less faster. The end results are still far from my liking, but with perseverance might get there. I have used the machine on my full body around 9 times so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item several time but i will be gone very shortly when you use this.&lt;br /&gt;IF you use this you can use about 1000 not 1500</li>
            <li> Not lasting as long as it should</li>
            <li> Pretty much a total waste of money. Don&#x27;t know how anyone had good results from this thing. I&#x27;m beginning to think all of these hair removal machines are just a pipe dream. This one quit working all together after about six months. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It works just fine! just received and tested, and packaging was all right.</li>
            <li> The previous light lasted a bit more than 1500 flashes. This is a good deal and will keep buying however my unwanted hair is not coming back so I may not buy after some point.. Very pleased with the product!!!</li>
            <li> order this lam for the Remington professional IPL hair removal system lamp did worked for 1500 pulses then died off.</li>
            <li> I urge you to check the history of reviews from the reviewers that are giving this product 5 stars. I have found that every one of them are fake. Please do not be fooled. These bulbs are supposed to have a life of 1,000-1,500 flashes. I definitely did not get anywhere near that amount of use with the bulb that came standard with the actual iLight unit. This replacement bulb I purchased burnt out after the third use. The product as a whole (Bulb and Unit) is a dud. I used the product for 3 months and did not see any results similar to the hair removal I&#x27;ve received in office visits. i.e. no hair loss what-so-ever. It delivers a similar sensation to an actual office treatment but is not nearly strong enough, even on the highest setting, to provide hair removal. I did not experience a single strand of hair falling out. Waste of money; would not purchase again, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> dont waste you money, the machine  doesnt work anyway</li>
            <li> I purchase these refills because I obviously own the Remington iLight hair removal system, so my opinion is directly related to the system itself. The Remington iLight works ok. I have had professional laser hair removal performed at my dermatologist&#x27;s medical spa with excellent results, but the cost adds up. I wanted to laser my legs, so I bought this system. I&#x27;ve used it on the highest setting once every month or so for the last year. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of hair, but nothing compared to professional results. I will admit that I haven&#x27;t followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation of doing it every two to three week as you are supposed to catch the hair in its growth cycle. I wouldn&#x27;t spend $300 on the machine again, but I continue to pay for these refills since the initial investment has already been made. I have not found better pricing for these refills outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Everything went very smooth. I received the product on time as promised and all in tact.</li>
            <li> You have to do use it for a very long time before you start noticing a reduction in hair growth.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my light cartridge today.  Remington 6000USA I-Light Pro.  Starting on 12/24/2011 and completed my 3rd treatment.  So far I have not shed any hair yet.  But my hair is very stubborn from previous laser hair removals.  I am excited to hear and see others results.  The replacement cartridge was a piece of cake to put in.  I followed the directions and it took a minute to replace.  I am going to add these replacements on my gift list for people to buy me! :)</li>
            <li> They burn up too easily.  But it is still a lot cheaper than professional services. It works really good on areas that are realy have light color skin and i have black color hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m happy at all!  So far I&#x27;ve burned through 2 lamp cartridges (on my 3rd) and have only attempted to treat my hands and arms (not arm pits mind you)&lt;br /&gt;Have followed all the directions and only use it on max power level and still getting growth back in certain areas that have been treated multiple times after nearly 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Can NOT recommend this product and wish I had my money back to try something else....;(</li>
            <li> doesnt seem to work even though i have probably used it 20 times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I managed to purchase 3-pack in such a good price - almost same as a 2-pack. I&#x27;m from Europe, so it is sometimes difficult to find a seller who delivers it here. And for such price - never happened before. It came also very fast with no problems. Thank You! :)</li>
            <li> If you are a hairy person this will take a lot of light bulb replacements. I hate that the bulbs have a counter and quit working after so many flashes. I&#x27;ve spent more in bulbs than I did for the unit and I think they plan on that.</li>
            <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have some unwanted body hair, and waxing HURT.  Figured we&#x27;d try this out - the reviews we read online suggested that this device might permanently remove the hair, and much less expensively than laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie - this thing has some &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; to it; it feels like you&#x27;re snapping an elastic against your skin.  And the results certainly aren&#x27;t permanent.  But the regrowth rate is very slow, and the hair that comes back is a bit finer than what was previously there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using this thing for about a year; between the two of us, we&#x27;ve probably used it on pretty much every square inch of the human body.  Some locations hurt more than others, without a doubt, but it&#x27;s definitely bearable, and we&#x27;ve seen no ill effects anyplace (though it&#x27;s possible to singe your skin a bit with the super-bright flashes, so beware!).</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Remington unit, but I just bought this replacement cartridge and it only worked for a few pulses...have tried re-installing it- but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love the I-Light pro so I will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington iLight.  I have purchased replacement heads several times prior.  I do feel that they last a good amount of time.  The best part is that I have dark hair, and you can always see the black dots of hair even after shaving.  No more since I have used the iLight.  I love that, it is a WONDERFUL product.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m a guy and have used this on my shoulders and upper arms and the hair has become small and much thinner than it was before. I have started using it on my chest and stomach and have noticed less hair growth there as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using laser hair remover more than 2 years. It is really works. All black hair goon.</li>
            <li> It takes a few of these each year but no more waxing!! Great product.</li>
            <li> A like it works but not long enough</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. I&#x27;ve followed the products directions, but haven&#x27;t noticed less hair or slower growth, even after the second treatment.</li>
            <li> I like to buy this product with the little thing to chanche just in case I need it. Really great</li>
            <li> says 3 hole body treaent worth phffttt did underarms bikinni area an one whole leg a little over half the other wow didnt even get one whole treament oop that was meant for the system i just got</li>
            <li> Hello! I bought 3 this product and sent to Brazil, but only 1 works.&lt;br /&gt;What can you do for me?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and waiting for a answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my order number is: 102-6473132-9481818 and 102-3544705-0657001</li>
            <li> Light bulb fits well and is again working, however, they seem to have a short life which is disappointing, thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you&#x27;re here, these are the cheapest you can find online for the replacement bulbs to your iLight. It does what it says, and the lights last for about 1200-1500 shots. Keep track, and if there is anything that does less than that, the company will give you a replacement. But honestly, I&#x27;ve done that 1 out of 18 I&#x27;ve ordered (if that eases anyone&#x27;s mind).</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Excellent seller. I constantly order from here.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This review is after 2-3 months of use.  I am a male and use the device on my underarms and chest.  I use it weekly.  I started to see a slow in hair growth after ~3 weeks.  After 2-3 months, hair growth on my chest is still there but slowed significantly.  Only have to touch up spots with a razor in the shower every 4-5 days versus a full shave every 2-3 days to stay hair free.  My underarms have been slower to respond and I still have not seen the same result as my chest although it is working.  I have used 3 bulbs in this time @ $26 each here on Amazon.  Based on this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s practical to use this on your entire body as it would take too long and bulb use would be costly.  Overall, if you have specific areas your looking for help with, this is a good option in my opinion and I&#x27;ve tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;I have a more exciting side benefit.  I have about 6 plaque psoriasis spots on my body (red scaly skin).  I&#x27;ve tried all topical creams, nothing works.  My best results were with laser light treatment in the past but I no longer have access to the treatment.  I started to use the iLight on those patches and the patches are slowly going away.  More to come.</li>
            <li> These are for my I-light Pro machine to help in hair reduction,and that is what it does.</li>
            <li> Purchased for adult daughter&#x27;s use, haven&#x27;t heard much about it so it must be okay...at least it isn&#x27;t injurying anyone so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> It just worked for me on really thin hair, but it grows back again.</li>
            <li> I have experienced limited results. It has taken more treatments than was instructed to achieve minimum results. The cartridges did not seem to give you the amount of treatments as advertised. Although the product appears to be working. It is definitely easier than other methods. It does cause some considerable pain if not set at the right level.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after about 10 flashes or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 5 months but haven&#x27;t been using it regularly.  I can say I noticed a slowdown in regrowth, but definitely not salon quality results.  I find that with the cost of the machine, and replacing bulbs once a month, that eventually I would be better off with a Groupon for laser hair removal.  This will be fine as a maintenance tool but not so much for the initial job.</li>
            <li> Lasts the amount of flashes it said it would! Love this product! Will buy more when I will need them.</li>
            <li> This product does appear to permanently remove hair, if used on a regular basis for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, too.  The cartridge lasts longer, if you do not allow it to get too hot during treatment by using it for an extended period of time.  Perhaps do lower legs one day, upper the next.</li>
            <li> These need some work. If they lasted longer, it would be better, but they need a little more power as well.</li>
            <li> These replacements work as advertised, along with the unit, but they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as Remington suggests.  I suppose we could all take 10 second breaks between shots, hoping to prolong bulb life, but then we&#x27;d have to call in sick to work just to make time to get the job done.  I doubt that Remington is going to do something crazy, like improve the refill, but at the very least they should either 1) reduce the price per refill or 2) give a good price break for purchase of multiple units.  I understand companies like Remington make their money on refills, not on initial sales, but geez .... $22 is steep for a product that works a fraction as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all hair removal products of this type. I read the reviews and decided I would give this a try. It absolutely works. The cartridge does seem to need to be replaced sooner than the 1300 or so light pulses it claims, but I may have used it more than I realized. After 2 months of use just as the directions state, The hair is gone. I used it 3 times in the first 2 weeks then once a week afterward. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working but by the end of the week, there was noticeable improvement. It works.</li>
            <li> i dont know how to grade this thing cuz it&#x27;s going to die soon</li>
            <li> About cartridge- fits my Remington ILight IPL just as its supposed to....&lt;br /&gt;IPL seems to really work not a quick fix though- takes a long time to do a thorough job but it seems to really work - hardy have to shave at all at this point.</li>
            <li> The last 3 cartridges that I&#x27;ve ordered have not worked properly.  I called Remington when the first one failed prematurely (after one treatment of my legs and underarms) and was given a case number.  I was required to pay for shipping to have the cartridge tested.  It was faulty, so they sent a replacement which didn&#x27;t work at all!  While waiting for the Remington testing, I ordered another one from Amazon, and that new cartridge is defective as well, and only delivered 3 flashes before failure.  Either my machine has developed a sudden unexplained problem, or there is a serious lack of quality control.  It&#x27;s absurd that I have to to repeatedly pay shipping charges to have new cartridges tested due to their poor manufacturing, coupled with the inconvenience of waiting.  I&#x27;ll be contacting Remington this week and hope for a better outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  In full disclosure, I had to send my machine back to Remington while it was still under warranty.  I&#x27;ve gotten so frustrated that I&#x27;ve stopped using the device, and now have 3 new cartridges that do not work.  With this many issues, I don&#x27;t want to invest in even more cartridges for a possibly defective machine.  I&#x27;m getting no errors on the device, but it fails to flash.  Their customer service has very limited schedule and are difficult to reach for those of us with normal working hours.  I&#x27;ve emailed them, but my machine is over 1 year old so I&#x27;m probably out of luck unless I want to gamble on a new one.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Purchased the IPL for my wife for Christmas.  She loves it, uses it weekly, and still hasn&#x27;t burned out the first cartridge it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping the replacements I purchase last at least as long!</li>
            <li> I think these should cost less but, I was able to cover my legs, thighs, stomach and chest one just one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought another, going to retreat.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used the I-Light device that much, so I am still on the original light bulb. .A lot of reviewers are stating they don&#x27;t last as long as the manufacturer states. I cannot speak to that as of yet, but I will revise this review once I start using this more. Gotta prep for summer soon, so I am sure I will bust this out eventually!</li>
            <li> I have it fixed in Melbourne for many more $. I wait for a quote now  i fitted a new globe and still did not work/t</li>
            <li> I still have mixed feelings on the remington but i wanted to try for more sessions so i got another replacement cartiladge, they are really easy to switch out</li>
            <li> Love the machine. People might not have real expectations for lazer hair removal but I&#x27;ve been to the American lazer center, $1000 for just 4in square areas. And you have to drive the, etc. Deal with them losing your appointments. I can do this at home, in minutes and got the same frickin results! Best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. The hair is very fine and much of it grows at a super slow rate. Every two weeks, for ~ a year. Even though I have skipped weeks at a time. On the 2nd or 3rd highest setting never tried anything higher.  So if you&#x27;re planning on going somewhere and paying for $1000s, try this first, it&#x27;s the same lazer!</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say, as i read by other views, this cartrige did not do 1500 pulses as it said. I did my body for only one treatment and the cartrige run out. in this case i will end up buying one cartrige for each treatment, which is going to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> The best item with the the best price</li>
            <li> Ive been using the remington pro for some time now. I am Cuban-American and have stubborn body hair. I did the treatment on my legs, bikini, stomache, and underarms. After several months I gave up on my legs and bikini area. But the treatment took well to my stomache and my armpits. Now I use it every other week to keep my hairs from growing back. my armpit skin is smoothe and looks really natural. These bulbs and the remington pro machine was worth just for that.</li>
            <li> The light is suppose to last for 1500 pulses, I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 of the lights and none of them have lasted for 1500 pulses.  The price of the replacement lights is very high for what little results are produced.  It seems like Remington is trying to make big bucks off the replacement lights.</li>
            <li> I purchased this second light when I bought the main unit knowing that I would eventually need it, in stalled t today and it fits and works as expected.</li>
            <li> they work great.need to order more actually.</li>
            <li> Sounds great, sounds easy to do! NOT! Time consuming, hurts, takes a long time to kill the hair at the root. Had it low everytime and still had RED BUMPS on my skin. Just stuck it in closet and started shaving again.</li>
            <li> The hair removal system works, and these cartridges are a must have to maintain those troubled spots.  Obviously, we&#x27;ve found that they last longer if you use the lower light level...but you gotta do what you gotta do...</li>
            <li> OMG - tried it once, on Level on - then gave it away.  It may work - but really really hurts!</li>
            <li> it was as expected, good thing that i ordered this item in advance because the cartridge of the unit i bought dies earlier as expected</li>
            <li> I have used the Remington I-Light Pro for 6 weeeks and have not seen a reduction in hair growth.  I watched the video and tried it as stated.  i will be returning it.  Remington really missed the boat on this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair. I have no complaints, this product works exactly as described! I have empty patches of hair whenever I use it which I think is great because I don&#x27;t feel I have to shave as frequently as I did before I started using the Remington iLight</li>
            <li> the cartridges don&#x27;t last for more than 3-5 uses on SMALL areas.  Paying for professional laser treatment would&#x27;ve been more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Handy way o getting your own hair removal with the laser technology.</li>
            <li> Limited skin tone and hair color. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this five times. So far I can not see a big improvement. I have a hairy back,chest and belly. Light skin and brown hair. This was supposed to work best for my skin and hair color. I will use it another five times. If I don&#x27;t start to see results I will give up on it. I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> While my legs did not stay as smooth as daily shaving, after 4 treatments the hair growth is much thinner, lighter and I only have to shave once a week in bathing suit weather to stay looking hairless.  I have a birth mark and the hair on it would grow horribly thick and dark with a rough texture.  The I-Light Pro eliminated that completely and I don&#x27;t even have to shave that all.  Did not work as well on my underarms.</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement light, but the overall IPL product works well.</li>
            <li> Cartridges are easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The machine doesn&#x27;t work, so neither do these. Invest in a really good razor and let someone else spend the money on the R&amp;D.</li>
            <li> Works well, and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Bought this due to my new unit misfiring. I still have misfires, but the unit is now working with rest breaks.</li>
            <li> What more do you really need to know? My skin is not light so I have been really surprised and impressed at the results.  Unfortunately I love this thing so much I ran out of bulbs. But its winter so I am not shaving every day like I would be in the Summer and wow you can tell it is working.  With 1/4 inch hair on my bikini line I have large spots without hair! That&#x27;s also the case with my arms and legs to a lesser degree.  It works better with the darker hair for sure.  I also use it much more often than instructed, probably every 2-3 days on the highest strength. Oh and I started at the end of December and half gone through 2 bulbs.  Still cheaper than paying to get it done and I do it in my bathroom. Can&#x27;t beat that. Gotta go order more bulbs!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this home laser system and could not be more pleased with the results.  I have little to no hair on every inch of my legs and I did it for way less money than going to a salon to have it laser-ed away, as we all know how ridiculously expensive that is!  This product is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Light works great, too bad it doesn&#x27;t last that long. Maybe like solar panels the tech will improve with time.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  Easy to operate. Price was good too!&lt;br /&gt;Really nice to find something this personal to do at home.</li>
            <li> The machine works so great. The lights are a little expensive but worth it to have such smooth legs! Love it. Recommend the whole system</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing compared to professional laser. Your hair must be really dark (practically black) for it to really work, unlike professional which will pick up more lightly colored hair. You have to use it a lot to see professional outcomes, however it is still useful and it&#x27;s convenient to have it at home. Grab an ice pack, set it to the highest setting and zap away!</li>
            <li> Yesterday the yellow light warning was on again. I just used the bulb twice, no more than 20 shots! I turned the machine off and on twice, finally the warning was gone. Wonder how long this bulb is going to last. Will keep update.</li>
            <li> I love my Remington hair removal system. I have only replace the cartridge once in a year. The cartridge is very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I have found that one cartridge only lasts you a couple trips all over your body.  Plan on buying several over the course of your hair removal process.  And always have one on-hand in case your cartridge runs out in the middle of a treatment!!!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely skeptical now and am unsure if it would be wise to purchase another replacement cartridge from Amazon. The light cartridge that my I-Light Pro came with lasted for several applications (each under arm area). So, when I received my replacement, I figured I would get nearly the same quality. Unfortunately, the cartridge only worked for one under arm application and then never lit again. I do recall the box the cartridge came in having a piece of cellophane tape holding one side closed and hoping that I didn&#x27;t get a used product. I suppose this is a risk when purchasing items online, but I didn&#x27;t expect this from Amazon. I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen to most, but felt the need to post this review as something to consider.</li>
            <li> Works well I see a decrease on hair growth</li>
            <li> perfect arrived faster than expected will buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product weekly for over a month now and I have not seen any noticeable results whatsoever.Very annoyed that I shelled out so much money for something that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t speak english</li>
            <li> I have used this many times  and I do see some results , they are minimal . If you get one of these be prepared to buy a dozen cartridges before you see any real results.</li>
            <li> love it works wonders and seller is great fast delivery and i highly recommend this product to remove hair, though it does not work well on blonde hairs</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love my I-light Pro.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past few months, it&#x27;s working ok. I started with 3 power/level and I have a white skin with dark brown hair. The hairs are actually quite thick and many of them. I noticed that there is a gradual reduction in the hair after every session of treatment. Especially, I am happy with the bikini area and the gradual hair reduction there. It DOES HURT badly, but I can tolerate pain pretty well. The hair there was quite think and full. Now, after 4th session, the treated area are rather becoming free of hair. I bought it for 300 Australian Dollars, in a very good deal. It is definitely worth that price. But anything higher than 500 dollars, I would consider it closely and compare with some other options.</li>
            <li> Easy and economical replacement lights</li>
            <li> First bulb didn&#x27;t last as long as expected but the product absolutely helps reduce the thickness and quantity of hair on treated areas.</li>
            <li> Even after using for six months all hair grew back!  Had a two month break waiting for delivery. Very disappointed as I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Ulta doesn&#x27;t sell the replacements so now I have to buy from here. Everything worked fine and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product does work, but the light cartridges don&#x27;t last as they should - I went through the 2 that came with the system and both lasted fewer than 50 pulses, not the 1500 that is promised.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get rid of the hair, but if you keep at it, it works very well.  So far I am totally smooth under my arms, and almost all leg hair is gone.  I&#x27;m working up to the bikini area, slowly working that down.  It is a bit painful at first, but very easy to deal with.  JUst make sure to shave first, or it smells like burning hair and is a bit more painful.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It really slows hair growth.  It does not hurt and is quick to use.  I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> Used before.  Still love this.</li>
            <li> I wanna return it back because I thought it a hair removal.. Not replacement part</li>
            <li> Broke after trying to put a replacement cartridge in.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, used it a few times and can see the results.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement cartridges for my laser hair removal system.</li>
            <li> cartridge works fine, but the Remington unit is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a back up for the laser hair remover.</li>
            <li> Cartridge yields around 50% of expected and results are around 20% of promised.&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to last for 3 full body applications and was not sufficient for two.&lt;br /&gt;Power seems to low, only some hairs are burned and others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After several months using it as instructed, and sometimes applying more than one time in the same area in the same day, results are too small, hair is still there.&lt;br /&gt;I have white skin and very dark hair, so I expected good results on my body.</li>
            <li> ive been using the remington for 6 months once a week on my second replacement head this system doesnt work and is a waste of money i have light skin and dark hair i see no results</li>
            <li> The replacement cartdridge has worked so far as well as the original cartridge worked. Easy to change. Like I mentioned in my review of the IPL machine it significantly extends the time between shavings but doesn&#x27;t even come close to three months of being hair free. For me that result is sufficient, you need to know what to expect.</li>
            <li> This brings up an important debate.  Does this light yield 1500 flashes?  I have not counted, but apparently it does not.  You will go through multiple lights to get rid of an undesired area of hair growth.  That is reality</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy the system after reading some of the reviews about the light not lasting very long.  I am glad I did anyway.  I have done three full treatments and one partial and am still on the first light cartridge.  I would definitely recommend this, and will repurchase when needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Remington iLight Pro!  I am fair skinned with freckles and I have medium brown hair.  These replacements are so nice, and cheaper (Subscribe &amp; Save!!!) than other sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the iLight about six or eight times over the course of a month.  That leaves me free from shaving or lasering for the next couple of months - really!  I do pick up a razor maybe once or twice to get strays, but if I do, I also re-laser that area with the iLight to get that hair&#x27;s growth cycle (all hair doesn&#x27;t grow at once, each follicle has its&#x27; own cycle, and you have to hit each cycle with the laser a couple/few times in order to penetrate - hence multiple times over a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the iLight for a couple years, and while my hair still pretty much grows back, I have actually noticed that the backs of my calves are completely hair free, my bikini line is thinner, and my underarm hair is much finer.  The hair on my shins is still what it was, but even at the end of the growth stage (once it starts to grow back - I tested to see the final result) it isn&#x27;t as long as it used to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the iLight, and these refills are pretty cheap (Subscribe &amp; Save!!!!!) compared to Hammacher Schlemmer (where I bought my machine).  Great price, they always work, and it&#x27;s an AMAZING product.  I haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones, so I can&#x27;t compare them, but I like this one and these refills are great.</li>
            <li> Recieved item promptly. Works great and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I got the [[ASIN:B005CHHO46 Remington IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System]] as a gift for my wife in January 2012, and she got some results on her underarms; unfortunately, she couldn&#x27;t find the required patience in herself to go any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she used up a couple of bulbs in six months, I can give you some feedbacks on how the cartridges are. She could get flashes somewhere in the range of 1,000 pulses, but only the first 500s are super powerful; they still work after that, but they lose their power gradually.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original.</li>
            <li> Muito eficiente esse depilados a laser. Recomendo</li>
            <li> The I Light system works very well. My hair has been growing back much slower and thinner. I only have to shave on average of twice weekly. I would have given it 5 stars if hair regrowth was much less, like only having to shave once every 1-2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> With lower power it takes longer but last longer too other wise the device works good as a replacement. .</li>
            <li> I think the Remington Light Pro is the only system where the parts are not that expensive. I had looked at the price of the replacement cartridge before I bought the system and that really helped me make the decision to go ahead and buy the I-light Pro hair removal system.</li>
            <li> I bought the remington hair remover for my girlfriend as a gift. She is still useing the original cartridge that came with the machine. I&#x27;m sure the refill is just as good.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m about 90% hair free.  Use only on my legs and under arms and will last about 3 full sessions for the most part.</li>
            <li> I have hated dark hair, fair skin combo on my legs for 40 years....too cheap for pro laser....this seems to be working...down from shaving every day to just patches twice weekly after 4 treatments....only concern is that cartridges are very variable...first one 2 full treatments, 2nd one, one treatment, we&#x27;ll see if I get another treatment from 3rd.....but so far it&#x27;s worth it even at 1 treatment per cartridge</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get many treatments out of the bulbs, very expensive to replace</li>
            <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s like the professional machines.</li>
            <li> Coverage is low. Bulb life is too short.</li>
            <li> This device is amazing and saved me $1000s on getting professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li> Works well but takes several treatments like the instructions say.  At first it seemed the bulbs did not last as long as advertised, but i thing there close to 1500.  I did have some that would not flash every time. missed about 10%.  The reason for 4 stars in the cost.  My upper legs have dark hair and I get about 1 1/2 treatments from a bulb.  so it&#x27;s like a bulb once a month or so.  but it does  work.  I&#x27;m at about 70-80% less hair and whats there is lighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had system for less than three months.  I had intended to use it every week but I&#x27;ve skipped probably four weeks now because of how quickly these bulbs die.  The system itself costs over $200 and when you&#x27;re paying over $20 for each bulb it gets costly very quickly.  My system came with a bulb and I got a $50 target giftcard for buying the system from their site so I got two replacement bulbs with that and another off of amazon.  So that&#x27;s four bulbs and I&#x27;ve only gotten an average of two uses from each bulb.  I&#x27;ve counted pulses as well and mine usually only last for 700 pulses at most.  It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the system itself for those wondering.  It works..but only kind of.  I&#x27;ve noticed the hair on my legs are a little thinner and not growing back in some places but I&#x27;ve noticed no difference to my arms, underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does, but the bulbs are inconsistent.  Like most reviewers here, my first bulb lasted just about 2 full uses, but it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a replacement bulb here at Amazon and it worked for about 5 full uses, but not as well.  I&#x27;d much rather have an effective 2 uses than an ineffective 5 uses.  The hair is still coming in thinner, which I greatly appreciate, but I liked it better when it actually went away for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably still order another bulb, but I admit that I&#x27;m nervous to do so, especially now that the price has gone back up to $25.  Which efficiency am I going to get?</li>
            <li> there were no where near 1500 flashes in each cartridge, and I bought 2 of them. I have contacted Remington, but have no help from them. even though the product really works, the cartridges don&#x27;t last even 500 flashes, maybe even less</li>
            <li> Just started using this &amp; it seems to be doing what it says..no hair growth after a few tx though...good service w/ the reorders.</li>
            <li> perfect delivery services&lt;br /&gt;i used it six months ago it is economic and till now solve problem partially hope by frequent use solve it completely</li>
            <li> The original bulb lasted 5-6 treatments, but the replacement bulb only lasted one treatment.  I&#x27;m writing Remington to see why but it appears that others have this problem as well.</li>
            <li> This article does not live 1500 lights ... The first lamp lasted less than 100 lights. And I need a new replacement cartridge to continue.</li>
            <li> the results are more visible after the second or third session, but i dont know how many sessions until the long term results</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly and comes packaged in a container that protects the product without crushing the item.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Okay price on a replacement bulb.  I&#x27;ll have to see if the product holds up to the estimated amount of flashes.</li>
            <li> Top product, works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed .It stoped work after 1 minute. And I have no choice, I have to buy other one, because I need replaice this light.</li>
            <li> They work, they just don&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> The hair removal system doesn&#x27;t work. The machines coverage area for removal of hair is so small and the cartridges don&#x27;t last very long on maximum setting.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Bella light system from Israel, large coverage area, cartridges last quite a while at maximum setting  Finally a solution for hair removal!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd refill. I have hardly any hair left on my legs. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I used this product according to the directions.  It stated you needed to do 2 treatments 2 weeks apart.  I am not at 4 treatments and 3 bulbs later and still very little results.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, and burn out super fast.</li>
            <li> Get lots of cartridges the don&#x27;t last very long.  Happy they are more reasonable than the other laser treatment machines.</li>
            <li> Is very good, I&#x27;m really liking the results. I recommended the product to 02 more friends, they are also bought and loving the results of the product......The only thing I do not like is the price of cartridge in Brazil.</li>
            <li> is working really good, the bulb light has been wroking without any issue, and the ressults are going as the promissed, so far, is a 5 star review!</li>
            <li> Never really worked and boke right after the month warranty.  Complete waste of money.  Wish I had listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The iLight works, it takes some time but it does. But the cartridges are awful, they don&#x27;t last 1,500 pulses like they say. I used my replacement one for underarms twice and legs once and it already needs replacing again. I got the iLight with a replacement cartridge in September. I&#x27;ts not even the end of October and I already had to buy 2 mores cartridges. There is something really wrong here. This might be intentional as the company will make more profits selling the cartridges than the product itself or this cartridges are really not good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for myself.  I have used it 4 times using 2 cartridges.  The first cartridge that came with the unit lasted me 2 1/2 treatments.  I thought that was about right because it said 2-3 full treatments.  The second replacement cartridge however only lasted 1 1/2 treatments.  I am sure it was no where near the 1500 flashes so I was pretty disappointed with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair loss, there is some but not what I expected.  I still have to shave every other day.  I am light skinned with black hair on my legs so I thought I would be the perfect candidate.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t waited long enough?  But now with the very short life of the replacement cartridge, I am questioning my purchase.  It is going to get very expensive, if the cartridge is only going to last half as long as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read on another review today to slow down and let things cool and that my help the cartridge life.  I will try that.</li>
            <li> Well, It does last as long as it says and I have never had one die early. I usually counted all of my flashes and it would always seem to die at exactly 1500. Almost like they were programmed to die at 1500. And 1500 flashes does not cover nearly as much as they say. If you are diligent and cover every inch, then you&#x27;ll have to buy a new cartridge after every use. It quickly became just as expensive as professional laser hair removal (if you get the treatments through groupon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, although very slowly. It took me over 4 months before the results were worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not buying this one and instead going for their new device, which can last for 30,000 flashes. It is much less expensive and has much stronger flashes than these ones.</li>
            <li> My wifey loves it, no more expensive trips to beauty salons.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!i really love it and for sure im gonna buy again from you.thanks a lot again!see you again</li>
            <li> the shippipng came earlier than estimated time. i recommend this product for people who wants a longer lasting hair removal and don&#x27;t want to deal with the wax products. the only thing that you trade for the convenience is time. it does take a bit of your free time to cover the areas of hair removal you want.</li>
            <li> I tried this on dark hair over 3months and used 2 replacement heads, should have kept my money, don&#x27;t waste your time with this</li>
            <li> I am positive there is no way it gave the number of light emissions it claimed it would.  Rip off.</li>
            <li> This product did not work, but the warranty was great. I was able to return it with no issues as they stated.</li>
            <li> I normally am happy with these but the last one is a dude. It just flashes a weak blue and barely does that though now and then if I keep trying it does a real flash. I was busy though and so hadn&#x27;t used it right away so was too late to return. Emailed CS but they said to clean the cone and when that didn&#x27;t work to call. I didn&#x27;t feel like the long wait so hung up. I&#x27;m sure I know what thay&#x27;d say anyway I waited too long for a replacement cartridge but to try a new one and if that isn&#x27;t it I&#x27;d need to buy a new cone. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the cartridge it was working fine before the new one.</li>
            <li> My first time replacing the bulb in my I-Light.  Came packaged well, and replacing was a breeze.  Bulb fit and worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> These work fantastically well. I personally am on my second one. but I do see results with them.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, this product works amazing and will save so much money rather than visiting the laser clinic. I definitely love it for bikini season!</li>
            <li> The machine itself is great. But I think the replacement lights are defective. The first light that came with my machine let me do my legs, top and bottom, my underarms and my bikini line for 3 full treatments. I am 5&#x27; 6&amp;#34; with very long legs. The first replacement light did not even do one leg lower leg, maybe 40-50 pulses, as best. The second light I was able to finish my legs and do my underarms and most of my bikini line and than it too stopped. It was very disappointing to spend $40 on replacement lights and only 1/3 of the life as the original light. Some of the reviews say you can overheat the light and crack it. I see that could be possible except the first replacement light did not even get the change to get hot and I was very careful not to block the vents. Is there any guarantee for life span?</li>
            <li> Works very well! A full series of three treatments, and I am down to only needing to shave once a week. Stubble is finer and sparser. Definitely pickup extra bulbs, which is another selling point for this model- cheapest refills!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three replacement bulbs now and none of them has given me the 1200-1500 pulses that it&#x27;s supposed to, and even worse, every bulb has given me a different number of pulses. Where is the quality control here?! Clearly, the replacement cartridges are an issue as it&#x27;s noted in many reviews, maybe it&#x27;s time to fix the problem already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  OWNED THIS PRODUCT 2 YEARS NOW AND THE BOTTOMLINE IS, THE HAIR REMOVAL IS NOT PERMANENT, IT ONLY KEEPS THE HAIR AWAY WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVELY USING THE MACHINE.</li>
            <li> It does burn the hair off your skin, and it stuns it for a while. It does grow back though. Don&#x27;t think this is the laser that the professionals use for permanent removal.</li>
            <li> The bulb doesn&#x27;t last long. I purchased one bulb a few months ago and I&#x27;m in need of another one already.</li>
            <li> this works great, lots of zaps, i can tell my hairgrowth is improving. i have dark hair, light skin, just perfect for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using according with the instructions. I hope it be very good! I already like it.</li>
            <li> My wife really raves about it, so it does what it says it does. Can&#x27;t elaborate more except when the wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> These heads are a total waste of money, you may as well go get Laser treatment for the cost to keep replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> Guys,stay tidy, if you do not like being \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; this tool will do it for you, underarm hair, wherever, gone, cleanly,painlessly</li>
            <li> Just got it and used it once. So far it seems to work just like the professional ones do. For a fraction of the cost. Keeping track of the light flashes since that has been an issue for some making posts. If it gets anywhere near the 1500 flashes if will be great. It is slower going than the salon but again half the price and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> This really does work well. The reason for the 4 stars is it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim. They seem to vary in amount of flashes they last. The last one I used two times ... Bikini area, both underarms and one calf.</li>
            <li> I almost got two full body treatments (underarm, bikini, and legs from mid-thigh down) from one cartridge.  Not sure of the exact count of pulses, but I doubt there were 1500.  Once the unit&#x27;s yellow light came on (indicating the life of the cartridge nearing the end), there were maybe 30 pulses left.  Keep a spare on hand to avoid not being able to complete a treatment.  Other than usage life, I still like the product and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I really like not having to shave so often.  It&#x27;s easy to use with long cords, both from the outlet and to the hand held zapper. After the first few times of use, I went through the first bulb quickly.  I would like this machine better if replacing bulbs were not so expensive.  So now I alternate between using a cream hair remover and the iLight.  I have shaved my hairy areas maybe once in the last two years...and much of the hair has never returned.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m reviewing the cartridge only, but didn&#x27;t buy the system here, got at Walmart.  Buy cartridges on Amazon, cheap and easy to get with Prime.  I love this machine - in just a few months, I have a lot less hair.  I was sure it was not going to work, and have been amazed.  I have lots of thick, black hair on light skin, so that&#x27;s perfect for the system; it won&#x27;t work as well on lighter hair or darker skin.  With that in mind, this has cut the leg hair to about 1/3 of what I had and underarm hair (which was a LOT) is nearly gone.  Between shaves, I just get back a light number of hairs on legs and armpits.  It takes mere minutes to shave now -and legs are smooth for days!  In my whole life, I&#x27;ve had razor stubble and burn, so this is a delight.  Its easy to use, too - I have used 6-7 times in 6 months and not all hair is gone, but its a lot less and much easier to shave.  Not sure if it will ever be all gone, but that happens with the pricey office laser hair removal, too - my dau. had that and it comes back, too.  I have gone thru 3 or 4 cartridges, though, as I have a lot of thick hair, and have done both arms, legs (upper and lower) and bikini line, and under arms, and fingers, toes (seriously) and even though it says its not for face, I used on upper lip with great success and no problem.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the results of this product! Worked MAYBE for a few weeks then all the hair returned just as thick!! Does not work on facial hair! :(</li>
            <li> it is a excellent product and it work very well. I love it and I happy with the product, thanks</li>
            <li> Okay, we all think we are smarter than the directions, so if you start out on a higher level, you do get a little zap... but it definitely works. I will keep working with it and live a hair free life. :)</li>
            <li> For the price I have spent on bulb replacements I could have gone to a professional and pay to have it done.</li>
            <li> Now my wife can use her Hair removal again. She thought it was broken but I was able to get it to work again</li>
            <li> The first four were good, but the last one just burst out whileI was using it!&lt;br /&gt;I am using I light hair removal, it is real good one. Maybe the was an honest mistake from the company.</li>
            <li> The cartridge ran out after 2 uses.  They definitely don&#x27;t last as long as promised.  By the time you are done with the number of sessions you need, you&#x27;ll actually spend more than paying for professional hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good, and the hair does stay away for a good amount of time. Overall, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The replacement seems to be lasting longer than the original cartridge that came with the laser.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Still using it.  It&#x27;s not permanent, but they don&#x27;t claim it is either.  I don&#x27;t think the hair growth stops as long as they say, but it is less than shaving.  I did use up one full cartridge and was glad to have a second on hand.  I think the cartridges do seem to last about as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to complete the job of the recommended 3 sessions, so be sure to buy multiple.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the IPL machine itself.  Overall, it does work, but the results are temporary.  However, the hair is taking a looooonnng time to grow back, which is good.  The replacement cartridges don&#x27;t last more than 500 flashes.  However, as long as the product works and is slowing the growth of my hair I am happy.</li>
            <li> it does not work.  i have zapped my stomach on level 5 for 9 times total.  It reduced the growth about 1% .  very spotty,  so now i have a couple of smooth patches in my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this machine will not save you time, because it doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this machine is expensive and doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hurts like hell on any sensitive area.  Doing your private areas are out of question as the level one is too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theres a reason why this machine hasnt put laser hair clinics out of business.  BECAUSE IT DOESNT WORK!</li>
            <li> It was very easy tu buy the product and everythin went fine. The whole hair removal system is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but takes time.</li>
            <li> This is good product. thanks.</li>
            <li> changing the bulbs on the machine was very easy and the results are great. I like how easy the device works and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great complement. As expected.</li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to do my own hair removal when I have the time.  This little machine makes it possible.  It took about 8-10 treatments (once a week).  But I can finally say I don&#x27;t have to shave my arm pits!</li>
            <li> This cartridge retails for $25.  That&#x27;s what I saw it in the stores for, that&#x27;s what I saw it on eBay for.  Here, it was only $20, shipped and sold by Amazon.  With their free shipping on $25, you&#x27;ll save on shipping if you can just find something for $5 more!  Anyway, good price for the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IPL hair removal system itself... it says do it every two weeks.  I&#x27;ve started to do it every week, highest power level setting of 5 (ouch!).  Fair skin, dark hair... technically this system should really do the trick.  I&#x27;ve seen about 70% less hair in areas where I&#x27;ve used it.  It&#x27;s not hair-less.  Just less hair.  Still need to shave, but there&#x27;s definitely less to shave, and definitely smoooooother than just shaving alone, where hair would come back and always lead to ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t really found the perfect perfect solution for hair removal yet, but this beats shaving and waxing.  Waxing may be very smooth for a few days but really, when the hairs grown back it&#x27;s ingrown all the time (and my hair is pin straight!).  Shaving straight alone leads to razor burn by the next day.  Even using Tend Skin, while either waxing or shaving.  So, so far this zapping system does seem to work best.  Like I said, takes off about 70% of the hair, the rest is daily shaving (and TendSkin... and only ever like 2 random ingrown hairs vs a dozen!) to keep it totally fuzz free and smooth.  Would say I&#x27;m generally happy -- and generally smooth haha -- with the IPL system overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes I&#x27;m a guy.  Guys need to groom too...!  ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just i was looking for my Remington i ligth pro plus</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work w the item it&#x27;s used with. Some kind of glitch between this item and the manufacturers equipment of the laser. Light blinks yellow instead of green.</li>
            <li> like all Remington products</li>
            <li> Worked for 1 day, my wife tried it once when we got it, when she tried to use it a month later it did not work, and it was too late to return it as it is not covered by amazon&#x27;s protection anymore.</li>
            <li> works about two rounds then needs replacing</li>
            <li> To get much success out of this product, I had to completely ignore the directions.  I used it twice a week, doubling up on each area  for each session, and after about 3 months had significant hair reduction.  Currently, hair is coming in finer, much more slowly and there is much less of it, but I&#x27;m not sure what would be required for complete hair elimination.  Crank it straight up to max each time.  It can sting like a b*tch depending on where you use it, but anything else is a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> Ad the moment to used, only worked for 5 times and the manual said that this item is damage, because the i light pro sound but do not flash the light</li>
            <li> The product appears to operate as advertised but I am unsure of results as I have not used for the full length of the recommended time period.  It causes some discomfort but it depends where you are using it how uncomfortable it gets.</li>
            <li> not as good as salon lazer.  taKES MULTIPLUEapplications.  needs a higher setting i can take the pain.  easy to use.</li>
            <li> the unit itself is pricey..but worth every penny!! the results are just as good as my drs. lazor..but 75% less pain!!i use it 2x a month on average...says not for face ..but if u use safety lenses aka/tanning booth its fine i use it on my face..i struggled for 20 years with polycystic ovarian which gives u facial hair like a man ..this is an amazing item..i have 85% less hair than before its not overnight...2 years of treatments</li>
            <li> I have ordered these a few times now, they work well with the system and last a long time.  I did get one package that did not work and that was just a matter of returning it for one that did.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit. It is very easy to use. The cartridge is long lasting. The down fall is that you cannot use it on your face at all and it covers a small area at a time. Does not completely eliminate hair but definitely thins it and slows its growth. Shadows after shaving are less visible.</li>
            <li> The light won&#x27;t flash most of the time and it&#x27;s frustrating.  Expensive, and not worth it.  A lot of money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the wrong product by mistake so am unable to rate the product.. I didn&#x27;t realize it was not the whole system.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does the job as described</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I felt informed and had what I thought to be reasonable expectations. I am underwhelmed by the Light-pro. Using as instructed, I have seen no results in over a month. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the bulb burned out long before the claims of the company. I purchased this to avoid electrolysis on a troubled area. Now I will probably still have to go spend another $300 to actually get results.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Skip this one.</li>
            <li> It was good deal, delevered on time, price was good as will, but I expect to have better price. the is limited selection option in the site to almost no other options</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and actually works, but it runs out way too fast</li>
            <li> Love my Remington, Had to find a new place to get replacement heads. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This works well but the time I got out the last one seemed short. Hopefully this one will last longer.</li>
            <li> Some of these devices that just bought did not work properly</li>
            <li> The bulb does not last as long as advertised. With the original bulb that came with the machine I was able to do my legs, bikini and my husband&#x27;s back three times over. The replacements burn out after only doing my legs once.</li>
            <li> Try several times, the feeling is very good, for the axillary and Bikini effect is very obvious, with some fine hair effect is not obvious, will continue to use, very love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it WAY more than it says to achieve hair loss, and I have yet to see results. Frustrating!</li>
            <li> Great price!  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This product was defective, the burden is not hard 50 uses and is supposed to have paid a few thousand</li>
            <li> It was exactly as expected! I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and I&#x27;ve recomended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;It was effective on me!</li>
            <li> Some people complaint about short lamp life, which I too have experienced. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good design as far as keeping the lamp cool and the heat eventually makes it fail prematurely. My advise is to slow down how fast you flash the unit so that the flash tube stays cooler and doesn&#x27;t fracture from overheating and don&#x27;t block the air vents of the hand piece. I&#x27;m keeping the flash intervals at greater than 4 seconds with rest periods of a minute if I feel any little amount of warmth of the air venting out of the hand unit. Using a longer flash interval of probably 6 - 8 seconds would probably be okay for continuous use. Never get impatient and start flashing it fast for little stint, that could be all you need to overheat the tube. Leave the unit on and fan running if you take breaks in your session. Every bit of cooling will help. From my experience I think you&#x27;ll be able to extend the lamp&#x27;s life but it will still fail prematurely due to lots of tiny heat cracks forming in the tube to a point where they leak. My current lamp I estimate is getting close to it&#x27;s maximum flash count using a 4 to 6 second flash interval but it still has developed a fine tangle of tiny fractures all around the cathode but none big enough to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell the problem lies in the way the reflectors in front and behind the tube shroud it from the cooling air so it doesn&#x27;t cool very fast because no real airflow is happening within the confines of the reflectors to cool the center section of the tube. It&#x27;s a shame such a great product has this flaw, but at least it can be partially worked around. This unit really should have been designed with a much higher airflow to cool the lamp and maybe have incorporated some heatsinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Tips to Extend the Lamp Life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, I keep cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol on hand while using the unit, to clean the vaporized debris off of the lens whenever anything is seen on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2, Between uses pull the hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny. Also look at the lamp&#x27;s reflector. It may develop a haze on it. To clean that off I remove the lamp. hold it over a sink and have a small spray bottle with isopropyl alcohol in it that I spray the reflector and tube with. Then I carefully shake the alcohol off and use a hair dryer to dry the lamp off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the Lamp Fails (The technical version)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Xenon flash tube inside of the lamp if overheated develops small fractures that allow the gas inside to seep out. The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts. The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So other than the tube failing how does the unit know when the lamp has \\&quot;expired\\&quot; at 1,500 flashes? Well when I had the lamp apart I noticed a little \\&quot;transistor\\&quot; inside. I looked up the part number an it turns out to be a serially programmed EEPROM. Basically a tiny bit of memory that can store a number. The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM. Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.e hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny.

            <li> I used others remove hair sistems but was very painfull, with the Remington IPL Pro no pain. I&#x27;m happy and expecting great results and smooth skin</li>
            <li> The included cartridge with the i-Light does not even compare to the replacements.  This last so much longer.  I was at first disappointed with how long the included cartridge last and hoped that the replacements would last longer and they do.  Save your self the trouble and buy one of these if you just ordered the i-Light!</li>
            <li> not too bad, except for the 1500 flash limit. Definitely effective, although several (more than three) repeats were needed. Word!</li>
            <li> Love the results. Works great, if you stay consistent. Must shave first then use laser after. Time consuming only very small area at a time.</li>
            <li> This product broke after 2 months of use ! The apparatus that holds the cartridge has malfunctioned/broke and so the unit is inoperable. I now have to pay another $50-$60 to replace this part and I am concerned that it will break again within a short period of time. The unit sits in my bathroom cubby and I am debating what to do with it. Paid $299.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to claim any warranty on the product because I live in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
