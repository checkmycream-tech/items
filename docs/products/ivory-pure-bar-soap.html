    <ol>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s the best soap.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT ITEM</li>
            <li>AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE.  </li>
            <li>This is a great soap to use if you are hypoallergenic!</li>
            <li>This soap is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good soap.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy &amp; my confidence has increased.</li>
            <li>This soap is great for my skin.</li>
            <li>lol.....</li>
            <li>A great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>This 16-count package of Ivory is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice.</li>
            <li>I use nothing more than Ivory soap and this package deal was a very good one.  </li>
            <li>it is good for those who have allergy and don&#x27;t want to smell any thing.</li>
            <li>And it always gives me a good cleaning after my showers.</li>
            <li>And for the people who said it does not have a good smell...</li>
            <li>For shower, buy something else with nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent of the soap is a sugary, corn-flakey kind of delight.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is perfect - light and fresh.</li>
            <li>This soap is cheap but good.</li>
            <li>Plus, its so nice to never \\&quot;run out\\&quot; any more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>gentle skin cleanser - which are great for sensitivity -</li>
            <li>Nothing. :-)   </li>
            <li>What more could I ask?)</li>
            <li>AM PLEASED WITH PURCHASE</li>
            <li>There are so many bars in the package; it is truly a wonder.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Dove is a better bet than this version of Ivory.</li>
            <li>this is better than dove to me as well, bc</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It should be nice just like the original ivory :)</li>
            <li>It always makes me feel very clean after every use.</li>
            <li>And it always feels so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li>(And it is cheap, too.</li>
            <li>I started using Ivory Soap bars in college because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>The soap does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean you up.  </li>
            <li>Beats all those pricey fragrant designer soaps and always leaves a clean just washed aura.  </li>
            <li>I just want to smell clean, not smell like flowers.</li>
            <li>One hint though: for whatever reason this soap is kind of damp coming out of the clear plastic overwrapper.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done using this soap, your body will be fresh and clean --</li>
            <li>The kids love how it floats, so they are more likely to use it.  </li>
            <li>I spoke with a good dermatologist who told me to buy some plain, ivory bar soap and keep the skin area very clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And don&#x27;t worry, Ivory will also lather as good as other soaps but doesn&#x27;t need special ingredients to do so.</li>
            <li>If you want perfume in your soap, then get a different kind....</li>
            <li>as many other ppl mentioned it does leave the skin a little dry but the scent is very good,,, basic and great value for money</li>
            <li>This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li>5 stars for the soap quality, took away a star for their logo change (prefer the old logo) and the significantly shrunk bar sizes and higher</li>
            <li>etc... (pretty much everything.)</li>
            <li>I opened our two packages and stacked the criss crossed bars in a cardboard box to dry out some more and cure.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t do a whole lot to kill germs for hand washing, or wound care.  </li>
            <li>Since my kids have skin problems, this soap does not seem to aggravate it as much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>We switched from body wash and saved a ton of money, plus this lasts much longer too.</li>
            <li>The whole reason a lot of people buy it</li>
            <li>Later in life I&#x27;ve used every different kind of soaps.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and gentle, and it does not dry skin out.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the 10 pack at WM, but found it here at a better price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s now more expensive than many soaps, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it that much.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I was using another brand of soap, than I remember Ivory whose claim was 99/100% pure.  </li>
            <li>The only products that were safe for me were baby wash (liquid cleanser) and cetaphil (or generic)</li>
            <li>Bars are slightly bigger than what my local grocery store carries, so this was an even better deal than I thought I was getting.  </li>
            <li>However, although I can afford much more these days, this is the only soap I&#x27;ve used in the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always use this for washing my face it removes all traces of makeup and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The other soap I grew up with has come to smell so strong that I had to store it in the garage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to the old tried and true Ivory soap from another generation.  </li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  </li>
            <li>Its natural!</li>
            <li>Simply Ivory bars really work for me.</li>
            <li>There is no harsh chemicals or perfumes in it.</li>
            <li>When I was a young girl, my parents always used Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and was looking for a soap to use that would not break me out.</li>
            <li>It breaks a little quick and if left in water the whole thing gets soft.  </li>
            <li>The more they dry the easier they are to get the white wax paper wrapper off when you go to use one plus the dryer, harder bar lasts longer than the semi-moist one.</li>
            <li>but she told me they actually use ivory for their patients in their practice because it is simply excellent at killing germs, and yielding less negative reactions than any other products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good, it doesn&#x27;t have any fancy exfoliants or moisturizers, but it cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Ivory is good soap, but it has a terrible odor.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t cause skin breakouts for myself or my wife, and isn&#x27;t loaded down with a bunch of perfumes, and simply works.  </li>
            <li>Oh - and the plain version doesn&#x27;t have a perfume that I can really detect with my sensitive nose -</li>
            <li>It is fine though, I just have 4 broken halves now in the tub.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> yes it will tend to dry out your skin but for me it only happens in the Winter time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised to find this out - since previously all regular soaps, (bar soap, liquid soap, hand-made soap, cleansers, laundry detergents, dish soaps, skin care products, etc) were off limits to me for the bad skin reactions I&#x27;d have.</li>
            <li> After using it for 10 days straight on delicate skin on my neck, that skin did seem a touch dry.</li>
            <li> I think I bought a pack back in 2011, and still have over half left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t want soap mixed with deodorants or other scents.</li>
            <li> This was always my soap of choice.. it always seemed to be the least expensive until recently when they significantly shrunk the size of the bars... not just a little smaller either, much smaller.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about Ivory soap that hasn&#x27;t been said already in this item&#x27;s reviews or elsewhere</li>
            <li> Granted, everyone has different allergies and sensitivities, but plain</li>
            <li> I remember this stuff in my grandparent&#x27;s house 55 years ago, and it still does the job without the stink of other soaps.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;a one downside it would be it&#x27;s a little dry, meaning it may leave the skin a little dry as it doesn&#x27;t have added moisturizers in it like other soaps do.</li>
            <li> To counter the dry skin, I just use a little cetaphil moisturizing cream once a day.</li>
            <li> so I could live in the house without suffocating.      </li>
            <li> I buy it because it is not as harsh as Dial Soap.</li>
            <li> HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> Considering I get ugly red welts, rashes, eczema, and other skin reactions to various products - I was still afraid to try it -</li>
            <li> I still use my delicate skin cleansers for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> It was bad enough in the shower that I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I always have a bad reaction to any soap used (down there) &amp; this didn&#x27;t happen with the Ivory soap!</li>
            <li> I was unable to purchase bath sized Ivory in any drug or grocery stores.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use nothing more than Ivory soap and this package deal was a very good one.  The soap does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean you up.  A great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to the old tried and true Ivory soap from another generation.  Beats all those pricey fragrant designer soaps and always leaves a clean just washed aura.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Granted, everyone has different allergies and sensitivities, but plain Simply Ivory bars really work for me. I couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised to find this out - since previously all regular soaps, (bar soap, liquid soap, hand-made soap, cleansers, laundry detergents, dish soaps, skin care products, etc) were off limits to me for the bad skin reactions I&#x27;d have. The only products that were safe for me were baby wash (liquid cleanser) and cetaphil (or generic) gentle skin cleanser - which are great for sensitivity - but they don&#x27;t do a whole lot to kill germs for hand washing, or wound care.  Well, a medical procedure presented me with a complication. I spoke with a good dermatologist who told me to buy some plain, ivory bar soap and keep the skin area very clean.  I was so hesitant to use the soap - but she told me they actually use ivory for their patients in their practice because it is simply excellent at killing germs, and yielding less negative reactions than any other products. Considering I get ugly red welts, rashes, eczema, and other skin reactions to various products - I was still afraid to try it - but I had to. And, SURPRISE! The ivory did not irritate my skin whatsoever! No welts. No allergic reactions. Nothing. :-)   After using it for 10 days straight on delicate skin on my neck, that skin did seem a touch dry. I was using it several times a day, and concentrating it a bit. To counter the dry skin, I just use a little cetaphil moisturizing cream once a day. Problem solved.  That was a year ago. Since, this has become my go-to hand washing soap. I still use my delicate skin cleansers for the rest of my body. But Ivory will continue to be my hand soap for the future. I even use it for clothing that needs hand washing.   Oh - and the plain version doesn&#x27;t have a perfume that I can really detect with my sensitive nose - so I find that to be a big thumbs up as well. A five star product. (And it is cheap, too. What more could I ask?)</li>
            <li> I have used Ivory Bar Soap for years. I buy it because it is not as harsh as Dial Soap. Since my kids have skin problems, this soap does not seem to aggravate it as much.</li>
            <li> This soap is cheap but good. I recommend it for hands washing. For shower, buy something else with nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars because it almost has no smell. it is good for those who have allergy and don&#x27;t want to smell any thing.</li>
            <li> It breaks a little quick and if left in water the whole thing gets soft.  It is fine though, I just have 4 broken halves now in the tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ivory Soap all my life and I think it&#x27;s the best soap. It&#x27;s the purest soap there is. If there&#x27;a one downside it would be it&#x27;s a little dry, meaning it may leave the skin a little dry as it doesn&#x27;t have added moisturizers in it like other soaps do. But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. There is no harsh chemicals or perfumes in it. I think the smell is perfect - light and fresh. And it always gives me a good cleaning after my showers.</li>
            <li> This was always my soap of choice.. it always seemed to be the least expensive until recently when they significantly shrunk the size of the bars... not just a little smaller either, much smaller. Around the same time the price seemed to increase!  5 stars for the soap quality, took away a star for their logo change (prefer the old logo) and the significantly shrunk bar sizes and higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s now more expensive than many soaps, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it that much.  I see the packaging on these says the bars are 4.5 ounces, which is what they used to be but now around here the bars are 3.1 ounces.</li>
            <li> Bars are slightly bigger than what my local grocery store carries, so this was an even better deal than I thought I was getting.  Not much I can say about Ivory soap that hasn&#x27;t been said already in this item&#x27;s reviews or elsewhere - it&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t cause skin breakouts for myself or my wife, and isn&#x27;t loaded down with a bunch of perfumes, and simply works.  We both grew up with Ivory, have been using it together in our home for a decade now, and will for decades to come.</li>
            <li> I started using Ivory Soap bars in college because it was cheap. However, although I can afford much more these days, this is the only soap I&#x27;ve used in the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t want soap mixed with deodorants or other scents. I just want to smell clean, not smell like flowers. When you&#x27;re done using this soap, your body will be fresh and clean -- no aroma disguise necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t worry, Ivory will also lather as good as other soaps but doesn&#x27;t need special ingredients to do so.</li>
            <li> HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST AND I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.  EXCELLENT ITEM AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE.  AM PLEASED WITH PURCHASE</li>
            <li> The scent of the soap is a sugary, corn-flakey kind of delight. There are so many bars in the package; it is truly a wonder. The wrappers are nonsense. They shred and slough off in a disheartening fashion. The soap is incredibly white.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only soaps that my daughter can use.  She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li> I remember this stuff in my grandparent&#x27;s house 55 years ago, and it still does the job without the stink of other soaps.  The other soap I grew up with has come to smell so strong that I had to store it in the garage so I could live in the house without suffocating.      If you look closely as well, you will find that Ivory has not tried the trick of shrinking the bar to 4 oz.  They have my business for the rest of my washing life.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap to use if you are hypoallergenic! It is mild and gentle, and it does not dry skin out. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good, it doesn&#x27;t have any fancy exfoliants or moisturizers, but it cleans my skin very well. And that&#x27;s all I want in soap. For this price, I&#x27;ve purchased this soap numerous times.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone in my family uses ivory bars of soap. It&#x27;s a very good soap. The scent is very nice. It always makes me feel very clean after every use. It has never irritated my skin. No rash. No itchy feeling after using it. I love this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to use ivory bars of soap. I was at target today and they had 10 bars of ivory soap in a pack for 3 dollars. They had an aloe one so I got that. Never seen it b4. It should be nice just like the original ivory :)</li>
            <li> When I was a young girl, my parents always used Ivory soap.  Later in life I&#x27;ve used every different kind of soaps.  My skin is very sensitive and I was using another brand of soap, than I remember Ivory whose claim was 99/100% pure.  I was unable to purchase bath sized Ivory in any drug or grocery stores.  That is why I went on the internet and found bath size.  It is still the soap I remembered using 77 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Ivory is good soap, but it has a terrible odor. It was bad enough in the shower that I threw it away. Dove is a better bet than this version of Ivory.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome!!! I always have a bad reaction to any soap used (down there) &amp; this didn&#x27;t happen with the Ivory soap! I&#x27;m so happy &amp; my confidence has increased. This is the best. period &amp; it&#x27;s only $1.50 for 3 at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the 10 pack at WM, but found it here at a better price! We switched from body wash and saved a ton of money, plus this lasts much longer too. One hint though: for whatever reason this soap is kind of damp coming out of the clear plastic overwrapper. I opened our two packages and stacked the criss crossed bars in a cardboard box to dry out some more and cure. The more they dry the easier they are to get the white wax paper wrapper off when you go to use one plus the dryer, harder bar lasts longer than the semi-moist one.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin, and was looking for a soap to use that would not break me out. I have tried dove, cetaphil. st ives, oil of olay, ... etc... (pretty much everything.) And for the people who said it does not have a good smell...Its natural! The whole reason a lot of people buy it so they will not break out. If you want perfume in your soap, then get a different kind.... Some people..... lol..... Any who.... this is better than dove to me as well, bc I Also have rosecea and this soap does not make my face itch either! And it always feels so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> as many other ppl mentioned it does leave the skin a little dry but the scent is very good,,, basic and great value for money</li>
            <li> A great price for the quantity. If there&#x27;s any type of Apocalypse, I won&#x27;t be smelling funky for a while. I think I bought a pack back in 2011, and still have over half left.</li>
            <li> I always use this for washing my face it removes all traces of makeup and highly recommend it yes it will tend to dry out your skin but for me it only happens in the Winter time.I have used this on my son since he was born.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I&#x27;m not allergic to.  I love it.  I even wash my hair with it.</li>
            <li> This 16-count package of Ivory is a great deal.  The kids love how it floats, so they are more likely to use it.  Plus, its so nice to never \\&quot;run out\\&quot; any more.</li>
