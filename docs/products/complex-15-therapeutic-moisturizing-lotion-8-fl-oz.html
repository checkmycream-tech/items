            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this lotion online!  </li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog your pours, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, yet provides amazing moisture for your skin without being greasy at all .</li>
            <li>This is amazing lotion.   </li>

            <li>I love this lotion and have been using it for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps many of you.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the face cream and the moisturizing lotion and love them both.  </li>
            <li>I also have eczema, and have most lotions to be ineffective.  </li>
            <li>so I can put more on throughout the day.  </li>

            <li>This is definitely the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for 30 years and  still love the results.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a doctor many years ago</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many skin products, so this is one that I can use.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I just hope I&#x27;m always able to find it.  </li>
            <li>shipped fast, this is a great product - recommended by my Dermatologist 20 years ago and have used it since...</li>
            <li>This is simply the best that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>In the winter I slather it on, and then sometimes put on more.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully</li>
            <li>It does seem to have a magic touch for soothing most of the issues I encounter with my problem skin.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it were perfumed :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>The milia is going away and my skin looks even better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice lotion and works great for my husband who&#x27;s on oxygen and can only use non petroleum based products when there&#x27;s oxygen running in his room.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with Pears soap, rinse it well, and pat it lightly leaving most of the water on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light,never feels greasy and great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is one more time that I&#x27;ve learned that when you get a great deal at Amazon, you better buy ALOT since it may not last.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who need to moisturize but who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had used it for many years after a woman who had fantastic skin told me she used it.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for persons sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>In addition was able to pick up a product I needed which wasn&#x27;t available in my area of the country.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over 15 years - it&#x27;s perfect to use before you put your make-up on, very light, dries very fast, you just need a dime size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, or skin easily prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and non-greasy and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it is still available in Canada at normal prices!  </li>
            <li>, you cannot fine it at all here with out a Dr. perception.</li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly, not at all greasy, and feels wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Ha it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light with no oil and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this lotion because a friend said it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>the local drug store dropped it, I am so happy for Amazon..</li>
            <li>I found it online but also at my local drugstore which is great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all over, light lotion that I even put on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>However, it is no longer available from them.  </li>
            <li>Even though the cost is much more now, I felt it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>And now that I&#x27;ve spoken to Merck and they&#x27;ve confirmed that it&#x27;s been officially discontinued</li>
            <li>I have tried many many moisturizing lotions, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li>and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Urea is the key to great moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s a nice light lotion that still moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and no greasy feeling but for me I found you have to keep using regularly for the best results.  </li>
            <li>, I used the whole bottle putting it on after every shower on my whole body while I was just damp and the results are amazing, my skin is a smooth as silk, no dryness, and it feels so much more resilient, I will never allow myself to be out of this product.  </li>
            <li>, she was so excited.</li>
            <li>I am sooo excited to have found it again, and will never, never give it up again.</li>
            <li>I purchased four of these bottles for a super price along with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and is non greasy.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Have been using this lotion for over 20 years, not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Penetrates quickly and works well with BB Cream which I use as a foundation.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>mention that if you could find a good hypoallergenic lotion with urea and no fragrance at the drug store, you&#x27;d have more benefit from it than from all other lotions you&#x27;d pay 5 times as much for.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why local drug stores don&#x27;t carry this on the shelf, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can use it even though I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still well worth paying the shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and have tried so many different kinds of moisturizers, but Complex 15 is the BEST!</li>
            <li>/&gt;5April2012-I am still loving this lotion after 35 years and think it has helped keep those deep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>It works for me, I paid five times what is worth</li>
            <li>It is light, nongreasy and my skin actually feels moisturized more than 5 minutes after use.  </li>
            <li>Complex 15 is a very nice, light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash it off right away.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and that is all I do for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, unscented, and priced right.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion and has been perfect for my crazy dry skin here in Colorado during winter.</li>
            <li>I have a great complexion however I&#x27;m finding small milia on my face.</li>
            <li>my skin was a wreck, dry, kind of scaly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to use this year round from my face to my feet:)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin, great for dry skin, and certainly doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very very veryyyy lightweight.</li>
            <li>It came and it was exactly what I wanted and thank you very much</li>
            <li>The smaller squeeze bottles look significantly better...</li>
            <li>If I had to pay more for this product, I&#x27;d still buy it as it is truly the ONLY lotion I can use without having an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Complex 15 lotion is a great product.</li>
            <li>When you first use it don&#x27;t be put off by it liquid consistency.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond happy to have just found Complex 15 online.  </li>
            <li>first heard a dermatologist on television</li>
            <li>better than the big name brands sold in the anchor</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft all day with no break outs, shine, or slip.  </li>
            <li>to be in larger bottle and better price.</li>
            <li>A prime membership is still a good deal, but is becoming less so obviously.</li>
            <li>i have fairly sever dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As far as I am aware, there are no dyes or preservatives in this stuff, and with the phospholipids it is life friendly, so keep it in the fridge-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many, many years (it was recommended by a dermatologist) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many many years....</li>
            <li>I have tried so many daily moisturizers with varied success, but believe that this will be a keeper for as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>if you have dry skin in more sensitive areas, like around your eyes (or if the cream is for a young child, then vanicream is probably a better idea.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nice and gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, high quality, water based (no oil) lotion that is fantastic after your shower to make you skin soft for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It heals dry skin without the burn associated with most lotions.</li>
            <li>No scent, just pure comfort.</li>
            <li>Really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, this lotion works wonders and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>well it really is</li>
            <li>It is my husband&#x27;s go-to moisturizer in the winter, and It is very helpful for my eczema.</li>
            <li>It is non-cosmetic (no oil to clog pores) and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and i really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>In the summer, I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s reasonably priced too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many, many other lotions only to waste my money.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old loves it too!!!</li>
            <li>No smell, not greasy like so many other lotions.</li>
            <li>Better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried (all others are oily or greasy).</li>
            <li>With many other moisturizers, I tend to get blemishes, but not with Complex15 lotion.</li>
            <li>Complex 15 is ideal because it is not greasy, it absorbs into dry skin promptly</li>
            <li>I find the product is not bad but it just not working well enough.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other two reviewers-this is the best lotion I have ever used-moisturizes my skin without that sticky, greasy feeling many other lotions leave behind.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Complex 15\\&quot; is such a great lotion, which does not leave oily or greesy feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is just very basic and pure, no heavy smell, no crazy chemical feel.  </li>
            <li>This lotion leaves no greasy after feel; absorbing completely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The 8 oz container will last quite a while and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>In its absence in stores, I have looked at a lot of what is available; most of what is out there are multiple brands with the same basic ingredients-</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to add sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Complex 15 is very light and absorbant, but it still moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased that you had it and</li>
            <li>, my elbows are just as smooth as the rest of me, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, if you try it do commit to a whole bottle, it took time for your skin to get in bad shape and it will take some time to get it in good shape, but my skin everywhere is as smooth and silky as a child&#x27;s, and no fragrance is a plus, I urge anybody with dry skin or scaly cracked areas to try this.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit, and it is so light and non-greasy</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many other lotions that claim they&#x27;re non-allergenic and break out in a rash by the second week of use.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be happening with many items I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, covers easily, and has worked wonders in combating my dry skin, especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I immediately changed up my make up, found a great facial exfoliating sponge, and then began using this lotion instead of the expensive &amp;#34;dermatologist recommended&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It soaks in completely and doesn&#x27;t wash off or get oily.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of Complex 15 by a dermatologist many years ago.</li>
            <li>So far, no luck until this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, at least 25, a friend who is a dermatologist recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li>I love Complex 15 and used it after I could no longer find another dermatologist recommended moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I adore Complex 15, been using it for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>So far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten is Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps Light-Weight body lotion.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff it actually works and gets rid of dry skin and itchyness caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product in combination with Jericho Dead Sea Minerals Mud Soap for about 3 weeks and have seen significant improvement in the feel/texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It then became very hard to find, my local drug store would special order it for me, but then they just stopped taking special orders.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores in our area, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When your skin is extremely dry to the point of flaky-ness, it doesn&#x27;t help much there.</li>
            <li>to me it really depends on where the dry skin is.</li>
            <li>Complex 15 is the only lotion I have been able to use on my face without breaking out.  </li>
            <li>Also, I qualifed for free shipping by ordering 4 bottles and my order arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li>Love you Complex 15!</li>
            <li>I was once able to find it at CVS, but the last two years it has been harder and harder and then finally it was nowhere to be found.  </li>
            <li>When I think how much money I spent on the department store brands, I cringe...</li>
            <li>Merck will sell the patent/copyright and someone else will make it again in the near future.</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion which my husband, who is a professional pianist, will use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, especially in the winter, and I seem to have a new rash every other week.</li>
            <li>It is my understanding that Complex 15 therapeutic moisturizing lotion will not be available in the future.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend says she only has to apply this moisturizer about a third as often as her old moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Its too bad so many people feel they have to pay so much at cosmetic counters in department stores to find these same benefits--otherwise, it would be in high demand and still on the shelves.  </li>
            <li>I usually put it on right after bathing or showering.</li>
            <li>My skin gets irritated easily and I also use retin-A which makes it even worse at times.</li>
            <li>My 90 year old father&#x27;s doctor recommended this product because Pop&#x27;s skin was so dry and fragile.</li>

            <li> Hope this helps many of you.</li>

            <li> I also have eczema, and have most lotions to be ineffective.  </li>
            <li> so I can put more on throughout the day.  </li>

            <li> Glad to have found this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for 30 years and  still love the results.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a doctor many years ago</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many skin products, so this is one that I can use.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I just hope I&#x27;m always able to find it.  </li>
            <li> shipped fast, this is a great product - recommended by my Dermatologist 20 years ago and have used it since...</li>
            <li> This is simply the best that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> In the winter I slather it on, and then sometimes put on more.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully</li>
            <li> It does seem to have a magic touch for soothing most of the issues I encounter with my problem skin.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it were perfumed :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff</li>
            <li> The milia is going away and my skin looks even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice lotion and works great for my husband who&#x27;s on oxygen and can only use non petroleum based products when there&#x27;s oxygen running in his room.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with Pears soap, rinse it well, and pat it lightly leaving most of the water on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light,never feels greasy and great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Well, this is one more time that I&#x27;ve learned that when you get a great deal at Amazon, you better buy ALOT since it may not last.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who need to moisturize but who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had used it for many years after a woman who had fantastic skin told me she used it.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for persons sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> In addition was able to pick up a product I needed which wasn&#x27;t available in my area of the country.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over 15 years - it&#x27;s perfect to use before you put your make-up on, very light, dries very fast, you just need a dime size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, or skin easily prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and non-greasy and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it is still available in Canada at normal prices!  </li>
            <li> , you cannot fine it at all here with out a Dr. perception.</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly, not at all greasy, and feels wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Ha it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light with no oil and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because a friend said it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> the local drug store dropped it, I am so happy for Amazon..</li>
            <li> I found it online but also at my local drugstore which is great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all over, light lotion that I even put on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> However, it is no longer available from them.  </li>
            <li> Even though the cost is much more now, I felt it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> And now that I&#x27;ve spoken to Merck and they&#x27;ve confirmed that it&#x27;s been officially discontinued</li>
            <li> I have tried many many moisturizing lotions, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Urea is the key to great moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s a nice light lotion that still moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and no greasy feeling but for me I found you have to keep using regularly for the best results.  </li>
            <li> , I used the whole bottle putting it on after every shower on my whole body while I was just damp and the results are amazing, my skin is a smooth as silk, no dryness, and it feels so much more resilient, I will never allow myself to be out of this product.  </li>
            <li> , she was so excited.</li>
            <li> I am sooo excited to have found it again, and will never, never give it up again.</li>
            <li> I purchased four of these bottles for a super price along with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and is non greasy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this lotion for over 20 years, not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Penetrates quickly and works well with BB Cream which I use as a foundation.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> mention that if you could find a good hypoallergenic lotion with urea and no fragrance at the drug store, you&#x27;d have more benefit from it than from all other lotions you&#x27;d pay 5 times as much for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why local drug stores don&#x27;t carry this on the shelf, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can use it even though I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still well worth paying the shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have tried so many different kinds of moisturizers, but Complex 15 is the BEST!</li>
            <li> /&gt;5April2012-I am still loving this lotion after 35 years and think it has helped keep those deep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> It works for me, I paid five times what is worth</li>
            <li> It is light, nongreasy and my skin actually feels moisturized more than 5 minutes after use.  </li>
            <li> Complex 15 is a very nice, light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash it off right away.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and that is all I do for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, unscented, and priced right.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion and has been perfect for my crazy dry skin here in Colorado during winter.</li>
            <li> I have a great complexion however I&#x27;m finding small milia on my face.</li>
            <li> my skin was a wreck, dry, kind of scaly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to use this year round from my face to my feet:)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin, great for dry skin, and certainly doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very very veryyyy lightweight.</li>
            <li> It came and it was exactly what I wanted and thank you very much</li>
            <li> The smaller squeeze bottles look significantly better...</li>
            <li> If I had to pay more for this product, I&#x27;d still buy it as it is truly the ONLY lotion I can use without having an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Complex 15 lotion is a great product.</li>
            <li> When you first use it don&#x27;t be put off by it liquid consistency.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond happy to have just found Complex 15 online.  </li>
            <li> first heard a dermatologist on television</li>
            <li> better than the big name brands sold in the anchor</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft all day with no break outs, shine, or slip.  </li>
            <li> to be in larger bottle and better price.</li>
            <li> A prime membership is still a good deal, but is becoming less so obviously.</li>
            <li> i have fairly sever dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As far as I am aware, there are no dyes or preservatives in this stuff, and with the phospholipids it is life friendly, so keep it in the fridge-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many, many years (it was recommended by a dermatologist) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many many years....</li>
            <li> I have tried so many daily moisturizers with varied success, but believe that this will be a keeper for as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry skin in more sensitive areas, like around your eyes (or if the cream is for a young child, then vanicream is probably a better idea.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, high quality, water based (no oil) lotion that is fantastic after your shower to make you skin soft for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It heals dry skin without the burn associated with most lotions.</li>
            <li> No scent, just pure comfort.</li>
            <li> Really absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, this lotion works wonders and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> well it really is</li>
            <li> It is my husband&#x27;s go-to moisturizer in the winter, and It is very helpful for my eczema.</li>
            <li> It is non-cosmetic (no oil to clog pores) and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and i really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> In the summer, I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s reasonably priced too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, many other lotions only to waste my money.  </li>
            <li> My 18 year old loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> No smell, not greasy like so many other lotions.</li>
            <li> Better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried (all others are oily or greasy).</li>
            <li> With many other moisturizers, I tend to get blemishes, but not with Complex15 lotion.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is ideal because it is not greasy, it absorbs into dry skin promptly</li>
            <li> I find the product is not bad but it just not working well enough.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other two reviewers-this is the best lotion I have ever used-moisturizes my skin without that sticky, greasy feeling many other lotions leave behind.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Complex 15\\&quot; is such a great lotion, which does not leave oily or greesy feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is just very basic and pure, no heavy smell, no crazy chemical feel.  </li>
            <li> This lotion leaves no greasy after feel; absorbing completely into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The 8 oz container will last quite a while and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> In its absence in stores, I have looked at a lot of what is available; most of what is out there are multiple brands with the same basic ingredients-</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to add sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Complex 15 is very light and absorbant, but it still moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased that you had it and</li>
            <li> , my elbows are just as smooth as the rest of me, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, if you try it do commit to a whole bottle, it took time for your skin to get in bad shape and it will take some time to get it in good shape, but my skin everywhere is as smooth and silky as a child&#x27;s, and no fragrance is a plus, I urge anybody with dry skin or scaly cracked areas to try this.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit, and it is so light and non-greasy</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many other lotions that claim they&#x27;re non-allergenic and break out in a rash by the second week of use.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be happening with many items I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, covers easily, and has worked wonders in combating my dry skin, especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I immediately changed up my make up, found a great facial exfoliating sponge, and then began using this lotion instead of the expensive &amp;#34;dermatologist recommended&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It soaks in completely and doesn&#x27;t wash off or get oily.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Complex 15 by a dermatologist many years ago.</li>
            <li> So far, no luck until this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, at least 25, a friend who is a dermatologist recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li> I love Complex 15 and used it after I could no longer find another dermatologist recommended moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I adore Complex 15, been using it for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> So far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten is Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps Light-Weight body lotion.</li>
            <li> It sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff it actually works and gets rid of dry skin and itchyness caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in combination with Jericho Dead Sea Minerals Mud Soap for about 3 weeks and have seen significant improvement in the feel/texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It then became very hard to find, my local drug store would special order it for me, but then they just stopped taking special orders.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores in our area, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When your skin is extremely dry to the point of flaky-ness, it doesn&#x27;t help much there.</li>
            <li> to me it really depends on where the dry skin is.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is the only lotion I have been able to use on my face without breaking out.  </li>
            <li> Also, I qualifed for free shipping by ordering 4 bottles and my order arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li> Love you Complex 15!</li>
            <li> I was once able to find it at CVS, but the last two years it has been harder and harder and then finally it was nowhere to be found.  </li>
            <li> When I think how much money I spent on the department store brands, I cringe...</li>
            <li> Merck will sell the patent/copyright and someone else will make it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> It is the only lotion which my husband, who is a professional pianist, will use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, especially in the winter, and I seem to have a new rash every other week.</li>
            <li> It is my understanding that Complex 15 therapeutic moisturizing lotion will not be available in the future.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend says she only has to apply this moisturizer about a third as often as her old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Its too bad so many people feel they have to pay so much at cosmetic counters in department stores to find these same benefits--otherwise, it would be in high demand and still on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on right after bathing or showering.</li>
            <li> My skin gets irritated easily and I also use retin-A which makes it even worse at times.</li>
            <li> My 90 year old father&#x27;s doctor recommended this product because Pop&#x27;s skin was so dry and fragile.</li>
            <li> and it works wonderfully on dry, fragile, loose, or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once I found Complex 15, my skin is so much healthier!</li>
            <li> The Complex 15 has reduced the large breakouts, and now it is smaller.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 has fixed that... completely.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had found this before spending money on all kinds of lotions incuding \\&quot;Gold Bond\\&quot; for extra dry skin.   </li>
            <li> so I am an long time user  </li>
            <li> so the lotion container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a distant second.</li>
            <li> I actually carried around a tube of A&amp;D lotion and used it a few times a day for two years with only short term relief.</li>
            <li> I can use less than a dime size on my entire face and still have a lot extra.</li>
            <li> The lotion bottle looks a little different - ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li> I have used so many lotions over the years, it&#x27;s sad!</li>
            <li> I order this product because We have dry skin.</li>
            <li> if your dry skin is on your leg then this product is the one.</li>
            <li> I used it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation because I had dry and cracked skin around some of my knuckles-</li>
            <li> Usually I use a very heavy cream or something like Vaseline to keep my skin in somewhat good condition, but in the summer these can be sticky and uncomfortable and I always have a sneaking suspicion that bugs are going to stick to my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am a nurse, and washing my hands countless times everyday with harsh institutional soaps leaves them red, cracked, sore, and, in general, a mess.  </li>
            <li> skin is sensitive to lotions and loves to make zits, but that&#x27;s never been the case since using Complex 15.</li>
            <li> I am now in my late 40&#x27;s, started using it in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> anyone finds a twin or near twin to Complex 15</li>
            <li> is the way it absorbs into the skin, and there is absolutely no greasy or oily feeling</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple years and have had absolutely no problems with it.</li>
            <li> The product became scarce in Baltimore and traditional pharmacies and was not available at Walmart, Target, or Sams Club.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice daily and have for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Smooths out rough heels too.  </li>
            <li> Also,a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little of this lotion goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This bottle might last me a few years!</li>
            <li> This stuff, on the other hand, is a godsend.   </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and a very small amount (dime-sized) takes care of my face for the entire day.</li>
            <li> In Alaska, everyone uses hand lotion, it&#x27;s so dry, but I&#x27;m just so excited to have my Complex 15 up here in the dry cold.</li>
            <li> My hands were dry again after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for the past several years from Drugstore.com at considerably less cost.  </li>
            <li> Get it, complex, simple...</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint    </li>
            <li> It is thick, greasy and my skin is actually drier soon after using it.   </li>
            <li> this reminds me of a pet product or aquarium cleaner, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to keep costs down</li>
            <li> It was more difficult to get in those days and after awhile, I was lured by the promises of the expensive cosmetic counter products.</li>
            <li> I could use a new brand for a few months, but would end up with dry itchy patches around the base of my face, and neck, and red patches under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive at Amazon and is delivered directly to my door.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel oily or heavy and within a few minutes you will forget you ever applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might provide immediate relief for a few hours, but not throughout the day or anything longterm.</li>
            <li> and before I put on my heavy night cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others and nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> And now that I can order it at Amazon for even less than it sells in the stores I can stock up and never run out!</li>
            <li> It is a little more than I am used to paying but not the horrible prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Like so many reviewers, I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> By the way there is no difference between the small tube, and the 8oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Not very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> A few years later, I encountered a machinist who was having hand irritation from the chlorine used in cutting oils for machining &amp; recommended Complex 15 to him.</li>
            <li> We ALL have compliments that our skin has a glow, and for me at 54, I have hardly a wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> Found out Complex 15 Lotion and their products can be ordered through Well.ca /products/complex-15-body-lotion-8308.html/ .</li>
            <li> Just google Complex 15 Canada and</li>
            <li> I have used complex 15 for 26 years.</li>
            <li> I then apply Complex 15 generously.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 was discontinued in the USA.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Complex 15 for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I find that it is one product that does not ever irritate my skin and if my skin has been irritated by another product, Complex 15 soothes it.  </li>
            <li> i found Complex 15 thirty years ago and have used it since.  </li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended Complex 15 (along with Dove soap, but that&#x27;s another review), and we understand why.</li>
            <li> I have returned to Complex 15 and will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and Complex 15 seems to help.</li>
            <li> I ordered Complex 15 because someone recommended it to address my ongoing battle with acne and rosacia.</li>
            <li> Then I found Complex 15 and used if for around three days and the problem was resolved.</li>
            <li> but not what is in Complex 15.</li>
            <li> If you use it but your hands are going to be in water a lot, apply Eucerin over the Complex</li>
            <li> this is basically a wax that will seal in the Complex 15</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin for the very worst of my rashes, where the skin is already cracked and thickened, but for the rest of my body I think it works really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downside to this product is how incredibly ugly the bottle is.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick, nor thin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, but also the areas I get eczema, behind my ears, knees, and in my elbow.</li>
            <li> I wanted one to moisturize, be non irritating, non greasy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was poorly marketed.  </li>
            <li> (Weird...</li>
            <li> for my chicken skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very sad that they have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every skin lotion on the market and all of them either made my skin feel as if it was greasy or made my skin react badly.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is horrible, and I am just going to throw out the two bottles I got.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really absorbs into the skin. It isn&#x27;t thick, nor thin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have been using it for over 10 years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s light with no oil and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I only wish it had SPF 15 added to it.</li>
            <li> I was so grateful to find this. It was recommended to my mother by a pharmacist in AZ and she brought a bottle up to me, she was so excited. I can use it even though I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know. I use it on my hands, but also the areas I get eczema, behind my ears, knees, and in my elbow. It is THE only lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn or make my skin itch. It soaks in completely and doesn&#x27;t wash off or get oily. I offered a bit to my fiance, and he now uses it exclusively. In Alaska, everyone uses hand lotion, it&#x27;s so dry, but I&#x27;m just so excited to have my Complex 15 up here in the dry cold.</li>
            <li> Found out Complex 15 Lotion and their products can be ordered through Well.ca /products/complex-15-body-lotion-8308.html/ . Just google Complex 15 Canada and Well.ca will come up. The lotion bottle looks a little different - ingredients are the same. It is a little more than I am used to paying but not the horrible prices on Amazon. It is $10.99 a bottle. Very reasonable. Hope this helps many of you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because a friend said it was fantastic. I have really sensitive skin. It burned and itched my face. I had to wash it off right away.,so I use it on my hands. Not very good moisturizer.  My hands were dry again after a few minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really sensitive skin. My husband likes it .</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is the only lotion I have been able to use on my face without breaking out.  I have tried both the face cream and the moisturizing lotion and love them both.  I am very sad that they have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> My Dr recommended this product to me 20 some yrs ago so I am an long time user  the local drug store dropped it, I am so happy for Amazon.. Thank you</li>
            <li> Get it, complex, simple...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this lotion works wonders and is very affordable. I have dry skin and a very small amount (dime-sized) takes care of my face for the entire day. It does not feel oily or heavy and within a few minutes you will forget you ever applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive to lotions and loves to make zits, but that&#x27;s never been the case since using Complex 15. Good job, guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is how incredibly ugly the bottle is. The smaller squeeze bottles look significantly better... this reminds me of a pet product or aquarium cleaner, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to keep costs down then I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I also have eczema, and have most lotions to be ineffective.  Usually I use a very heavy cream or something like Vaseline to keep my skin in somewhat good condition, but in the summer these can be sticky and uncomfortable and I always have a sneaking suspicion that bugs are going to stick to my legs.  Complex 15 is very light and absorbant, but it still moisturizes very well.  It&#x27;s a little thin for the very worst of my rashes, where the skin is already cracked and thickened, but for the rest of my body I think it works really well.  I don&#x27;t feel sticky at all, and it&#x27;s non-irritating so I can put more on throughout the day.  It&#x27;s also light enough to use on my face.  It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to add sunscreen.  All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for overall skin moisturizing for my eczema in the summertime.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Complex 15 by a dermatologist many years ago. It is the only moisturiser that I have used that is truly not greasy. I like the fact that it is not scented and is hypoallergenic. It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have used complex 15 for 26 years. Initially, my doctor prescribed it for my combination skin. When it went OTC I ordered it from WalMart. It is nongreasy and provides a great base for my Clinique makeup. I wash my face with Pears soap, rinse it well, and pat it lightly leaving most of the water on it. I then apply Complex 15 generously. I let it soak in for about 5 minutes and then apply my makeup. It is the best. I get compliments all the time about my skin. It does not cause any breakouts or flakiness on my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin, great for dry skin, and certainly doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Love this product- can use it on face as well as body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many moisturizers over the years... I could use a new brand for a few months, but would end up with dry itchy patches around the base of my face, and neck, and red patches under my eyes.  (Weird... I know...)  Complex 15 has fixed that... completely.  It is the BEST product out there.  It absorbs quickly, and is non greasy.  I wish they made a version for the rest of my body!      Try it... you will LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best lotion I have ever used. No smell, not greasy like so many other lotions. Just an all around excellent moisturizer. Would recommend to everyone! JJJ</li>
            <li> my skin was a wreck, dry, kind of scaly and then I started using this, I used the whole bottle putting it on after every shower on my whole body while I was just damp and the results are amazing, my skin is a smooth as silk, no dryness, and it feels so much more resilient, I will never allow myself to be out of this product.  It didn&#x27;t happen over night, but it did happen, this is the best I have ever tried and I have tried so many lotions, one of the best things about it is the way it absorbs into the skin, and there is absolutely no greasy or oily feeling, my elbows are just as smooth as the rest of me, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, if you try it do commit to a whole bottle, it took time for your skin to get in bad shape and it will take some time to get it in good shape, but my skin everywhere is as smooth and silky as a child&#x27;s, and no fragrance is a plus, I urge anybody with dry skin or scaly cracked areas to try this.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t sell well and/or isn&#x27;t popular because it contains BHT and EDTA. Please stop using this! Some people will put anything in/on their bodies...</li>
            <li> This lotion is very very veryyyy lightweight. I can use less than a dime size on my entire face and still have a lot extra. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, or skin easily prone to breakouts. When your skin is extremely dry to the point of flaky-ness, it doesn&#x27;t help much there. It might provide immediate relief for a few hours, but not throughout the day or anything longterm. This bottle might last me a few years! Ha it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion!  You can feel your skin just sopping up the moisture it provides. My dermatologist recommended it years ago and I used it until I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I have experimented with many other lotions that claim they&#x27;re non-allergenic and break out in a rash by the second week of use.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this lotion online!  This lotion is affordably priced I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping to get it since I can&#x27;t find it in any stores in my town, including Walmart.  Oh well.  It&#x27;s still well worth paying the shipping.  If I had to pay more for this product, I&#x27;d still buy it as it is truly the ONLY lotion I can use without having an allergic reaction.  I have tried many, many, many other lotions only to waste my money.  Love you Complex 15!</li>
            <li> The best ever face lotion - not greasy at all, moisturizes like a wonder.  Better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried (all others are oily or greasy).</li>
            <li> I have used so many lotions over the years, it&#x27;s sad! I wanted one to moisturize, be non irritating, non greasy and inexpensive. So far, no luck until this one. I found it online but also at my local drugstore which is great. My skin gets irritated easily and I also use retin-A which makes it even worse at times. Great formula, I love that it has no spf since that burns my skin and it is under $7. When I think how much money I spent on the department store brands, I cringe...Glad to have found this one.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have tried so many different kinds of moisturizers, but Complex 15 is the BEST! I have been using it for a couple years and have had absolutely no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I order this product because We have dry skin. I find the product is not bad but it just not working well enough. I need to order something else.</li>
            <li> i read all of the reviews and they all said this lotion is so wonderful well it really is</li>
            <li> Complex 15 lotion is a great product. It heals dry skin without the burn associated with most lotions. I received the product quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says she only has to apply this moisturizer about a third as often as her old moisturizer. And she loves that it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great because it is so light and nonsmelly. I wish they would offer it with spf though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many, many years (it was recommended by a dermatologist) and I can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s so light and non-greasy and great for sensitive skin. Even my husband uses it.  And now that I can order it at Amazon for even less than it sells in the stores I can stock up and never run out! Also, I qualifed for free shipping by ordering 4 bottles and my order arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li> My friend tells me that this is a very good product and does what it says on the tin!!! Everyone is happy. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Like so many reviewers, I was very disappointed Complex 15 was discontinued in the USA. It&#x27;s a uniquely great product I&#x27;ve used for decades. The good news is that it is still available in Canada at normal prices!  If demand keeps up, maybe they won&#x27;t discontinue the product there, too. I ordered it from Well.ca.</li>
            <li> Excellent products as prescribed years ago by our excellent dermatologist. &lt;br /&gt;Will use it forever, or until our doctor says otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for 30 years and  still love the results.  It&#x27;s light,never feels greasy and great for my sensitive skin.  With many other moisturizers, I tend to get blemishes, but not with Complex15 lotion. Also,a little bit goes a long way.  Unfortunately, no local stores carry it anymore, so I&#x27;m very pleased to be able to get it at Amazon.com for an excellent price and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5April2012-I am still loving this lotion after 35 years and think it has helped keep those deep wrinkles at bay. Recently, Bed,Bath &amp; Beyond has been carrying this lotion in their Harmon Product section-available in some stores and online.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It was recommended to me by my doctor because of my eczema. My skin is very sensitive, especially in the winter, and I seem to have a new rash every other week. I have tried every skin lotion on the market and all of them either made my skin feel as if it was greasy or made my skin react badly. When you first use it don&#x27;t be put off by it liquid consistency.  I usually put it on right after bathing or showering. It soaks right in and that is all I do for the rest of the day. This is the best thing you can do to baby your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Complex 15 for over 5 years.  It is non-greasy, covers easily, and has worked wonders in combating my dry skin, especially during the winter months.  The product became scarce in Baltimore and traditional pharmacies and was not available at Walmart, Target, or Sams Club.  It is less expensive at Amazon and is delivered directly to my door.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a face moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and absorbs quickly.  You can use makeup over it as well. (This is Joe&#x27;s wife writing!!). It was recommended by a doctor many years ago and I find that it is one product that does not ever irritate my skin and if my skin has been irritated by another product, Complex 15 soothes it.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores in our area, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for many many years....I am now in my late 40&#x27;s, started using it in my early 20&#x27;s.  It doesn&#x27;t clog your pours, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, yet provides amazing moisture for your skin without being greasy at all . It sinks right in.  Happy I found it here;  drugstores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is a very nice, light moisturizer.  I am allergic to many skin products, so this is one that I can use.  I have enjoyed using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy to have just found Complex 15 online.  I had been ordering it from a pharmacy, and now, even they can&#x27;t get it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I first heard a dermatologist on television mention that if you could find a good hypoallergenic lotion with urea and no fragrance at the drug store, you&#x27;d have more benefit from it than from all other lotions you&#x27;d pay 5 times as much for.  i found Complex 15 thirty years ago and have used it since.  We ALL have compliments that our skin has a glow, and for me at 54, I have hardly a wrinkle.  This is amazing lotion.   And it feels good on.   Its too bad so many people feel they have to pay so much at cosmetic counters in department stores to find these same benefits--otherwise, it would be in high demand and still on the shelves.  Perhaps it was poorly marketed.  I just hope I&#x27;m always able to find it.  Until I searched online, just now, we were running out of options.</li>
            <li> A little of this lotion goes a long way. It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s a nice light lotion that still moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other two reviewers-this is the best lotion I have ever used-moisturizes my skin without that sticky, greasy feeling many other lotions leave behind.  I am a nurse, and washing my hands countless times everyday with harsh institutional soaps leaves them red, cracked, sore, and, in general, a mess.  Once I found Complex 15, my skin is so much healthier!</li>
            <li> Well, this is one more time that I&#x27;ve learned that when you get a great deal at Amazon, you better buy ALOT since it may not last.  I purchased four of these bottles for a super price along with free shipping.  Only to find now when I want to reorder, the deal is gone.  This seems to be happening with many items I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Like cashew butter and some medical supplies.  A prime membership is still a good deal, but is becoming less so obviously.</li>
            <li> It works for me, I paid five times what is worth</li>
            <li> Great lotion and has been perfect for my crazy dry skin here in Colorado during winter. It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light. I&#x27;ll be able to use this year round from my face to my feet:)</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended Complex 15 (along with Dove soap, but that&#x27;s another review), and we understand why. It is my husband&#x27;s go-to moisturizer in the winter, and It is very helpful for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and can&#x27;t use very many lotions because they make me break out.  This lotion is nice and gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive facial skin.  Plus, the price is great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over 15 years - it&#x27;s perfect to use before you put your make-up on, very light, dries very fast, you just need a dime size so the lotion container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No perfumes, hypoallergenic. I also use it after I wash my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the big name brands sold in the anchor stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy!</li>
            <li> Called today and was told the product has been discontinued, for business reasons.</li>
            <li> My husband has rosecea and acne and sun sensitivity.  He washes his face every morning and night then puts this on.  It is non-cosmetic (no oil to clog pores) and very moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve started using it every night after I wash my face and before I put on my heavy night cream.  It&#x27;s an all over, light lotion that I even put on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Great for face have used for YEARS!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this before spending money on all kinds of lotions incuding \\&quot;Gold Bond\\&quot; for extra dry skin.   Gold Bond is horrible, and I am just going to throw out the two bottles I got.  It is thick, greasy and my skin is actually drier soon after using it.   This stuff, on the other hand, is a godsend.   It is light, nongreasy and my skin actually feels moisturized more than 5 minutes after use.  I&#x27;ll buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> i have fairly sever dry and sensitive skin and i really like this product. vanicream is also great but i like this product as well. to me it really depends on where the dry skin is. if your dry skin is on your leg then this product is the one. if you have dry skin in more sensitive areas, like around your eyes (or if the cream is for a young child, then vanicream is probably a better idea.</li>
            <li> shipped fast, this is a great product - recommended by my Dermatologist 20 years ago and have used it since...non greasy and has keep my skin mositurized</li>
            <li> Many years ago, at least 25, a friend who is a dermatologist recommended this product to me.  She used it herself.  It was more difficult to get in those days and after awhile, I was lured by the promises of the expensive cosmetic counter products. I have returned to Complex 15 and will never buy anything else.This is simply the best that I have ever used.  I wash with goats milk soap and apply this lotion twice a day.  I get compliments all the time on my skin and I&#x27;m 64.  Lightweight, unscented, and priced right.  But highly effective!!</li>
            <li> I love Complex 15 and used it after I could no longer find another dermatologist recommended moisturizer.  I have been hooked ever since.  It never leaves your skin greasy and if you need a lot of moisture you can reapply to gain a deeper effect.  I was once able to find it at CVS, but the last two years it has been harder and harder and then finally it was nowhere to be found.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who need to moisturize but who have sensitive skin. With all the allergies I have everything makes me itch or break out in hives. This does not have that effect. I love it and have used it for years. Very light but effective. Good for anytime like under makeup or as an all over moisturizer. No scent, just pure comfort. The 8 oz container will last quite a while and well worth the price. Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased that you had it and the price was great and the shipping price was great. It came and it was exactly what I wanted and thank you very much and it was a great experience.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I feel like it is just very basic and pure, no heavy smell, no crazy chemical feel.  I had used it for many years after a woman who had fantastic skin told me she used it.  It then became very hard to find, my local drug store would special order it for me, but then they just stopped taking special orders.  I have rosacea and Complex 15 seems to help. It has no smell and is very light going on, I find my skin drinks it in. In the winter I slather it on, and then sometimes put on more.  In the summer, I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much. I am sooo excited to have found it again, and will never, never give it up again. By the way there is no difference between the small tube, and the 8oz bottle. Buy the 8 oz bottle, a much better deal!!!! My 18 year old loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> Probably the very best  healing lotion you can buy over the counter.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy and absorbs quickly. I use it twice daily and have for a few years now. It does not clog pores, and it definitely gives my skin the nourishment it needs. Great for sensitive skin. Product is quality, thank you!</li>
            <li> Have been using this lotion for over 20 years, not greasy, absorbs quickly. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product based on reviews.  Glad I did.  My skin feels smooth and soft all day with no break outs, shine, or slip.  Penetrates quickly and works well with BB Cream which I use as a foundation. A small amount goes a long way.  I have tried so many daily moisturizers with varied success, but believe that this will be a keeper for as long as it is available.  Use this under my night cream for extra moisture.  Smooths out rough heels too.  Great product, great price.  Would recommend to anyone and would give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for the past several years from Drugstore.com at considerably less cost.  However, it is no longer available from them.  Even though the cost is much more now, I felt it was worth it.  It is my understanding that Complex 15 therapeutic moisturizing lotion will not be available in the future.  If I am misinformed on this, please let me know how and where I can make future purchases.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I adore Complex 15, been using it for more than a decade. And now that I&#x27;ve spoken to Merck and they&#x27;ve confirmed that it&#x27;s been officially discontinued I&#x27;m at a loss. I&#x27;ve tried a few others and nothing comes close. Not Vanicream, Gold Bond, Sauve or Lubriderm. So far the closest I&#x27;ve gotten is Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps Light-Weight body lotion. But it&#x27;s a distant second. I&#x27;ll just keep on searching.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone finds a twin or near twin to Complex 15 I&#x27;d love to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Merck will sell the patent/copyright and someone else will make it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I ordered Complex 15 because someone recommended it to address my ongoing battle with acne and rosacia. After 3 weeks, I can see improvement with both areas. Also, it is great for after shaving. It does seem to have a magic touch for soothing most of the issues I encounter with my problem skin. It is nice to have one go to product. While the Rosacia seems managed, the acne is still a problem. The Complex 15 has reduced the large breakouts, and now it is smaller. This is an improvement but troublesome. I am gaining ground in my acne battle, but the war wages on.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Sadly, this product seems to be unavailable in many brick and mortar stores now. I used it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation because I had dry and cracked skin around some of my knuckles- the result of having my hands in various cleaners and solvents and scraping and banging them while repairing things. Going back to school, I was no longer in that environment but the problem persisted. I actually carried around a tube of A&amp;D lotion and used it a few times a day for two years with only short term relief. Then I found Complex 15 and used if for around three days and the problem was resolved. A few years later, I encountered a machinist who was having hand irritation from the chlorine used in cutting oils for machining &amp; recommended Complex 15 to him. I ran into him a year later and he said his boss was ordering it for the shop for all the workers to use.&lt;br /&gt;The product I am referring to is not the face lotion (no experience with that). As far as I am aware, there are no dyes or preservatives in this stuff, and with the phospholipids it is life friendly, so keep it in the fridge- another reason to do so is that it is basically an oil and will go rancid if left out. In its absence in stores, I have looked at a lot of what is available; most of what is out there are multiple brands with the same basic ingredients- but not what is in Complex 15. If you use it but your hands are going to be in water a lot, apply Eucerin over the Complex 15- this is basically a wax that will seal in the Complex 15 so it does not get washed away immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice lotion and works great for my husband who&#x27;s on oxygen and can only use non petroleum based products when there&#x27;s oxygen running in his room.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves no greasy after feel; absorbing completely into the skin.  It is the only lotion which my husband, who is a professional pianist, will use.  It&#x27;s also great for persons sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I worked for a dermatologist and got hooked on this moisturizer. I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores so I was pleased to find it here. Good price for a good product. You only need a tiny bit, and it is so light and non-greasy that you can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin.</li>
            <li> bought this for my second daughter, she is a beautician and some stress with her job at time, this has cleared up&lt;br /&gt;her systems, you cannot fine it at all here with out a Dr. perception. that is why i got two bottles.</li>
            <li> This was a recommended lotion and is as good as promised.  Not greasy and absorbs quickly. Nice to know I can get it in a couple of days whenever needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many moisturizing lotions, and this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s not too greasy, but it moisturizes well.  It&#x27;s also perfect to put on underneath make up - foundation glides on very well after putting this on (you have to wait for just a minute though for the lotion to seep into your pores).  And it&#x27;s reasonably priced too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Complex 15\\&quot; is such a great lotion, which does not leave oily or greesy feel on your skin. I have been using it for 10 years and have never found any reason to switch brands.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a very good purchase. FYI, it was $6.75 on July 20 2006.    Pros:    (1) very good moisturizer - works well during the night  (2) absorbs very quickly - normally within 2-3 minutes  (3) not sticky after usage - very good aspect    Cons:    (1) does not smell good (not bad either) - the only complaint    I just wish that it were perfumed :) so that I can use it in the day time too. If so, it can just be the best one available on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it actually works and gets rid of dry skin and itchyness caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, high quality, water based (no oil) lotion that is fantastic after your shower to make you skin soft for the rest of the day. I love it.</li>
            <li> order was handled great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Keeps my skin hydrated and feels like i am not wearing anything at all !!! Awesome !!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever had.  It is not greasy and is truly fragrance free. My husband uses it as an after shave lotion and says that it makes his skin very smooth and soothes after shave irritation.</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly, not at all greasy, and feels wonderful!  It feels better than most everything else I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Complex 15 is ideal because it is not greasy, it absorbs into dry skin promptly and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything (including sandpaper!) for my chicken skin.  I have been using this product in combination with Jericho Dead Sea Minerals Mud Soap for about 3 weeks and have seen significant improvement in the feel/texture of my skin.  Will continue to purchase through Amazon at this time.</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing... in a trash in 2 days. Also has red welts after use. Dont know why this gets good reviews.</li>
            <li> Urea is the key to great moisturizing. Absorbs fast and no greasy feeling but for me I found you have to keep using regularly for the best results.  Love the stuff&lt;br /&gt;needs to be in larger bottle and better price.</li>
            <li> I have a great complexion however I&#x27;m finding small milia on my face. I immediately changed up my make up, found a great facial exfoliating sponge, and then began using this lotion instead of the expensive &amp;#34;dermatologist recommended&amp;#34; lotions I had been using. I found immediate, great results!! The milia is going away and my skin looks even better. Buy with confidence ladies as this lotion is wonderful. Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I will forever be a loyal customer for this product!!</li>
            <li> My 90 year old father&#x27;s doctor recommended this product because Pop&#x27;s skin was so dry and fragile. I don&#x27;t know why local drug stores don&#x27;t carry this on the shelf, it is amazing. No oder and it works wonderfully on dry, fragile, loose, or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had great service from these folks.  In addition was able to pick up a product I needed which wasn&#x27;t available in my area of the country.  Very pleased.  Thanks</li>
