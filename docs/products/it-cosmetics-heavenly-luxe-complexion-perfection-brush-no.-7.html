            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this line.....love their brushes!</li>
            <li>The large end does the trick perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have to say it Cosmetics Brushes are by far the BEST brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>No other brush can perform the way these brushes perform and I have tried All the Best out there.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush ever.</li>
            <li>I love It cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Bought more and love it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush for highlighting</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of IT Cosmetics and love ALL THEIR BRUSHES and Makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The foundation end is better.</li>
            <li>I am a skeptic when it comes to many products.  </li>
            <li>You use to be able to buy it by itself for around 25-35 dollars.</li>
            <li>These can be buffed out, but it takes more work.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I found that foundation goes on more smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>&quot; brushes  are soft, they do NOT shed on the skin, they hold the makeup, they provide flawless complete coverage, they feel like silk gliding across the face.</li>
            <li>But I can say I get a smooth blend with my MAC foundation</li>
            <li>The larger end is great for my mouse style foundation.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, IT cosmetics make the best brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>Okay, might be a bit of an overstatement, because this is the first foundation brush I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>I got it here for a far more better price.</li>
            <li>Great double ended brush, useful for foundation and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This brush is so nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush and the bigger side is great for airbrushing concelor into your skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth transitions between product, so there are no hard lines!</li>
            <li>I rate this brush a ten I love the way the concealer apply.</li>
            <li>I also prefer the Sigma F80 flat top foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>the tapered end is  wonderful on what little dark circles and acne</li>
            <li>I use it for liquid foundation and it seems to work fine, but its not the same as the mac foundation brush I am used to.</li>
            <li>I have several IT brushes, all are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The small end is great for concealer in the inner eye area.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and makes my makeup application so easy - I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a double duty brush that could help me apply concealer in such a way that it blended in rather than sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>The It brush is less tightly packed and the bristles bend more which creates more brush marks.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>No other makeup brush compares to the high quality of IT brushes.</li>
            <li>and I mean real small comes out with a perfect finish.</li>
            <li>(I have somewhat sensitive skin) and this puppy does not shed at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and spreads make up so evenly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, just glides over your skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush hairs have remained really soft and there&#x27;s no shedding.</li>
            <li>My collection of her brushes is almost complete..</li>
            <li>You could not purchase this brush without buying the whole kit on a different site.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, no shredding.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice soft brush, but I prefer my RealTechniques Expert Face Brush which is less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>I use it to apply my bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very practical because it has the two brushes in one,the foundation brush allows you to use less product than a sponge and withouth using the fingers.</li>

            <li> Awesome brush! Wish I bought two</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush ever. I use it to apply my bare minerals powder. It is a life saver. I use the smaller brush for my eye area! I love it!</li>
            <li> awesome brush. I love It cosmetics.  When the subscribe them and you get them It is always the truth.  Bought more and love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for liquid foundation and concealer.  It seems to do the job, however, I feel that the brush was made for dry/powder foundation.  I use it for liquid foundation and it seems to work fine, but its not the same as the mac foundation brush I am used to.</li>
            <li> IT cosmetics makes the best brushes.  I found that foundation goes on more smoothly and evenly.  I now have two of these.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever!!!  Okay, might be a bit of an overstatement, because this is the first foundation brush I&#x27;ve bought.  But I can say I get a smooth blend with my MAC foundation, the brush ends are soft-to-touch (I have somewhat sensitive skin) and this puppy does not shed at all.  Very pleased with value and quality.</li>

            <li> This brush is so nice &amp; soft. I received so many compliments on it. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to clean the thick end &amp; I end up losing a lot of the hairs from the brush. I don&#x27;t usually wear any face makeup or concealer so maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it. I only bought it for a wedding</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very practical because it has the two brushes in one,the foundation brush allows you to use less product than a sponge and withouth using the fingers.The quality of the brush is good</li>

            <li> I am a fan of IT Cosmetics and love ALL THEIR BRUSHES and Makeup as well.  The quality of this brush is the best I have ever run across and well worth the price.  Once you have it in hand you just want to brush your face with it to relax.  Like they all say &amp;#34;BRUSH THERAPHY&amp;#34;!!!!  These line of brushes is a MUST HAVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for H&amp;C, and it works perfectly for blending. Smooth transitions between product, so there are no hard lines!</li>
            <li> This brush will be the best brush you will ever buy. I&#x27;m love it. Use it for liquid makeup or powder.  It&#x27;s so soft, just glides over your skin.  I do wash my brushes every two weeks or so and this washes up perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not the best brush. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work well with my choice in concealer. The foundation end is better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very versatile brush, but the metal pieces that hold it together became loose just after a few days of usage. The brush hairs have remained really soft and there&#x27;s no shedding.</li>
            <li> I have to say it Cosmetics Brushes are by far the BEST brushes out there.  No other brush can perform the way these brushes perform and I have tried All the Best out there. I do not believe in using drug store makeup brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;it\\&quot; brushes  are soft, they do NOT shed on the skin, they hold the makeup, they provide flawless complete coverage, they feel like silk gliding across the face. They are made so well it&#x27;s actually scary. I am a skeptic when it comes to many products.  I give them all a chance but I have to say this:  I will never buy another brand of makeup brush again. &#x27;IT&#x27; COSMETIC BRUSHES--- ALL OF THEM-- ARE THE BEST OUT THERE.  Thank you \\&quot;it\\&quot;.  My collection of her brushes is almost complete.. Pricey, Yes, but lets face it girls YOU GET WHAT  YOU PAY FOR! Why waste money replacing brushes. These brushes SAVE YOU  money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!! AWESOME, my \\&quot;brush\\&quot; search is over.  :)</li>
            <li> You could not purchase this brush without buying the whole kit on a different site. You use to be able to buy it by itself for around 25-35 dollars.

            <li> Great double ended brush, useful for foundation and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best I have ever used. A small amount of foundation and I mean real small comes out with a perfect finish. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft brush, but I prefer my RealTechniques Expert Face Brush which is less than half the price.  I also prefer the Sigma F80 flat top foundation brush.
