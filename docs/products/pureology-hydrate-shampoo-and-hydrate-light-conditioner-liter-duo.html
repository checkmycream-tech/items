            <li> This is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo, been using it for years.........</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and with other products I have tried in the past it has always mad my hair look very stringy and greasy. Not only does this product make my hair feel good it also makes it very soft and with lots of volume! It looks like I have a ton of hair that smells amazing by the way!! People stop to ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing and it&#x27;s actually this product in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with this product originally at the salon I go to when my hair is being washed. It is super expensive at retail but I found the duo on Amazon for 1/2 the price for larger quantities. I highly recommend this product and if you are on the fence on spending a lot of money on this product it is totally worth it to have gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li> I bought the Hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner Duo because my hair stylist suggested a hydrating shampoo. I like Purelogy shampoo so I bought Purelogy Hydrate Shampoo. It does hydrate. I was pleasantly surprised when I used the conditioner the first time and it made my scalp tingle, yet that was the only time it tingled was the first time I used it. My hair is color treated with a partial highlight. My hair felt less dried out with this shampoo/conditioner. I expected over time it would be completely hydrated. It could be using a deep conditioner is what is needed. Purelogy hydrate shampoo/ conditioner did help rehydrate my hair. The hydrate light conditioner did not weigh my hair down and I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wife said this was the best shampoo/conditioner, and that it&#x27;s really popular, and expensive, blah blah blah... I said okay whatever not like I care just order it if you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it got here this morning and I just used it tonight, and holy crap it is the BEST shampoo/conditioner!! I&#x27;m just a guy with short hair, I could care less about shampoo/conditioner, but man this has changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got out of the shower, my hair was silky smooth like I had poured oil in my hair. Soon as it dried, my hair is more soft then it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say the downside is the price, but let&#x27;s be honest a bottle this huge will last forever (especially if it&#x27;s just for a guy).</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my hair, best shampoo and conditioning I ever used and now I can&#x27;t live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> dried out my hair bad, but I gave it to my friend and she loves it</li>
            <li> Great purchase and experience!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it for years. This order came very quickly; within days of the order.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I can use. I have very fine, fragile hair that breaks or falls out with certain products. Leaves your hair in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Best products I have ever used! Shipping was good too!</li>
            <li> Best product for color treated hair. I&#x27;ve never found it cheaper than on Amazon.  I pay a lot to keep the grays away &amp; with  Purology I can go longer between colorings.</li>
            <li> These are expensive, however they last a really long time. I wash my hair approximately 4 times a week and this stuff will last me around 5 months. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I was out of conditioner so I was really happy when my DUO arrived on time and fast.  I have tried many shampoos and conditioners and this is by far the best.  I have dry, naturally curly hair that is hard to comb through but with this conditioner its like silk.  I highly recommend buying from this seller as I have purchased from others only to be disappointed with delay after delay.  Great job I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
