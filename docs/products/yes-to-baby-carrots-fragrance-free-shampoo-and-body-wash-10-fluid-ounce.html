            <li>I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT</li>
            <li>so it is a great value.</li>
            <li>I liked it!</li>
            <li>Good shampooo for the kids.</li>
            <li>My kid is allergic to all kinds of fragrances so this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Glad i could find it here!</li>
            <li>Found this and loved it even more.</li>
            <li>I mostly used it as a shampoo and to wash &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas (daughter was complaining that Aveeno oatmeal soap didn&#x27;t feel good).</li>
            <li>This soap is super easy to dispense and wonderful for my child&#x27;s sensative skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried every natural product out there and this product and the babyganics newborn fragrance free foaming wash worked the best.</li>
            <li>You need more than one pump.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>love the products.</li>
            <li>DO BE ABLE TO WASH MY DAUGHTERS HEAD...</li>
            <li>so I am glad amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Was off the date before the first use and enjoy this great soap.</li>

            <li>they are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My son is 2.5 years old, he is also happy.</li>

            <li>I also love the fact that it is super mild.</li>
            <li>no added fragrance just a nice natural scent</li>
            <li>The reason why it&#x27;s not getting a five star is because when you use it as a soap the foam seems a little watery and it makes it a bit challenging to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>My little toddler loves to shower and this gentle shampoo has worked great for him!</li>
            <li>pump brakes very fast!</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>However that foam is great for little hands that want to participate.</li>
            <li>It actually helped his eczema and did a nice job lathering.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural product too.</li>
            <li>Natural (Too many baby products have harmful chemicals)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for an organic tear free mild shampoo and body wash for my 16 month old.</li>

            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>Love putting baby in his little natural spa :) the scent is mild and gentle...</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo/body wash for a small child with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Hope this review helps a parent looking for a good shampoo/body wash for their little one with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It Knots up my daughter&#x27;s hair, doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOESNT WORK</li>
            <li>But the bottle is a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally would buy the leading brand of baby wash, or even generic, but this to me is a worthy splurge.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Clearly Natural Unscented body wash or some Aveeno body wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentle for baby&#x27;s sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just takes some adjusting because other than that it cleans very well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product but the pump quickly broke and that was annoying especially when trying to bathe a toddler.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic tear free mild shampoo and body wash for my 16 month old. This product lives up to its promises. I especially love it as a shampoo. It lathers up very well and rinses easily. I also love the fact that it is super mild. My baby has been getting diaper rashes lately, and this is the only soap that&#x27;s gentle enough that I can use on her bottom. I wish I could give a 4 1/2 stars. The reason why it&#x27;s not getting a five star is because when you use it as a soap the foam seems a little watery and it makes it a bit challenging to get a good lather going. However that foam is great for little hands that want to participate. It just takes some adjusting because other than that it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always reading reviews before I buy something and finally wanted to take a minute and write a review so I could share my findings and help someone else.  I bought this for my son who has eczema and it worked great. It actually helped his eczema and did a nice job lathering. I have tried every natural product out there and this product and the babyganics newborn fragrance free foaming wash worked the best. Although if I had to choose I would pick this product over babyganics because it has a nicer lather and the container it comes in is easier to get the soap out of.   Hope this review helps a parent looking for a good shampoo/body wash for their little one with sensitive skin. I will save you the money and time that I already spent and tell you to just purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Good shampooo for the kids. My kid is allergic to all kinds of fragrances so this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> It Knots up my daughter&#x27;s hair, doesn&#x27;t lather very well. You need more than one pump. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This soap is super easy to dispense and wonderful for my child&#x27;s sensative skin. I love that it is a natural product too.</li>
            <li> Was using the scented version, which was great. Found this and loved it even more. I mostly used it as a shampoo and to wash &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas (daughter was complaining that Aveeno oatmeal soap didn&#x27;t feel good). Now no more complaints and I was happy...until I found out it isn&#x27;t available any more. YTC rep couldn&#x27;t confirm whether it is discontinued or being reformulated.</li>
            <li> My little toddler loves to shower and this gentle shampoo has worked great for him! It doesn&#x27;t irritate his eyes, so he keeps playing while the soap water is runnng off his face too!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No Scent (Great for people with allergies)&lt;br /&gt;All Natural (Too many baby products have harmful chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;Cleans Wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time (We bath our daughter 3 times a week with soap per her doctors instructions and 4 x week with just warm&lt;br /&gt;  water. (this is part of her nighttime routine) and after over 6 months we still have about a 3rd of the bottle left)&lt;br /&gt;Gentle for baby&#x27;s sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Initially paying $7.99 up front. But, at the rate it lasts, it will cost less than $1/month.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I got it for a few times, because it does not burn the eyes. Would make a great baby shampoo and wash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- pump brakes very fast! What to do with the 1/2 bottle? toss away?&lt;br /&gt;- soap smells wired, thought fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;- leaves a residue on baby&#x27;s skin&lt;br /&gt;- dries my skin very bad&lt;br /&gt;- seem to bee too diluted, so the price is outrageous for the such a diluted soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate?? Organic??? R U kidding? hmmm.... how can you trust the rest they claim on the bottle?</li>
            <li> The product works well.  The foam pump gets stuck and makes getting the product out of the bottle dificult.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my local drug store as they put it on clearance. Was upset i ran out of it and its not at the store anymore. Glad i could find it here! Love the scent. Love the pump and instant bubbles. I normally would buy the leading brand of baby wash, or even generic, but this to me is a worthy splurge. Love putting baby in his little natural spa :) the scent is mild and gentle...no added fragrance just a nice natural scent</li>
            <li> I use the entire yesto line for me and my daughter. love the products. they are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the brand personally, but my daughter didn&#x27;t care for it.  Not sure if it was the shampoo or just an &amp;#34;anti-bath/anti-shampoo&amp;#34; phase she was going through at the time?</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT BUT AFTER 3 BOTTLES OF THIS STUFF IT REALLY DOESNT WORK AS ADVERTISED&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TO PUMP 20 TIMES DO BE ABLE TO WASH MY DAUGHTERS HEAD...THE BOTTLE SAYS 1 TO 2 PUMPS (I BELIEVE)&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMENT THIS AND WILL BE GOING BACK TO AVEENO</li>
            <li> This shampoo and body wash extremely dried out my skin.  It is horrible and a waste of money.  I just use it now after a day at the beach to help take off all the sunblock I have put on, but that is only because I don&#x27;t want my money to go to waste.  But after I am done using it I am not going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo/body wash for a small child with sensitive skin.  It is hard to find so I am glad amazon has it.  One bottle lasts a couple months too so it is a great value.</li>
            <li> This soap was just what I needed to wash my daughter&#x27;s skin and hair.  But the bottle is a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) After a few uses, the pump gets stuck.  The only way to unstick it is to bang it against the tub.  It unsticks part way, I press down the pump, and it happens again.  Over and over again.  And it wasn&#x27;t just one bad bottle.  I&#x27;ve had the same problem with three bottles in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The expiration date and lot number are printed on the bottom of the bottle in ink that is not water-fast.  In other words, if you leave the bottle sitting on a wet countertop, the ink will dissolve and stain your countertop.  My off-white corian vanity is ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have never imagined that a bath product would be so poorly packaged -- so it is nearly impossible to access the product and the product ruins your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products for my son but unfortunately they all dry his skin out. I went back to Mustela after using this stuff. It wasn&#x27;t terrible but my little man just has my sensitive skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I liked it! Shampoo foam, does not run, well applied and washed off. My son is 2.5 years old, he is also happy. Minus only one, not very durable plastic dispenser, it broke during delivery. It&#x27;s not very nice, but not critical for the evaluation.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this product. As a shampoo, it is EXTREMELY drying that my hair suddenly became so frizzy and damaged. It is also a terrible body wash as it did not clean very well at all and left significant residue. I much prefer Clearly Natural Unscented body wash or some Aveeno body wash.</li>
            <li> The soap/shampoo is great but the packaging is horrible. The expiration date is printed on the bottom of the bottle and the company used a water soluble tricky ink. So the date washes off the bottle while using it and stains your bathtub. For some reason it is not removable form the tub, so beware of this tricky ink!!&lt;br /&gt;Was off the date before the first use and enjoy this great soap.</li>
