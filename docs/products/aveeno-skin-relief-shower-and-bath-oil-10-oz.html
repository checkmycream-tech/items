            <li>The oil feels and smells nice</li>
            <li>This product is the absolute best thing I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
            <li>Wonderful itch relief for my ultra sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>Aveeno Shower/Bath Oil has a very light smell which seems to dissipate rather</li>
            <li>puts a nice and smooth film on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love bath oil</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will continue to use it but will not buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product</li>
            <li>A friend suggested I look on amazon.com where I was able to find 11 bottles.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff--have a daughter and a granddaughter who have also been able to find relief.     </li>
            <li>I stand away from the faucet in the shower, rub this on, rinse it off, and my skin feels and looks way better than before.</li>
            <li>..haven&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere else..</li>
            <li>One problem was that it prevented the castille soap from making as many suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At most it will reduce itch, but for some people that is all they are looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best product, I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Try it yourself and don&#x27;t forget the exfoliation step with a stone.  :)</li>
            <li>Smells lovely without being perfume-y too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product as a bath oil.</li>
            <li>Product is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>It works much better than the lotions I had been using after the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this on your site.</li>
            <li>I make sure not to rinse it off when I am rinsing his shampoo off.</li>
            <li>Love th√Æs product.</li>
            <li>so was glad to find on amazon.</li>
            <li>will buy again for sure if I can keep finding it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So much better than just lotion alone.</li>
            <li>and I have to order it in bulk because no one here seems top carry it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry that nothing is perfect</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and itchy in the winter and this has been my perfect cure!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially in very dry Arizona.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, goes on easy, and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The neutral scent allowed the stronger castille scents (peppermint) to stay strong.  </li>
            <li>and so I avoid those that are too strong or seem to linger.  </li>
            <li>It is a fine oil.</li>
            <li>Good stuff at first i wasn&#x27;t sure but really works</li>
            <li>It was widely available at that time.</li>
            <li>My skin stays smooth and itch free.  </li>
            <li>Others also use it for keeping skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>great sheer texture, not over oily.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years but it is no longer available in my area.</li>
            <li>Its a quick easy way to moisturize ay</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t expect Aveeno Shower/Bath Oil to be much different but hope springs eternal and the excellent reviews made me think that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply that way and seems to be just the right amount for me.  </li>
            <li>and I liked old one.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Johnson&#x27;s baby oil Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Combats dry skin,and the two together offers AWESOME HYDRATION!</li>
            <li>When I poured this out of the bottle in my hand in the shower I noticed a mild scent</li>
            <li>seeps into skin quick.</li>
            <li>Does a really great job of making your skin softer (and less itchy which was my goal).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle first!)</li>
            <li>It is great for my itching skin in winter, without making a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very oily, great for sex in a bath if you have one large enough.</li>
            <li>I like to use a nice oil in my bath to prevent my skin from drying out rather than apply a lotion later.  </li>
            <li>A bottle lasts quite a while and is totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I used it tonight on my other boys and their skin felt nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for a long time and love it!</li>
            <li>Then you rinse it off right before exiting your shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By itself, this shower oil is great affordable alternative to the Neutrogena bath oil, but perhaps a little less effective</li>
            <li>and my skin remains soft and smooth for over 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous creams and lotions that were ok</li>
            <li>could not find exact mixture in stores</li>
            <li>nice smell, not overwhelming, just clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different moisturizing bath gels and lotions, some by Aveeno, and none of them really seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I specifically got this for my 1 year old boy that has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>you use is like an ounce in tub of water.cheaper than aveeno in the packets that say for exzema and works better and cheaper.anyone with dry skin problems</li>
            <li>Totally l love this product, not too oily, but oily enough to make my skin fill soft and moisturized even in the winter!</li>
            <li>First off its main ingredient is mineral oil, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used it.</li>
            <li>I normally use a sweet almond oil that can be hard to find, so when I stumbled upon this in the store I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Once I got out of the bath my whole body immediately started itching</li>
            <li>I would much rather use 100 percent coconut or almond oil over this product.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell, and it easier and quicker to apply over the whole body than cream.  </li>
            <li>but this is very soothing.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis much.</li>
            <li>I like a bath oil that just leaves my skin feeling soft but this was more like it left a film on me.</li>
            <li>Better than other name brands.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find locally and I swear it&#x27;s the best for my super sensitive, very dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you apply after the fact and pat dry, it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful if you live in the desert.</li>
            <li>I have given it to friends and family members to try, and all have adopted this as their primary solution to dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Pat dry then follow with a light application of the Aveeno lotion.  </li>
            <li>Although if I can&#x27;t find something I like better, this did keep my skin from getting dry and itchy all last winter, if used in the shower, lightly rinsed and then &amp;#34;patted&amp;#34; dry.</li>
            <li>I need to rinse well afterward because this stuff really is oil, but it keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the only produact I have found that keeps my skin soft &amp; full of moisture.</li>
            <li>I might be able to skip the heavy body lotions this winter if I use this each time I shower.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much can only find it online,</li>
            <li>This makes his skin feel normal.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, it&#x27;s makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances that could trigger migraines</li>
            <li>I barely rinse afterwards and lightly pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly it was unavailable unless I bought a case by having my local drugstore special order order it.</li>
            <li>Putting moisturizer on your body seamed like it would be grose and messy and get on your clothes, but this is easy.</li>
            <li>I am older and live in the southern California desert.</li>
            <li>With the rinsing your skin is soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d nearly given up this time when even that wasn&#x27;t getting results.</li>
            <li>...love this stuff...makes my skin soft after shower</li>
            <li>2-3 times a week, I gently use a river rock/pumice stone for exfoliating after cleansing, then apply the shower oil before a final rinse.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, not greasy the way it can be after using body lotion.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that when she wants to get out of the tub, She&#x27;s like a greased pig.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on my kids&#x27; skin as baby oil.</li>
            <li>and they come out with soft skin.</li>
            <li>Really helps dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely greasy, but it is oily.</li>
            <li>For some reason, Aveeno Skin Relief Shower &amp; Bath Oil is no longer on the shelves of major drug stores.  </li>
            <li>It was the only thing that helped clear up my toddlers severe eczema.</li>
            <li>We live in a dessert and during the winter it is just sooooo dry.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only way I&#x27;ve found to have moisturized skin without bathing in lotion daily.  </li>
            <li>No dry skin problems and I&#x27;m over 60.</li>
            <li>Now they have no dry skin and are amazed at the results.</li>
            <li>This takes a little longer but my body soaks in this product pretty rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I have multiple auto immune disorders, including psoriatic arthritis and sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, which lead to horribly dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Little expensive but good to use.</li>

            <li> I specifically got this for my 1 year old boy that has mild eczema.</li>
            <li> you use is like an ounce in tub of water.cheaper than aveeno in the packets that say for exzema and works better and cheaper.anyone with dry skin problems</li>
            <li> Totally l love this product, not too oily, but oily enough to make my skin fill soft and moisturized even in the winter!</li>
            <li> First off its main ingredient is mineral oil, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used it.</li>
            <li> I normally use a sweet almond oil that can be hard to find, so when I stumbled upon this in the store I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Once I got out of the bath my whole body immediately started itching</li>
            <li> I would much rather use 100 percent coconut or almond oil over this product.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell, and it easier and quicker to apply over the whole body than cream.  </li>
            <li> but this is very soothing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis much.</li>
            <li> I like a bath oil that just leaves my skin feeling soft but this was more like it left a film on me.</li>
            <li> Better than other name brands.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally and I swear it&#x27;s the best for my super sensitive, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you apply after the fact and pat dry, it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful if you live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I have given it to friends and family members to try, and all have adopted this as their primary solution to dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Pat dry then follow with a light application of the Aveeno lotion.  </li>
            <li> Although if I can&#x27;t find something I like better, this did keep my skin from getting dry and itchy all last winter, if used in the shower, lightly rinsed and then &amp;#34;patted&amp;#34; dry.</li>
            <li> I need to rinse well afterward because this stuff really is oil, but it keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> This is the only produact I have found that keeps my skin soft &amp; full of moisture.</li>
            <li> I might be able to skip the heavy body lotions this winter if I use this each time I shower.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much can only find it online,</li>
            <li> This makes his skin feel normal.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, it&#x27;s makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances that could trigger migraines</li>
            <li> I barely rinse afterwards and lightly pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly it was unavailable unless I bought a case by having my local drugstore special order order it.</li>
            <li> Putting moisturizer on your body seamed like it would be grose and messy and get on your clothes, but this is easy.</li>
            <li> I am older and live in the southern California desert.</li>
            <li> With the rinsing your skin is soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d nearly given up this time when even that wasn&#x27;t getting results.</li>
            <li> ...love this stuff...makes my skin soft after shower</li>
            <li> 2-3 times a week, I gently use a river rock/pumice stone for exfoliating after cleansing, then apply the shower oil before a final rinse.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, not greasy the way it can be after using body lotion.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that when she wants to get out of the tub, She&#x27;s like a greased pig.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on my kids&#x27; skin as baby oil.</li>
            <li> and they come out with soft skin.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely greasy, but it is oily.</li>
            <li> For some reason, Aveeno Skin Relief Shower &amp; Bath Oil is no longer on the shelves of major drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It was the only thing that helped clear up my toddlers severe eczema.</li>
            <li> We live in a dessert and during the winter it is just sooooo dry.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only way I&#x27;ve found to have moisturized skin without bathing in lotion daily.  </li>
            <li> No dry skin problems and I&#x27;m over 60.</li>
            <li> Now they have no dry skin and are amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> This takes a little longer but my body soaks in this product pretty rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I have multiple auto immune disorders, including psoriatic arthritis and sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, which lead to horribly dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Little expensive but good to use.</li>
            <li> Naturally this has led to our using several other Aveeno Products.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like a bath oil to prevent me from drying out, not to treat my skin once I&#x27;m already dry.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that works on my dry skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I find it works well either directly on the skin in the shower, or a bit poured in a bath.</li>
            <li> I was having, I tried several different products with no success.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s because I put too much in the bath, it just feels thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry and nothing soothed my skin like Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I towel dry my hair and face</li>
            <li> and then I air dry.</li>
            <li> Helps with Dry Skin Challenges....</li>
            <li> Soothing and calming for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after a shower, I use the oil</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that dry skin itch.</li>
            <li> and it has worked wonders for my dry, itchy</li>
            <li> Would recommend for dry skinned people.</li>
            <li> Pat dry.</li>
            <li> I use it for my Mother who has dry skin and it helps.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin from developing that dry itchy feeling that occurs each winter.  </li>
            <li> Need it in dry Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I use it both after my shower and often on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my family&#x27;s dry skin and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I bet sales weren&#x27;t hot because the instructions call for putting the oil in the bath water which is sticky and messy, rather than applying once you get out of the tub on wet skin and towel dry (no tub or shower mess!)</li>
            <li> The directions clearly suggest that you can add a small amount to bath water, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it.  </li>
            <li> With this, I only have to apply a little oil after I turn the shower off, towel dry, and itchy skin is gone.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the bath and also rub on very dry areas.  </li>
            <li> Although I know that taking long hot showers is not recommended for people with dry itchy skin, it&#x27;s difficult for me to switch to cooler and shorter showers.  </li>
            <li> You put this on wet skin and it helps seal in moisture.  </li>
            <li> the end of your shower.&lt;br /&gt;The oil emulsifies into a milky oil when you spread it over your wet skin.</li>
            <li> DO be careful with this - have a mat on the bathtub or shower basin</li>
            <li> I do recommend that a non-slip bath mat be used to prevent the risk of slipping.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not going to clear up a serious skin condition.</li>
            <li> While it is expensive, it really helps with the itching and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> does to prevent exzema, including prescription creams and all other lotions.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that while it smells okay coming out of the bottle, upon rubbing it into your skin it smells a little sour (think baby spittle - albeit it very, very faint).  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in any stores locally.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price in my opinion</li>
            <li> Once out of the shower (and after patting my body down with a towel, NOT rubbing it down)</li>
            <li> then I pour a GENEROUS handful of AVEENO SHOWER/BATH OIL and spread it over my entire body--and I do mean</li>
            <li> A little pricey but helps my sons skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> My mother and sister complained about having some serious dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> Little pricey but hard to find.</li>
            <li> I notice very little scent when I raise my forearm to my nose.</li>
            <li> and then the weird residue spread around the outside of the tub.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how this product will smell</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding it stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the drugstore--</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores-love it</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> I have been using it this entire unseasonably cold winter</li>
            <li> It felt thick and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Well I am seriously in a pickle here...   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and never used any type of moisturizer, but my skin started getting really dry this winter, plus amazon lets me avoid the awkward walk through the cosmetic isle in the store.</li>
            <li> If you want something to put into your bath water, this is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> Even in the harsh NY winter!!!</li>
            <li> I have finally found relief for my miserably itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It does have a weird smell (oatmeal) when putting it on, but it goes away when you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> While it works alright if applied AFTER the bath, it is horrible when used in the bath water.  </li>
            <li> I have always had eczema and terribly itchy skin in the winter, from the day we turn the heat on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> puts a nice and smooth film on your skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered Aveeno Shower &amp; Bath Oil several years ago at a local store.  Then suddenly all of the stores in the area stopped carrying it.  I have search everywhere. I went to Aveeno online to see if they still produced the product and found it could be purchased through Amazon.  I was elated.  This is the greatest product; I love it and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> It is great to use after aquacise classes.  Removes the itching of the pool water.  Thanks!!.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price in my opinion</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I have used several years now. Really helps dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to relieve itchy winter skin.  I have a really hard time finding it stores.</li>
            <li> I like to use a nice oil in my bath to prevent my skin from drying out rather than apply a lotion later.  I normally use a sweet almond oil that can be hard to find, so when I stumbled upon this in the store I was thrilled.  It smells a lot like my almond oil, but it doesn&#x27;t work anything like it.  I should have been tipped off when I read that you have to \\&quot;shake well before use\\&quot;.  It seems to be a combination oil/lotion (there are no ingredients listed on the bottle).  While it works alright if applied AFTER the bath, it is horrible when used in the bath water.  The directions clearly suggest that you can add a small amount to bath water, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it.  As soon as I poured some under the tap it frothed and then the weird residue spread around the outside of the tub.  It leaves a gritty, slimy residue in the tub when you&#x27;re done and leaves your skin feeling the same.  If you want something to put into your bath water, this is not a good product.  If you apply after the fact and pat dry, it works just fine.  Personally, I like a bath oil to prevent me from drying out, not to treat my skin once I&#x27;m already dry.</li>
            <li> Very oily, great for sex in a bath if you have one large enough. lol</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross. First off its main ingredient is mineral oil, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used it. As a bath oil it separated strangly in the water and left tons of residue. Once I got out of the bath my whole body immediately started itching and I had to shower to get all of this oily junk off. Yuck. I would much rather use 100 percent coconut or almond oil over this product.</li>
            <li> I used this in my bath and I really didn&#x27;t care for it. I love bath oil and I like to try different products but I wouldn&#x27;t  use this one again. It felt thick and greasy on my skin. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s because I put too much in the bath, it just feels thick and greasy. I like a bath oil that just leaves my skin feeling soft but this was more like it left a film on me. I gave it to someone else to try and they didn&#x27;t care for it either. I like Aveeno products but I did not like this bath oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This was my go to item when I was deployed. My skin was extremely dry and nothing soothed my skin like Aveeno products. I use this in the shower and then Aveeno lotion when I get out. I also had Aveeno body wash, I wasn&#x27;t playing. However it is way too costly on this site. I purchased all my products from drugstore.com which was way cheaper, by $4.00. I love the product and will continue to use it but will not buy it from Amazon. Oh side note know I am in VA and have went back to the product again. The winters up North is drying out my skin big time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin my whole life.  I discovered this over 10 years ago. I apply at the end of my shower and rinse off every day.  works like nothing else does to prevent exzema, including prescription creams and all other lotions.  With the rinsing your skin is soft but not greasy.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the drugstore--I used to always buy all the inventory from a drugstore when they had it--now none of the chains (bartels, wallgreens, rite aid) in the northwest carry it; so I order it here.</li>
            <li> This is the only produact I have found that keeps my skin soft &amp; full of moisture.</li>
            <li> Little pricey but hard to find.</li>
            <li> UPDATE; I am devastated - it has happened, the oil has been discontinued!!! I bet sales weren&#x27;t hot because the instructions call for putting the oil in the bath water which is sticky and messy, rather than applying once you get out of the tub on wet skin and towel dry (no tub or shower mess!) or applying in the shower and rinsing it off...  Well I am seriously in a pickle here...   I have always had eczema and terribly itchy skin in the winter, from the day we turn the heat on.  I would wake up in the middle of the night scratching my legs til I was bleeding! My daughter has the same problem.  For 10 years now, I find this oil to be the only reliable solution to our problem.  I tried medicated lotions, soaps, creams, soaks, etc, but nothing worked.  With this, I only have to apply a little oil after I turn the shower off, towel dry, and itchy skin is gone.  The only issue is that the local supermarkets and drugstores only carry it sporadically and each year it&#x27;s the same anxiety: will the stores replenish their stock?  Thankfully I can find it online!  I have given it to friends and family members to try, and all have adopted this as their primary solution to dry itchy skin.  It does not feel greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell, and it easier and quicker to apply over the whole body than cream.  LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I have finally found relief for my miserably itchy skin. Started using AVEENO SHOWER/BATH OIL about ten years ago. It was widely available at that time. Suddenly it was unavailable unless I bought a case by having my local drugstore special order order it. I&#x27;d nearly given up this time when even that wasn&#x27;t getting results. A friend suggested I look on amazon.com where I was able to find 11 bottles. I bought ALL OF THEM. I love this stuff--have a daughter and a granddaughter who have also been able to find relief.     When I get out of the shower I towel dry my hair and face then I pour a GENEROUS handful of AVEENO SHOWER/BATH OIL and spread it over my entire body--and I do mean entire-- and then I air dry. This takes a little longer but my body soaks in this product pretty rapidly.  Especially in the winter this keeps me from itching and scratching until I&#x27;ve raised welts all over. As a result I&#x27;ve reduced the chance of skin infection. Naturally this has led to our using several other Aveeno Products.</li>
            <li> Helps with Dry Skin Challenges....&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended by my dermatologist...It is a good product! nd I use it with the Johnson&#x27;s baby oil Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Combats dry skin,and the two together offers AWESOME HYDRATION!</li>
            <li> Soothing and calming for dry winter skin. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Works great for the kids to moisturize the skin while they play in the bath.  Saves time afterwards by not having to lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and never used any type of moisturizer, but my skin started getting really dry this winter, plus amazon lets me avoid the awkward walk through the cosmetic isle in the store. Putting moisturizer on your body seamed like it would be grose and messy and get on your clothes, but this is easy. I stand away from the faucet in the shower, rub this on, rinse it off, and my skin feels and looks way better than before. It does have a weird smell (oatmeal) when putting it on, but it goes away when you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this on Amazon...love this stuff...makes my skin soft after shower..haven&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere else..</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after a shower, I use the oil and I feel great.  You do not feel oily after the shower and I don&#x27;t have that dry skin itch.</li>
            <li> I bought this shower oil to mix with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castille soap so that I would stop stripping my skin every shower.  The neutral scent allowed the stronger castille scents (peppermint) to stay strong.  I felt like my skin stopped drying out every day.  One problem was that it prevented the castille soap from making as many suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself, this shower oil is great affordable alternative to the Neutrogena bath oil, but perhaps a little less effective</li>
            <li> Although I know that taking long hot showers is not recommended for people with dry itchy skin, it&#x27;s difficult for me to switch to cooler and shorter showers.  I have tried so many different moisturizing bath gels and lotions, some by Aveeno, and none of them really seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t expect Aveeno Shower/Bath Oil to be much different but hope springs eternal and the excellent reviews made me think that it was worth a try.  I have been using it this entire unseasonably cold winter and it has worked wonders for my dry, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering, I pour about a quarter size dollop into my palm and slather it on my soaking skin.  It is so easy to apply that way and seems to be just the right amount for me.  My skin stays smooth and itch free.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances that could trigger migraines and so I avoid those that are too strong or seem to linger.  Aveeno Shower/Bath Oil has a very light smell which seems to dissipate rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so tickled to have finally found something that works and hope that my five stars will add to the rating and encourage some others who may have the same problem to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is another great product for ecezema</li>
            <li> You put this on wet skin and it helps seal in moisture.  My skin is so dry that nothing is perfect but this is very soothing.</li>
            <li> The oil feels and smells nice but it&#x27;s not going to clear up a serious skin condition. At most it will reduce itch, but for some people that is all they are looking for. Works well in either bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Totally l love this product, not too oily, but oily enough to make my skin fill soft and moisturized even in the winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2009, and It has worked miracles for me.  I was diagnosed with Steven&#x27;s Johnson Syndrome in 2009, with the itching and peeling I was having, I tried several different products with no success.  I ended up going to Target and found this product.  While it is expensive, it really helps with the itching and dry skin.  It&#x27;s definitely the best product, I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Does a really great job of making your skin softer (and less itchy which was my goal).  Little expensive but good to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product... It&#x27;s great for eczema and also itchy pregnancy skin..... It never stings. I put it everywhere and it&#x27;s just heaven. A bottle lasts quite a while and is totally worth the cost. It was the only thing that helped clear up my toddlers severe eczema.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products.  You can moisturize while in the shower.  Pricey, but worth it.  Would recommend for dry skinned people.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells like almond oil. Its a quick easy way to moisturize ay the end of your shower.&lt;br /&gt;The oil emulsifies into a milky oil when you spread it over your wet skin. Then you rinse it off right before exiting your shower. Pat dry.</li>
            <li> Very helpful if you live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  After cleansing, apply some of this soothing creamy oil (don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle first!) before your final rinse for skin that&#x27;s not parched after towel drying.  2-3 times a week, I gently use a river rock/pumice stone for exfoliating after cleansing, then apply the shower oil before a final rinse.  Pat dry then follow with a light application of the Aveeno lotion.  Holy cow, it&#x27;s makes a huge difference and my skin remains soft and smooth for over 24 hours.  Try it yourself and don&#x27;t forget the exfoliation step with a stone.  :)</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed for a toddler who has eczema; it seems to help.  Others also use it for keeping skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for years.  I use it instead of shaving lotion on my legs, and smear it all over myself after washing.  I need to rinse well afterward because this stuff really is oil, but it keeps my skin soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis much.</li>
            <li> I have had severe psori for over 10 yrs and this lotion after the shower keeps my skin moist and not irritated. I have tried numerous creams and lotions that were ok but this one knocks them out of the box!  Even in the harsh NY winter!!! ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I guess using any oil after showing or bathing seals in the moisture, and this product is no different.  It actually works pretty well.  My only complaint is that while it smells okay coming out of the bottle, upon rubbing it into your skin it smells a little sour (think baby spittle - albeit it very, very faint).  Now, I&#x27;ve only used it in winter so this hasn&#x27;t presented a problem, especially since I wipe off any excess with a towel - but I&#x27;m not sure how this product will smell come warmer weather.  So, while it works, I will probably not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> When I poured this out of the bottle in my hand in the shower I noticed a mild scent but I can&#x27;t tell you what the scent it.  Once out of the shower (and after patting my body down with a towel, NOT rubbing it down) I notice very little scent when I raise my forearm to my nose. My skin feels soft, not greasy the way it can be after using body lotion.  I might be able to skip the heavy body lotions this winter if I use this each time I shower.  Time will tell.     DO be careful with this - have a mat on the bathtub or shower basin so you don&#x27;t slip. It&#x27;s not extremely greasy, but it is oily.</li>
            <li> It is a fine oil. I use it for my Mother who has dry skin and it helps. The only problem is that when she wants to get out of the tub, She&#x27;s like a greased pig. I have to wrap her in towels to lift her out. It just means the oil is working.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in any stores locally. Pretty much can only find it online, A little pricey but helps my sons skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> I have multiple auto immune disorders, including psoriatic arthritis and sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, which lead to horribly dry and sensitive skin. This product is the absolute best thing I&#x27;ve ever found! A little goes a long way, I find it works well either directly on the skin in the shower, or a bit poured in a bath. Smells lovely without being perfume-y too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, it can leave a slippery film in your bathtub. Definitely use a textured bath mat.</li>
            <li> Love this product as a bath oil. Great size, easy to dispense. Smells great. Great product fir me.</li>
            <li> Product is fabulous!  Keeps my skin from developing that dry itchy feeling that occurs each winter.  It works much better than the lotions I had been using after the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this on your site. For some reason, Aveeno Skin Relief Shower &amp; Bath Oil is no longer on the shelves of major drug stores.  I do recommend that a non-slip bath mat be used to prevent the risk of slipping.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my skin, especially if you don&#x27;t like to wear lotion! Just use it in the shower and your done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a long time and love it!</li>
            <li> This makes a noticeable difference for my kids bath time. I specifically got this for my 1 year old boy that has mild eczema. We live in a dessert and during the winter it is just sooooo dry. This makes his skin feel normal. Not greasy at all. I make sure not to rinse it off when I am rinsing his shampoo off. I used it tonight on my other boys and their skin felt nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this last in the shower with a pouf sponge. I barely rinse afterwards and lightly pat dry with a towel. Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. My skin is dry and itchy in the winter and this has been my perfect cure! Wished I had known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally and I swear it&#x27;s the best for my super sensitive, very dry skin. It has a very light scent, goes on easy, and rinses off cleanly. Without leaving a greasy film on the bottom of the tub. Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores-love it</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Need it in dry Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Love th√Æs product. Hard to find</li>
            <li> I am older and live in the southern California desert. This stuff is amazing. I use it both after my shower and often on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. could not find exact mixture in stores so was glad to find on amazon. seems they improved it and I liked old one. didn&#x27;t see any need for improving. great sheer texture, not over oily. seeps into skin quick. does not stain clothes or sheets. nice smell, not overwhelming, just clean smell. will buy again for sure if I can keep finding it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at first i wasn&#x27;t sure but really works</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on my kids&#x27; skin as baby oil. Also, it separates in the bottle, and doesn&#x27;t come out evenly (mixed) from the bottle even after shaking it. My kids turned their noses up at it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my family&#x27;s dry skin and it does the job. I put it my kids bath and they come out with soft skin.</li>
            <li> Works great in my tub or after a shower. Conditions skin great without a perfume smell, no oily residue. Better than other name brands.</li>
            <li> Wonderful itch relief for my ultra sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but it is no longer available in my area. It is great for my itching skin in winter, without making a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> great except for the residue in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower by itself, mix it in with unscented &#x27;everyone lotion&#x27; to moisturize every 2-3 days - using it with lotion makes it easier to apply (it is oil).  Smells amazing!  So far this is the only way I&#x27;ve found to have moisturized skin without bathing in lotion daily.  I am totally hooked.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years now. No dry skin problems and I&#x27;m over 60. My mother and sister complained about having some serious dry skin issues. I recommended this and the lotion. Now they have no dry skin and are amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially in very dry Arizona. I use it in the bath and also rub on very dry areas.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I lived in NYC and used it every day after my shower to keep my legs moisturized. Now we keep it at our place in Tahoe too for the subzero winters and skiing skin and it works beautifully. So much better than just lotion alone.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that works on my dry skin and I have to order it in bulk because no one here seems top carry it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I have agree about the smell.  Although if I can&#x27;t find something I like better, this did keep my skin from getting dry and itchy all last winter, if used in the shower, lightly rinsed and then &amp;#34;patted&amp;#34; dry.</li>
            <li> what a great product.I had a case of exzema and was trying everything.this is what cured it.all you use is like an ounce in tub of water.cheaper than aveeno in the packets that say for exzema and works better and cheaper.anyone with dry skin problems this is the ticket.</li>
