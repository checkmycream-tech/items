            <li>it does take some practice getting used to using the airbrush and getting your correct color, but once you do, the results are awesome.</li>
            <li>I found that holding the wand about 8\\&quot;s from my face is best with a sweeping motion.  </li>

            <li>The results are the best I have ever seen in my makeup.  </li>

            <li>I mix the frapuccino and Latte color together, 9 drops of each to make a perfect match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The frapuccino will be perfect in the summer when I have a tan.  </li>
            <li>so I got in touch with the owners and they bent over backwards to create me the perfect color.  </li>

            <li>It really is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My skin is one, beautiful, even color -</li>
            <li>but once I did today I have to say that I am extremely happy with the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Product is great and great price too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blush that it came with was great for my skin tone color</li>
            <li>They are both great.  </li>
            <li>The results of  doing this were that the makeup itself did not look so great.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look great on me.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this airbrush system.  </li>
            <li>I KNOW WHY NOW, THIS IS A GREAT SYSTEM AND GREAT COMPANY.</li>
            <li>Makeup is great.</li>
            <li>I had to write a review about this amazing product because as a consumer, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the courteous customer service and timely delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>The customer service is great too.</li>
            <li>Im really happy with it.</li>

            <li>i&#x27;m  a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>OMG what great customer service is that?  </li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>If you have any questions it comes with a number to call and a very nice lady will help you with any questions.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING!..</li>
            <li>MY MAKEUP LOOKS FLAWLESS :-)</li>
            <li>Besides the product burning out the machine was very good and the makeup coverage was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think it took me 2-3 minutes to apply the foundation, another 2 minutes to rinse really good</li>
            <li>Today though I got a really nice and even coat of foundation that looked great</li>
            <li>It is light weight and perfect every time!!  </li>
            <li>It looks great, I&#x27;ve had tons of people telling me my makeup looks nice.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to learn that the problem was, well, me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead, I picked up a Belloccio blush (here on Amazon) in Charming Lily.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 2 or 3 times to get good at it</li>
            <li>I LOVED THEIR TANNING SOLUTION</li>
            <li>Go to Ulta instead and get their cosmetics professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow!</li>
            <li>And you won&#x27;t even spend $66.s professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s IT - good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck!up:  </li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t move my face, it did look good</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the level of customer service, as well as I am thrilled with this product!</li>

            <li>I was impressed with her sincerity and customer service before even receiving the product - really, who does that these days?</li>
            <li>I have not tried the sealer at all yet, honestly.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of blotting to make it nice and even looking.  </li>
            <li>a truly awesome company that really cares about their customers.</li>
            <li>but if I smiled, their were lines all over my face.&lt;br</li>

            <li>played around with the different types of foundation until I found the one that was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies if you&#x27;re looking for an Airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, get this one.</li>
            <li>LOVE the moisturizer and waterproof setting spray too.  </li>
            <li>If I was too close to my face wrinkles were more noticable.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients have even proved me with a more even skin tone for those days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>and I was sure the machine was a dud.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>What more could I want?</li>
            <li>You basically need to buy two and mix them to get a perfect color, especially once you start getting a tan in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and lasts the whole day</li>
            <li>So if you get a drop of water on your face, you will be able to see where the makeup came off.  </li>
            <li>Most people have guessed I am in my 40&#x27;s - HURRAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:  </li>
            <li>The makeup itself stays on better than ANY makeup I&#x27;ve ever used before</li>
            <li>Have you washed it?\\&quot; and, my favorite,</li>
            <li>I knew if I felt confident about how I looked, I&#x27;d do a better job presenting.</li>
            <li>Kathy took the time to help me figure out the best solution for me personally.</li>
            <li>truly cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!</li>
            <li>I just wish I would have found this sooner :)</li>
            <li>But love how it feels going on your face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better, feels better, is better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>You better hope you like the system and the make up as well because you will be stuck with it.</li>
            <li>If you had so many returns that your business went under, wouldn&#x27;t that tell you something as a business owner?  </li>
            <li>i love this makeup system.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>No break outs whatsoever! :)</li>
            <li>It came with three different skin tone colors that I can use one at a time or mix together to get a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Challenging.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love this..</li>
            <li>BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND ITS OK..</li>
            <li>INSTEAD YOU&#x27;RE BETTER OFF WITH THAT..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find a brand that won&#x27;t rub off with a better moisturizer under it.  </li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments from friends and family about how my skin looks so flawless and what am i doing differently..</li>
            <li>I love it 😍😗😊</li>
            <li>Very easy to work with and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to do and I loved the feel of it.</li>
            <li>nice clean finish.</li>
            <li>I really thought it sounded too good to be true!!  </li>
            <li>it goes on perfectly smooth, lasts all day and it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The makeup has a flawless finish and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Porcelain matches my fair skin exactly.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice little unit, uncomplicated with the best price I have seen on one of these.</li>
            <li>I would love this product if it was available in a more olive shade</li>
            <li>I was preparing to give my very first major sales presentation, and wanted to look my best.</li>
            <li>Aside from this being an exceptional price I just have to comment on the stellar customer service I have received from the owners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shortly after using the Tickled Pink Airbrush system and makeup, imagine my surprise when a fellow actor referred to me as &amp;#34;the woman with the perfect skin.&amp;#34;  ME?  </li>
            <li>So I would def recommend going ahead and buying more moisturizer with your 1st purchase to save on shipping costs (free over $50).</li>
            <li>After months of searching for the best airbrush kit I came acrossed a company called Tickled Pink.</li>
            <li>From Day One, the owners of Tickled Pink were delightfully helpful with any of my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have gotten a lot more products &amp; free skin color match with makeup I can use.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, was delivered quickly and has GREAT customer</li>
            <li>I would keep it put away when not in use and make sure you clean it out thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I had a lot of fun mixing the different shades of foundation to find the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can already tell you that their customer service is excellent, very polite,  professional and helpful)</li>
            <li>I can already tell you that their customer service is excellent, very polite,  professional and helpful)</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>UP WOULD SMUDGE REALLY EASY.</li>
            <li>Strong spraying capacity.  </li>
            <li>While I found this airbrush machine to work wonderfully, imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same one on Ebay withOUT</li>
            <li>Which is fine.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and it makes my skin feel so nice and soft</li>
            <li>The machine works great and is easy to use, however the makeup itself is gross.</li>
            <li>takes a little practice to get it looking perfect and not cake-y.  </li>
            <li>and i found it so easy and so much fun!</li>
            <li>I was able to splurge on this for myself and although the cost seems high you will not regret it because you get a flawless look that everyone will compliment you on and in the long run you will save money on foundation.  </li>
            <li>They also have a huge selection of airbrush makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of airbrushing my makeup on now.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put cheap makeup, or makeup that isn&#x27;t water based in the machine or it will ruin it.  </li>
            <li>The seller has been fabulous to work with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so light</li>
            <li>You also must figure out by trial and error how to apply with a light hand...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply, clean and store.</li>
            <li>no blotchiness, no age spots - just smooth,</li>
            <li>it’s great that you can mix up the different colors to match your skin tone as the seasons change.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>When I called to say the foundation was too light, I was told it was just to practice with</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re gonna love it as much as I do :)</li>
            <li>BUT IT FADES AWAY NATURALLY NO BLOTCHY SPOTS AND ITS A BEAUTIFUL TAN NO ORANGE</li>
            <li>The enthusiastic husband and wife owners who initially went out of their way to send samples stopped replying to my texts or phone calls when I returned the machine at my own cost and on their request for replacement.</li>
            <li>I have always loved playing around with makeup, but i am by far no Makeup Artist, but when i got my machine, i started practicing on my sister and friends</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a few applications, I can now apply my foundation and blush in about 10 minutes, including the Flawless Finish application and the time to clean the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>abut applying it myself, but its super easy.  </li>
            <li>The make up goes on so easily and quickly</li>
            <li>I think if the owners managed to reduce the cost of the products than this would be the ultimate airbrush system to own!</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try</li>
            <li>great machine, will be using it for a long time, until I need another.</li>
            <li>I am starting to think that all of those 5-star reviews are not legitimate as the more recent reviews are not so good!!</li>
            <li>but I did just order the airbrush blush because it&#x27;s so fast and easy)!</li>
            <li>fee\\&quot; if they decide you didn&#x27;t clean it</li>
            <li>I ordered my Tickled Pink kit about a month ago, after an exhaustive search for a reasonably priced airbrush system - and my skin has never looked this beautiful - ever!</li>
            <li>The airbrush wand seems well made (even my husband agreed it was good quality) and looks so cute with the pink handle and \\&quot;Tickled Pink\\&quot; engraving.</li>
            <li>AND I SAW THAT THIS SYSTEM HAD THE MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that so far I am 100% pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>I love the actual airbrush machine, very easy clean up.</li>
            <li>I tried airbrush make up for my wedding and decided that I wanted something I could use at home for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>that I just read and they are all so true.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t pour too much makeup in the top, the cleaning is effortless.   </li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li>I recently started acting and now realize how important it is to look your very best.  </li>
            <li>This is the one system that really does what it says it will do - you will love your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the deluxe kit directly from the sellers via phone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like, you email the \\&quot;company\\&quot; which is really Kathy and her husband</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend $200 on the kit, setting spray and another full sized bottle of foundation to look at it sit on my vanity.</li>
            <li>and her husband truely care about their product and their customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought my makeup looked good - this product takes it to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>(at my age the natural bright light helps me see more clearly than most bathroom lights), so the long cords make that easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to experiment a bit but quickly found that 12 drops of biege and 4 drops of tan work for me.  </li>
            <li>I EMAILED THE COMPANY PERSONALLY AND RECEIVED EMAILS THE VERY NEXT DAY, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li>I used all of the .5oz make up quickly</li>
            <li>Like I told Kathy, they should have taken that barrowed money and put it towards making a better quality product instead of making more quantity and not refunding all the unsatisfied customers their money back, but like Kathy said, \\&quot;we&#x27;re a business</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I turn it to high, fill the cup on the airbrish with tap water and cover the spray end with my finger to make \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; in the cup, then refill it with more water and spray it trhough.</li>
            <li>She was wonderful and spent a ton of time on the phone with me, explaining that the newer line of aloe-based foundations would probably work best since I live in such a dry climate.</li>
            <li>special occasions I lightly dust Bare Minerals on my cheeks to create even more glamour, and use a darker blush under my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>Some of the other ones tell you they have good stuff in them, but do not actually tell you what this good stuff is as TickledPink does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really is a great product and less money</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li>It goes on feeling really cool and fresh, and I make sure to use it near (and over) my eyebrows and nose, which for some reason are the areas that normally flake the most on me, and along my jawline and neck, too.</li>
            <li>An ounce will last a long time, but i like to get a variety of colors so that you can blend and make the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>but this foundation is very lightweight!!...</li>
            <li>QUIET, QUICK &amp; HANDY</li>
            <li>i have thrown away all my old makeup and replaced it with this unit, which is super cute looking.</li>
            <li>But i did think it was very generous of them to throw in a free moisturizer/gift.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, you don&#x27;t really need any instructions for &#x27;assembly&#x27;, but detailed instructions are on their website.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that the refill is a larger bottle but not by too much.</li>
            <li>They also gave me a free sample of their moisturizer which is used in the same way the makeup is used in and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>The airbrush gives you 3 speeds to choose from and it only took me two practice tries to perfect applying it.</li>
            <li>I tell every one about it and how much it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>SO worth it,  </li>
            <li>After trying every kind of makeup to try to cover my scars , hundreds of dollars later.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this system and make-up, and the results are better than I expected.</li>
            <li>He decided on this system because it had a lot of very positive reviews</li>
            <li>My kit arrived today, a day early, and I was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>That was quickly overcome though the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>just right :</li>
            <li>just right with any of these types of machines.  </li>
            <li>I ordered right from their site.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I was right on.  </li>
            <li>She asked me if I had been applying it right and asked if I had been trying it out.</li>
            <li>She was certainly right about that.</li>
            <li>once you get started you will wish you had not waited so long and the customer service that I have received at Tickled Pink is outstanding!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I came across tickled pinks machine which I felt was reasonably priced and finally took the plunge, and SO glad that I did!</li>
            <li>&amp; I would have to buy the next darker shade ($26 more w/shipping) &amp; hope it&#x27;s the right color.</li>
            <li>Also, if you order directly from their website the unit ships for free.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t quite  sure how to actually  use it because I never used an airbrush product before.</li>
            <li>GIVES A PRETTY COLOR IN YOUR FACE AND MAKES YOUR FACE SOFTER THAN IT</li>
            <li>As for coverage, it covers pretty well.</li>
            <li>{ This is my first time trying any type of airbrush makeup</li>
            <li>once I was able to actually TRY it, I was sold!  </li>
            <li>I love it overall</li>
            <li>, so light and soft of a look..</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price for the make up</li>
            <li>I can finally feel better about myself again.</li>
            <li>I do, though, sometimes use the Latte under my eyes first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be going back under again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be posting my own tickled pink RANT review soon, along with how the dinair airbrush system works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be posting my own tickled pink RANT review soon, along with how the dinair airbrush system works.</li>
            <li>First of all....</li>
            <li>But honestly, Tickled Pink is everything I need.</li>
            <li>Make up looks so light and natural.</li>
            <li>plugged it in and had NO problem at all on using it for the first time..</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to get the shade right, but now when I wear it, my skin looks flawless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 and just recently re-entered the workforce (after tens years as a stay-at-home mom), and I was about to get on a plane to fly across the country to meet with a potential new client in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I was leery of buying an airbrush system because of the complication with cleanup, but Tickled Pink is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you look on their website all the reviews are positive but if you look closely you can see where you have to email the \\&quot;company\\</li>
            <li>i usually dont take the time to write a reveiw but with this product i decided to because it is that good.</li>
            <li>have not only found fun and healthy new make-up but a new friend.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores and felt like it accentuated every pore on my face.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how to post a photo, but if you&#x27;ll look me up as Roz Van Meter, you&#x27;ll see how I look as a Woman of a Certain Age.</li>
            <li>- I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply, and I am STILL amazed at how well it covers up every red blotch and age spot every time I use it.</li>
            <li>All of this is packaged in a nice little travel bag with instructions for assembly, which is basically showing you where to connect the tubing.</li>
            <li>I was very discouraged about wearing makeup</li>
            <li>I have to say that while I was learning how to apply the makeup, and I used to much</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin looked shiny in areas that I had too much makeup on</li>
            <li>Covers really well and is super-easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got the light foundation set with my kit and also purchased the blue brown eye shadow and the desert mauve blush.  </li>
            <li>so I would not have too much of an adjustment, if any, to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 12 and 4 drops was way too much makeup for me, but I just sprayed until it was gone.</li>
            <li>4 drops was too much.  </li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable if you have shopped around as I have.  </li>
            <li>I travel for business and really want to take this along.</li>
            <li>The makeup is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin look</li>
            <li>, I have problems with my skin tone being even and the airbrush really works.</li>
            <li>It is economical and looks entirely professional when finished.</li>
            <li>I also highly reccomend not to just buy a foundation...get a blush too!</li>
            <li>The rep was always there to answer my questions and very helpful.</li>
            <li>It really covers all my flaws , thank you so much for making this product .</li>
            <li>and I really like it,</li>
            <li>asking if I could get a system FAST, she agreed to overnight it out to me on Monday via Fed-Ex.</li>
            <li>so I can really see every imperfection on my skin</li>
            <li>and so I can really see TP cover everything.</li>
            <li>I really just ad one misty layer over another until everything is covered on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my brows or hairline or ever get on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I truly feel like it corrects ALL of my skin issues and really does leave you with a polished airbrush look.</li>
            <li>Doesnt take up that much space.</li>
            <li>I love the way my makeup looks after using the  Tickled Pink Airbrush.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>One more thing if you Google tickled pink airbrush</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how light this is, but you get the same coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>My makeup kit came with everything wrapped and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to go faster than ever</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about Kathy or Tinckled Pink -you</li>
            <li>I worked in customer service for several years and know that you never treat a customer poorly, especially when its your own business.</li>
            <li>, I pack it back in the original box</li>
            <li>I Love the Tickled Pink airbrush kit!  </li>
            <li>Since using this system, I have consistently gotten better and younger acting parts.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to try new colors!  </li>
            <li>The makeup has completely dried, and even though I used more than I should have without letting the makeup dry before applying more, it is perfection.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a whole lot about them, but I had an amazon gift card and started reading the reviews on this particular one.  </li>
            <li>, then do several drops of latte to hit my spots of imperfection with a more concentrated and closer flow, then just go generally all over and on my neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting my money back ($200) for a product that didn&#x27;t work as described but apparently Kathy needs the money more than  clientele.</li>
            <li>will be ordering the new make-up and facial serum as soon as it is available this week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw that Tickled Pink&#x27;s set was almost half the price of Temptu&#x27;s and the reviews were great, so why not, I took a chance never having operated an airbrush system or worn the make-up.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s dry, I then brush on some powdered blush, which goes on fine over the foundation (</li>
            <li>just looks so pretty and so natural like a glow on your cheeks once you learn how to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>Yes, in acting it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>You can layer too if you want even more coverage for dark spots or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I finish off by making sure I spray my jawline down to my neck.</li>
            <li>The great thing is, when I wash my face in the evening, there is hardly any make up on the wash cloth compared to when I used regular liquid make up.  </li>
            <li>How often do you get to speak to a live person on the phone, let alone someone who actually wants to hear your story?</li>
            <li>even awesomeness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the makeup would \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my hair and clothes, so the first time I tried it I sat in my undies and had my hair tied back, but the mist is so fine on the low setting it never gets on anything (except where you&#x27;re pointing).</li>
            <li>I am lucky that the porcelain actually matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>This is worth the money, but be sure to spray from at least 5 inches from face for even application.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, and only took me a couple tries to feel proficient.</li>
            <li>The sample foundations should last longer since it’s a larger bottle, but in reality you use more than just 2-3 drops that some places may say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel,and love the amount of time it has decreased my morning routine!</li>
            <li>It was quick and simple.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>bought this airbrush kit with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this product bc</li>
            <li>I will admit I was a little bit of a skeptic when I read the reviews for other airbrush systems, but I got this one because the reviews were pretty good</li>
            <li>one\\&quot;... I was, however, willing to pay even hundreds more for any other system because I needed one shipped out to me in a day, and I couldn&#x27;t find one locally in any store here in Phoenix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gone with Dinair kit, for a little more $</li>
            <li>\\&quot;no offense, but your skin looks kind of dull.</li>
            <li>The better you look, the better parts you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mineral powder I was using made me look older - every flaw, no matter how big or small, was magnified, especially on camera.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My technique: gently spray 5-6 inches from your face in a soft circular motion.</li>
            <li>I went to the Tickled Pink website for the detailed instructions as the notice in the package instructed me.  </li>
            <li>the Tickled Pink logo stuck on it for $99 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>that really made me self conscious</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit directly from the vendor and am very disapointed.</li>
            <li>but I would like to order a few more to see which one I like</li>
            <li>I searched for a light weight natural makeup for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I tried using soooo many different foundations/powders/BB/CC creams to find one that would correct all my problems, but instead I would look cakey/unnatural or dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not give a company such positive promotion if it wasn&#x27;t absolutely warranted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally insecure about how I look, but after 10 years of wearing sweats and very little make-up, I admit I was really stressing about how I was going to look to a room full of</li>
            <li>When you get a tan in the summer, just mix your foundations to be a bit darker to match your new skin color.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 days, I had a new machine.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate</li>
            <li>Tickled Pink doesn&#x27;t normally use Fed-Ex I might add, so a special trip was being made on my behalf.</li>
            <li>My forehead in particular is very red, dry and easily aggravated and no matter</li>
            <li>It might work for dry skin or a different climate, but not on combination skin in a warm climate.. and it does NOT last, which is the reason I even decided to splurge on an airbrush set..</li>
            <li>The compressor is small and the whole thing is easy to pack around with you.</li>
            <li>I had to use a regular blush because no matter how many drops I used, I could never see it.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive replacement makeup just like any other airbrush system.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I start covering my age spots first and the vein above my eye; I hold the airbrush a bit closer to my face to cover (about 2\\&quot; out).</li>
            <li>I have done 3 wedding makeups so far!</li>
            <li>and they fixed it immediately!</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals and was looking for something that looked a little more \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The hose between the base and airbruish is super long, which is awesome, as is the electrical cord.</li>
            <li>I find very few products that are better then stated.  </li>
            <li>I put it together easily (as the directions showed for me to do) and have been using it almost everyday since.  </li>
            <li>about fell over my very first time using Tickled Pink</li>
            <li>I also have a very prominent vein above one eyelid, but after a few sweeps with \\&quot;Frappacino\\&quot; (which mathces my skin tone to a tee), it simply vanishes.</li>
            <li>Learning curve is super short - second try</li>
            <li>I should have bought the Dinair set off of Ebay which is only a little more..</li>
            <li>Skin: I have medium skin tone and also use sunless tanners regularly on my face/neck to add a little more color, since you lose it quicker with washing/exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I ordered mine from Amazon due to my great experience with Amazon, the fact that I had a gift card and the Ticked Pink website literally gives me headaches --not due to structure, but due to the colors and fonts.  </li>
            <li>I bought this through the actual Tickled Pink website and got free shipping.</li>
            <li>Will need to go back to applying an oil absorbing lotion underneath the foundation to make this last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I bought directly from the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>This is far bettyer than my Luminess machine and for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Nothing beats this for application and the natural results you can obtain.  </li>
            <li>this is one of those times when expectations are far exceeded.  </li>
            <li>I went on Tickled Pink&#x27;s website just days before the big day to get lighter shades and the owner Kathy not only sent out the color I ordered but included another light shade as a wedding gift!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Makeup upon drying does not look natural.</li>
            <li>I bought directly from their website.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old woman who spent more than 40 years outdoors riding horses in all types of weather, dirt and grime, with absolutely no regard for skin care.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was talking with an old friend by the time we hung</li>
            <li>&quot; after they have paid $200 and explained that your product wasn&#x27;t as described even after having it applied by a professional make-up artist..........Is that quality and service?</li>
            <li>&quot; after they have paid $200 and explained that your product wasn&#x27;t as described even after having it applied by a professional make-up artist..........Is that quality and service?</li>
            <li>I purchased this product directly from the sellers website.</li>
            <li>Also am a redhead with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While it dries completely, I go ahead and do my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>You can control how thick you want to layer on the make-up (natural or more</li>
            <li>tend to have an oily T-zone, so because this make up is water based, I occasionally need to use blot papers or loose powder, but my makeup stays fresh looking all day!</li>
            <li>The two other colors that come with the medium kit were too yellow (Mocha) and too light (Latte) for me.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I have aging, dry skin PLUS rosacea.</li>
            <li>like any other makeup brand, not all products are worth the buy.</li>
            <li>No more powder face, it lasts all day and does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Even at the end of September we still have 100 degree temps here in Phoenix, so foundation never lasts long or it ends up looking dry and cakey no matter how much mosturizer I use first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken three trips with it -- the compressor isn&#x27;t much bigger than your fist and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>After some frustration, adjusting the machine, turning it off and on (patience is not one of my strong points), I used it a little on my inner forearm.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those who never reviews products, but I swear this product has improved my outlook on make up and boosted my confidence majorly!</li>
            <li>I actually purchased through their direct website, since it was a little cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and dealing with a small company who really care is very rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they decide if it gets posted or not, which would be a good reason for all positive reviews, after all, bad reviews don&#x27;t make money.</li>
            <li>When I first found Tickled Pink</li>
            <li>Not too dark or garish and the right tone for me.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and its easy to get carried away or spray too close and over do it.</li>
            <li>Perfect...this was the only one that was easy to handle and aquires very little of the airbrush makeup.....</li>
            <li>I always put my foundation on with this now, no other way.</li>
            <li>I am still dumb founded by the way this \\&quot;business owner\\&quot; was so blunt in not caring whether her products pleased customers or not.</li>
            <li>I initially was going to buy the Temptu system but being suspicious of any company that invests so much in advertising, I considered the high price and a couple not-so-stellar reviews then decided to look at other options.</li>
            <li>The only reason I held back one star for this particular machine was because even though I wash it out after every application sometimes the compressor spits makeup out at an inconsistant pressure.</li>
            <li>Somedays it works great, and other days (usually when I am running behind of course ;) )</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because with my skin being so oily, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of my old clinique</li>
            <li>I have worked with makeup all my life from the runway in my youth to today in my 50s as a professional in the technical area.  </li>
            <li>Now I use this in conjunction with bare minerals eye shadow applied via brush.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals every day</li>
            <li>I had been a Bare Mineral user for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will definitely purchase directly from them again.</li>
            <li>I went on You tube and found this video of  this pretty Asian woman  showing how to use the Tickled Pink Airbrush</li>
            <li>I purchased this item less than two months ago, i must have gotten a defected one because after reading all the the good reviews on Amazon my air brush machine was slowly deteriorating and finally burnt out while i was in the middle of using the product.</li>
            <li>I will never touch another make-up again as long as I live.</li>
            <li>The unit is small and cute with all the pink, and surprisingly quiet.</li>
            <li>I used to use only bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>First time I did it with a heavy hand because I wasn&#x27;t used to it and looked like a clown.</li>
            <li>The makeup has to dry, so using too much at once makes it take longer to dry.  </li>
            <li>Yes it finishes quickly because you have to use at least 10 drops of foundation for it</li>
            <li>Once it was barely sprinkling and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention until my husband told me I had to check the mirror because my face looked spotted with little white spots.</li>
            <li>On the first day that I tried it, a couple of my close friends asked me if I was doing something different with my skin because it had lost its glow and was looking dull and old.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is uneven overall with some red patches, acne scars here and there large pores along my nose and cheeks and darker circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My only advice to new owners is be very careful with the wand, the mechanics beneath are fragile and cannot handle being dropped or abused in any way.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this product and I will be ordering again (when I run out of makeup refills.)</li>
            <li> it does take some practice getting used to using the airbrush and getting your correct color, but once you do, the results are awesome.</li>
            <li> I found that holding the wand about 8\\&quot;s from my face is best with a sweeping motion.  </li>
            <li> Best product I have in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> The results are the best I have ever seen in my makeup.  </li>

            <li> I mix the frapuccino and Latte color together, 9 drops of each to make a perfect match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The frapuccino will be perfect in the summer when I have a tan.  </li>
            <li> so I got in touch with the owners and they bent over backwards to create me the perfect color.  </li>

            <li> My skin is one, beautiful, even color -</li>
            <li> but once I did today I have to say that I am extremely happy with the way it looks.</li>
            <li> Product is great and great price too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blush that it came with was great for my skin tone color</li>
            <li> They are both great.  </li>
            <li> The results of  doing this were that the makeup itself did not look so great.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look great on me.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this airbrush system.  </li>
            <li> I KNOW WHY NOW, THIS IS A GREAT SYSTEM AND GREAT COMPANY.</li>
            <li> Makeup is great.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review about this amazing product because as a consumer, I am impressed.</li>

            <li> AMAZING!..</li>
            <li> MY MAKEUP LOOKS FLAWLESS :-)</li>
            <li> Besides the product burning out the machine was very good and the makeup coverage was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think it took me 2-3 minutes to apply the foundation, another 2 minutes to rinse really good</li>
            <li> Today though I got a really nice and even coat of foundation that looked great</li>
            <li> It is light weight and perfect every time!!  </li>
            <li> It looks great, I&#x27;ve had tons of people telling me my makeup looks nice.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to learn that the problem was, well, me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead, I picked up a Belloccio blush (here on Amazon) in Charming Lily.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 2 or 3 times to get good at it</li>
            <li> I LOVED THEIR TANNING SOLUTION</li>
            <li> Go to Ulta instead and get their cosmetics professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow!</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t even spend $66.s professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s IT - good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If I didn&#x27;t move my face, it did look good</li>

            <li> I am happy with the compressor, it works great and is very reasonably priced but the makeup that comes with it, is not so great.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li> Unless you have lovely porcelain skin or beautiful darker skin, most of us are medium beiges.  </li>
            <li> The quality, the way it covers is absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li> I was impressed with her sincerity and customer service before even receiving the product - really, who does that these days?</li>
            <li> I have not tried the sealer at all yet, honestly.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of blotting to make it nice and even looking.  </li>
            <li> a truly awesome company that really cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> but if I smiled, their were lines all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she was very nice and offered to replace the product free of charge and without a receipt.</li>
            <li> ITS GREAT TOO, 100% AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>

            <li> So glad I bought it</li>
            <li> played around with the different types of foundation until I found the one that was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies if you&#x27;re looking for an Airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, get this one.</li>
            <li> LOVE the moisturizer and waterproof setting spray too.  </li>
            <li> If I was too close to my face wrinkles were more noticable.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients have even proved me with a more even skin tone for those days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> and I was sure the machine was a dud.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t see any safe colors for me without trying out a sample.</li>

            <li> Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE AIRBRUSH</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> Love Love Love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> These blushes go on so nice and so smooth.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> What more could I want?</li>
            <li> You basically need to buy two and mix them to get a perfect color, especially once you start getting a tan in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and lasts the whole day</li>
            <li> So if you get a drop of water on your face, you will be able to see where the makeup came off.  </li>
            <li> Most people have guessed I am in my 40&#x27;s - HURRAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:  </li>
            <li> The makeup itself stays on better than ANY makeup I&#x27;ve ever used before</li>
            <li> Have you washed it?\\&quot; and, my favorite,</li>
            <li> I knew if I felt confident about how I looked, I&#x27;d do a better job presenting.</li>
            <li> Kathy took the time to help me figure out the best solution for me personally.</li>
            <li> truly cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!</li>
            <li> I just wish I would have found this sooner :)</li>
            <li> But love how it feels going on your face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better, feels better, is better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.....</li>
            <li> You better hope you like the system and the make up as well because you will be stuck with it.</li>
            <li> If you had so many returns that your business went under, wouldn&#x27;t that tell you something as a business owner?  </li>
            <li> i love this makeup system.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> No break outs whatsoever! :)</li>
            <li> It came with three different skin tone colors that I can use one at a time or mix together to get a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> Challenging.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this..</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND ITS OK..</li>
            <li> INSTEAD YOU&#x27;RE BETTER OFF WITH THAT..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to find a brand that won&#x27;t rub off with a better moisturizer under it.  </li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments from friends and family about how my skin looks so flawless and what am i doing differently..</li>
            <li> I love it 😍😗😊</li>
            <li> Very easy to work with and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to do and I loved the feel of it.</li>
            <li> nice clean finish.</li>
            <li> I really thought it sounded too good to be true!!  </li>
            <li> it goes on perfectly smooth, lasts all day and it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The makeup has a flawless finish and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Porcelain matches my fair skin exactly.</li>
            <li> This one is a nice little unit, uncomplicated with the best price I have seen on one of these.</li>
            <li> I would love this product if it was available in a more olive shade</li>
            <li> I was preparing to give my very first major sales presentation, and wanted to look my best.</li>
            <li> Aside from this being an exceptional price I just have to comment on the stellar customer service I have received from the owners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shortly after using the Tickled Pink Airbrush system and makeup, imagine my surprise when a fellow actor referred to me as &amp;#34;the woman with the perfect skin.&amp;#34;  ME?  </li>
            <li> So I would def recommend going ahead and buying more moisturizer with your 1st purchase to save on shipping costs (free over $50).</li>
            <li> After months of searching for the best airbrush kit I came acrossed a company called Tickled Pink.</li>
            <li> From Day One, the owners of Tickled Pink were delightfully helpful with any of my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have gotten a lot more products &amp; free skin color match with makeup I can use.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, was delivered quickly and has GREAT customer</li>
            <li> I would keep it put away when not in use and make sure you clean it out thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I had a lot of fun mixing the different shades of foundation to find the perfect match.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can already tell you that their customer service is excellent, very polite,  professional and helpful)</li>
            <li> I can already tell you that their customer service is excellent, very polite,  professional and helpful)</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> UP WOULD SMUDGE REALLY EASY.</li>
            <li> Strong spraying capacity.  </li>
            <li> While I found this airbrush machine to work wonderfully, imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same one on Ebay withOUT</li>
            <li> Which is fine.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and it makes my skin feel so nice and soft</li>
            <li> The machine works great and is easy to use, however the makeup itself is gross.</li>
            <li> takes a little practice to get it looking perfect and not cake-y.  </li>
            <li> and i found it so easy and so much fun!</li>
            <li> I was able to splurge on this for myself and although the cost seems high you will not regret it because you get a flawless look that everyone will compliment you on and in the long run you will save money on foundation.  </li>
            <li> They also have a huge selection of airbrush makeup as well.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of airbrushing my makeup on now.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put cheap makeup, or makeup that isn&#x27;t water based in the machine or it will ruin it.  </li>
            <li> The seller has been fabulous to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so light</li>
            <li> You also must figure out by trial and error how to apply with a light hand...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply, clean and store.</li>
            <li> no blotchiness, no age spots - just smooth,</li>
            <li> it’s great that you can mix up the different colors to match your skin tone as the seasons change.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> When I called to say the foundation was too light, I was told it was just to practice with</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna love it as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> BUT IT FADES AWAY NATURALLY NO BLOTCHY SPOTS AND ITS A BEAUTIFUL TAN NO ORANGE</li>
            <li> The enthusiastic husband and wife owners who initially went out of their way to send samples stopped replying to my texts or phone calls when I returned the machine at my own cost and on their request for replacement.</li>
            <li> I have always loved playing around with makeup, but i am by far no Makeup Artist, but when i got my machine, i started practicing on my sister and friends</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few applications, I can now apply my foundation and blush in about 10 minutes, including the Flawless Finish application and the time to clean the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> abut applying it myself, but its super easy.  </li>
            <li> The make up goes on so easily and quickly</li>
            <li> I think if the owners managed to reduce the cost of the products than this would be the ultimate airbrush system to own!</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try</li>
            <li> great machine, will be using it for a long time, until I need another.</li>
            <li> I am starting to think that all of those 5-star reviews are not legitimate as the more recent reviews are not so good!!</li>
            <li> but I did just order the airbrush blush because it&#x27;s so fast and easy)!</li>
            <li> fee\\&quot; if they decide you didn&#x27;t clean it</li>
            <li> I ordered my Tickled Pink kit about a month ago, after an exhaustive search for a reasonably priced airbrush system - and my skin has never looked this beautiful - ever!</li>
            <li> The airbrush wand seems well made (even my husband agreed it was good quality) and looks so cute with the pink handle and \\&quot;Tickled Pink\\&quot; engraving.</li>
            <li> AND I SAW THAT THIS SYSTEM HAD THE MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that so far I am 100% pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love the actual airbrush machine, very easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I tried airbrush make up for my wedding and decided that I wanted something I could use at home for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> that I just read and they are all so true.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t pour too much makeup in the top, the cleaning is effortless.   </li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li> I recently started acting and now realize how important it is to look your very best.  </li>
            <li> This is the one system that really does what it says it will do - you will love your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the deluxe kit directly from the sellers via phone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like, you email the \\&quot;company\\&quot; which is really Kathy and her husband</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend $200 on the kit, setting spray and another full sized bottle of foundation to look at it sit on my vanity.</li>
            <li> and her husband truely care about their product and their customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought my makeup looked good - this product takes it to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> (at my age the natural bright light helps me see more clearly than most bathroom lights), so the long cords make that easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to experiment a bit but quickly found that 12 drops of biege and 4 drops of tan work for me.  </li>
            <li> I EMAILED THE COMPANY PERSONALLY AND RECEIVED EMAILS THE VERY NEXT DAY, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> I used all of the .5oz make up quickly</li>
            <li> Like I told Kathy, they should have taken that barrowed money and put it towards making a better quality product instead of making more quantity and not refunding all the unsatisfied customers their money back, but like Kathy said, \\&quot;we&#x27;re a business</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I turn it to high, fill the cup on the airbrish with tap water and cover the spray end with my finger to make \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; in the cup, then refill it with more water and spray it trhough.</li>
            <li> She was wonderful and spent a ton of time on the phone with me, explaining that the newer line of aloe-based foundations would probably work best since I live in such a dry climate.</li>
            <li> special occasions I lightly dust Bare Minerals on my cheeks to create even more glamour, and use a darker blush under my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Some of the other ones tell you they have good stuff in them, but do not actually tell you what this good stuff is as TickledPink does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really is a great product and less money</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li> It goes on feeling really cool and fresh, and I make sure to use it near (and over) my eyebrows and nose, which for some reason are the areas that normally flake the most on me, and along my jawline and neck, too.</li>
            <li> An ounce will last a long time, but i like to get a variety of colors so that you can blend and make the perfect shade.</li>
            <li> but this foundation is very lightweight!!...</li>
            <li> QUIET, QUICK &amp; HANDY</li>
            <li> i have thrown away all my old makeup and replaced it with this unit, which is super cute looking.</li>
            <li> But i did think it was very generous of them to throw in a free moisturizer/gift.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, you don&#x27;t really need any instructions for &#x27;assembly&#x27;, but detailed instructions are on their website.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that the refill is a larger bottle but not by too much.</li>
            <li> They also gave me a free sample of their moisturizer which is used in the same way the makeup is used in and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> The airbrush gives you 3 speeds to choose from and it only took me two practice tries to perfect applying it.</li>
            <li> I tell every one about it and how much it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> SO worth it,  </li>
            <li> After trying every kind of makeup to try to cover my scars , hundreds of dollars later.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this system and make-up, and the results are better than I expected.</li>
            <li> He decided on this system because it had a lot of very positive reviews</li>
            <li> My kit arrived today, a day early, and I was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> That was quickly overcome though the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> just right :</li>
            <li> just right with any of these types of machines.  </li>
            <li> I ordered right from their site.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I was right on.  </li>
            <li> She asked me if I had been applying it right and asked if I had been trying it out.</li>
            <li> She was certainly right about that.</li>
            <li> once you get started you will wish you had not waited so long and the customer service that I have received at Tickled Pink is outstanding!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I came across tickled pinks machine which I felt was reasonably priced and finally took the plunge, and SO glad that I did!</li>
            <li> &amp; I would have to buy the next darker shade ($26 more w/shipping) &amp; hope it&#x27;s the right color.</li>
            <li> Also, if you order directly from their website the unit ships for free.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t quite  sure how to actually  use it because I never used an airbrush product before.</li>
            <li> GIVES A PRETTY COLOR IN YOUR FACE AND MAKES YOUR FACE SOFTER THAN IT</li>
            <li> As for coverage, it covers pretty well.</li>
            <li> { This is my first time trying any type of airbrush makeup</li>
            <li> once I was able to actually TRY it, I was sold!  </li>
            <li> I love it overall</li>
            <li> , so light and soft of a look..</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price for the make up</li>
            <li> I can finally feel better about myself again.</li>
            <li> I do, though, sometimes use the Latte under my eyes first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be going back under again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be posting my own tickled pink RANT review soon, along with how the dinair airbrush system works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be posting my own tickled pink RANT review soon, along with how the dinair airbrush system works.</li>
            <li> First of all....</li>
            <li> But honestly, Tickled Pink is everything I need.</li>
            <li> Make up looks so light and natural.</li>
            <li> plugged it in and had NO problem at all on using it for the first time..</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the shade right, but now when I wear it, my skin looks flawless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and just recently re-entered the workforce (after tens years as a stay-at-home mom), and I was about to get on a plane to fly across the country to meet with a potential new client in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I was leery of buying an airbrush system because of the complication with cleanup, but Tickled Pink is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you look on their website all the reviews are positive but if you look closely you can see where you have to email the \\&quot;company\\</li>
            <li> i usually dont take the time to write a reveiw but with this product i decided to because it is that good.</li>
            <li> have not only found fun and healthy new make-up but a new friend.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores and felt like it accentuated every pore on my face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how to post a photo, but if you&#x27;ll look me up as Roz Van Meter, you&#x27;ll see how I look as a Woman of a Certain Age.</li>
            <li> - I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply, and I am STILL amazed at how well it covers up every red blotch and age spot every time I use it.</li>
            <li> All of this is packaged in a nice little travel bag with instructions for assembly, which is basically showing you where to connect the tubing.</li>
            <li> I was very discouraged about wearing makeup</li>
            <li> I have to say that while I was learning how to apply the makeup, and I used to much</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin looked shiny in areas that I had too much makeup on</li>
            <li> Covers really well and is super-easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got the light foundation set with my kit and also purchased the blue brown eye shadow and the desert mauve blush.  </li>
            <li> so I would not have too much of an adjustment, if any, to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 12 and 4 drops was way too much makeup for me, but I just sprayed until it was gone.</li>
            <li> 4 drops was too much.  </li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable if you have shopped around as I have.  </li>
            <li> I travel for business and really want to take this along.</li>
            <li> The makeup is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin look</li>
            <li> , I have problems with my skin tone being even and the airbrush really works.</li>
            <li> It is economical and looks entirely professional when finished.</li>
            <li> I also highly reccomend not to just buy a foundation...get a blush too!</li>
            <li> The rep was always there to answer my questions and very helpful.</li>
            <li> It really covers all my flaws , thank you so much for making this product .</li>
            <li> and I really like it,</li>
            <li> asking if I could get a system FAST, she agreed to overnight it out to me on Monday via Fed-Ex.</li>
            <li> so I can really see every imperfection on my skin</li>
            <li> and so I can really see TP cover everything.</li>
            <li> I really just ad one misty layer over another until everything is covered on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my brows or hairline or ever get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I truly feel like it corrects ALL of my skin issues and really does leave you with a polished airbrush look.</li>
            <li> Doesnt take up that much space.</li>
            <li> I love the way my makeup looks after using the  Tickled Pink Airbrush.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> One more thing if you Google tickled pink airbrush</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how light this is, but you get the same coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> My makeup kit came with everything wrapped and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to go faster than ever</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about Kathy or Tinckled Pink -you</li>
            <li> I worked in customer service for several years and know that you never treat a customer poorly, especially when its your own business.</li>
            <li> , I pack it back in the original box</li>
            <li> I Love the Tickled Pink airbrush kit!  </li>
            <li> Since using this system, I have consistently gotten better and younger acting parts.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to try new colors!  </li>
            <li> The makeup has completely dried, and even though I used more than I should have without letting the makeup dry before applying more, it is perfection.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a whole lot about them, but I had an amazon gift card and started reading the reviews on this particular one.  </li>
            <li> , then do several drops of latte to hit my spots of imperfection with a more concentrated and closer flow, then just go generally all over and on my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting my money back ($200) for a product that didn&#x27;t work as described but apparently Kathy needs the money more than  clientele.</li>
            <li> will be ordering the new make-up and facial serum as soon as it is available this week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw that Tickled Pink&#x27;s set was almost half the price of Temptu&#x27;s and the reviews were great, so why not, I took a chance never having operated an airbrush system or worn the make-up.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry, I then brush on some powdered blush, which goes on fine over the foundation (</li>
            <li> just looks so pretty and so natural like a glow on your cheeks once you learn how to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Yes, in acting it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> You can layer too if you want even more coverage for dark spots or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I finish off by making sure I spray my jawline down to my neck.</li>
            <li> The great thing is, when I wash my face in the evening, there is hardly any make up on the wash cloth compared to when I used regular liquid make up.  </li>
            <li> How often do you get to speak to a live person on the phone, let alone someone who actually wants to hear your story?</li>
            <li> even awesomeness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the makeup would \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my hair and clothes, so the first time I tried it I sat in my undies and had my hair tied back, but the mist is so fine on the low setting it never gets on anything (except where you&#x27;re pointing).</li>
            <li> I am lucky that the porcelain actually matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> This is worth the money, but be sure to spray from at least 5 inches from face for even application.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, and only took me a couple tries to feel proficient.</li>
            <li> The sample foundations should last longer since it’s a larger bottle, but in reality you use more than just 2-3 drops that some places may say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel,and love the amount of time it has decreased my morning routine!</li>
            <li> It was quick and simple.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> bought this airbrush kit with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this product bc</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little bit of a skeptic when I read the reviews for other airbrush systems, but I got this one because the reviews were pretty good</li>
            <li> one\\&quot;... I was, however, willing to pay even hundreds more for any other system because I needed one shipped out to me in a day, and I couldn&#x27;t find one locally in any store here in Phoenix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gone with Dinair kit, for a little more $</li>
            <li> \\&quot;no offense, but your skin looks kind of dull.</li>
            <li> The better you look, the better parts you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mineral powder I was using made me look older - every flaw, no matter how big or small, was magnified, especially on camera.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My technique: gently spray 5-6 inches from your face in a soft circular motion.</li>
            <li> I went to the Tickled Pink website for the detailed instructions as the notice in the package instructed me.  </li>
            <li> the Tickled Pink logo stuck on it for $99 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> that really made me self conscious</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit directly from the vendor and am very disapointed.</li>
            <li> but I would like to order a few more to see which one I like</li>
            <li> I searched for a light weight natural makeup for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I tried using soooo many different foundations/powders/BB/CC creams to find one that would correct all my problems, but instead I would look cakey/unnatural or dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not give a company such positive promotion if it wasn&#x27;t absolutely warranted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally insecure about how I look, but after 10 years of wearing sweats and very little make-up, I admit I was really stressing about how I was going to look to a room full of</li>
            <li> When you get a tan in the summer, just mix your foundations to be a bit darker to match your new skin color.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 days, I had a new machine.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate</li>
            <li> Tickled Pink doesn&#x27;t normally use Fed-Ex I might add, so a special trip was being made on my behalf.</li>
            <li> My forehead in particular is very red, dry and easily aggravated and no matter</li>
            <li> It might work for dry skin or a different climate, but not on combination skin in a warm climate.. and it does NOT last, which is the reason I even decided to splurge on an airbrush set..</li>
            <li> The compressor is small and the whole thing is easy to pack around with you.</li>
            <li> I had to use a regular blush because no matter how many drops I used, I could never see it.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive replacement makeup just like any other airbrush system.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I start covering my age spots first and the vein above my eye; I hold the airbrush a bit closer to my face to cover (about 2\\&quot; out).</li>
            <li> I have done 3 wedding makeups so far!</li>
            <li> and they fixed it immediately!</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and was looking for something that looked a little more \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The hose between the base and airbruish is super long, which is awesome, as is the electrical cord.</li>
            <li> I find very few products that are better then stated.  </li>
            <li> I put it together easily (as the directions showed for me to do) and have been using it almost everyday since.  </li>
            <li> about fell over my very first time using Tickled Pink</li>
            <li> I also have a very prominent vein above one eyelid, but after a few sweeps with \\&quot;Frappacino\\&quot; (which mathces my skin tone to a tee), it simply vanishes.</li>
            <li> Learning curve is super short - second try</li>
            <li> I should have bought the Dinair set off of Ebay which is only a little more..</li>
            <li> Skin: I have medium skin tone and also use sunless tanners regularly on my face/neck to add a little more color, since you lose it quicker with washing/exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from Amazon due to my great experience with Amazon, the fact that I had a gift card and the Ticked Pink website literally gives me headaches --not due to structure, but due to the colors and fonts.  </li>
            <li> I bought this through the actual Tickled Pink website and got free shipping.</li>
            <li> Will need to go back to applying an oil absorbing lotion underneath the foundation to make this last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I bought directly from the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> This is far bettyer than my Luminess machine and for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Nothing beats this for application and the natural results you can obtain.  </li>
            <li> this is one of those times when expectations are far exceeded.  </li>
            <li> I went on Tickled Pink&#x27;s website just days before the big day to get lighter shades and the owner Kathy not only sent out the color I ordered but included another light shade as a wedding gift!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Makeup upon drying does not look natural.</li>
            <li> I bought directly from their website.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old woman who spent more than 40 years outdoors riding horses in all types of weather, dirt and grime, with absolutely no regard for skin care.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was talking with an old friend by the time we hung</li>
            <li> &quot; after they have paid $200 and explained that your product wasn&#x27;t as described even after having it applied by a professional make-up artist..........Is that quality and service?</li>
            <li> &quot; after they have paid $200 and explained that your product wasn&#x27;t as described even after having it applied by a professional make-up artist..........Is that quality and service?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly from the sellers website.</li>
            <li> Also am a redhead with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While it dries completely, I go ahead and do my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> You can control how thick you want to layer on the make-up (natural or more</li>
            <li> tend to have an oily T-zone, so because this make up is water based, I occasionally need to use blot papers or loose powder, but my makeup stays fresh looking all day!</li>
            <li> The two other colors that come with the medium kit were too yellow (Mocha) and too light (Latte) for me.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have aging, dry skin PLUS rosacea.</li>
            <li> like any other makeup brand, not all products are worth the buy.</li>
            <li> No more powder face, it lasts all day and does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of September we still have 100 degree temps here in Phoenix, so foundation never lasts long or it ends up looking dry and cakey no matter how much mosturizer I use first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken three trips with it -- the compressor isn&#x27;t much bigger than your fist and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> After some frustration, adjusting the machine, turning it off and on (patience is not one of my strong points), I used it a little on my inner forearm.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those who never reviews products, but I swear this product has improved my outlook on make up and boosted my confidence majorly!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased through their direct website, since it was a little cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and dealing with a small company who really care is very rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they decide if it gets posted or not, which would be a good reason for all positive reviews, after all, bad reviews don&#x27;t make money.</li>
            <li> When I first found Tickled Pink</li>
            <li> Not too dark or garish and the right tone for me.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and its easy to get carried away or spray too close and over do it.</li>
            <li> Perfect...this was the only one that was easy to handle and aquires very little of the airbrush makeup.....</li>
            <li> I always put my foundation on with this now, no other way.</li>
            <li> I am still dumb founded by the way this \\&quot;business owner\\&quot; was so blunt in not caring whether her products pleased customers or not.</li>
            <li> I initially was going to buy the Temptu system but being suspicious of any company that invests so much in advertising, I considered the high price and a couple not-so-stellar reviews then decided to look at other options.</li>
            <li> The only reason I held back one star for this particular machine was because even though I wash it out after every application sometimes the compressor spits makeup out at an inconsistant pressure.</li>
            <li> Somedays it works great, and other days (usually when I am running behind of course ;) )</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because with my skin being so oily, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of my old clinique</li>
            <li> I have worked with makeup all my life from the runway in my youth to today in my 50s as a professional in the technical area.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this in conjunction with bare minerals eye shadow applied via brush.  </li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals every day</li>
            <li> I had been a Bare Mineral user for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will definitely purchase directly from them again.</li>
            <li> I went on You tube and found this video of  this pretty Asian woman  showing how to use the Tickled Pink Airbrush</li>
            <li> I purchased this item less than two months ago, i must have gotten a defected one because after reading all the the good reviews on Amazon my air brush machine was slowly deteriorating and finally burnt out while i was in the middle of using the product.</li>
            <li> I will never touch another make-up again as long as I live.</li>
            <li> The unit is small and cute with all the pink, and surprisingly quiet.</li>
            <li> I used to use only bare minerals.  </li>
            <li> First time I did it with a heavy hand because I wasn&#x27;t used to it and looked like a clown.</li>
            <li> The makeup has to dry, so using too much at once makes it take longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> Yes it finishes quickly because you have to use at least 10 drops of foundation for it</li>
            <li> Once it was barely sprinkling and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention until my husband told me I had to check the mirror because my face looked spotted with little white spots.</li>
            <li> On the first day that I tried it, a couple of my close friends asked me if I was doing something different with my skin because it had lost its glow and was looking dull and old.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is uneven overall with some red patches, acne scars here and there large pores along my nose and cheeks and darker circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My only advice to new owners is be very careful with the wand, the mechanics beneath are fragile and cannot handle being dropped or abused in any way.</li>
            <li> Kathy and I spoke for a long time on the phone about her business, my new job and upcoming trip, and of course, about Tickled Pink products.</li>
            <li> I use the moisturizer first and let it dry a few seconds</li>
            <li> I had to switch to all natural products due to health reasons.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I tried using the Tickled Pink Airbrush system, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The machine is small, so it does not take up much space.  </li>
            <li> I also was experiencing dryness and flaking on my forehead and chin (no matter how much moisturizer I would slather on and even after heavy exfoliation!)</li>
            <li> Like with any new tool, it takes a few times to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Start to finish takes maybe 3 minutes, allowing areas to dry before going back over it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not particular on a specific brand, I just wanted an airbrush system to try.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me the Tickled Pink airbrush kit for my birthday last week.</li>
            <li> UP STAY LONG...</li>
            <li> The air hose is long, giving you a lot of room for movement.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to realize this had to go.</li>
            <li> &quot; Excuse me?</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for the last 2 weeks, with primer, without primer, with tickled pink moisturizer, without moisturizer, with setting spray, and without setting spray, you get the picture.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that there is only 1 Tickled Pink Airbrush video on there.......</li>
            <li> There is a reason that there is only 1 Tickled Pink Airbrush video on there.......</li>
            <li> the make up may seem pricey, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Tell me where you will ever get personal attention with any other make-up company in the world...</li>
            <li> yet I did not want to stop using makeup because I wanted to even out the red, blotchy, dry skin due to the rosacea.</li>
            <li> Yes I let it dry</li>
            <li> You can buy a mini-compressor &amp; airbrush on Amazon for $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the moisturizer isn&#x27;t for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This has also helped clear the small amount of acne</li>
            <li> Not sure if it’s the moisturizer, the natural ingredients of the foundation, or both</li>
            <li> i had a small issue with my purchase, but my their email response was immediate, and they fixed the problem to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> First i put on a thin film of drugstore serum, then start to airbrush.</li>
            <li> I have to sit and mess with it to get it working properly agian.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to stare at for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes only a little practice and finesse to master this thing.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars though because the makeup can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li> And if I put on too much, my skin starts to flake, so getting an even skin tone is tough to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt like this makeup attracted more moisture (in a bad way).</li>
            <li> I bought this according to all the great reviews, but did NOT realize their horrible return policy.  </li>
            <li> I applied the makeup in the morning and with the bathroom door closed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M TICKLED PINK</li>
            <li> Tickled Pink Airbrush make up it&#x27;ll leave you looking natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the unit from the Tickled Pink web site.</li>
            <li> After a month of using the Tickled Pink makeup, I found that my complexion improved.  </li>
            <li> I have because Tickled Pink makeup doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.  </li>
            <li> It was $9.50 plus shipping and still way cheaper than the Tickled Pink.</li>
            <li> Check the Tinkled Pink and Belloccio websites to see if there is something to replace your bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never worn liquid foundation because it&#x27;s always felt too heavy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go 1 day without my tickled pink airbrush. .</li>
            <li> Pay extra and buy through amazon so that when you run into trouble, they cannot maltreat you.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of comparison shopping before purchasing the Tickled Pink Airbrush.</li>
            <li> , I spent $66</li>
            <li> I started looking online and reading reviews about Tickled Pink Airbrush</li>
            <li> Tickled Pink foundations are about $18 for an ounce, but sometimes they run specials</li>
            <li> I tried another airbrush and it was twice the price and did not work as well as Tickled Pink.</li>
            <li> Ladies, do yourselves and your skin a favor - purchase the Tickled Pink kit.  </li>
            <li> and no I didn&#x27;t apply layer after wet layer</li>
            <li> this is what popsup:&lt;br /&gt;Tickled Pink Airbrush</li>
            <li> Tickled Pink Airbrush</li>
            <li> I spent $140 for an airbrush/mini-compresser made in China.</li>
            <li> The reason I am only giving it 4 stars is not due to performance but rather that the makeup refills are quite expensive and I think the foundation that comes with the kit will not last me longer than a month.</li>
            <li> Also, since the unit does not come with a case, there is no place to put the little wrench and plastic eyedropper, and the cord that is so long -- it just drapes on the counter.  </li>
            <li> then the other systems I have seen.</li>
            <li> I put it together with just a small bit of hoopla: The air hose came with a white plastic piece on it</li>
            <li> then the other guys.</li>
            <li> It is quicker and easier than any other make-up I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have drawers of other make-ups</li>
            <li> They are going in the garbage tomorrow to make space for other things.</li>
            <li> This unit is compact and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and we talked like we had known each other all our lives.</li>
            <li> Other than that as with any of these machines there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Tickled Pink call me after receiving my email (on a weekend!)</li>
            <li> They  are going to be pretty expensive everywhere</li>
            <li> Was cheaper then the other brands and works just as well.</li>
            <li> but I want something that won&#x27;t run down my face if it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> I knew I wanted an airbrush system, and after reading the reviews on about half a dozen machines, I soon realized Tickled Pink was \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> There was no reason for Kathy, the owner of Tickled Pink to be so rude and have such an attitude when I tried to return the products.</li>
            <li> I depress the button a little over half way down.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was at first a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and the shades were too dark.  </li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t expect this to not work on my body for stretch marks or to at least cover it alittle ..</li>
            <li> Hold back a few inches and keep the airbrush making small circles</li>
            <li> At least once a week I pour alcohol in the well and spray it through for extra cleaning and this works well.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is with the foundation.</li>
            <li> NOT FUN</li>
            <li> I just purchased my Tickled Pink airbrush system a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like a celeb everyday after I use Tickled Pink to do my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got it down</li>
            <li> Literally if you shed ONE tear or were out in the rain at all it will run down your face.</li>
            <li> My momma made her little redhead stay out of the sun, and Tickled Pink has done the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The make up doesnt show all those little lines like my other make-up did..</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and tossed all my other make up.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try an airbrush system hoping it would be less aggressive on my skin since there would be no brush rubbing the makeup on</li>
            <li> OR LESS TO COVER.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean up literally takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> not super tan</li>
            <li> makeup routine now takes less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> You use less makeup on your face &amp; it looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> Beige shade dried as a dark brown mask on my face with well-demarcated jaw lines</li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that approximately 3-6 drops will cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> and it also felt sticky a little which I did not like.</li>
            <li> My forehead was a little itchy a couple of times</li>
            <li> and I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t cover that</li>
            <li> I was a little uncoordinated with the machine, but it did not matter at all.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to figure out your color shade...</li>
            <li> While that&#x27;s drying, I apply eyeliner and mascara and a little eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li> Imagine: just pack the compressor with stylus, a little bottle of makeup, some blush, and a couple of eye pencils.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty expensive \\&quot;play\\&quot; makeup!</li>
            <li> All of the all natural makeup was either oily or heavy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it for a few years but</li>
            <li> She also told me that when they started this company a few years ago they did let customers return the products if they were unsatisfied but that caused them to go under</li>
            <li> ( ordered the dinair system today, should have it in a few days.</li>
            <li> ( ordered the dinair system today, should have it in a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I wasted a lot of money on something that was over-hyped here on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the airbrush technique or silicone-based make-up that is to credit</li>
            <li> I USE IT ALMOST EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> The money you will save on makeup is unbelievable..</li>
            <li> So upset I just wasted my money!  </li>
            <li> Still using it just not sure how to make it look even.  </li>
            <li> (If you are a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman and not sure if this is for you - I&#x27;m 59.)</li>
            <li> small and compact.  </li>
            <li> After a week I had it nailed, no more breakouts and loads of compliments.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever leave reviews, but I had to for this one</li>
            <li> knew I wanted some blush, and the Tickled Pink makeup is just so expensive.</li>
            <li> Everyone complimented the bride, me and my other daughter about how well our makeup looked!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is not as expensive as other airbrush machines</li>
            <li> I also have 4 sisters who are very anxious to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not fair either.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would definitely recommend purchasing this airbrush kit, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of doing airbrush makeup you will never return to regular foundation (dirty sponges, streaky lines, cleaning brushes...and let&#x27;s not forget the cost!)  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read the negative reviews before purchasing!</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews on their website I decided to go with this company and this has been the worst product and \\&quot;company\\</li>
            <li> And I have NO MORE DRYNESS!!</li>
            <li> It seems like once you find your color match, it would be hard to go wrong</li>
            <li> , whatever touches your face will leave a print behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to pay out of pocket again and send this crap back to Kathy</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING I HATE ABOUT</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t mad just a little upset, so i gave the company a call and to my benefit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, DO NOT!</li>
            <li> but it was very difficult to the makeup out of the little bottles.</li>
            <li> Not good on a rainy day!  </li>
            <li> This company has been in business for a few years an not one person has wrote a bad review?</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive</li>
            <li> is plastered on their faces (sorry ladies-but come on now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Liquid makeup too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Belloccio makes an airbrush kit for professionals so they aren&#x27;t some random company pushing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You  absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. .</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I find the shipping to be outrageous, $9 for a that tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> , I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Anyone can tell you how expensive airbrush foundations are.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> A RIP-OFF!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still hesitant telling everyone what I&#x27;m doing differently, selfish..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad that this didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> After my daughter was born my skin went crazy and I now have rosacea.</li>
            <li> We called a few places and it was going to cost an outrageous amount of money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mad until I called the company and spoke with Kathy, who was yawning on the phone as I was explaining to her the problems I have been having with the products.</li>
            <li> Still after all this I wasn&#x27;t mad, just disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY ANYTHING YET.</li>
            <li> The application seems to be somewhat idiot proof.</li>
            <li> I have tried and hate.</li>
            <li> Now it makes sense to me as to why there wasn&#x27;t one bad review!</li>
            <li> will NOT bne disappointed with this system!</li>
            <li> If being out of money and out of the product is one of your worst nightmares, I would suggest BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the airbrush machine, but the makeup itself was horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part is if any water at all touches your face the foundation spots and runs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After my daughter was born my skin went crazy and I now have rosacea. My forehead in particular is very red, dry and easily aggravated and no matter what kind of makeup I used (I tried liquids, powders, mineral makeup, tinted moisturizers) it always looked flaky. At times also the skin on my forehead would become aggravated and itch. I was very discouraged about wearing makeup yet I did not want to stop using makeup because I wanted to even out the red, blotchy, dry skin due to the rosacea. I decided to try an airbrush system hoping it would be less aggressive on my skin since there would be no brush rubbing the makeup on and I could hopefully get a lighter coat of makeup and reduce the aggravation. I was not particular on a specific brand, I just wanted an airbrush system to try. My husband bought me the Tickled Pink airbrush kit for my birthday last week. He decided on this system because it had a lot of very positive reviews and I have to add another one. It took me 3-4 times to learn how to apply the makeup to get the coverage and the look that I wanted but once I did today I have to say that I am extremely happy with the way it looks. The unit is small and cute with all the pink, and surprisingly quiet. I applied the makeup in the morning and with the bathroom door closed my husband did not even hear it running. It has 3 speeds, low/medium/high and I personally like using it on low. I am lucky that the porcelain actually matches my skin tone so I do not need to mix the colors to match. I think it took me 2-3 minutes to apply the foundation, another 2 minutes to rinse really good and I was done. I have to say that while I was learning how to apply the makeup, and I used to much I noticed that my skin looked shiny in areas that I had too much makeup on and it also felt sticky a little which I did not like. Today though I got a really nice and even coat of foundation that looked great and it lasted from 7am until almost midnight without any touch ups or aggravation. My forehead was a little itchy a couple of times but I just ignored it and the feeling passed. All in all I would definitely recommend purchasing this airbrush kit, you will not be disappointed. The reason I am only giving it 4 stars is not due to performance but rather that the makeup refills are quite expensive and I think the foundation that comes with the kit will not last me longer than a month. The good news is that the refill is a larger bottle but not by too much. Also, if you order directly from their website the unit ships for free. I think if the owners managed to reduce the cost of the products than this would be the ultimate airbrush system to own!</li>
            <li> The first few times I tried using the Tickled Pink Airbrush system, I didn&#x27;t like it. I have oily skin and large pores and felt like it accentuated every pore on my face. After viewing some videos online about technique, I realized I was holding the wand to close to my face. Now I get what all the fuss is about. I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with it as it really does give a flawless finish when applied correctly. Practice makes perfect with this system. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because with my skin being so oily, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of my old clinique make up designed for oily skin. Will need to go back to applying an oil absorbing lotion underneath the foundation to make this last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I would not give a company such positive promotion if it wasn&#x27;t absolutely warranted and I have to say that so far I am 100% pleased with this purchase! I bought directly from the company&#x27;s website. I initially was going to buy the Temptu system but being suspicious of any company that invests so much in advertising, I considered the high price and a couple not-so-stellar reviews then decided to look at other options. I saw that Tickled Pink&#x27;s set was almost half the price of Temptu&#x27;s and the reviews were great, so why not, I took a chance never having operated an airbrush system or worn the make-up. I am so glad I did. Firstly, the item was shipped out in record time: a few minutes after placing the order the company notified that the shipment was being processed and then an hour after that I was notified by USPS that my shipment was received! The airbrush wand seems well made (even my husband agreed it was good quality) and looks so cute with the pink handle and \\&quot;Tickled Pink\\&quot; engraving. I bought the medium tones kit and tested out the colors on my mom, sister and myself. We are all different tones but it&#x27;s brilliant that I can blend the 3 medium-shades of foundation to perfectly match each skin tone! It takes only a little practice and finesse to master this thing. Users who get cakey or clumpy results are just not doing it correctly! My technique: gently spray 5-6 inches from your face in a soft circular motion. You can control how thick you want to layer on the make-up (natural or more dramatic)and you can use the lighter shade to highlight areas like your cheekbones or a darker shade to contour. Just get used to the speed and amount of spray dispensed. Maybe I have a knack for it but I learned how to do all this in my practice run. My mom and sister loved being my Guinea pigs because their make-up came out perfect. Your skin really looks flawless - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the airbrush technique or silicone-based make-up that is to credit but whatever it is I loveit.</li>
            <li> QUIET, QUICK &amp; HANDY...... I USE IT ALMOST EVERYDAY! MY MAKEUP LOOKS FLAWLESS :-) IT ONLY TAKES ME ABOUT 5MIN OR LESS TO COVER. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS SHOULD I USE A FINISHING POWDER TO MAKE THE MAKE UP STAY LONG... OVERALL I&#x27;M TICKLED PINK</li>
            <li> Product is great and great price too.  The product is not as expensive as other airbrush machines but it does the job that it is suppose to do. nice clean finish.</li>
            <li> I had to switch to all natural products due to health reasons.  All of the all natural makeup was either oily or heavy and uncomfortable.  I searched for a light weight natural makeup for a very long time.  When I first found Tickled Pink I really thought it sounded too good to be true!!  It Is Wonderful!!!  I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I had time to use the machine and the products.  It has been almost two months and I LOVE IT!!!  It is light weight and perfect every time!!  If you have any questions it comes with a number to call and a very nice lady will help you with any questions.  This is a wonderful product that will last for many years, a Wonderful Investment!!!  So glad I bought it and you will be to!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was at first a little skeptical. That was quickly overcome though the first time I used it. Covers really well and is super-easy to use. The makeup has a flawless finish and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I ever used an airbrush system and I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an infomercial for an airbrush product but it was too expensive and then I went on Amazon and I came across this product. I went on the actual website and spoke to the woman Kathy who sells the product and she told me about the airbrush product and I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, I took it out of the box and it was very easy to put together but I wasn&#x27;t quite  sure how to actually  use it because I never used an airbrush product before. I went on You tube and found this video of  this pretty Asian woman  showing how to use the Tickled Pink Airbrush System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 setting, low medium and high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use either the low or medium to get the make up just right :[]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played around with the different types of foundation until I found the one that was perfect for me.  It leaves your face looking  practically flawless. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. No caked on feeling whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t look like those woman in Sephora or  Macy&#x27;s make up department store where you can tell that make up is plastered on their faces (sorry ladies-but come on now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Tickled Pink Airbrush make up it&#x27;ll leave you looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blush that it came with was great for my skin tone color but I would like to order a few more to see which one I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting makeup on in the mornings now is such a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies if you&#x27;re looking for an Airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, get this one. It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry. You&#x27;re gonna love it as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> GIVES A PRETTY COLOR IN YOUR FACE AND MAKES YOUR FACE SOFTER THAN IT IS</li>
            <li> Mix your makeup selections for the perfect color.  Strong spraying capacity.  This is far bettyer than my Luminess machine and for a fraction of the cost.  This is worth the money, but be sure to spray from at least 5 inches from face for even application.  It is a matter of learning how to apply foundation just right with any of these types of machines.  It takes practice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it was easy to use however I got my airbrush kit with the medium shade makeup and I found it was too pink/orange for my skin tone. I would love this product if it was available in a more olive shade otherwise I would have given it one extra star.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little bit of a skeptic when I read the reviews for other airbrush systems, but I got this one because the reviews were pretty good AND it was a lot cheaper then the other systems I have seen. The compressor is small and the whole thing is easy to pack around with you. As for coverage, it covers pretty well. I got medium for myself and I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t cover that well but it does. They also gave me a free sample of their moisturizer which is used in the same way the makeup is used in and I have to say I love it. It smells pretty good and it makes my skin feel so nice and soft, I love it! I am very happy with this product and I will be ordering again (when I run out of makeup refills.)</li>
            <li> { This is my first time trying any type of airbrush makeup and I have to say I am hooked! It gives my face a nice color and my face looks smooth and it lasts all day! I actually look forward to putting on my makeup! }</li>
            <li> I got this system about 3 weeks ago. I love it! Takes no time at all to put my makeup on. It looks great, I&#x27;ve had tons of people telling me my makeup looks nice. Never got that before. Very easy to work with and very easy to clean. Bought the blush afterwards. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my Tickled Pink airbrush system a few weeks ago.  I had heard about it for a few years but once I was able to actually TRY it, I was sold!  Like with any new tool, it takes a few times to get the hang of it.  By the 3rd try, I got it!  I got the light foundation set with my kit and also purchased the blue brown eye shadow and the desert mauve blush.  They are both great.  I am ready to try new colors!  LOVE the moisturizer and waterproof setting spray too.  I tested the waterproof spray before going to my Zumba class!  You would never know by the end of the hour that I had gotten all red faced and sweaty!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this system and the fact that you will always have the PERFECT shade of foundation no matter what season it is!  When you get a tan in the summer, just mix your foundations to be a bit darker to match your new skin color.  When you go back to winter and lighten up, mix the lighter color!  Perfection!  I have recommended this to all of my make up loving friends too.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to and the colors sometimes need to be mixed.</li>
            <li> i usually dont take the time to write a reveiw but with this product i decided to because it is that good. it does take some practice getting used to using the airbrush and getting your correct color, but once you do, the results are awesome. it actually takes me five minutes to put my makeup on now. the makeup has great coverage, i have freckles and blemishes on my face and this makeup covers it perfectly making me look like i have flawless skin and like im wearing no makeup. i have thrown away all my old makeup and replaced it with this unit, which is super cute looking. if your intersested in buying this product, do it, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the unit from the Tickled Pink web site. I have worked with makeup all my life from the runway in my youth to today in my 50s as a professional in the technical area.  Nothing beats this for application and the natural results you can obtain.  I had to experiment a bit but quickly found that 12 drops of biege and 4 drops of tan work for me.  I found that holding the wand about 8\\&quot;s from my face is best with a sweeping motion.  I depress the button a little over half way down.  If I was too close to my face wrinkles were more noticable.  Wrinkles seemed to disappear when holding the wand 8\\&quot; away.  I used to use only bare minerals.  Now I use this in conjunction with bare minerals eye shadow applied via brush.  After a month of using the Tickled Pink makeup, I found that my complexion improved.  The ingredients have even proved me with a more even skin tone for those days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.  I find very few products that are better then stated.  Ladies this is one of those times when expectations are far exceeded.  Don&#x27;t miss out!</li>
            <li> I love it overall but it was very difficult to the makeup out of the little bottles. But i did think it was very generous of them to throw in a free moisturizer/gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6-7 months now and I am amazed at how good their makeup looks! The airbrush gives you 3 speeds to choose from and it only took me two practice tries to perfect applying it. Aside from this being an exceptional price I just have to comment on the stellar customer service I have received from the owners. They are courteous and prompt with any questions or concerns you may have. I would recommend this product to anyone. My only advice to new owners is be very careful with the wand, the mechanics beneath are fragile and cannot handle being dropped or abused in any way. I would keep it put away when not in use and make sure you clean it out thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me. Liquid makeup too expensive.  To liquidy.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of doing airbrush makeup you will never return to regular foundation (dirty sponges, streaky lines, cleaning brushes...and let&#x27;s not forget the cost!)  I was able to splurge on this for myself and although the cost seems high you will not regret it because you get a flawless look that everyone will compliment you on and in the long run you will save money on foundation.  This is due to the fact that approximately 3-6 drops will cover your entire face.  This has also helped clear the small amount of acne I have because Tickled Pink makeup doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.  I have cut my morning makeup routine into about 1/3 of the time!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Best product I have in my makeup collection. I always put my foundation on with this now, no other way. I tell every one about it and how much it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> My kit arrived today, a day early, and I was very excited to try it out. I put it together with just a small bit of hoopla: The air hose came with a white plastic piece on it and I could not for the life of me figure out where it went. I went to the Tickled Pink website for the detailed instructions as the notice in the package instructed me.  It was the airbrush holder. It attaches to the left side of the machine.  Beyond that, you don&#x27;t really need any instructions for &#x27;assembly&#x27;, but detailed instructions are on their website.  I ordered mine from Amazon due to my great experience with Amazon, the fact that I had a gift card and the Ticked Pink website literally gives me headaches --not due to structure, but due to the colors and fonts.  It is very hard to stare at for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in an earlier review that the reviewer had used 12 drops of the lighter color and 4 drops of the medium color. Unless you have lovely porcelain skin or beautiful darker skin, most of us are medium beiges.  Therefore, I just followed her lead so I would not have too much of an adjustment, if any, to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of the sample moisturizer in the bowl, set the machine to low, and proceeded.  It did not seem to be working, so I gave up on the moisturizer, used some from on my shelf,  and started on my makeup with the 12 and 4 drops of makeup.  I did not feel anything on my face and I was sure the machine was a dud. After some frustration, adjusting the machine, turning it off and on (patience is not one of my strong points), I used it a little on my inner forearm.  I was delighted to learn that the problem was, well, me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned back to my face and applied the makeup. The color was a nice match.  I was a little uncoordinated with the machine, but it did not matter at all.  The 12 and 4 drops was way too much makeup for me, but I just sprayed until it was gone. The results of  doing this were that the makeup itself did not look so great.  I preferred my mineral makeup to what I was seeing.  Once again, the problem was me.  The makeup has to dry, so using too much at once makes it take longer to dry.  The makeup has completely dried, and even though I used more than I should have without letting the makeup dry before applying more, it is perfection.  It seems like once you find your color match, it would be hard to go wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted some blush, and the Tickled Pink makeup is just so expensive. I also didn&#x27;t see any safe colors for me without trying out a sample. Instead, I picked up a Belloccio blush (here on Amazon) in Charming Lily.  It seemed to be a safe bet and it was! It is so beautiful applied. Not too dark or garish and the right tone for me. Lovely. It was $9.50 plus shipping and still way cheaper than the Tickled Pink. It is 5.8 ounces and 4 drops was too much.  It will last a very long time. They also have a huge selection of airbrush makeup as well.  Don&#x27;t put cheap makeup, or makeup that isn&#x27;t water based in the machine or it will ruin it.  Belloccio makes an airbrush kit for professionals so they aren&#x27;t some random company pushing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:  The machine is small, so it does not take up much space.  The air hose is long, giving you a lot of room for movement.  The results are the best I have ever seen in my makeup.  I am a huge fan of airbrushing my makeup on now.  I can&#x27;t see ever going back.  I just keep looking in the mirror in different lights.  It really is beautiful.  I didn&#x27;t even try to make it beautiful, I just wanted to learn and practice, and it just turned out flawless.  The application seems to be somewhat idiot proof. The price is so reasonable if you have shopped around as I have.  I have also looked around at the various water based makeups.  This makeup has so many ingredients that are good for your skin.  Some of the other ones tell you they have good stuff in them, but do not actually tell you what this good stuff is as TickledPink does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:  The unit does not come with a case.  I travel for business and really want to take this along. How can I go back to regular makeup, mineral or otherwise? I will look at a camera cases to see if I can find something.  Also, since the unit does not come with a case, there is no place to put the little wrench and plastic eyedropper, and the cord that is so long -- it just drapes on the counter.  The makeup is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend airbrushing your makeup and this machine to anyone now.  The machine is just a delivery device, but you want one with different speeds, like this one, and one that is not a hunk of junk.  This one is a nice little unit, uncomplicated with the best price I have seen on one of these. The makeup that comes with the machine is nice, and just looks so lovely applied.  I love this, I do not even want to wash it off tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and here is a shout-out to Hannah D:  No, you do not need powder.  I have always used a finishing powder with my makeup as it finishes the job.  You do not need powder with this at all.  A blush just adds perfection to this, and I look washed out without one, so I will always use a blush even with this.  Check the Tinkled Pink and Belloccio websites to see if there is something to replace your bronzer.  I am sure that there is, since both companies sell the airbrush tanner as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and the shades were too dark.  I went on Tickled Pink&#x27;s website just days before the big day to get lighter shades and the owner Kathy not only sent out the color I ordered but included another light shade as a wedding gift!  The airbrush kit is a great buy and the service was quick and friendly...will continue to buy their products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look great on me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an airbrush to use for my wedding day...I didn&#x27;t know a whole lot about them, but I had an amazon gift card and started reading the reviews on this particular one.  I am really happy with this airbrush system.  My fiance and I had a lot of fun mixing the different shades of foundation to find the perfect match.  My friends all thought I had my make up professionally done at the wedding and the photos turned out great!  I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I bought this through the actual Tickled Pink website and got free shipping. I really like the way it makes my skin look, I have problems with my skin tone being even and the airbrush really works. It took me about 2 or 3 times to get good at it but it really is a great product and less money then the other guys. Really enjoying it. I only gave it 4 stars though because the makeup can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t expect this to not work on my body for stretch marks or to at least cover it alittle .. But it&#x27;s GREAT for makeup on face !</li>
            <li> I READ ALOT OF REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING A AIRBRUSH MAKEUP SYSTEM AND I SAW THAT THIS SYSTEM HAD THE MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS. I KNOW WHY NOW, THIS IS A GREAT SYSTEM AND GREAT COMPANY. I LOVE THE AIRBRUSH AND I ALSO USE THE TANNING AIRBRUSH ON CLIENTELE IN MY SALON. I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY ANYTHING YET. I LOVED THEIR TANNING SOLUTION AS WELL IT IS ALITTLE PRICEY BUT IT FADES AWAY NATURALLY NO BLOTCHY SPOTS AND ITS A BEAUTIFUL TAN NO ORANGE AT ALL. I EMAILED THE COMPANY PERSONALLY AND RECEIVED EMAILS THE VERY NEXT DAY, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAVE PURCHASED THEIR MAKEUP AS WELL, ITS GREAT TOO, 100% AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> The thing I LOVE the most about this airbrush kit is that it is easy to travel with!!. I&#x27;ve taken it with me several times now, I pack it back in the original box it came with and put it in my suitcase. It travels well!... I won&#x27;t go ANYWHERE without it!!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s so many good reviews on here that I just read and they are all so true. The from the quality of the airbrush itself to the quality of the make-up!.. AMAZING!.. I&#x27;ve actually never worn liquid foundation because it&#x27;s always felt too heavy so I&#x27;ve only worn powder but this foundation is very lightweight!!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely Love this PRODUCT!! :)</li>
            <li> I Love the Tickled Pink airbrush kit!  I tried airbrush make up for my wedding and decided that I wanted something I could use at home for special occasions.  The Tickled Pink system has great reviews and the best prices.  I was nervous abut applying it myself, but its super easy.  It took a few tries to get the shade right, but now when I wear it, my skin looks flawless.  I don&#x27;t look too made up, and I always get compliments!&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have an oily T-zone, so because this make up is water based, I occasionally need to use blot papers or loose powder, but my makeup stays fresh looking all day!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. .. The quality, the way it covers is absolutely amazing., so light and soft of a look..I can&#x27;t go 1 day without my tickled pink airbrush. . You  absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. . The money you will save on makeup is unbelievable.. I&#x27;ve never been happier with my make up</li>
            <li> I bought this product last September and I absolutely love it!  I use it everyday and tossed all my other make up.  The finish makes me look so much younger and it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off.  The seller has been fabulous to work with.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Makeup is great. I really like that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off too. It&#x27;s also so light, I forget that I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I never had a coverage like this in my life. I love it and I will order for my sis</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable airbrush system&lt;br /&gt;Good customer service until your machine breaks and you need help. This will happen.&lt;br /&gt;3/5 compatibility with acne prone skin. Although any brushless, fingerless system will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Makeup upon drying does not look natural. Beige shade dried as a dark brown mask on my face with well-demarcated jaw lines even though equal application over the neck and face was ensured.&lt;br /&gt;The compressor stopped working properly after 2 months of use. The enthusiastic husband and wife owners who initially went out of their way to send samples stopped replying to my texts or phone calls when I returned the machine at my own cost and on their request for replacement. If being out of money and out of the product is one of your worst nightmares, I would suggest BEWARE!!! I had delivery confirmation from the post office that claimed the item was delivered but the owners denied. It was a nightmare. Pay extra and buy through amazon so that when you run into trouble, they cannot maltreat you. I bought directly from their website.&lt;br /&gt;Just like any other makeup brand, not all products are worth the buy. I had to use a regular blush because no matter how many drops I used, I could never see it.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive replacement makeup just like any other airbrush system. Yes it finishes quickly because you have to use at least 10 drops of foundation for it do the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered right from their site. It was super easy to do and I loved the feel of it. Hold back a few inches and keep the airbrush making small circles and I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong. It does take about 4 drops of foundation and the sample sizes are pretty small.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!! I will never touch another make-up again as long as I live. I just received my entire system. It is quicker and easier than any other make-up I have ever tried. I have drawers of other make-ups I have tried and hate. They are going in the garbage tomorrow to make space for other things. This unit is compact and a little product goes a long way! It is economical and looks entirely professional when finished. This product took ten years off my life immediately!! I called Saturday while Kathy, the owner, was at the beach. She called me back as soon as she could get reception and we talked like we had known each other all our lives. This is Wednesday and the entire system was on my doorstep today. I&#x27;ve been texting with Kathy all day today. Tell me where you will ever get personal attention with any other make-up company in the world...try calling Estee Lauder and talking to her. Let me know when that happens. Product is awesome!! Customer service is A++++++++++++++! System is soooooooooooo easy to use! Make-up is waterproof and lasts longer than most, hours beyond anything else. You will look like you have been photo shopped!! Love Love Love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Very happy with the speed of delivery!!! This is a Christmas gift so hopefully she will like it!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase an airbrush system for the longest time, but was hesitant because of the price. I came across tickled pinks machine which I felt was reasonably priced and finally took the plunge, and SO glad that I did! It has made the BIGGEST difference in my makeup!!! No more powder face, it lasts all day and does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles if applied correctly. The only reason I held back one star for this particular machine was because even though I wash it out after every application sometimes the compressor spits makeup out at an inconsistant pressure. Somedays it works great, and other days (usually when I am running behind of course ;) ) I have to sit and mess with it to get it working properly agian. Other than that as with any of these machines there is a learning curve. It takes a little time to figure out your color shade...mine is a mix of 2 colors for foundation. You also must figure out by trial and error how to apply with a light hand... a little goes a long way and its easy to get carried away or spray too close and over do it. I also highly reccomend not to just buy a foundation...get a blush too! These blushes go on so nice and so smooth. Why ruin your nice airbrushed face with a powder blush. You can, but in my opinion it defeats the purpose and the airbrush blush just looks so pretty and so natural like a glow on your cheeks once you learn how to apply it correctly. It took me a couple trys. First time I did it with a heavy hand because I wasn&#x27;t used to it and looked like a clown. Now I&#x27;ve got it down and I love it. I  don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to regular makeup again. If your waiting to pull the trigger bc of price like I was don&#x27;t wait anymore it it SO worth it,  once you get started you will wish you had not waited so long and the customer service that I have received at Tickled Pink is outstanding!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just spend 3 minutes (maybe 2) reading the instructions.  If you don&#x27;t pour too much makeup in the top, the cleaning is effortless.   What an incredible find.  Imperfections seemed to disappear.  What more could I want?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters wedding and it turned out beautiful!!! Everyone complimented the bride, me and my other daughter about how well our makeup looked!!!!</li>
            <li> While I found this airbrush machine to work wonderfully, imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same one on Ebay withOUT the Tickled Pink logo stuck on it for $99 and free shipping.  I ALWAYS shop around so I&#x27;m upset with myself for paying this price!  I used all of the .5oz make up quickly and once I saw how pricey the refills are I packed it away.  You basically need to buy two and mix them to get a perfect color, especially once you start getting a tan in the summer.  I just can&#x27;t see paying $46 for 2 bottles of this foundation, something that will last me MAYBE 4-6 weeks when using it every day.  I find the shipping to be outrageous, $9 for a that tiny bottle.  So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price for the make up I say go for it!  It looks great and lasts the whole day just be prepared cuz this is basically a pricey committment.  I went out and bought the Maybelline Matte Mousse make up and it&#x27;s GORGEOUS!  Looks airbrushed but cost $7!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this.  I am happy with the compressor, it works great and is very reasonably priced but the makeup that comes with it, is not so great.  It&#x27;s not water resistant at all.  So if you get a drop of water on your face, you will be able to see where the makeup came off.  I even bought their makeup setting mist, and that didn&#x27;t help either.  The makeup was light weight and provided good coverage but I want something that won&#x27;t run down my face if it gets wet.  Literally if you shed ONE tear or were out in the rain at all it will run down your face.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old woman who spent more than 40 years outdoors riding horses in all types of weather, dirt and grime, with absolutely no regard for skin care.  I recently started acting and now realize how important it is to look your very best.  Yes, in acting it&#x27;s true.  The better you look, the better parts you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mineral powder I was using made me look older - every flaw, no matter how big or small, was magnified, especially on camera.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try an airbrush makeup system.  Did a lot of comparison shopping before purchasing the Tickled Pink Airbrush. It is reasonably priced, was delivered quickly and has GREAT customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after using the Tickled Pink Airbrush system and makeup, imagine my surprise when a fellow actor referred to me as &amp;#34;the woman with the perfect skin.&amp;#34;  ME?  WOW!  Since using this system, I have consistently gotten better and younger acting parts.  Most people have guessed I am in my 40&#x27;s - HURRAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:  I use the Flawless Finish powder to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; everything and for a matte finish after foundation and blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few applications, I can now apply my foundation and blush in about 10 minutes, including the Flawless Finish application and the time to clean the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!  LOVE!  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I had to write a review about this amazing product because as a consumer, I am impressed. I was impressed with the courteous customer service and timely delivery of the product. The rep was always there to answer my questions and very helpful. The makeup itself stays on better than ANY makeup I&#x27;ve ever used before and it&#x27;s easy to apply, clean and store. I was leery of buying an airbrush system because of the complication with cleanup, but Tickled Pink is very easy to use. I will never use over-the-counter makeup again!</li>
            <li> After trying every kind of makeup to try to cover my scars , hundreds of dollars later. I was so happy to purchase this item. It really covers all my flaws , thank you so much for making this product . I can finally feel better about myself again.</li>
            <li> All airbrush make up is not created equal.  I got my make up done for a shoot with Dinair and I credited it to the application technique and not the brand, I was wrong.  I bought this according to all the great reviews, but did NOT realize their horrible return policy.  You have to pay a restocking fee, and a \\&quot;cleaning fee\\&quot; if they decide you didn&#x27;t clean it just right.  So upset I just wasted my money!  I should have bought the Dinair set off of Ebay which is only a little more.. This make up is too dewey for me.. It might work for dry skin or a different climate, but not on combination skin in a warm climate.. and it does NOT last, which is the reason I even decided to splurge on an airbrush set.. I wish I had read the negative reviews before purchasing!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever leave reviews, but I had to for this one so you don&#x27;t repeat the same mistake I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this airbrush kit with high hopes. I use Bare Minerals every day and I really like it, but I was looking for something with similar results except longer-lasting. After reading all the positive reviews about the kit and the customer service, I thought this would be a great investment and I was really excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the airbrush machine, but the makeup itself was horrible. It stayed on top of my skin and looked completely fake and plastic. On the first day that I tried it, a couple of my close friends asked me if I was doing something different with my skin because it had lost its glow and was looking dull and old. My boss told me I should quit smoking (I do NOT smoke). It didn&#x27;t take long to realize this had to go. Which is fine. I love shopping on Amazon because of their amazing return policy and the shopper-confidence that goes with that. So I packed everything in the box, paid for the return shipping (and $15.00 for shipping when I purchased even though the stamp on my package showed they had only paid $11.00) and when they finally processed my return (which took a while), they figured that my refund should be $124.95 even though I paid $163.90 for it--almost $39 was deducted from my refund for \\&quot;restocking and shipping fees.\\&quot; Excuse me? Didn&#x27;t I pay for shipping both ways? And $39 for restocking fees? That&#x27;s 24% for restocking fees? That&#x27;s just ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ... the way I see it, I spent $66 (39 + 15 (shipping) + 11 (return shipping)) to try this overrated makeup for day and instead of compliments get comments like \\&quot;You should stop smoking\\&quot; and \\&quot;no offense, but your skin looks kind of dull. Have you washed it?\\&quot; and, my favorite, \\&quot;I think you need to catch up on your beauty sleep.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT waste your money on this. I&#x27;m serious, DO NOT! Go to Ulta instead and get their cosmetics professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow! And you won&#x27;t even spend $66.s professionals to give you a free makeover and show you wonderful makeup that will make you glow! And you won&#x27;t even spend $66.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Tickled Pink kit about a month ago, after an exhaustive search for a reasonably priced airbrush system - and my skin has never looked this beautiful - ever! Not even 20 years ago! I knew I wanted an airbrush system, and after reading the reviews on about half a dozen machines, I soon realized Tickled Pink was \\&quot;the one\\&quot;... I was, however, willing to pay even hundreds more for any other system because I needed one shipped out to me in a day, and I couldn&#x27;t find one locally in any store here in Phoenix. I&#x27;m 51 and just recently re-entered the workforce (after tens years as a stay-at-home mom), and I was about to get on a plane to fly across the country to meet with a potential new client in a couple of days. I was preparing to give my very first major sales presentation, and wanted to look my best. I knew if I felt confident about how I looked, I&#x27;d do a better job presenting. I&#x27;m not normally insecure about how I look, but after 10 years of wearing sweats and very little make-up, I admit I was really stressing about how I was going to look to a room full of 30-somethings.  Problem was, I had to find a system and get it in my hands before getting on that plane...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did Kathy from Tickled Pink call me after receiving my email (on a weekend!) asking if I could get a system FAST, she agreed to overnight it out to me on Monday via Fed-Ex. Tickled Pink doesn&#x27;t normally use Fed-Ex I might add, so a special trip was being made on my behalf. Kathy and I spoke for a long time on the phone about her business, my new job and upcoming trip, and of course, about Tickled Pink products. She was wonderful and spent a ton of time on the phone with me, explaining that the newer line of aloe-based foundations would probably work best since I live in such a dry climate. I was impressed with her sincerity and customer service before even receiving the product - really, who does that these days? How often do you get to speak to a live person on the phone, let alone someone who actually wants to hear your story? Kathy took the time to help me figure out the best solution for me personally. I felt like I was talking with an old friend by the time we hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my package and it arrived as promised. Even at the end of September we still have 100 degree temps here in Phoenix, so foundation never lasts long or it ends up looking dry and cakey no matter how much mosturizer I use first. And if I put on too much, my skin starts to flake, so getting an even skin tone is tough to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I about fell over my very first time using Tickled Pink - I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply, and I am STILL amazed at how well it covers up every red blotch and age spot every time I use it. I also have a very prominent vein above one eyelid, but after a few sweeps with \\&quot;Frappacino\\&quot; (which mathces my skin tone to a tee), it simply vanishes. There are no steaks, no cakey-ness, no flakes. I absolutely LOVE this system and make-up, and the results are better than I expected. This is the one system that really does what it says it will do - you will love your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use my system - I work with a magnified lighted make-up mirror (brightest day setting) so I can really see every imperfection on my skin and so I can really see TP cover everything. I use my regular AHA mosturizer, then I use the TP airbrush on the low setting to apply TP moisturizer (4-5 drops). It goes on feeling really cool and fresh, and I make sure to use it near (and over) my eyebrows and nose, which for some reason are the areas that normally flake the most on me, and along my jawline and neck, too. While it&#x27;s still feeling a bit damp, I use 8 drops of Frappacino, also on the low setting. I start covering my age spots first and the vein above my eye; I hold the airbrush a bit closer to my face to cover (about 2\\&quot; out). Then I move the airbrush further away from my face (about 6\\&quot;) and begin covering everywhere in a circular motion. I finish off by making sure I spray my jawline down to my neck. The color really is a perfect match, so I never have a \\&quot;blending\\&quot; issue. The two other colors that come with the medium kit were too yellow (Mocha) and too light (Latte) for me. I do, though, sometimes use the Latte under my eyes first or if I get a pimple - and then cover over it/blend with the Frappacino. When I finish covering, I use the water-proof sealant all over (about 4 drops). While that&#x27;s drying, I apply eyeliner and mascara and a little eyebrow powder. When it&#x27;s dry, I then brush on some powdered blush, which goes on fine over the foundation (but I did just order the airbrush blush because it&#x27;s so fast and easy)! All of that literally takes me about 5 minutes!!! My skin is one, beautiful, even color - no blotchiness, no age spots - just smooth, even awesomeness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the makeup would \\&quot;spray\\&quot; on my hair and clothes, so the first time I tried it I sat in my undies and had my hair tied back, but the mist is so fine on the low setting it never gets on anything (except where you&#x27;re pointing). I really just ad one misty layer over another until everything is covered on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my brows or hairline or ever get on my clothes. Sometimes I even spray my chest (décolletage) after I&#x27;m dressed if it looks blotchy from the sun and it&#x27;s never a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up literally takes less than a minute. I turn it to high, fill the cup on the airbrish with tap water and cover the spray end with my finger to make \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; in the cup, then refill it with more water and spray it trhough. Then I use a Q-tip to wipe out any residue in the cup. That&#x27;s IT - good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the airbrush machine itself, it&#x27;s tiny enough to take with me on my trips. The hose between the base and airbruish is super long, which is awesome, as is the electrical cord. When I&#x27;m traveling, I like to put my makeup on by a window (at my age the natural bright light helps me see more clearly than most bathroom lights), so the long cords make that easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Kathy or Tinckled Pink -you will NOT bne disappointed with this system!</li>
            <li> I am one of those who never reviews products, but I swear this product has improved my outlook on make up and boosted my confidence majorly! I actually purchased through their direct website, since it was a little cheaper and free shipping. The website isn&#x27;t the easiest to navigate, but if you text them a question they will get back to you immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin: I have medium skin tone and also use sunless tanners regularly on my face/neck to add a little more color, since you lose it quicker with washing/exfoliating. My skin tone is uneven overall with some red patches, acne scars here and there large pores along my nose and cheeks and darker circles under my eyes. I also was experiencing dryness and flaking on my forehead and chin (no matter how much moisturizer I would slather on and even after heavy exfoliation!) that really made me self conscious but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $$$ going to a dermatologist to try and figure out why and what to do about it. I tried using soooo many different foundations/powders/BB/CC creams to find one that would correct all my problems, but instead I would look cakey/unnatural or dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Get:  So with this kit you get the compressor and airbrush gun, 1 bottle of moisturizer, 1 bottle of water proof sealant, and 3 colors (0.5 fl oz): latte, frappuccino, and mocha (lighter to darkest, respectively). All of this is packaged in a nice little travel bag with instructions for assembly, which is basically showing you where to connect the tubing. It is super easy to use, and only took me a couple tries to feel proficient. I use the moisturizer first and let it dry a few seconds, then do several drops of latte to hit my spots of imperfection with a more concentrated and closer flow, then just go generally all over and on my neck. I then add a couple drops each of the frappuccino and mocha to add color along my cheeks, hairline, jawline and neck area. Start to finish takes maybe 3 minutes, allowing areas to dry before going back over it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about this product! I truly feel like it corrects ALL of my skin issues and really does leave you with a polished airbrush look. The colors all blend wonderfully and it’s great that you can mix up the different colors to match your skin tone as the seasons change. And I have NO MORE DRYNESS!! Not sure if it’s the moisturizer, the natural ingredients of the foundation, or both but I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the bottle of moisturizer and sealer is pretty small (the bottles are considered “sample sizes” but these two products are maybe .25 fl oz?) so I did have to go ahead and re-order another larger bottle of the moisturizer. I have not tried the sealer at all yet, honestly. So I would def recommend going ahead and buying more moisturizer with your 1st purchase to save on shipping costs (free over $50). The sample foundations should last longer since it’s a larger bottle, but in reality you use more than just 2-3 drops that some places may say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny! I just wish I would have found this sooner :)</li>
            <li> I love this machine! My sister wanted airbrush makeup done for her wedding. We called a few places and it was going to cost an outrageous amount of money! I started looking online and reading reviews about Tickled Pink Airbrush so i decided to try it out. I have always loved playing around with makeup, but i am by far no Makeup Artist, but when i got my machine, i started practicing on my sister and friends and i found it so easy and so much fun! I have done 3 wedding makeups so far! The customer service is great too. If you have ANY questions about the machine or techniques or products, they are always there to help. I had a problem once with my machine, so i let them know and they fixed it immediately! Anyone can tell you how expensive airbrush foundations are. They  are going to be pretty expensive everywhere you look. Tickled Pink foundations are about $18 for an ounce, but sometimes they run specials and they always include some sort of sample with your order.  An ounce will last a long time, but i like to get a variety of colors so that you can blend and make the perfect shade.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. Doesnt take up that much space. Was cheaper then the other brands and works just as well. Im really happy with it. I have used it on a couple of friends and they went and bought one too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.  Still using it just not sure how to make it look even.  It takes a bit of blotting to make it nice and even looking.  But love how it feels going on your face.</li>
            <li> I love the way my makeup looks after using the  Tickled Pink Airbrush.  It is easy to use and the results are amazing.  I tried another airbrush and it was twice the price and did not work as well as Tickled Pink.</li>
            <li> I purchased the deluxe kit directly from the sellers via phone.  Kathy is absolutely wonderful to do business with.  The product exceeded my expectations.  I had been a Bare Mineral user for 15+ years.  I thought my makeup looked good - this product takes it to a whole new level.  My skin looks better, feels better, is better.  Learning curve is super short - second try I was right on.  Ladies, do yourselves and your skin a favor - purchase the Tickled Pink kit.  (If you are a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman and not sure if this is for you - I&#x27;m 59.)</li>
            <li> Perfect...this was the only one that was easy to handle and aquires very little of the airbrush makeup.....I love it.....never gives me a problem....well done</li>
            <li> The worst customer service I have ever experienced! After months of searching for the best airbrush kit I came acrossed a company called Tickled Pink. After reading the positive reviews on their website I decided to go with this company and this has been the worst product and \\&quot;company\\&quot; I have ever come across. If you look on their website all the reviews are positive but if you look closely you can see where you have to email the \\&quot;company\\&quot; your review and then they will post it....... Now it makes sense to me as to why there wasn&#x27;t one bad review! This company has been in business for a few years an not one person has wrote a bad review? It&#x27;s more like, you email the \\&quot;company\\&quot; which is really Kathy and her husband and they decide if it gets posted or not, which would be a good reason for all positive reviews, after all, bad reviews don&#x27;t make money. This company is a scam. You better hope you like the system and the make up as well because you will be stuck with it. I have tried this product for the last 2 weeks, with primer, without primer, with tickled pink moisturizer, without moisturizer, with setting spray, and without setting spray, you get the picture. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the make up can look okay, however it doesn&#x27;t stay on! If you touch your face even after it dries it will leave a finger print, sponge print, whatever touches your face will leave a print behind. Yes I let it dry and no I didn&#x27;t apply layer after wet layer and yes I applied finishing spray. I will also do a step by step video on YouTube so everyone can see that Its not me nor my technique but the low quality of the product.  I have tried everything, I have even taken this kit to Ulta and had a make-up artist apply it and with no surprise it ended up with the same results.  Still after all this I wasn&#x27;t mad, just disappointed. I didn&#x27;t get mad until I called the company and spoke with Kathy, who was yawning on the phone as I was explaining to her the problems I have been having with the products. She asked me if I had been applying it right and asked if I had been trying it out. Of course I had been trying it out I didn&#x27;t spend $200 on the kit, setting spray and another full sized bottle of foundation to look at it sit on my vanity. Then she went on to tell me about how she is the owner of the company along with her husband and that \\&quot;we&#x27;re just not going to see eye to eye on this,\\&quot; she said. She was certainly right about that. She also told me that when they started this company a few years ago they did let customers return the products if they were unsatisfied but that caused them to go under and they had to barrow money from their parents to get it going again! Really? If you had so many returns that your business went under, wouldn&#x27;t that tell you something as a business owner?  Like I told Kathy, they should have taken that barrowed money and put it towards making a better quality product instead of making more quantity and not refunding all the unsatisfied customers their money back, but like Kathy said, \\&quot;we&#x27;re a business and we don&#x27;t make money when items are returned, we&#x27;re not Wal-mart\\&quot;. It&#x27;s no wonder they went under before and with the customer service I received.........I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be going back under again. I am still dumb founded by the way this \\&quot;business owner\\&quot; was so blunt in not caring whether her products pleased customers or not. I worked in customer service for several years and know that you never treat a customer poorly, especially when its your own business. There was no reason for Kathy, the owner of Tickled Pink to be so rude and have such an attitude when I tried to return the products. I&#x27;m not getting my money back ($200) for a product that didn&#x27;t work as described but apparently Kathy needs the money more than  clientele. I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to pay out of pocket again and send this crap back to Kathy and she can stick it where the sun don&#x27;t shine.

            <li> I purchased this item less than two months ago, i must have gotten a defected one because after reading all the the good reviews on Amazon my air brush machine was slowly deteriorating and finally burnt out while i was in the middle of using the product. i wasn&#x27;t mad just a little upset, so i gave the company a call and to my benefit she was very nice and offered to replace the product free of charge and without a receipt. Besides the product burning out the machine was very good and the makeup coverage was fantastic! I DO recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great airbrush machine!</li>
            <li> i love this makeup system. easy to use. easy to clean. small and compact.  i&#x27;ve never owned airbrush make up before, so i have no others to compared it to, but this works great.  takes a little practice to get it looking perfect and not cake-y.  i had a small issue with my purchase, but my their email response was immediate, and they fixed the problem to my satisfaction. i&#x27;m  a happy customer.  the make up may seem pricey, but it goes a long way. i use about 8 drops each time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium make up kit.  I have yellow undertones to my skin, not super tan but I&#x27;m not fair either.  I mix the frapuccino and Latte color together, 9 drops of each to make a perfect match for my skin tone.  The frapuccino will be perfect in the summer when I have a tan.  I came back and ordered blush and eye shadows to try.  One of the eye shadows I ordered was way lighter than the name of it described so I got in touch with the owners and they bent over backwards to create me the perfect color.  They sent me 4 different shades!  OMG what great customer service is that?  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!  The make up goes on so easily and quickly once you get the hang of it (just 2 or 3 days of practice) and I just love it.  The great thing is, when I wash my face in the evening, there is hardly any make up on the wash cloth compared to when I used regular liquid make up.  That&#x27;s how light this is, but you get the same coverage.  You can layer too if you want even more coverage for dark spots or blemishes.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!  PS I have very oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all.  No break outs whatsoever! :)</li>
            <li> My makeup kit came with everything wrapped and ready to use.  I put it together easily (as the directions showed for me to do) and have been using it almost everyday since.  It came with three different skin tone colors that I can use one at a time or mix together to get a perfect match.  I would highly recommend buying this product bc you can use it for makeup, a self tanner and also for eye shadow and blush!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in May 2012. I love the way it makes my skin feel,and love the amount of time it has decreased my morning routine! In December 2012, the machines motor burned out. I contacted the representative, who gave me instructions for the return, as it was under warranty. Within 3 days, I had a new machine. I was thrilled with the level of customer service, as well as I am thrilled with this product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have Never Been Happier with something I purchased online!  First of all....this product rocks!  It is so easy to use and I feel like a celeb everyday after I use Tickled Pink to do my makeup.  My face looks flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Importantly:  The customer service is Phenomenal!  I called to ask how to fix something that I dislodged and the owner answered her phone and walked the phone into another room where her husband proceeded to take me through a very simple step by step process of fixing it.  It was quick and simple.  This product is also very easy to fix if you use it EVERY DAY like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny Golen (Pittsburgh, Pa!)</li>
            <li> The makeup they sent me was expired and my face became irritated and covered in bumps. throwing away immediately!!! Waste of money. My face is still recovering, it&#x27;s been weeks.</li>
            <li> a truly awesome company that really cares about their customers. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will definitely purchase directly from them again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly from the sellers website. Shipping was quick and packaged well. I love the actual airbrush machine, very easy clean up. At least once a week I pour alcohol in the well and spray it through for extra cleaning and this works well. The only complaint I have is with the foundation. It looks caked and feels sticky is extra coverage is needed. The worst part is if any water at all touches your face the foundation spots and runs. Not good on a rainy day!  Once it was barely sprinkling and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention until my husband told me I had to check the mirror because my face looked spotted with little white spots. Yikes!  I have since switched to OCC (Obessive Compulsive Cosmetics) airbrush foundation and now it&#x27;s perfect!  No worries on a rainy day this makeup has to be washed off.  I like that.  So, I give the airbrush machine a grade A and the makeup a grade C-.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have aging, dry skin PLUS rosacea. Challenging. Also am a redhead with extremely sensitive skin. From Day One, the owners of Tickled Pink were delightfully helpful with any of my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup routine now takes less than 5 minutes. First i put on a thin film of drugstore serum, then start to airbrush. Porcelain matches my fair skin exactly. I use the Low setting and spray away. While it dries completely, I go ahead and do my eye makeup. Then a quick brush of blush and I&#x27;m good to go. Rosacea has become invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For special occasions I lightly dust Bare Minerals on my cheeks to create even more glamour, and use a darker blush under my cheekbones. But honestly, Tickled Pink is everything I need. I&#x27;ve taken three trips with it -- the compressor isn&#x27;t much bigger than your fist and is pretty quiet. Imagine: just pack the compressor with stylus, a little bottle of makeup, some blush, and a couple of eye pencils. Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to post a photo, but if you&#x27;ll look me up as Roz Van Meter, you&#x27;ll see how I look as a Woman of a Certain Age. My momma made her little redhead stay out of the sun, and Tickled Pink has done the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this.. Make up looks so light and natural. If you are considering purchasing this, Do it. You wont regret it</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND ITS OK.. THE ONLY THING I HATE ABOUT IT IS WHEN U ACCIDENTALLY SPLASH WATER ON YOUR FACE THE MAKE UP WOULD SMUDGE REALLY EASY. NOT FUN AT ALL. AND SHIPPING FOR A TINY REFILL OF FOUNDATION COSTS $8.00??? ARE U KIDDING ME??? THATS A RIP-OFF! I COULD BUY ME ANOTHER FOUNDATION AT WALMART FOR 8 BUCKS! SO LADIES, THINK 1ST BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM!! STICK TO THE TRADITIONAL MAKE UPS INSTEAD YOU&#x27;RE BETTER OFF WITH THAT..</li>
            <li> When I called to say the foundation was too light, I was told it was just to practice with &amp; I would have to buy the next darker shade ($26 more w/shipping) &amp; hope it&#x27;s the right color. I thought I was getting an airbrush &amp; makeup I could use for the price I paid.  That&#x27;s pretty expensive \\&quot;play\\&quot; makeup! You can buy a mini-compressor &amp; airbrush on Amazon for $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the moisturizer isn&#x27;t for dry skin.  I used my moisturizer under my \\&quot;play\\&quot; makeup &amp; waited about 30 minutes for it to set, but if I touched my face, the makeup came off my face onto my finger. I tried it with their moisturizer 1st.  If I didn&#x27;t move my face, it did look good but if I smiled, their were lines all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of airbrushing makeup on.  You use less makeup on your face &amp; it looks smoother.  I&#x27;ll have to find a brand that won&#x27;t rub off with a better moisturizer under it.  This isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d gone with Dinair kit, for a little more $ I would have gotten a lot more products &amp; free skin color match with makeup I can use.  Sending this one back costs $25 restocking + $35 airbrush cleaning if they don&#x27;t think you cleaned it well enough.  BUYER BEWARE!  I spent $140 for an airbrush/mini-compresser made in China.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING it goes on perfectly smooth, lasts all day and it very easy to use. The customer service was beyond anything I could have hoped for, the owners themselves worked with me to assure I received the colors ordered.They mailed out the correct shade immediately and called to make sure I was happy. WOW very Impressed A++++&lt;br /&gt;Janet M.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to write this review because I wanted to have some practice. After a week I had it nailed, no more breakouts and loads of compliments. I can&#x27;t ever go back to regularly applied foundation. I&#x27;m ready to go faster than ever and I&#x27;m still hesitant telling everyone what I&#x27;m doing differently, selfish..I know, ha, ha, ha....I&#x27;m 40+++++ what do you expect!?</li>
            <li> great machine, will be using it for a long time, until I need another.Then I will order another.</li>
            <li> This is now the only way i&#x27;ll apply foundation. Flawless and you can&#x27;t screw up with airbrush.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit directly from the vendor and am very disapointed. The machine works great and is easy to use, however the makeup itself is gross. I use bare minerals and was looking for something that looked a little more \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;. This is definietly not it : ( My face felt really greasy after a few hours. I live in a humid climate and I felt like this makeup attracted more moisture (in a bad way). I&#x27;m really sad that this didn&#x27;t work out and I feel like I wasted a lot of money on something that was over-hyped here on Amazon... I am starting to think that all of those 5-star reviews are not legitimate as the more recent reviews are not so good!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the airbrush kit after speaking with ,Kathy, the owner.&lt;br /&gt;She recommended the correct shades of foundation and sent me samples of eye shadow and blush.&lt;br /&gt;Any questions I had were immediately answered either by phone or e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;She and her husband truely care about their product and their customers.&lt;br /&gt;The airbrush is very easy to use and I have been using the moisturizer,foundation,eye shadow, blush and finishing spray.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering the new make-up and facial serum as soon as it is available this week.&lt;br /&gt;I am a nurse and took my airbrush into work and used it on my co-workers.  I did one side of their faces and the difference was amazing.&lt;br /&gt; I also have 4 sisters who are very anxious to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and dealing with a small company who really care is very rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;I have not only found fun and healthy new make-up but a new friend.</li>
            <li> My kit came in and I imeadiately went in to try it out.. I watched the How to video.. plugged it in and had NO problem at all on using it for the first time.. My husband didnt know what I was doing but when he saw me.. he said.. &amp;#34; You look NICE!&amp;#34; What did you do... lol... I have had so many compliments from friends and family about how my skin looks so flawless and what am i doing differently.. The make up doesnt show all those little lines like my other make-up did..Its great!</li>
            <li> I am the most happy satisfied customer thanks to Angelica and the airbrush really works makes me look beautiful I love it 😍😗😊</li>
