            <li>This leave in is by far one of the best leave-in&#x27;s I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light and not greasy</li>
            <li>We use and LOVE the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>We use about 1-2 tbsp of the Smoothing lotion and then top with about 1 tbsp of the Curl Queen Gel.</li>
            <li>Have tried so many and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>and I think I get better results with my</li>
            <li>The As I Am is a bit lighter on my hair and just seems to work better with the Kinky Curly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it smells delightful</li>
            <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li>on top of</li>
            <li>and it has a really nice &amp; light berry scent.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I think I actually like this the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my hair just to see what works, what doesn&#x27;t and what I can find that works better.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a light vanilla cotton candy.</li>
            <li>reallyyyy looking forward to re-ordering this product :)</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Water, Curl Junkie Leave in Conditioner and top it off with Ouidad Moisturizing Styling Gel.  </li>
            <li>Why pay $27 or more for 8 oz of Ouidad leave in Conditioner?  </li>
            <li>She asked me where she could get more.  </li>
            <li>I have 4b hair and it works magic every time.</li>
            <li>but I think it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>This conditioner provides great slip and makes detangling my natural 4C hair a breeze!  </li>
            <li>product is great for natural girls who like a lot of &#x27;slip&#x27; when twisting their hair.</li>
            <li>The combo allows her hair to be combed easily</li>
            <li>The best leave in conditioner ever, it leaves my hair silky smooth and easy to manage, it does not leave your hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>This works really well in the warm months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than worth the money</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>Thanks curl junkie!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is on the dry side, and this product is great for moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li>I has been a full week now.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter what I use as a styling product on top of this, my hair comes out amazing every single time I start with the smoothing lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use many Curl Junkie products so had high expectations for this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but as a male, I kind of try not to smell like an incense seller wearing perfume with a bundle of flowers at bath &amp; body works.  </li>
            <li>This product addresses curly hair only, and I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen such a nice shine in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The daily smoothing lotion works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>went on the hunt and turned back to my daughter&#x27;s favorite styling product brand:</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d suggest if you haven&#x27;t tried it before is to look at the ingredients and make sure there aren&#x27;t any listed that you try to avoid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled stronger, so it&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my favorite curly red head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faint in the hair, but it smells very pleasant like a light body spray made of cotton candy bubble gum, in other words it&#x27;s not as potently strong as a perfume.</li>
            <li>My new staple!!  </li>
            <li>White chick with unruly red curls, was just about to cut it all off when I found this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This works with all my gels, is very moisturizing and detangles well.  </li>
            <li>I really.</li>
            <li>REALLY didn&#x27;t think this product would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the product.  </li>
            <li>This might be great if you have thick, coarse hair, but was too much for me.</li>
            <li>That way at least one of the samples will more than likely work for you :)</li>
            <li>Works as a decent detangler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>All of my hair textures love it, and I have a few.</li>
            <li>I need to use it a few more times</li>
            <li>Works great for my half relaxed, half natural, hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for detangling, but it left my hair dry and dull.  </li>
            <li>(we use a wide tooth comb only and don&#x27;t comb dry hair) and the curls form nicely.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and my curls are POPPIN.</li>
            <li>I bought this smoothing lotion based on the recommendations of a YouTube video on natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and the reason I purchased this was from a person I subscribe to on YouTube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle :).</li>
            <li>I mix this Curl Assurance Smoothing Lotion, about a quarter sized amount, with 3-4 drops of Redken Diamond Oil (Black Bottle) and apply Curl Formers to my 2B/C thick, frizzy hair, and I end up with a smooth, frizz free result from the combination.  </li>
            <li>It smoothes my naturally curly hair and prepares it for my styling products like no other leave-in I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use it as my first step in styling while my hair is soaking wet.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a huge fan of Curl Junkie -- especially for my daughter who has mixed hair that is coarse and fine, waist length, and very thick.</li>
            <li>But none of them was really making a big enough dent to the frizz issue here in humid</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair soft after I washed my hair which has never happened before.</li>
            <li>I finally got that softness that I was always hoping the expensive wash-out conditioners would give me on their own but never did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the other products from their line.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my hair, my hair feels instantly soft and the softness lasts and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>

            <li> When I purchased the Curl Junkie Smoothing Lotion, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be much different from any other leave-in conditioner, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have tried some products in the past that left my hair soft right after i washed it, but when it dried it was nightmare.</li>
            <li> The Smoothing Lotion was too heavy for my fine curly hair and left it feeling weighed down and dull.  </li>
            <li> daughter has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on different products...</li>
            <li> I have just begun my curly girl method journey and I decided to get this product and a few others from several different companies (thus begins my P.J&#x27;ness).</li>
            <li> So, whether you are purple, green, blue or see-through, try it.</li>
            <li> After I do my cowash, I apply this into the ends of my hair while my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I had to add other products to combat the dryness.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This conditioner also made my hair extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair moisturized and no more frizz and can be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> (does not coat or weigh down hair), and it keeps your hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> , I try to tone down the amount of smells I emit.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like a slightly watered down conditioner, so if you squeeze it in your palm, it wouldn&#x27;t hold in the shape squeezed out.</li>
            <li> As a black woman, I have leaned toward products that specifically say something about my hair type or ethnicity.</li>
            <li> my hair is tightly curled/kinky and I use this twice a week</li>
            <li> and I have thick, tightly curled hair that gets extremely dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I follow up with the Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle and a little of the Pattern Pusher with the Curl Queen...</li>
            <li> That means she would recommend it to other curlies!!</li>

            <li> This conditioner provides great slip and makes detangling my natural 4C hair a breeze!  It works well with my oils and styling gels too.</li>
            <li> I use many Curl Junkie products so had high expectations for this one.  The Smoothing Lotion was too heavy for my fine curly hair and left it feeling weighed down and dull.  The daily smoothing lotion works a lot better for me. This might be great if you have thick, coarse hair, but was too much for me.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a huge fan of Curl Junkie -- especially for my daughter who has mixed hair that is coarse and fine, waist length, and very thick. Her hair can frizz like no one&#x27;s business. We just moved West to East Coast and with that came the humidity which is making her look like RoseannRoseannaDanna!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on the hunt and turned back to my daughter&#x27;s favorite styling product brand: Curl Junkie. We use and LOVE the [[ASIN:B002KDNN86 Curl Junkie Coffee-Coco Curl Creme, 8 fl. oz.]], [[ASIN:B002KDK42O Curl Junkie Hibiscus &amp; Banana Deep Fix Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B002KDK43I Curl Junkie Curl Rehab Moisturizing Hair Treatment, Strawberry Ice-Cream Scent, 8 oz.]]. These are staples for my daughter. But none of them was really making a big enough dent to the frizz issue here in humid D.C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and [[ASIN:B0046HGJV2 Curl Junkie Curl Queen Hair Styling Gel, 12 fl. oz.]] and it is THE winning combo! Suprisingly enough you don&#x27;t need a ton of either for them to work well! We use about 1-2 tbsp of the Smoothing lotion and then top with about 1 tbsp of the Curl Queen Gel. The combo allows her hair to be combed easily (we use a wide tooth comb only and don&#x27;t comb dry hair) and the curls form nicely. The gel doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue or crunchy \\&quot;cast\\&quot; on her hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells great too!</li>
            <li> This works with all my gels, is very moisturizing and detangles well.  Pairs great with the Cur Junkie Curl Queen Gel.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Product. Have tried so many and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for detangling, but it left my hair dry and dull.  I had to add other products to combat the dryness.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in.  Has nice slip and does a good job of smoothing the hair.  However, I bought it to use in conjunction with my Kinky Curly Curling Custard and I think I get better results with my As I Am Leave In Conditioner.  The As I Am is a bit lighter on my hair and just seems to work better with the Kinky Curly.  It is also less expensive and I can get it at Sally&#x27;s whereas I can only order this online.  This is the reason I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have just begun my curly girl method journey and I decided to get this product and a few others from several different companies (thus begins my P.J&#x27;ness). I has been a full week now. WOW. I use this under my styling products. My hair is soft, and my curls are POPPIN. I have 4a/4b or fractal, zigzag (check chapter 6 in the handbook)type hair. I really. REALLY didn&#x27;t think this product would make much of a difference. I have seen a lot of raving reviews on YT. Just didn&#x27;t believe that I could get similar results. Now, of course texture and pattern and thickness of hair all play a part in any product use. Just try a sample. I am a believer in at least this product as a \\&quot;pre-styler\\&quot; I don&#x27;t use it as a leave in. I may try that next.</li>
            <li> Product was just as I was expecting, fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for natural girls who like a lot of &#x27;slip&#x27; when twisting their hair. My hair is on the dry side, and this product is great for moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> White chick with unruly red curls, was just about to cut it all off when I found this amazing product.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what I use as a styling product on top of this, my hair comes out amazing every single time I start with the smoothing lotion.  I will never be without it again!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased the Curl Junkie Smoothing Lotion, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be much different from any other leave-in conditioner, but I was very pleasantly surprised. As a black woman, I have leaned toward products that specifically say something about my hair type or ethnicity. This product addresses curly hair only, and I LOVE this stuff! It smoothes my naturally curly hair and prepares it for my styling products like no other leave-in I have ever used. All of my hair textures love it, and I have a few. So, whether you are purple, green, blue or see-through, try it. It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> The best leave in conditioner ever, it leaves my hair silky smooth and easy to manage, it does not leave your hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> Works great for my half relaxed, half natural, hair. Great smoothing and slip. A little pricey but I have found a keeper</li>
            <li> This product smells so good! I&#x27;ve used it a couple times on my hair when I wore it out (it is currently braided). I have 4b always-thirsty hair and this lotion is a quencher. The smell is not overpowering at all. It&#x27;s faint in the hair, but it smells very pleasant like a light body spray made of cotton candy bubble gum, in other words it&#x27;s not as potently strong as a perfume. As for the texture, it is not as thick as I thought and expected. The consistency is like a slightly watered down conditioner, so if you squeeze it in your palm, it wouldn&#x27;t hold in the shape squeezed out. At the same time, it wouldn&#x27;t run off your hand. So it&#x27;s a good in between consistency. When I put it on my hair, my hair feels instantly soft and the softness lasts and doesn&#x27;t dry out. Overall, it smells delightful, it&#x27;s very light and not greasy AT ALL (does not coat or weigh down hair), and it keeps your hair moisturized. It&#x27;s a staple of mine now and I love it! A little goes a long way! Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> This product is the best detangler I have ever used in my 25 years of experimenting with SO many curly hair products and detangler sprays and what not. I wish my mom knew about this stuff when I was a kid while she brushed my hair before school! LOL I used it as a leave in conditioner but the bottle says it can also be used as a rinse out conditioner. The smell is not that good at all but I use [[ASIN:B0030H0MK8 Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle! Hair Styling Solution - 12 oz]] on top of and it has a really nice &amp; light berry scent. I wish it came with a pump though :(</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.  Got this product from Amazon instead of the online store I usually use, because it was cheaper.  Product is great, softens and gives slip.</li>
            <li> This works really well in the warm months. I use it under gel. It gives lots of as shine and detangles well. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this smoothing lotion based on the recommendations of a YouTube video on natural hair and I love it. I alternate between this product and the Oyin Handmade Hair Dew. I think I actually like this the best. I use it as a leave in and/or moisturizer and it works well under the gels that I use for hold. The smoothing lotion gives a lot of slip and it smells really good. The only thing I&#x27;d suggest if you haven&#x27;t tried it before is to look at the ingredients and make sure there aren&#x27;t any listed that you try to avoid.</li>
            <li> Now let me start off by saying that I am a product junkie. I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my hair just to see what works, what doesn&#x27;t and what I can find that works better. This leave in is by far one of the best leave-in&#x27;s I&#x27;ve EVER used. It&#x27;s more than worth the money and you don&#x27;t have to use much. This product smells really good. Kind of like a light vanilla cotton candy. It&#x27;s subtle :). This conditioner left my hair extremely soft. I finally got that softness that I was always hoping the expensive wash-out conditioners would give me on their own but never did. This conditioner also made my hair extremely shiny. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen such a nice shine in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant about spending the money on this product then I&#x27;d suggest either just taking the plunge or maybe going onto curl junkie&#x27;s website and buying their massive pack of free-samples. That way at least one of the samples will more than likely work for you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reallyyyy looking forward to re-ordering this product :)</li>
            <li> my hair is tightly curled/kinky and I use this twice a week or whenever I co-wash, it goes on smooth, smells great, no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and the reason I purchased this was from a person I subscribe to on YouTube. Her hair is a different texture than mine but it was ok. I need to use it a few more times but I think it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I mix this Curl Assurance Smoothing Lotion, about a quarter sized amount, with 3-4 drops of Redken Diamond Oil (Black Bottle) and apply Curl Formers to my 2B/C thick, frizzy hair, and I end up with a smooth, frizz free result from the combination.  Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this and I still love it. Works great on curly hair. Highly reccomended. Adds shine and definition to my curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Im a woman of color and I have thick, tightly curled hair that gets extremely dry and brittle. I have tried some products in the past that left my hair soft right after i washed it, but when it dried it was nightmare. This product left my hair soft after I washed my hair which has never happened before. I use this product as a leave in FYI! Thanks curl junkie!!!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews...but this stuff is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has long curly hair.  Medium thickness.  I use this as her &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for styling.  Water, Curl Junkie Leave in Conditioner and top it off with Ouidad Moisturizing Styling Gel.  She&#x27;s got good curl all day.  Why pay $27 or more for 8 oz of Ouidad leave in Conditioner?  Curl Junkie gives you more for your money and works beautifully. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on different products...I&#x27;m done looking...this is it.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m 3c-4a Low Porosity mixed hair.  After I do my cowash, I apply this into the ends of my hair while my hair is wet. Immediately after, I also add Jane&#x27;s Solution styling cream. I love being beautiful. Works as a decent detangler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is the scent. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but as a male, I kind of try not to smell like an incense seller wearing perfume with a bundle of flowers at bath &amp; body works.  When my shaving cream smells like Sandalwood, lotion smells like Cocoa butter, deodorant smells like &amp;#34;cool rush&amp;#34;, breath smells like onions, and shirt smells like weed, I try to tone down the amount of smells I emit. Maybe it&#x27;s a girls thing, but it gets overbearing when all the products I use have a ton of different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring up scent too, because with this product, its definitely there. I&#x27;ve smelled stronger, so it&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable. I actually like the smell, but I imagine it might be too strong/distinct for others. I had my yoga teacher try it and she didn&#x27;t like the fragrance at all. I would describe it as Edible Baby Oil with Sugar and Cinnamon .</li>
            <li> This conditioner was made for my 3C curls. Its lightweight but moisturizing and helps my curls clump together. I use it as my first step in styling while my hair is soaking wet. I follow up with the Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle and a little of the Pattern Pusher with the Curl Queen...Oh and  It smells heavenly as do all the Curl Junkie products. I highly recommend this and the other products from their line.</li>
            <li> Love it! Detangles well on my daughters&#x27; hair. A necessary staple of my hair collection.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on natural hair products and this one does as advertised. It leaves hair moisturized and no more frizz and can be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my curl cream and it is the best for elongating and defining my curls.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my favorite curly red head.  She absolutely loves the product.  Her hair looks great with it.  She asked me where she could get more.  That means she would recommend it to other curlies!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use another leave in conditioner. I have 4b hair and it works magic every time.</li>
            <li> My new staple!!  Leaves my 4B/C feeling moisturized and has a wonderful scent!  Will purchase again!  Please know it has glycerin, so it&#x27;s great for the summer time.</li>
