            <li> The very first time it worked great. After a few wears it kind of move around under the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li> This product straightens my toe with manageable discomfort. Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This was for my grandmother, she said it helped a lot</li>
            <li> It really helps protect my toe from rubbing against the shoe.</li>
            <li> It is helping with the toe nerve pain that was constant...wearing the toe straightener the pain is much less...</li>
            <li> The straightener slipped off my toes</li>
            <li> I am bummed because it slips off where I place it no matter how hard I tighten it. It could just be my feet though. Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I had hammer toe surgery a year ago, and it was straightened but it sticks up.  This is working to hold it in place to keep from rubbing on shoes.  I think over time it will force it in place.  It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product.  Already starting to tear.  Not worth the money at all!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for the existing problem</li>
            <li> This has been a great help to my hammertoe.  It keeps it in place and avoids any discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving medical advice, merely reporting  my personal experiences with the product.    My case:  the toe next to the \\&quot;big toe\\&quot;  is called the \\&quot;second toe\\&quot; or \\&quot;long toe.\\&quot;    When I would curl my toes inward the \\&quot;long toe\\&quot;  would do two things  [] hump/bend up vertically (called hammer toe)  [] and at the same time  [] ride over on top of the \\&quot;big toe\\&quot;    My problem is not a severe case but enough  that I should do something about it  also my toes are not deformed in anyway.    Also in my case while wearing shoes  the condition as described above does not exist.    When home I wear socks around the house and  when curling my toes the condition would present itself.    That said: this product works 100%  for the condition described above...  don&#x27;t let the large pad scare you off, its comfortable  with shoes on or off...the product works.</li>
            <li> The device broke about five days.  A plastic disk around the strap pulled out.  That plastic disk should be larger. Also cutting the strap short&lt;br /&gt;after adjustment, not a good idea, can not reuse device.</li>
            <li> The hard surface that fits on the surface of the shoe did not work as well as a soft surface device that I had earlier.  Also the toe strap continually became loose thus did not separate the second toe from my big toe.</li>
            <li> I thought this would fail me but toe-siree! I&#x27;ve suffered with hammer toes all my life, thinking I needed surgery. My second toes seem long in comparison to the little ones, they are double jointed and curl downward. I could never wear sandals. While only surgery could make them shorter, this made them completely straight. My feet don&#x27;t look perfect, but they look good enough to show off and that exceeded my expectations. After a few days they stay straight for hours after you take it off but like with any brace they will go back to normal so I will be wearing them for months. But that&#x27;s no big deal because I forget I have them on. They are uncomfortable with shoes on so I took off a star. It definitely depends on your situation but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Helps my toe - keeps it flat.  Stays snug.  I had to gradually increase wear time - before it was most comfortable.</li>
            <li> This was same thing that I got from my Dr. plus so much cheaper</li>
            <li> The elastic is very tight around my hammer toe but it does function as it should.  The bottom board is rather stiff as well.  I have had others that are thinner, more flexible with less tight elastic but hopefully this will last longer and work well longer.</li>
            <li> Great toe straightener  i had my doubts if it works but it did.  It did not get rid of the hammer toe of course nothing will do that except surgery.  However is has help me put off surgery (I am moving) till i get moved.  it does straighten your toe and make it more comfortable to wear your shoes. You still have to protect the toe from rubbing when wearing shoes but it makes it a whole lot easier to wear shoes.</li>
