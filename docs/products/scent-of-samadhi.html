            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an all-natural body fragrance/deodorant, you will love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina &#x27;</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than 3 years now, as both deodorant/perfume.  </li>
            <li>i love it as perfume or to do yoga .</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells</li>
            <li>Great scent and really works well.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!!! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s interesting, because I tried Scent of Samadhi many years ago (maybe 6-8 yrs ago), and did not like the scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years because it is the most heavenly scent I have encountered.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how how invigorating and even sensual it smells.</li>
            <li>It smells like very cheap, extremely strong incense.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this on my yoga instructor and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t allow for any odor to come thru and the aroma is very nice but strong</li>
            <li>I use a natural one from a company called &amp;#34;ziryabs&amp;#34; that works great and has no smell.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love this , but it smelled like really strong cheap incense.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE the smell and it makes me feel like a RICH BEING each time i put it on.</li>
            <li>for me it brings me immediately to a centered peaceful place love it!</li>
            <li>The cheap perfume smell somehow becomes a strong neutralizer, and gives me this sense of VERY CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I heard about and saw the product from my GF&#x27;s brother, and when I ordered it, it was in my hands very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Still, go easy</li>
            <li>Really wish I could figure out how to make this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have said, the scent is incredibly effective and magically activates when you sweat.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was too strong at all.  </li>
            <li>You may not get along with the scent if you don&#x27;t like your perfume/cologne too strong.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased how quickly this came in the mail right before Christmas for my husband Domenick.</li>
            <li>Pure and amazing.</li>
            <li>Beautiful peaceful uplifting fragrance that soothes the spirit and can be a natural deodorant if you choose to use it that way.</li>
            <li>It works great as a personal perfume.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and people that smell it on me like the aroma.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and seems to blend in with your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely product - my only quibble is that I wish there were more of it in the jar!</li>
            <li>I have always had fast shipping and great product received from Sensitive planet.  </li>
            <li>I get frequent compliments in public about smelling great!  </li>
            <li>It comes in a soft lovely carry and storage pouch that adds just the right touch to an elegant product.  </li>
            <li>Exotic, light fragrance, natural deodorant substitute!</li>
            <li>I use it as a deodorant when going to the gym or Bikram yoga, and it keeps me smelling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>And it gives off an exotic feel that&#x27;s somehow soothing and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>and sheesh you could smell anyone wearing it from several feet away, and then it had a different twang to it that has been perfectly balanced in today&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>I like adding this product so that when I perspire from this Texas heat, there is no unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice natural deodorant for daily use but probably not the best for activities during which profuse sweating is expected.</li>
            <li>Scent of Samadhi isn&#x27;t too easy to find, especially outside of the US.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit more feminine than masculine, but it is nonetheless suitable for both.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Just lovely so amazing to put it on , you are immediately tranquil ,and you need so little</li>
            <li>I use VERY LITTLE of it, and it scents my car so beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is a totally natural product that has the most pleasing  and sensual scent.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used it before, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I normally love exotic mystic scents, and that&#x27;s what I expected here.</li>
            <li>My jar is more than a year old now, since I use it sparingly, and it still smells just as strongly and fresh as when it was new, with no weird notes.</li>
            <li>I use it right after bathing, and the scent literally stays with me all day and night.</li>
            <li>First underarm deoderant I have ever used where I get complements on how nice I smell on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>, i haven&#x27;t had this kind of scent before with such a reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>it smells sooooo nice and sweet/feminine/earthy, b. lasts all day long, and c. is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I felt like it smelled anything but natural and was so strong that anyone embracing a clean natural smell would not like this.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at a yoga school.</li>
            <li>At night, I rub my finger along the inside of the top to get a tiny bit of residue and touch it between my nose and lip so that I can sleep smelling it.</li>
            <li>My first jar lasted about 6-7 months.  </li>
            <li>I first learned about the product from my yoga teacher.</li>
            <li>When I finish this jar, I will definitely buy some more.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this scent equally because a.</li>
            <li>I applied the powder as directed and can say that it does deodorize pleasantly and for the entire day and into the next.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this available for us, Sensitive Planet!</li>
            <li>I remembered how impressed Domenick was with the  fresh, subtle, pure scent of this product and I purchased it (at the last minute before Christmas).</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny pinch of this stuff to make you smell good all day.</li>
            <li>But it really works, it completely masks any sweat smellâ€¦and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really works as a fantastic deodorant, just a tiny pinch works, even on the hottest days!</li>
            <li>I found it really enhances my yoga practice.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>You control how much you put on so</li>
            <li>This works very well for me.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell, very unnatural.</li>
            <li>This, though, really deserves that tag line.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I find the scent very calming.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I was into aromatherapy lately and it had good reviews, but this scent is not for me</li>
            <li>Not only did I find this product to be exceptional, to know that the proceeds went to help single mothers and retired their sacred livestock was an honor to me.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want a very strong scent, you put on less...</li>
            <li>I admit I&#x27;m at a loss to try to put the scent itself into precise words, but I will say that if you really prefer incense from India to that made in other parts of the world, you will likely love this, too.</li>
            <li>I am sure it could also trigger migraines or other maladies for those with fragrance issues.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I both use it, great fragrance, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It works better than any of the other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Whatever tops you wear with this scent will retain the scent even into future wears (gets clean after washing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also wanted to say, you can purchase it more cheaply directly from the Sensitive Planet website, especially if you buy in quantity.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, and I love having a natural deodorizer without breathing in the toxins of other fragrant products.</li>
            <li>One jar last 2 months for me, so the price is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>The smell stays and it&#x27;s not super strong</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>because the price is a little high, and because perhaps a man would benefit from an extra, more masculine ingredient.</li>
            <li>I like to use a natural Crystal deodorant stone straight out of the shower (no scent) and apply this shortly after.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not overpowering and works with your natural scent.</li>
            <li>I have replaced my old deoderant as well as parfume with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is like wearing an essential oil blend that lasts soooo much longer than the oils.  </li>
            <li>So it may be good for others, but if you like faint, natural smells</li>
            <li>Really loved the smell and the concept when I bought this but just as a warning to others after using it for about 10 days, I noticed my food started tasting different which continued to get worse until my food started tasting like this product.</li>
            <li>How I came across this heavenly scent, was when a friend from one of my meditation circles was sitting next to me on one particular occasion, and I couldn&#x27;t help but take notice to the hypnotic fragrance emanating from her.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying wholesale direct from Sensitive Planet 6 or more to keep down the price down.  </li>
            <li>I wear it as a perfume, and it has tremendous staying power; for the rest of the day, as another reviewer notes, every time I move I get a little whiff of it.</li>
            <li>I just got a new one that smelled like it was almost entirely cloves.</li>
            <li>She worried a little that other women might like it on me but requested I buy more.</li>
            <li>I have had this for six months and have barely put a dent in it!</li>
            <li>and they said the very fresh batch( which looks dark) will smell like cloves and if it is  &#x27;aired &#x27;for a day or so  the other essential oils will kick in &amp; it will assume the normal scent.</li>
            <li>I just use a little amount each day and it makes me feel so Fresh and Fragrant.</li>
            <li>- you don&#x27;t need much and it last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and so my body odor is not the same as when I was a meat eater; but the tiny pinch, as directed, into the deep part of the underarm (where it kind of sinks into a hollow), works for me all day, and my day is very long.</li>
            <li>Usually when a product makes claims along the lines of \\&quot;smells like heaven!\\&quot; I just smile to myself and move along.</li>
            <li>I was not overtaken with the gentle scent and in fact will often breath deeply when it occasionally released probably due to sweating, because I find it relaxing.</li>
            <li>It -is- a complex scent, very strong, and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>I use just a little, it can be overpowering if too much is used.</li>
            <li>or I think it can be a little too much.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an all-natural body fragrance/deodorant, you will love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina &#x27;</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than 3 years now, as both deodorant/perfume.  </li>
            <li> i love it as perfume or to do yoga .</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it smells</li>
            <li> Great scent and really works well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product!!! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting, because I tried Scent of Samadhi many years ago (maybe 6-8 yrs ago), and did not like the scent at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years because it is the most heavenly scent I have encountered.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how how invigorating and even sensual it smells.</li>
            <li> It smells like very cheap, extremely strong incense.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on my yoga instructor and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t allow for any odor to come thru and the aroma is very nice but strong</li>
            <li> I use a natural one from a company called &amp;#34;ziryabs&amp;#34; that works great and has no smell.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this , but it smelled like really strong cheap incense.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE the smell and it makes me feel like a RICH BEING each time i put it on.</li>
            <li> for me it brings me immediately to a centered peaceful place love it!</li>
            <li> The cheap perfume smell somehow becomes a strong neutralizer, and gives me this sense of VERY CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I heard about and saw the product from my GF&#x27;s brother, and when I ordered it, it was in my hands very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Still, go easy</li>
            <li> Really wish I could figure out how to make this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have said, the scent is incredibly effective and magically activates when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was too strong at all.  </li>
            <li> You may not get along with the scent if you don&#x27;t like your perfume/cologne too strong.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased how quickly this came in the mail right before Christmas for my husband Domenick.</li>
            <li> Pure and amazing.</li>
            <li> Beautiful peaceful uplifting fragrance that soothes the spirit and can be a natural deodorant if you choose to use it that way.</li>
            <li> It works great as a personal perfume.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and people that smell it on me like the aroma.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and seems to blend in with your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely product - my only quibble is that I wish there were more of it in the jar!</li>
            <li> I have always had fast shipping and great product received from Sensitive planet.  </li>
            <li> I get frequent compliments in public about smelling great!  </li>
            <li> It comes in a soft lovely carry and storage pouch that adds just the right touch to an elegant product.  </li>
            <li> Exotic, light fragrance, natural deodorant substitute!</li>
            <li> I use it as a deodorant when going to the gym or Bikram yoga, and it keeps me smelling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> And it gives off an exotic feel that&#x27;s somehow soothing and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li> and sheesh you could smell anyone wearing it from several feet away, and then it had a different twang to it that has been perfectly balanced in today&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> I like adding this product so that when I perspire from this Texas heat, there is no unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice natural deodorant for daily use but probably not the best for activities during which profuse sweating is expected.</li>
            <li> Scent of Samadhi isn&#x27;t too easy to find, especially outside of the US.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit more feminine than masculine, but it is nonetheless suitable for both.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Just lovely so amazing to put it on , you are immediately tranquil ,and you need so little</li>
            <li> I use VERY LITTLE of it, and it scents my car so beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is a totally natural product that has the most pleasing  and sensual scent.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used it before, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I normally love exotic mystic scents, and that&#x27;s what I expected here.</li>
            <li> My jar is more than a year old now, since I use it sparingly, and it still smells just as strongly and fresh as when it was new, with no weird notes.</li>
            <li> I use it right after bathing, and the scent literally stays with me all day and night.</li>
            <li> First underarm deoderant I have ever used where I get complements on how nice I smell on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> , i haven&#x27;t had this kind of scent before with such a reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> it smells sooooo nice and sweet/feminine/earthy, b. lasts all day long, and c. is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I felt like it smelled anything but natural and was so strong that anyone embracing a clean natural smell would not like this.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a yoga school.</li>
            <li> At night, I rub my finger along the inside of the top to get a tiny bit of residue and touch it between my nose and lip so that I can sleep smelling it.</li>
            <li> My first jar lasted about 6-7 months.  </li>
            <li> I first learned about the product from my yoga teacher.</li>
            <li> When I finish this jar, I will definitely buy some more.  </li>
            <li> I truly love this scent equally because a.</li>
            <li> I applied the powder as directed and can say that it does deodorize pleasantly and for the entire day and into the next.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this available for us, Sensitive Planet!</li>
            <li> I remembered how impressed Domenick was with the  fresh, subtle, pure scent of this product and I purchased it (at the last minute before Christmas).</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny pinch of this stuff to make you smell good all day.</li>
            <li> But it really works, it completely masks any sweat smellâ€¦and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really works as a fantastic deodorant, just a tiny pinch works, even on the hottest days!</li>
            <li> I found it really enhances my yoga practice.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> You control how much you put on so</li>
            <li> This works very well for me.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell, very unnatural.</li>
            <li> This, though, really deserves that tag line.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find the scent very calming.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I was into aromatherapy lately and it had good reviews, but this scent is not for me</li>
            <li> Not only did I find this product to be exceptional, to know that the proceeds went to help single mothers and retired their sacred livestock was an honor to me.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want a very strong scent, you put on less...</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;m at a loss to try to put the scent itself into precise words, but I will say that if you really prefer incense from India to that made in other parts of the world, you will likely love this, too.</li>
            <li> I am sure it could also trigger migraines or other maladies for those with fragrance issues.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use it, great fragrance, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It works better than any of the other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Whatever tops you wear with this scent will retain the scent even into future wears (gets clean after washing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also wanted to say, you can purchase it more cheaply directly from the Sensitive Planet website, especially if you buy in quantity.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, and I love having a natural deodorizer without breathing in the toxins of other fragrant products.</li>
            <li> One jar last 2 months for me, so the price is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell stays and it&#x27;s not super strong</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> because the price is a little high, and because perhaps a man would benefit from an extra, more masculine ingredient.</li>
            <li> I like to use a natural Crystal deodorant stone straight out of the shower (no scent) and apply this shortly after.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overpowering and works with your natural scent.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my old deoderant as well as parfume with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is like wearing an essential oil blend that lasts soooo much longer than the oils.  </li>
            <li> So it may be good for others, but if you like faint, natural smells</li>
            <li> Really loved the smell and the concept when I bought this but just as a warning to others after using it for about 10 days, I noticed my food started tasting different which continued to get worse until my food started tasting like this product.</li>
            <li> How I came across this heavenly scent, was when a friend from one of my meditation circles was sitting next to me on one particular occasion, and I couldn&#x27;t help but take notice to the hypnotic fragrance emanating from her.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying wholesale direct from Sensitive Planet 6 or more to keep down the price down.  </li>
            <li> I wear it as a perfume, and it has tremendous staying power; for the rest of the day, as another reviewer notes, every time I move I get a little whiff of it.</li>
            <li> I just got a new one that smelled like it was almost entirely cloves.</li>
            <li> She worried a little that other women might like it on me but requested I buy more.</li>
            <li> I have had this for six months and have barely put a dent in it!</li>
            <li> and they said the very fresh batch( which looks dark) will smell like cloves and if it is  &#x27;aired &#x27;for a day or so  the other essential oils will kick in &amp; it will assume the normal scent.</li>
            <li> I just use a little amount each day and it makes me feel so Fresh and Fragrant.</li>
            <li> - you don&#x27;t need much and it last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and so my body odor is not the same as when I was a meat eater; but the tiny pinch, as directed, into the deep part of the underarm (where it kind of sinks into a hollow), works for me all day, and my day is very long.</li>
            <li> Usually when a product makes claims along the lines of \\&quot;smells like heaven!\\&quot; I just smile to myself and move along.</li>
            <li> I was not overtaken with the gentle scent and in fact will often breath deeply when it occasionally released probably due to sweating, because I find it relaxing.</li>
            <li> It -is- a complex scent, very strong, and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use just a little, it can be overpowering if too much is used.</li>
            <li> or I think it can be a little too much.  </li>
            <li> Am on my second order, but it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Natural powder, slightly damp.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it seems to mix well with my natural scent instead of just covering it up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent smells like cheap perfume to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever and just the tiniest bit goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> I can even skip putting it on every other day when I&#x27;m running low and it still seems to do its job.</li>
            <li> While it seems expensive it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> stated by the seller, only a small amount of the product will suffice, lasting well over</li>
            <li> This will last forever, because I used less than a pinch.</li>
            <li> but it still seems expensive because you get a very small jar, but I can forgive it because it says some of the money it earned goes to retired sacred cows in India and other charitable organizations.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and dresses like other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I do not use chemical perfumes, lotions, sprays, etc., and this has been the only &#x27;fragrance&#x27; that I&#x27;ve worn for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> , I know a small pinch goes a long way</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and you can in fact smell the fragrance opening up after a few hours, something that i never experienced with any other &#x27;deodorant&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 5*</li>
            <li> Not a great scent to wear!I saw two recent bad reviews taking about a strong unnatural smell.</li>
            <li> It is a scent you&#x27;d have to like though - earthy, slight floral, and smells a bit like in-scents.</li>
            <li> One  would have never said that about their product previously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this in the past and it&#x27;ll last me a year at least.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looooong way</li>
            <li> I get a little whiff of it.</li>
            <li> If I need some moisture absorption too I sprinkle a little baby powder along with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little too feminine</li>
            <li> All in all I can&#x27;t find one down side to this stuff!</li>
            <li> a few years ago while visiting us.</li>
            <li> Just sprinkle a pinch of the perfume powder on the automobile console and it lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> One small jar lasts a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> Use very little.</li>
            <li> And this product is expensive, though it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I believe I read at least one review suggesting the idea.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to worry about negative odors.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and smokey and improves with wearing.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend goes crazy when she gets close to me!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;A +&amp;#34; Grade product. This is the second time I am using this product. There was a gap of 1 year when i was not using it. Somehow I was missing this product so much that after 1 year I just had to go in and order it again. I just LOVE the smell and it makes me feel like a RICH BEING each time i put it on. I just use a little amount each day and it makes me feel so Fresh and Fragrant. Great Value for money. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;11 stars :)</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this , but it smelled like really strong cheap incense. I felt like it smelled anything but natural and was so strong that anyone embracing a clean natural smell would not like this. I am sure it could also trigger migraines or other maladies for those with fragrance issues. So it may be good for others, but if you like faint, natural smells this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased how quickly this came in the mail right before Christmas for my husband Domenick. My dearest friend suggested this to me  since Domenick won&#x27;t wear cologne anymore and my friend had worn scent of samadhi  a few years ago while visiting us. I remembered how impressed Domenick was with the  fresh, subtle, pure scent of this product and I purchased it (at the last minute before Christmas). It&#x27;s wonderful and he was so happy to receive it for Christmas!</li>
            <li> The scent is awesome and it lasts all day!  A little bit goes a long way. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. I love the fragrance and lasts for many hours. A tiny bit goes a very long way. Makes a wonderful underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> The dominant scent in this powder is rose, but it&#x27;s woven together with woods and spices. A really beautiful, unique scent. I found it really enhances my yoga practice.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product. It is very subtle and smokey and improves with wearing. I use just a little, it can be overpowering if too much is used.</li>
            <li> Not only for dudettes, but also for dudes!  This is a totally natural product that has the most pleasing  and sensual scent.  A little goes a looooong way - you don&#x27;t need much and it last for a long time.  It has lasted me about 4 months with daily use.  I figured it was time for a review from a dude for dudes!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use it, great fragrance, a little goes a long way. I use it in place of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice. It lasts forever and just the tiniest bit goes a really long way. I love this smell.</li>
            <li> get scent...i bought it for my girlfriend but i use it from time to time. a little goes a long...</li>
            <li> I used a salt stick and this for deodarant and never looked back. Pure and amazing. Powerful beautiful natural delicious goddess scent. I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely wonderful. Everytime I move I get a little whiff of it. It&#x27;s not over powering. And it gives off an exotic feel that&#x27;s somehow soothing and sexy at the same time. Those who don&#x27;t like sexy and exotic Would have a problem with it. I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d use it again and again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its the best deodorant ive ever used.  Love it</li>
            <li> The smell is simply heavenly.  If I need some moisture absorption too I sprinkle a little baby powder along with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. It works great as a personal perfume. I also use as an automobile scent and deodorizer. Just sprinkle a pinch of the perfume powder on the automobile console and it lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> Earthy, musky scent.  Does seem to last all day yet unobtrusive all the same.  Nice natural deodorant for daily use but probably not the best for activities during which profuse sweating is expected.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a yoga school. Was happy to see it at Amazon.  Beautifully scented in the Indian tradition -- the scent of incense mixes with scent of skin. Natural powder, slightly damp. Use very little. Wonderful. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells divine.  I use it as a deodorant when going to the gym or Bikram yoga, and it keeps me smelling fresh and clean.  A little goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Beautiful peaceful uplifting fragrance that soothes the spirit and can be a natural deodorant if you choose to use it that way. Safe and effective and supports some wonderful causes as well. It just doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> I am a return customer and will re-order soon.</li>
            <li> Great i will order it again</li>
            <li> When I opened this jar and breathed in the scent, I immediately relaxed and knew I&#x27;d made a good decision to purchase it. I applied the powder as directed and can say that it does deodorize pleasantly and for the entire day and into the next. I was not overtaken with the gentle scent and in fact will often breath deeply when it occasionally released probably due to sweating, because I find it relaxing. At night, I rub my finger along the inside of the top to get a tiny bit of residue and touch it between my nose and lip so that I can sleep smelling it. It is very relaxing. I have to be fair and say that I am a vegetarian and so my body odor is not the same as when I was a meat eater; but the tiny pinch, as directed, into the deep part of the underarm (where it kind of sinks into a hollow), works for me all day, and my day is very long. I love it! The only thing I would advice is a change in the description to let buyers know that there is a tiny white plastic dispenser in the pull string bag. I didn&#x27;t notice it and actually dropped and stepped on it, breaking it. But I glued it back together and wrapped it in order to use it until I got my immediately ordered second jar that had one in tact. It is much better at measuring than using my finger nail. Thanks for having this available for us, Sensitive Planet!</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t allow for any odor to come thru and the aroma is very nice but strong so you are gonna have to love it.  Works as a fragrance on its own.  I enjoy using it and people that smell it on me like the aroma.</li>
            <li> Literally smells like heaven... *sigh*</li>
            <li> This is really amazing!!, i haven&#x27;t had this kind of scent before with such a reasonable prices. Good to have it. 5 stars....</li>
            <li> I am using just a tiny amount for all over body scent. It gives me a sense of peace and is an instant stress reducer. I love it!</li>
            <li> Incredible! The smell stays and it&#x27;s not super strong it&#x27;s very pleasant</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. First underarm deoderant I have ever used where I get complements on how nice I smell on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on my yoga instructor and immediately loved it. The scent lasts all day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Bought some for sister who bought some fro her friend.</li>
            <li> Scent of Samadhi isn&#x27;t too easy to find, especially outside of the US.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit more feminine than masculine, but it is nonetheless suitable for both.&lt;br /&gt;As stated by the seller, only a small amount of the product will suffice, lasting well over a day.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and you can in fact smell the fragrance opening up after a few hours, something that i never experienced with any other &#x27;deodorant&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 5* because the price is a little high, and because perhaps a man would benefit from an extra, more masculine ingredient. Apart from that i think the product is really good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!! It smells amazing! I don&#x27;t even have to wear perfume and people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing and if I do wear perfume it seems to enhance the fragrance. It works better than any of the other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve even tried the clinical strength stuff. When I wear this I haven&#x27;t had any body odor problem whatsoever. I can even skip putting it on every other day when I&#x27;m running low and it still seems to do its job. It also doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and dresses like other deodorants. All in all I can&#x27;t find one down side to this stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its a great alternative to chemical deodorants</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites. If you&#x27;ve never used it before, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> Exotic, light fragrance, natural deodorant substitute! Great for men or women alike. Love. Recommend it highly, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works as a deodorant because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it so I threw it away. It smells like very cheap, extremely strong incense.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this at Shakti Fest in Joshua Tree, CA.  It is the best scent ever.  Very sexy.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  Am on my second order, but it lasts a long time.  My first jar lasted about 6-7 months.  The scent is very exotic, earthy and sensual.  I didn&#x27;t think it was too strong at all.  You control how much you put on so if you don&#x27;t want a very strong scent, you put on less...simple!!!  It comes in a soft lovely carry and storage pouch that adds just the right touch to an elegant product.  Would make a perfect gift for that special lady in your life, whether she is your mother, aunt, sister, daughter, cousin, lover, wife.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny pinch of this stuff to make you smell good all day. My boyfriend has asthma and hates most perfumes, but he doesn&#x27;t mind Samadhi. One canister can lasts for months or possibly years. This ancient ayurvedic herbal blend contains no colors, chemicals or animal products. It is vegan!</li>
            <li> always a great product.</li>
            <li> Really loved the smell and the concept when I bought this but just as a warning to others after using it for about 10 days, I noticed my food started tasting different which continued to get worse until my food started tasting like this product. I haven&#x27;t seen this be an issue for anyone else but if it happens to anyone else, know that you aren&#x27;t the only one. Stopped using it about 10 days ago and it still hasn&#x27;t resolved.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite products now for 10 + years</li>
            <li> I love the earthy scent...it&#x27;s not overpowering and works with your natural scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I thought it might be a little too feminine but my girlfriend loves it on me. She worried a little that other women might like it on me but requested I buy more. A little goes a long way and it seems to mix well with my natural scent instead of just covering it up.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this as it wears through the day. It blends with your own smell and smells exotic, a bit like tashi incense if you know that smell. It does not work as a sole deodorant for me. I use a natural one from a company called &amp;#34;ziryabs&amp;#34; that works great and has no smell. When I mix them, I get perfection.</li>
            <li> This product is safe and effective.  The fragrance blends with my body chemistry without the additives from retail deoderants.  This one container has lasted me about 9 months.  This works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, instead of deodorant. I get compliments allnthebtime, and have hooked some friends and family on it.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I was into aromatherapy lately and it had good reviews, but this scent is not for me, I know a small pinch goes a long way but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell, very unnatural. And this product is expensive, though it lasts a long time but it still seems expensive because you get a very small jar, but I can forgive it because it says some of the money it earned goes to retired sacred cows in India and other charitable organizations.</li>
            <li> Made my dog wheeze and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Usually when a product makes claims along the lines of \\&quot;smells like heaven!\\&quot; I just smile to myself and move along. This, though, really deserves that tag line. It -is- a complex scent, very strong, and a little does go a long way. I wear it as a perfume, and it has tremendous staying power; for the rest of the day, as another reviewer notes, every time I move I get a little whiff of it. You may not get along with the scent if you don&#x27;t like your perfume/cologne too strong. I admit I&#x27;m at a loss to try to put the scent itself into precise words, but I will say that if you really prefer incense from India to that made in other parts of the world, you will likely love this, too. My jar is more than a year old now, since I use it sparingly, and it still smells just as strongly and fresh as when it was new, with no weird notes. By the way, this isn&#x27;t a solid perfume/deodorant: it&#x27;s a brown powder. I&#x27;ve never had it either show up on my clothes or stain them. It&#x27;s also never given me any kind of skin reaction, evem though I&#x27;m a bit allergic to scents used in laundry soaps. Superb stuff.</li>
            <li> They delivered just as they promised.  I heard about and saw the product from my GF&#x27;s brother, and when I ordered it, it was in my hands very quickly.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> when i go have energy healing done my healer uses this scent..for me it brings me immediately to a centered peaceful place love it!</li>
            <li> Not only did I find this product to be exceptional, to know that the proceeds went to help single mothers and retired their sacred livestock was an honor to me. The product has been a source of peace to me and the smell works just as described. Will and would order this again, as it is all that it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell of this! While it seems expensive it is well worth it! I have had this for six months and have barely put a dent in it! I just love the exotic scent of this! My girlfriend goes crazy when she gets close to me! thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I first learned about the product from my yoga teacher. She would apply it on our foreheads during the meditation and I was enjoying the fragrance for the rest of the day. I was so happy to see it on Amazon. It is pricey but you need just a tiny bit. It also mixes with your scent and smells differently on each person.</li>
            <li> I normally love exotic mystic scents, and that&#x27;s what I expected here. Unfortunately, the scent smells like cheap perfume to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I LOVE though, is that I use it to scent my car. I believe I read at least one review suggesting the idea. I use VERY LITTLE of it, and it scents my car so beautifully. The cheap perfume smell somehow becomes a strong neutralizer, and gives me this sense of VERY CLEAN. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, and I love having a natural deodorizer without breathing in the toxins of other fragrant products. This will last forever, because I used less than a pinch. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I do not use chemical perfumes, lotions, sprays, etc., and this has been the only &#x27;fragrance&#x27; that I&#x27;ve worn for the past 2 years. How I came across this heavenly scent, was when a friend from one of my meditation circles was sitting next to me on one particular occasion, and I couldn&#x27;t help but take notice to the hypnotic fragrance emanating from her. After class, I asked her what she was wearing, and that&#x27;s when she told me about Samadhi. I use it right after bathing, and the scent literally stays with me all day and night. I can&#x27;t tell you how many people comment on &#x27;how nice I smell&#x27;, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine wearing anything else. One jar last 2 months for me, so the price is absolutely worth it. If you&#x27;re looking for an all-natural body fragrance/deodorant, you will love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina &#x27;The Veggie Goddess&#x27; Matthews....vegetarian/vegan author and blogger</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than 3 years now, as both deodorant/perfume.  I like to use a natural Crystal deodorant stone straight out of the shower (no scent) and apply this shortly after. As others have indicated in their reviews, the scent is delightful, wonderful for both men &amp; women.  I use it daily and each jar lasts me about 4-6 months, you need only a tiny amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to say, you can purchase it more cheaply directly from the Sensitive Planet website, especially if you buy in quantity.  I just bought 2 of them for about $26 each plus shipping which was about $5.  So they were still under $30 each including shipping.  If you buy 6, they are $22 each.  So if you can afford to stock up or have a friend to split an order with, you can save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Have been using this powder for years. I have always had fast shipping and great product received from Sensitive planet.  I suggest buying wholesale direct from Sensitive Planet 6 or more to keep down the price down.  I&#x27;ve done this in the past and it&#x27;ll last me a year at least.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Just lovely so amazing to put it on , you are immediately tranquil ,and you need so little i love it as perfume or to do yoga .</li>
            <li> This product is everything it says it is. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I use the Scent of Samadhi every day.  I stopped using any perfume since I have this.  It has a light fragrance and seems to blend in with your body chemistry.  When I finish this jar, I will definitely buy some more.  It lasts quite a while and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best.  No harmful chemicals.  Natural, woodsy wonderful smell - I get frequent compliments in public about smelling great!  People want to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my old deoderant as well as parfume with this product.  I LOVE the way it smells and I do not have to worry about negative odors.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product - my only quibble is that I wish there were more of it in the jar!</li>
            <li> Great scent and really works well. It&#x27;s a really  nice earthy smell that isn&#x27;t too strong or pungent.</li>
            <li> This produce is amazing! I always get comments on how good I smell! The produce does last 3 plus months too! I will continue to order this produce!! Thank you for such a wonderful product!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year.  Since I don&#x27;t use antiperspirant, and only use a salt crystal, I like adding this product so that when I perspire from this Texas heat, there is no unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I smell good now when I sweatâ€¦who can say that. It actually smells like I&#x27;m wearing perfume and people compliment me all the time. It is a scent you&#x27;d have to like though - earthy, slight floral, and smells a bit like in-scents. But it really works, it completely masks any sweat smellâ€¦and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> Ooh la la, I have found my signature scent. I truly love this scent equally because a. it smells sooooo nice and sweet/feminine/earthy, b. lasts all day long, and c. is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to wear a scent but I can not handle synthetic perfumes at all.  They just give me a headache and a runny  nose. Real essential oils (like from Simplers or YoungLiving) do not bother me at all.  This is like wearing an essential oil blend that lasts soooo much longer than the oils.  Whatever tops you wear with this scent will retain the scent even into future wears (gets clean after washing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting, because I tried Scent of Samadhi many years ago (maybe 6-8 yrs ago), and did not like the scent at all.  It was big back then in the LA yogi scene and sheesh you could smell anyone wearing it from several feet away, and then it had a different twang to it that has been perfectly balanced in today&#x27;s product.  Still, go easy or I think it can be a little too much.  Really wish I could figure out how to make this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have said, the scent is incredibly effective and magically activates when you sweat.  How amazing is that!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years because it is the most heavenly scent I have encountered. I just got a new one that smelled like it was almost entirely cloves. Not a great scent to wear!I saw two recent bad reviews taking about a strong unnatural smell. One  would have never said that about their product previously.  I called the company and they said the very fresh batch( which looks dark) will smell like cloves and if it is  &#x27;aired &#x27;for a day or so  the other essential oils will kick in &amp; it will assume the normal scent. Wanting to spread the word because it is a great product &amp; company.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Really works as a fantastic deodorant, just a tiny pinch works, even on the hottest days! I really recommend it. One small jar lasts a little over 2 months. I find the scent very calming.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> What a great product to use instead of chemical deodorants! I love how how invigorating and even sensual it smells. I am sold on this!</li>
