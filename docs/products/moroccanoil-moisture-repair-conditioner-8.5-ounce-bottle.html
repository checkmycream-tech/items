            <li>I enjoyed this conditioner, but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.</li>
            <li>Be sure to pair with the shampoo, I get the best results that way!</li>
            <li>Good product...  </li>
            <li>and this is not as conditioning as I hoped but still a good product.</li>
            <li>If the comb glides through my hair, I know it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and loved it.</li>
            <li>Yes.. its that good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as products purchased from MO website.</li>
            <li>It makes it smell really good</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and this bottle was not as good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it every day because I have very fine hair, but it is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>It smells so great and leaves my hair feeling great and keep it clean looking, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>

            <li>Plus, it smells freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great customer service and the fantastic price.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It was good and brought shine to my hair, but I still need more moisturizer;</li>
            <li>Super great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed this product so much that I ended up splurging and getting the Moroccanoil curl creme and that is wonderful as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but in my case the hair get oiled easy.</li>
            <li>smell stays... best of there products so far.</li>
            <li>Came quick- works great and was authentic from the company I received it from.</li>
            <li>I have thick/coarse curly to tight curly hair and this works great, and smells great too!</li>
            <li>I love how wonderfully smooth and healthy my hair is (plus people compliment how my hair smells!)</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li>my Hair needed more Moisture and this did the job.</li>
            <li>ITS EVEN BETTER IF YOU GO</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that so many women love this product line.</li>
            <li>All told, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the shampoo and conditioner for women who want smoother, shinier hair, though for women who want more texture, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>but that was ok.</li>
            <li>like the shampoo better.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and also the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling fabulous!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll know why so many people like this product.</li>
            <li>Sincerely  Dale</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is now sooo shiney and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have recommended this to me, and I am so glad I listened.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>You dont need more.  </li>
            <li>Better than Ive ever seen it.  </li>
            <li>so tonight, Im ordering another for me :-)</li>
            <li>this conditioner for my type of hair is ok, I have try  better products to better price</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair smell and feel.  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I bought Finesse moisturizing conditioner for 3.69 and it is infinitely better than this garbage.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>But I love all Moroccanoil products.  </li>
            <li>Im ordering more today.</li>
            <li>My hair feels better if I used &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; than when I use this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I paid more money for this product because I needed some help with my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I Used as a conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then the mask, so I use it once a week as I would do the mask</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner &amp; I also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; great price.</li>
            <li>Love the thickness of it.</li>
            <li>Waiting to see more benefits with continuous use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This has garnered many a handsome man exclaiming, &amp;#34;You smell so good!!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The Volume conditioner is a much better conditioner.</li>
            <li>love conditioner</li>
            <li>Love the Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li>They leave the hair clean, smooth, managable and smelling soooo good.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many salon products and Moroccanoil oil is by far the most superier - and it smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve used in a LONG time!</li>
            <li>Makes my tangly, curly hair so easy to comb out after washing.</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy &amp; my order arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Price-wise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The product inside seems fine</li>
            <li>Fantastic Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil Moisture Repair conditioner is absolutely fantastic in stopping this (as is the oil).  </li>
            <li>There will never ever be a product as fabulous as Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Conditioner . . .</li>
            <li>And yes, I have several great shampoos that I switch off depending on my hair and what Ive been doing with it.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had more success in that area with OTC drugstore Moroccan oil conditioners.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this was a genuine morocco oil product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes it smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li>aware!!</li>
            <li>would like to know before purchase if it is an original product and packing .</li>
            <li>about the size of two normal sized bananas put together, makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a very long time and it is great.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome stuff and the price is a bit high but worth it as I have tried many other products and they don&#x27;t work as well as this.</li>
            <li>Amazing conditioner that has helped my hair go from extremely damaged to extremely healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hair which tends to become very dry.</li>
            <li>It was just as if i had purchased it at the full price or from a salon</li>
            <li>If I can get this product and other Moroccan Oil products at great pricing I will be a forever</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells as great as the other Moroccanoil products.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a combination of products by Lanza and Aquage, which were seriously working wonderfully, until I went to a Bumble and Bumble salon and the stylist recommended the Moroccanoil line.</li>
            <li>Hair gets more unmanageable as one gets older and this conditioner does well to help manage hair paired with morrocan oil</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>You can get the same or better quality from Lanza (or Aqua I&#x27;m told) for a significantly better price.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product very much.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair smell and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>I only wish it smelled more like the shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling moisturized, smooth, soft, but strong as it has protein in it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and even received compliments on how great my hair smelled, but the price is crazy when there are so many knock offs on the market for it now.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this made my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny besides love the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is really nice without feeling like a film is left over from the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I feel it is DEFINITELY worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>so others will know that, in my opinion, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>, I really was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Considering I dye my hair bi-monthly and straighten it weekly, my hair is in good condition, in part due to this conditioner.</li>
            <li>she was right-</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of conditioners for my naturally curly dry hair and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>I love the regular Morrocan oil that is used to smooth hair and add shine, but this conditioner was not any better in quality than a $5 conditioner i could buy at a regular drugstore.</li>
            <li>It is really nothing special.</li>
            <li>It lasted me a good two and a half months.</li>
            <li>Good though for normal to slightly dry.</li>
            <li>Makes the hair soft and silky, and seems to do fine with colour-treated hair.</li>
            <li>my Hair looked back to being Healthy looking ,this repaired like it&#x27;s suppose to do my dry,Frizzy Split Ends</li>
            <li>I only had to use a dime size amount to make my hair feel like magic when I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>If you have coarse or frizzy hair, this product will smooth your locks and leave your hair shiny &amp; bouncy!</li>
            <li>I have had the keratin treatment and this shampoo is perfect for it because it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the ingredients that ruin the treatment which is expensive.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair being easier to style after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try for anyone that wants to splurge and treat your hair to a luxurious product.</li>
            <li>I got re married in 2011</li>
            <li>and i deal with a lot of dryness and static, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Might be of better use for a different hair type</li>
            <li>My all time favorite conditioner is the conditioner that comes with the loreal ever creme dye, but this ties for second with Pantene (for women of color).</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this line the last time I was with my stylist.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for my very coarse, very dry, very stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it and plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years and it&#x27;s great on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This repairs from dry ends way better than Matrix® Biolage Ultra Hydra Source.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out super soft and straight.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my ends, as I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair I would recommend the extra body conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and applying a dollop instead of your normal conditioner and leaving it in for 5-10 minutes will give you such sleek, shiny hair</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>The conditioner soaks into the hair, it&#x27;s really hydrating and my hair no longer feels crispy.</li>
            <li>and this really adds the moisture it</li>
            <li>IF YOU OVER PROCESS YOUR HAIR, BLEACH, LIGHT BLONDE,</li>
            <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li>I also use Nick Chavez Affinity spray when it is drying on the very ends to give body and curl.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels on my hair, too.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>because contains to much oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner for my virgin remy hair.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it with the shampoo because I love Organix Brazilian Keratin (the pink one).</li>
            <li>I expected more from this brand.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy again because of the price, but at least it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>different from the original bottle,fills suspicious.</li>
            <li>I spend a bit more on the other product lines I use.</li>
            <li>This is great for damaged hair, and a little goes and extremely long way.</li>
            <li>My favorite Conditioner and I have never seen this product at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Yes I color it, the last time I went in my hair dresser said wow, your hair feels fabulous-</li>
            <li>I have gotten older my hair is dryer</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Morracan products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product SMELLS genuine but it&#x27;s really not moisturizing in the slightest.</li>
            <li>Not worth it at all especially when I hear others using drug store brands and get amazing results.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for women who have sew-ins or natural hair!</li>
            <li>have fine, blonde hair that I color and get the Japanese straightening done to it.</li>
            <li>The product worked and even though I don&#x27;t live in CA</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product now.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife as a suggestion from some old high school girl friends of mine.  </li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m switching back to Lanza and Aquage, which I should never have stopped using in the first place.     </li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and looks better than it has the past year.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I regularly colour my hair and it gets dry and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Yes..absolutely love for my very wavy thick hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Styling Cream (along with a few other products) to texturize and bodify my hair, and the result is bedhead sexy hair, which isn&#x27;t really supposed to be silky and shiny anyway, and which I can live with until I use up all of my Moroccanoil products--</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color-treated, straight/smooth/shiny hair that is dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easier to style.</li>
            <li>Forget those early Saturday morning infomercials like Zen.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Your hair will only absorb so much and the rest will just sit on your head.  </li>
            <li>Moroccanoil lets the curls form and feel sooo soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil moisture repair conditioner makes my hair really soft and look healthier.  </li>
            <li>My hair feel soft, shiny and healthier since I have started using this.</li>
            <li>My head of hair looks to b that of a 30 something instead of a 62yr old.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft after using it that sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother putting product in my hair</li>
            <li>I had never know my hair can feel so soft...</li>
            <li>I only use it when I want a straight look.(pressed).  </li>
            <li>I will miss this after going natural</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry ends</li>
            <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, so it may work out pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>Problem was the actual bottle was dirty and the contents were filled to the top it seemed like it was not the product that should have been in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, not so much for long curly hair.</li>
            <li>Living out in Colorado where homes apparently don&#x27;t have water softeners - I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I just finished a bottle of Morrocanoil conditioner, and opened a new bottle from this seller that I purchased recently.  </li>
            <li>my hair is very processed, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>I have thick dry hair that I have to blow dry and then straighten to look good.</li>
            <li>This makes my coarse hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I usually like subtle perfumes and this smells so good that when I use it, I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume.</li>
            <li>Shampoo, towel dry and put a plastic hotel shower cap on and clean your bathroom or work up a little heat.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with the dry ends from using flat irons etc.  </li>
            <li>Hair does not dry out as often and scalp stays hydrated.</li>
            <li>It costs so much and received no success.  </li>

            <li> I love their Moroccanoil, the best on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this conditioner, but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.</li>
            <li> Be sure to pair with the shampoo, I get the best results that way!</li>
            <li> Good product...  </li>
            <li> and this is not as conditioning as I hoped but still a good product.</li>
            <li> If the comb glides through my hair, I know it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and loved it.</li>
            <li> Yes.. its that good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as products purchased from MO website.</li>
            <li> It makes it smell really good</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and this bottle was not as good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it every day because I have very fine hair, but it is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> It smells so great and leaves my hair feeling great and keep it clean looking, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>

            <li> LOVE!</li>

            <li> Plus, it smells freaking amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great customer service and the fantastic price.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It was good and brought shine to my hair, but I still need more moisturizer;</li>
            <li> Super great conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed this product so much that I ended up splurging and getting the Moroccanoil curl creme and that is wonderful as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but in my case the hair get oiled easy.</li>
            <li> smell stays... best of there products so far.</li>
            <li> Came quick- works great and was authentic from the company I received it from.</li>
            <li> I have thick/coarse curly to tight curly hair and this works great, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love how wonderfully smooth and healthy my hair is (plus people compliment how my hair smells!)</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> my Hair needed more Moisture and this did the job.</li>
            <li> ITS EVEN BETTER IF YOU GO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that so many women love this product line.</li>
            <li> All told, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the shampoo and conditioner for women who want smoother, shinier hair, though for women who want more texture, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> but that was ok.</li>
            <li> like the shampoo better.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and also the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling fabulous!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll know why so many people like this product.</li>
            <li> Sincerely  Dale</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is now sooo shiney and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have recommended this to me, and I am so glad I listened.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> You dont need more.  </li>
            <li> Better than Ive ever seen it.  </li>
            <li> so tonight, Im ordering another for me :-)</li>
            <li> this conditioner for my type of hair is ok, I have try  better products to better price</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair smell and feel.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought Finesse moisturizing conditioner for 3.69 and it is infinitely better than this garbage.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> But I love all Moroccanoil products.  </li>
            <li> Im ordering more today.</li>
            <li> My hair feels better if I used &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; than when I use this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I paid more money for this product because I needed some help with my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I Used as a conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then the mask, so I use it once a week as I would do the mask</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner &amp; I also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> Love the thickness of it.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see more benefits with continuous use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This has garnered many a handsome man exclaiming, &amp;#34;You smell so good!!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The Volume conditioner is a much better conditioner.</li>
            <li> love conditioner</li>
            <li> Love the Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> They leave the hair clean, smooth, managable and smelling soooo good.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many salon products and Moroccanoil oil is by far the most superier - and it smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve used in a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Makes my tangly, curly hair so easy to comb out after washing.</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy &amp; my order arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Price-wise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The product inside seems fine</li>
            <li> Fantastic Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Moisture Repair conditioner is absolutely fantastic in stopping this (as is the oil).  </li>
            <li> There will never ever be a product as fabulous as Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Conditioner . . .</li>
            <li> And yes, I have several great shampoos that I switch off depending on my hair and what Ive been doing with it.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had more success in that area with OTC drugstore Moroccan oil conditioners.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was a genuine morocco oil product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes it smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li> aware!!</li>
            <li> would like to know before purchase if it is an original product and packing .</li>
            <li> about the size of two normal sized bananas put together, makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a very long time and it is great.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff and the price is a bit high but worth it as I have tried many other products and they don&#x27;t work as well as this.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner that has helped my hair go from extremely damaged to extremely healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hair which tends to become very dry.</li>
            <li> It was just as if i had purchased it at the full price or from a salon</li>
            <li> If I can get this product and other Moroccan Oil products at great pricing I will be a forever</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells as great as the other Moroccanoil products.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a combination of products by Lanza and Aquage, which were seriously working wonderfully, until I went to a Bumble and Bumble salon and the stylist recommended the Moroccanoil line.</li>
            <li> Hair gets more unmanageable as one gets older and this conditioner does well to help manage hair paired with morrocan oil</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> You can get the same or better quality from Lanza (or Aqua I&#x27;m told) for a significantly better price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product very much.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair smell and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> I only wish it smelled more like the shampoo!  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling moisturized, smooth, soft, but strong as it has protein in it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and even received compliments on how great my hair smelled, but the price is crazy when there are so many knock offs on the market for it now.  </li>
            <li> They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this made my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny besides love the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is really nice without feeling like a film is left over from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I feel it is DEFINITELY worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> so others will know that, in my opinion, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> , I really was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Considering I dye my hair bi-monthly and straighten it weekly, my hair is in good condition, in part due to this conditioner.</li>
            <li> she was right-</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of conditioners for my naturally curly dry hair and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> I love the regular Morrocan oil that is used to smooth hair and add shine, but this conditioner was not any better in quality than a $5 conditioner i could buy at a regular drugstore.</li>
            <li> It is really nothing special.</li>
            <li> It lasted me a good two and a half months.</li>
            <li> Good though for normal to slightly dry.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair soft and silky, and seems to do fine with colour-treated hair.</li>
            <li> my Hair looked back to being Healthy looking ,this repaired like it&#x27;s suppose to do my dry,Frizzy Split Ends</li>
            <li> I only had to use a dime size amount to make my hair feel like magic when I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> If you have coarse or frizzy hair, this product will smooth your locks and leave your hair shiny &amp; bouncy!</li>
            <li> I have had the keratin treatment and this shampoo is perfect for it because it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the ingredients that ruin the treatment which is expensive.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair being easier to style after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try for anyone that wants to splurge and treat your hair to a luxurious product.</li>
            <li> I got re married in 2011</li>
            <li> and i deal with a lot of dryness and static, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Might be of better use for a different hair type</li>
            <li> My all time favorite conditioner is the conditioner that comes with the loreal ever creme dye, but this ties for second with Pantene (for women of color).</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this line the last time I was with my stylist.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my very coarse, very dry, very stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it and plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years and it&#x27;s great on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> This repairs from dry ends way better than Matrix® Biolage Ultra Hydra Source.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out super soft and straight.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my ends, as I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair I would recommend the extra body conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and applying a dollop instead of your normal conditioner and leaving it in for 5-10 minutes will give you such sleek, shiny hair</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> The conditioner soaks into the hair, it&#x27;s really hydrating and my hair no longer feels crispy.</li>
            <li> and this really adds the moisture it</li>
            <li> IF YOU OVER PROCESS YOUR HAIR, BLEACH, LIGHT BLONDE,</li>
            <li> I especially like that it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I also use Nick Chavez Affinity spray when it is drying on the very ends to give body and curl.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my hair, too.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> because contains to much oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner for my virgin remy hair.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with the shampoo because I love Organix Brazilian Keratin (the pink one).</li>
            <li> I expected more from this brand.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again because of the price, but at least it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> different from the original bottle,fills suspicious.</li>
            <li> I spend a bit more on the other product lines I use.</li>
            <li> This is great for damaged hair, and a little goes and extremely long way.</li>
            <li> My favorite Conditioner and I have never seen this product at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Yes I color it, the last time I went in my hair dresser said wow, your hair feels fabulous-</li>
            <li> I have gotten older my hair is dryer</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Morracan products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product SMELLS genuine but it&#x27;s really not moisturizing in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all especially when I hear others using drug store brands and get amazing results.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for women who have sew-ins or natural hair!</li>
            <li> have fine, blonde hair that I color and get the Japanese straightening done to it.</li>
            <li> The product worked and even though I don&#x27;t live in CA</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product now.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a suggestion from some old high school girl friends of mine.  </li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m switching back to Lanza and Aquage, which I should never have stopped using in the first place.     </li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and looks better than it has the past year.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I regularly colour my hair and it gets dry and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Yes..absolutely love for my very wavy thick hair!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Styling Cream (along with a few other products) to texturize and bodify my hair, and the result is bedhead sexy hair, which isn&#x27;t really supposed to be silky and shiny anyway, and which I can live with until I use up all of my Moroccanoil products--</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, color-treated, straight/smooth/shiny hair that is dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and easier to style.</li>
            <li> Forget those early Saturday morning infomercials like Zen.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Your hair will only absorb so much and the rest will just sit on your head.  </li>
            <li> Moroccanoil lets the curls form and feel sooo soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil moisture repair conditioner makes my hair really soft and look healthier.  </li>
            <li> My hair feel soft, shiny and healthier since I have started using this.</li>
            <li> My head of hair looks to b that of a 30 something instead of a 62yr old.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft after using it that sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother putting product in my hair</li>
            <li> I had never know my hair can feel so soft...</li>
            <li> I only use it when I want a straight look.(pressed).  </li>
            <li> I will miss this after going natural</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry ends</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, so it may work out pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> Problem was the actual bottle was dirty and the contents were filled to the top it seemed like it was not the product that should have been in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, not so much for long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Living out in Colorado where homes apparently don&#x27;t have water softeners - I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of Morrocanoil conditioner, and opened a new bottle from this seller that I purchased recently.  </li>
            <li> my hair is very processed, dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair that I have to blow dry and then straighten to look good.</li>
            <li> This makes my coarse hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I usually like subtle perfumes and this smells so good that when I use it, I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, towel dry and put a plastic hotel shower cap on and clean your bathroom or work up a little heat.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with the dry ends from using flat irons etc.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not dry out as often and scalp stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> It costs so much and received no success.  </li>
            <li> The new formula is easier to pour, but it so watered down that it feels like there is nothing in my hair.  </li>
            <li> the oil/serum, which has very little argan oil and which is overpriced if you consider that the vast majority of the ingredients are very inexpensive--just read the label).</li>
            <li> I first tried this product out in CA because they have hard water</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend this much for conditioner which is why I wanted to leave a review</li>
            <li> It left my hair so soft and silky, especially if you put it in, and leave it in for a few minutes then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair</li>
            <li> I am mixed on both sides, and have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recently recommended I try the Moroccan Oil line instead of the Enjoy (pink bottles) that I have been using for the past few years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell, which can make it hard to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and with this product I had to use a lot for it to actually condition and work!</li>
            <li> First let me say I have super damaged hair from bleach; that being said this is a bad as* detangling conditioner</li>
            <li> Also, due to fibromyalgia and hormonal loss: I am 62yrs old, I have a &amp;#34;birds nest&amp;#34; of snarls down the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair that tangles.  </li>
            <li> Long curly hair needs lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this product I can smell my hair all day long</li>
            <li> I have long think hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, when I began using the product a few days ago, I realized it didn&#x27;t smell the same as my last bottle and the product seem to have a different consistency.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling like there was a slight residue left on it, and my normally shiny hair lacked it&#x27;s usual luster.</li>
            <li> but if you use it very sparingly, this bottle will last at least 2 years if your hair is short or a little longer.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, this conditioner can leave my hair feeling a tad sticky as compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Bought other products from the same line and all work so well to soften my hair.</li>
            <li> wont go back to other products</li>
            <li> She has very long hair and went swimming every night at the hotels on our way by car to Texas.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated and tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> Gives enough moisture without weighing down my long hair.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you as an honest consumer, I am disappointed to say, I just bought a $20 bottle of conditioner that is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the Moroccan Oil conditioner for Christmas and have already seen my dry, dull hair turn glossy and soft, and people keep mentioning it too!</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I would prefer it if it had a slightly stronger scent.  </li>
            <li> GO FROM BLACK TO BLONDE.</li>
            <li> I think the price was to high for such a small bottle n need to use  a small amount  </li>
            <li> I could not live without it!  </li>
            <li> hair is naturally very dry, has been all my life.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that ends up curly after I wash &amp; condition my hair after using this product along with using oil &amp; scrunching my hair &amp; letting my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> While using, my hair felt like a knotty mess, felt rough and not clean and soft after using.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a little different as well.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair a few times a week</li>
            <li> In the shower, I put the conditioner on while I take my shower, then I take a wide tooth comb through as I rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Out of the shower, I put the Moroccanoil on, comb again with a wide tooth comb, then shake my head to let the curls form</li>
            <li> this arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it keeps it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Less frizz and at the same time my hair is not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> This product did not seem legit as it smelled differently than what I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is so snarled when I get out of the shower, that I have to work very carefully to get the knots out without damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, because of the faint residue (which seemed to increase my hair&#x27;s volume slightly) and dullness, I&#x27;ve decided to style my hair differently for the time being.</li>
            <li> As far as being moisturizing, it is very thick</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, and i only need a little to condition my hair!</li>
            <li> Use just a little as a little will go a very long way.  </li>
            <li> This product does not create miracles but it does sleek your hair down and allow temporary satisfaction if you want that sleek and shiny look that we all seek.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expect to use less of the product to get the conditioning that I want.  </li>
            <li> It had stains and black marks all over it.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s very expensive, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth</li>
            <li> If I have any complaints, it&#x27;s that it might leave a slight buildup on the hair after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> With other conditioners I can use a small amount and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Leave it in for a little while and wrap your hair up in a tee-shirt.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people whose hair isn&#x27;t very dry or thick.</li>
            <li> I little too heavy when used with the shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair grows very slow, it only grew maybe two inches in two years.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Yep, I shampoo everyday no matter what anyone says.  </li>
            <li> But for REPAIR and everyday conditioner?  </li>
            <li> Dove Moroccan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and the Moroccan Argan Oil brand from Sally&#x27;s are dead ringers for the smell and about 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> and i feel as if my hair has dried out since using.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> get the bottom half of my hair!</li>
            <li> The previous formula for this conditioner was so thick that you couldn&#x27;t get it out of the container.  </li>
            <li> My hair was broken in 2011 due to too much lightening ( haven&#x27;t colored my hair since), as well as a few minor surguries ( they tell me the anesthesia can cause hair loss) and terrible nutrition due to intestinal problems which since have been corrected.</li>
            <li> Recived my order a little late</li>
            <li> I usually use Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner and this product pales in comparison.</li>
            <li> I usually use Phillip Roth, it&#x27;s a 10 or Aveda.  </li>
            <li> If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars</li>
            <li> Of course, the harsh chemicals to color or perm R never a good idea IMHO</li>
            <li> The conditioner was not very impressive, my hair was tangled and not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and curly hair product worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length slightly thick hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li> It is expensive, and not worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> It is the absolute worst conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive stuff</li>
            <li> This conditioner is EXPENSIVE in salons.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s obviously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am sad to report that this product was dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me this was going to be a gift.</li>
            <li> Those two chemicals are horrible for your skin and hair and unfortunately, they are included in what seems to be at least 75% of hair/skin products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with any of them</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the Moroccan Oil conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely useless!!!</li>
            <li> THE POOL WATER IS HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fantastic Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> It really works. I like it.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner ever and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Bought it before.like it a lot and buy it again now</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products. I use their shampoo, conditioner, mask and oil. These are the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever tryed. They leave the hair clean, smooth, managable and smelling soooo good. They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of conditioners for my naturally curly dry hair and this is the best so far.  If I have any complaints, it&#x27;s that it might leave a slight buildup on the hair after a few weeks of use.  But I&#x27;ll keep using it anyway!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I little too heavy when used with the shampoo so i mix it with my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recently recommended I try the Moroccan Oil line instead of the Enjoy (pink bottles) that I have been using for the past few years. It&#x27;s been awesome. The conditioner soaks into the hair, it&#x27;s really hydrating and my hair no longer feels crispy. I only wash my hair a few times a week and this really adds the moisture it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, blonde hair that I color and get the Japanese straightening done to it. Translation: my hair is very processed, dry and damaged. I like using the shampoo and conditioner along with the hair oil. I use the hair oil just on my ends and it helps to spot treat the places the conditioner missed when I washed it out.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, and i only need a little to condition my hair!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I only use it on my ends, as I have fine hair. It works just as well as Purology. Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great. I don&#x27;t have to use the conditioner all the time either, because I use the shampoo. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves my hair soft and luxurious.  I only gave it 4 stars because I would prefer it if it had a slightly stronger scent.  (Although, I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of scents and this one does not set off any of my allergies.)</li>
            <li> I am Happy i decided to order this my Hair has been dry,Frizzy on the ends and it was time for a switch after using this for a week my Hair looked back to being Healthy looking ,this repaired like it&#x27;s suppose to do my dry,Frizzy Split Ends my Hair needed more Moisture and this did the job.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT, DO NO NEED THE SHAMPOO. THIS IS GREAT IF YOU OVER PROCESS YOUR HAIR, BLEACH, LIGHT BLONDE, GO FROM BLACK TO BLONDE. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR LEAVE IN. ITS EVEN BETTER IF YOU GO SWIMMING CAUSE THE POOL WATER IS HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I have chemically straightened hair and the Morrocanoil Line does wonders on my hair! I use the shampoo, this conditioner, and the oil every day. I also use the mask when I get around to it. My hair has never been healthier despite being so chemically processed! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure</li>
            <li> I first tried this product out in CA because they have hard water and I have long hair that tangles.  The product worked and even though I don&#x27;t live in CA I still use it in my home state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about this conditioner</li>
            <li> different from the original bottle,fills suspicious. would like to know before purchase if it is an original product and packing .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner and I did&#x27;t buy it for myself. My Fiance&#x27; lets me use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie--I&#x27;ll buy any and all products my stylist suggests. I had been using a combination of products by Lanza and Aquage, which were seriously working wonderfully, until I went to a Bumble and Bumble salon and the stylist recommended the Moroccanoil line. Of course, I bought the shampoo, conditioner (2 bottles!), oil, and mask.     The smell is wonderful, although it would be nice if it were a bit stronger. The ingredient list was enough to impress me as well (for all but the oil/serum, which has very little argan oil and which is overpriced if you consider that the vast majority of the ingredients are very inexpensive--just read the label). What I&#x27;m not a fan of is how my hair looks and feels after I&#x27;ve washed and conditioned it with Morocconoil products. I have long, fine, color-treated, straight/smooth/shiny hair that is dry at the ends. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling like there was a slight residue left on it, and my normally shiny hair lacked it&#x27;s usual luster. The oil/serum works decently enough, though Lanza&#x27;s makes my hair look and feel healthier.     Long story short, because of the faint residue (which seemed to increase my hair&#x27;s volume slightly) and dullness, I&#x27;ve decided to style my hair differently for the time being. I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Styling Cream (along with a few other products) to texturize and bodify my hair, and the result is bedhead sexy hair, which isn&#x27;t really supposed to be silky and shiny anyway, and which I can live with until I use up all of my Moroccanoil products--hey, all together they cost an arm and a leg at the salon--and then I&#x27;m switching back to Lanza and Aquage, which I should never have stopped using in the first place.     I&#x27;m glad that so many women love this product line. I&#x27;m just not one of them. Price-wise, it&#x27;s fine. I spend a bit more on the other product lines I use. All told, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the shampoo and conditioner for women who want smoother, shinier hair, though for women who want more texture, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recived my order a little late but that was ok. Problem was the actual bottle was dirty and the contents were filled to the top it seemed like it was not the product that should have been in the bottle. I have tried this product before from my hairdresser and it was wonderful, this time it made my hair clump together like I had added grease. It is horrible.</li>
            <li> Good product...  like the shampoo better.  I have dry hair and this is not as conditioning as I hoped but still a good product.</li>
            <li> The product SMELLS genuine but it&#x27;s really not moisturizing in the slightest. I usually use Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner and this product pales in comparison. I have long, thick, coarse hair and this didn&#x27;t do a darn for it. Definitely won&#x27;t purchase again and don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and also the shampoo. The smell is awesome.  I can&#x27;t use it every day because I have very fine hair, but it is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I love how soft this made my hair. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is HEAVEN!!  I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell, which can make it hard to not use too much.  At the same time, this conditioner can leave my hair feeling a tad sticky as compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I guess sometimes you just can&#x27;t win.  The previous formula for this conditioner was so thick that you couldn&#x27;t get it out of the container.  However, it was wonderful - rich, creamy and made my hair feel healthy and silky.  The new formula is easier to pour, but it so watered down that it feels like there is nothing in my hair.  My hair is so snarled when I get out of the shower, that I have to work very carefully to get the knots out without damaging my hair.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got this for Mom at her request. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner that has helped my hair go from extremely damaged to extremely healthy! It leaves my hair smelling fabulous! LOVE!</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated and tends to get dry. This is the ONLY conditioner I use now b/c it works so well. It makes my hair soft and easier to style. It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Great product! Moisturizes, and my hair is easier to style. Have been using if for a while now and reorder whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> Forget those early Saturday morning infomercials like Zen.  I bought this for my wife as a suggestion from some old high school girl friends of mine.  Not only did my wife like it by I used it myself.  I only had to use a dime size amount to make my hair feel like magic when I got out of the shower.  It is pricey but try it once and you&#x27;ll know why so many people like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for a conditioner. The ingredients are the key factor.  I would recommend it to anyone. Sincerely  Dale</li>
            <li> love this product. use it daily. highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I regularly colour my hair and it gets dry and breaks easily. Moroccanoil Moisture Repair conditioner is absolutely fantastic in stopping this (as is the oil).  My hair is now sooo shiney and healthy looking. I have tried so many salon products and Moroccanoil oil is by far the most superier - and it smells beautiful. Couldnt recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Super great conditioner.  Makes my tangly, curly hair so easy to comb out after washing.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have recommended this to me, and I am so glad I listened. It lasted me a good two and a half months. It left my hair so soft and silky, especially if you put it in, and leave it in for a few minutes then rinse. My hair grows very slow, it only grew maybe two inches in two years. Its grown four from using this for four months and is the only shampoo and conditioner I will use. Plus, it smells freaking amazing.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner.  I only wish it smelled more like the shampoo!  Gives enough moisture without weighing down my long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as recommended by one of my friend &amp; my wife loves it.... She bought it again</li>
            <li> This product did not seem legit as it smelled differently than what I have bought in the past. The bottle was a little different as well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product very much. The moroccanoil keeps my hair moisturized through countless coloring. I will continue to use this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells  great! I have really thick and curly hair product worked well for me. Will reorder soon and have recommended to others.</li>
            <li> great smell, used for years for fine curls</li>
            <li> This product rocks!! If you have coarse or frizzy hair, this product will smooth your locks and leave your hair shiny &amp; bouncy!</li>
            <li> I usually use Phillip Roth, it&#x27;s a 10 or Aveda.  I like the Moroccan oil and decided to try it.  For the price, I expect to use less of the product to get the conditioning that I want.  I have asian shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> too tangley of hair after use.</li>
            <li> This works best with the shampoo.  it makes my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have had the keratin treatment and this shampoo is perfect for it because it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the ingredients that ruin the treatment which is expensive. I have thick curly hair and it keeps it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my very coarse, very dry, very stubborn hair.  A little pricey, but worth it.  And it smells incredible!</li>
            <li> There will never ever be a product as fabulous as Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Conditioner . . . NEVER!  Whatever condition your hair is, this will fix it.  I use it everyday.  Yep, I shampoo everyday no matter what anyone says.  And yes, I have several great shampoos that I switch off depending on my hair and what Ive been doing with it.  But for REPAIR and everyday conditioner?  I USE THIS AND ONLY THIS!!!!!  If youre using it as a daily conditoner . . . then use only a 1/2 of a dime size.  You dont need more.  If you only need to do the ends of your hair, just condition there.  Now if you need and want a deep condition?  Shampoo, towel dry and put a plastic hotel shower cap on and clean your bathroom or work up a little heat.  Then rinse thoroughly after 15-20 mins.  You hair will be like silk.  This is expensive stuff but if you use it very sparingly, this bottle will last at least 2 years if your hair is short or a little longer.  Remember.  Your hair will only absorb so much and the rest will just sit on your head.  Use just a little as a little will go a very long way.  (Note: Just this last week, I went to Texas w/my great niece.  She has very long hair and went swimming every night at the hotels on our way by car to Texas.  Her hair was in knots using hotel shampoo and rinse so I lent her my shampoo and the Moroccanoil Repair.  OMG!  Her hair looked and felt delicious.  Better than Ive ever seen it.  She was amazed and hooked).  I gave her the rest of my bottle so tonight, Im ordering another for me :-)</li>
            <li> I like the product, I have curly hair so I need a lot of conditioner. this conditioner for my type of hair is ok, I have try  better products to better price</li>
            <li> This is the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes combing a breeze (which is a lot to say for my hair)! I have mid-back length slightly thick hair that tends to frizz and I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll never use anything else (although I only wash my hair every 3 or so days). I especially like that it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free. Those two chemicals are horrible for your skin and hair and unfortunately, they are included in what seems to be at least 75% of hair/skin products. Amazon prices can&#x27;t be beat. This conditioner is EXPENSIVE in salons.</li>
            <li> Yes..absolutely love for my very wavy thick hair!  Smells awsome too..</li>
            <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair smell and feel.  I have been using this for about two years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> First let me say I have super damaged hair from bleach; that being said this is a bad as* detangling conditioner and it smells great. I&#x27;ve been using it on my head for about 20 to 30 minutes twice a week and I am amazed how it gets the knots out.  However, and maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, it doesn&#x27;t help it feel softer or anything related to softness lol, I&#x27;ve had more success in that area with OTC drugstore Moroccan oil conditioners. For the price, for me, I will not be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I am a conditioner addict! I have tried so many conditioners! This conditioner does not live up to its reputation. I have very long hair and with this product I had to use a lot for it to actually condition and work! With other conditioners I can use a small amount and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I love their Moroccanoil, the best on the market, in my opinion. The conditioner, not so much for long curly hair. The best I&#x27;ve found is Suddz. Long curly hair needs lots of moisture. In the shower, I put the conditioner on while I take my shower, then I take a wide tooth comb through as I rinse it out. If the comb glides through my hair, I know it&#x27;s a good conditioner. Out of the shower, I put the Moroccanoil on, comb again with a wide tooth comb, then shake my head to let the curls form and I&#x27;m good to go. Moroccanoil lets the curls form and feel sooo soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My favorite Conditioner and I have never seen this product at such a low price. Thank you for the great customer service and the fantastic price. If I can get this product and other Moroccan Oil products at great pricing I will be a forever customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and loved it. The conditioner was not very impressive, my hair was tangled and not smooth at all. I prefer the oil over the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Living out in Colorado where homes apparently don&#x27;t have water softeners - I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair feels healthier and looks better than it has the past year.  I love it and plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair sticky and actually drier than it ever was.  I dont understand all these rave reviews for it.  It is the absolute worst conditioner I have ever used.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, I really was excited to try it.  It is expensive, and not worth the money at all.  Believe it or not, I bought Finesse moisturizing conditioner for 3.69 and it is infinitely better than this garbage.</li>
            <li> I received the Moroccan Oil conditioner for Christmas and have already seen my dry, dull hair turn glossy and soft, and people keep mentioning it too! This is seriously the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and applying a dollop instead of your normal conditioner and leaving it in for 5-10 minutes will give you such sleek, shiny hair you won&#x27;t believe. The bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, so it may work out pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells as great as the other Moroccanoil products.  Makes the hair soft and silky, and seems to do fine with colour-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really helps with the dry ends from using flat irons etc.  But I love all Moroccanoil products.  I have never been disappointed with any of them</li>
            <li> This makes my coarse hair very soft and manageable.  I could not live without it!  This is the best price I have found...</li>
            <li> It was good and brought shine to my hair, but I still need more moisturizer; Good though for normal to slightly dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent, can say better!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the Moroccan Oil conditioner.  Told it was great for use after Keratin Treatment.  While using, my hair felt like a knotty mess, felt rough and not clean and soft after using.  It costs so much and received no success.  Couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through while using the conditioner in the shower.  Not worth it at all especially when I hear others using drug store brands and get amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well with my hair. My hair is soft and shiny besides love the smell. If you can afford it you should try it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product now. Hair gets more unmanageable as one gets older and this conditioner does well to help manage hair paired with morrocan oil it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used. I have thick dry hair that I have to blow dry and then straighten to look good. I noticed my hair being easier to style after the first use. After the third time I used the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have to used a straightener. My hair is really nice without feeling like a film is left over from the conditioner. I bought another bottle and sent it to my friend to try.</li>
            <li> Pioneer Woman Ree Drummond wrote about this product in her blog- she was right- its the BEST stuff on the face of the earth. My hair feels like a million bucks. Yes I color it, the last time I went in my hair dresser said wow, your hair feels fabulous- what are you doing?  Yes.. its that good. Im ordering more today.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but arrived on time and works well. I probably won&#x27;t buy again because of the price, but at least it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to write a report.. I will give a star rating. If I like the product you will get a 5 star. If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a very long time and it is great.  I highly recommend Morracan products.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this conditioner before I made this purchase.  I read some wonderful reviews.  I&#x27;m wondering how this is possible.  My hair feels better if I used &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; than when I use this conditioner.  I paid more money for this product because I needed some help with my damaged hair.  Absolutely useless!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.  I have curly hair and Im constantly battling frizz so Im always looking for moisturizing conditioner.  I always wanted to try Moroccanoil but it&#x27;s obviously expensive.  Well now that I bit the bullet and tried it I feel it is DEFINITELY worth the cost.  First of all, the smell is amazing.  Whenever I use this product I can smell my hair all day long and I love it.  As far as being moisturizing, it is very thick and I definitely feel a difference using this conditioner.  Less frizz and at the same time my hair is not weighted down.  I actually enjoyed this product so much that I ended up splurging and getting the Moroccanoil curl creme and that is wonderful as well.  This is definitely worth a try for anyone that wants to splurge and treat your hair to a luxurious product. I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil moisture repair conditioner makes my hair really soft and look healthier.  It shipped quickly and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I Used as a conditioner for many years. It&#x27;s good, but in my case the hair get oiled easy. It&#x27;s better then the mask, so I use it once a week as I would do the mask</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It smells so great and leaves my hair feeling great and keep it clean looking, not greasy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>
            <li> Unless money suddenly becomes no object, I won&#x27;t repurchase.  Love the smell and even received compliments on how great my hair smelled, but the price is crazy when there are so many knock offs on the market for it now.  Dove Moroccan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and the Moroccan Argan Oil brand from Sally&#x27;s are dead ringers for the smell and about 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hair which tends to become very dry. My hair feel soft, shiny and healthier since I have started using this.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner &amp; I also use the shampoo. I have thick wavy hair that ends up curly after I wash &amp; condition my hair after using this product along with using oil &amp; scrunching my hair &amp; letting my hair dry naturally. I have used shampoos &amp; conditioners that are for curly hair from stores &amp; my hair ends up frizzy instead of curly. Fast delivery &amp; great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It provides great moisture when my hair needs it.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably smoother!  I just wish it would come in a larger size so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy it so often.</li>
            <li> This product does not create miracles but it does sleek your hair down and allow temporary satisfaction if you want that sleek and shiny look that we all seek.</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that this product was dissapointing. I love the regular Morrocan oil that is used to smooth hair and add shine, but this conditioner was not any better in quality than a $5 conditioner i could buy at a regular drugstore. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days and I love the way it makes my hair smell and leaves it very soft. I have long blonde hair and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever! Smells amazing &amp; makes my hair feel great!! Ordering was easy &amp; my order arrived very quickly. 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> this arrived as expected.  It was just as if i had purchased it at the full price or from a salon</li>
            <li> recently I read an add in a local magazine describing a treatment with these products at a local salon.  I went, she used this as well as the repair shampoo in addition to a deep massage with the &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; Moroccan  deep conditioner treatment.  My hair was broken in 2011 due to too much lightening ( haven&#x27;t colored my hair since), as well as a few minor surguries ( they tell me the anesthesia can cause hair loss) and terrible nutrition due to intestinal problems which since have been corrected. Also, due to fibromyalgia and hormonal loss: I am 62yrs old, I have a &amp;#34;birds nest&amp;#34; of snarls down the back of my head.  I got re married in 2011 and my head was balding.  I have now, shoulder length blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;since my deep treatment in Feb of 2013, I bought this product and the matching shampoo.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN my hair!!! The fragrance is divine, btw.  I went for another treatment and the hairdresser could not believe the difference in my hair.  ( I did not purchase the products, there, btw)  My hair still has the &amp;#34;birdsnest&amp;#34; of snarl after I shampoo but I use a detangler and get through it.  I also use Nick Chavez Affinity spray when it is drying on the very ends to give body and curl.  These moroccanoil REPAIR products are the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.  My head of hair looks to b that of a 30 something instead of a 62yr old.  Of course, the harsh chemicals to color or perm R never a good idea IMHO and I will NEVER DO THAT again... This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this and already I see a difference. Love the thickness of it. Hair does not dry out as often and scalp stays hydrated. Waiting to see more benefits with continuous use.</li>
            <li> I use this after the Moroccanoil Shampoo It leaves my hair feeling so soft after using it that sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother putting product in my hair</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturizer! Great conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and smells fantastic.  I usually like subtle perfumes and this smells so good that when I use it, I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume. It is just enough.  I really like the way it feels on my hair, too.  I don&#x27;t usually spend this much for conditioner which is why I wanted to leave a review so others will know that, in my opinion, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Came quick- works great and was authentic from the company I received it from. Bought other products from the same line and all work so well to soften my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and i deal with a lot of dryness and static, especially in the winter. I love this product. I wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> Not as good as products purchased from MO website.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair but do color it monthly ---as I have gotten older my hair is dryer so it takes a hit.  This is awesome stuff and the price is a bit high but worth it as I have tried many other products and they don&#x27;t work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I think the price was to high for such a small bottle n need to use  a small amount  because contains to much oil.</li>
            <li> ooooo.  This has garnered many a handsome man exclaiming, &amp;#34;You smell so good!!&amp;#34;.  And the looks on their faces is priceless.  Liquid gold.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this arrived in the condition it was in. The product inside seems fine but the bottle looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for about 10 years. It had stains and black marks all over it. The shampoo I got with it was the same. Unfortunately for me this was going to be a gift. Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner for my virgin remy hair. It makes it smell really good and it provides lots of body. I would highly recommend this product for women who have sew-ins or natural hair!</li>
            <li> The product did not do what I was expecting. I have pretty dry ends and this product did nothing to soften my hair. The Volume conditioner is a much better conditioner. Came on time and cheaper than in the salon. Might be of better use for a different hair type</li>
            <li> love conditioner it does its job with leaving the hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;not greasy. smell stays... best of there products so far.</li>
            <li> about the size of two normal sized bananas put together, makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this conditioner.  Not what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> PRoduct as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am mixed on both sides, and have long curly hair. I enjoyed this conditioner, but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. Considering I dye my hair bi-monthly and straighten it weekly, my hair is in good condition, in part due to this conditioner. My all time favorite conditioner is the conditioner that comes with the loreal ever creme dye, but this ties for second with Pantene (for women of color). I have not tried it with the shampoo because I love Organix Brazilian Keratin (the pink one). This smells great, but works just as well as Pantene. Why spend the extra money? I would recommend it to people whose hair isn&#x27;t very dry or thick. Leave it in for a little while and wrap your hair up in a tee-shirt. It will deep condition without making your hair too greasy.</li>
            <li> This brand is a tad overrated in my opinion. You can get the same or better quality from Lanza (or Aqua I&#x27;m told) for a significantly better price.</li>
            <li> Love the Moroccanoil products. This is great for damaged hair, and a little goes and extremely long way. If you have fine hair I would recommend the extra body conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had never know my hair can feel so soft...&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally very dry, has been all my life. I always tried to find solutions but nothing ever worked until I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s very expensive, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with a problem of dry/damaged hair!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years and it&#x27;s great on my natural hair.  I only use it when I want a straight look.(pressed).  My hair comes out super soft and straight.</li>
            <li> This was the best service ever!!!!!! It got here before needed. They respond back to my emails! just awesome service thank sooooo much!</li>
            <li> This repairs from dry ends way better than Matrix® Biolage Ultra Hydra Source. I have long think hair and I only have to use the size of a silver dollar of this conditioner get the bottom half of my hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was a genuine morocco oil product. Probably a knock off. I use this product all the time and this bottle was not as good. Be warned.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this line the last time I was with my stylist.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so ordered it here.  I love how wonderfully smooth and healthy my hair is (plus people compliment how my hair smells!) that I actually look forward to showering.</li>
            <li> I will miss this after going natural (I may sneak this in though). It leaves your hair feeling moisturized, smooth, soft, but strong as it has protein in it. I&#x27;m going without as it has silicone and phenoxyethanol and I&#x27;m trying to limit in take of those.</li>
            <li> Now this product is not the BEST conditioner I have tried; however, it does its job! IF you leave it in for about 2-3minutes it does what it says it will do~detangle and moisturize. I have thick/coarse curly to tight curly hair and this works great, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of Morrocanoil conditioner, and opened a new bottle from this seller that I purchased recently.  I bought from this seller, because their price was the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when I began using the product a few days ago, I realized it didn&#x27;t smell the same as my last bottle and the product seem to have a different consistency.  I guarantee you as an honest consumer, I am disappointed to say, I just bought a $20 bottle of conditioner that is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware!!</li>
            <li> I love this line! The best I&#x27;ve used in a LONG time! Be sure to pair with the shampoo, I get the best results that way!</li>
            <li> EHHH.  I expected more from this brand.  Leaves my hair feeling like I did not rinse out the conditioner and i feel as if my hair has dried out since using.  I feel like I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have curly, fuzzy hair.  This conditioner makes it smooth and manageable.  Use with Moroccan Oil shampoo for best results.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would really detangle my hair. It is really nothing special. I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair softer or stronger and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have curly hair and my stylist recommend it and ever since I have started using it wont go back to other products</li>
    </ol>
