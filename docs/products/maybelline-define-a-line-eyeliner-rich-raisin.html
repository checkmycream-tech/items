    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I like Maybelline&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li>Great color and product!</li>
            <li>I had found the perfect color I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its the perfect color for green/grey-ish eyes</li>
            <li>This looks great on anyone with hazel/green eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought this eyeliner was great, but not for me.</li>
            <li>Stores I have went to wanted $7 for this eyeliner, so the price on here is great.</li>
            <li>said, it doesn&#x27;t show up that great on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>I rated it a four star because it just didn&#x27;t work for me, but if it works for somebody else, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s find a better chemical combo!</li>
            <li>It would probably be amazing on lighter skin tones, but if your tan or darker, it may not show up on you.</li>
            <li>Since it is lighter, it can be seen that I am wearing eyeliner where the darker one blends rather well with my own lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to draw</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>and it is okay for the skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments with this color.</li>
            <li>Easy to glide-on and go.</li>
            <li>Dark purple looks awesome with hazel blue/grey/green eyes.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and received quickly!  </li>
            <li>I loved the color and was super pumped to finally find the perfect color for my blue eyes.</li>
            <li>This color compliments green eyes wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The color is great, especially for green/hazel eyes.</li>
            <li>Yet this pencil makes my eyes water &amp; causes an allergic reaction, which is very rare for me with eye pencils.</li>
            <li>This pencil not only goes on smoothly and evenly, it is very soft when applied and looks nice on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast which was good because I was out and needed a replacement fast.  </li>
            <li>It went on super smooth, and it just felt like it would last for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>More than anything else though, I really like that it glides very smoothly over the eyelids without tugging on the gentle skin of the eyelids.</li>
            <li>This color is killer and looks great with my gray blue eyes, just beware if you are sensitive in any way!</li>
            <li>The product had an over powerful smell of crayon.  </li>
            <li>Dominican Republic)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cheap and nice color, but if you think about the wait and longevity of this eyeliner, its not worth it.</li>
            <li>Nothing major more of an annoyance than anything.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, I thought I had contracted conjunctivitis somewhere.  </li>
            <li>It goes on great, just alittle hard to see the color unless someone gets real close to your face.</li>
            <li>It really makes your eye color pop.</li>
            <li>I have a tanned skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t really show up on me at all.</li>
            <li>I liked the color, and the twistable feature it has, but this was one of the only products that have occasionally irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of the entire Maybelline Define-A-Line series, but this particular color is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I particularly like how it seems to enhance the eyelashes rather than create a severe \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; look on days when I want to do my eyes, but don&#x27;t want them to look too \\&quot;jarring\\&quot; and outlined.</li>
            <li>Good product, probably nicer on green eyes, red hair, or for blonds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years and would recommend it to anyone looking for a long lasting, affordable, convenient product.</li>
            <li>I normally use this product and when I bought it from amazon my eyes swell up...</li>
            <li>I am a fan of this brand of eyeliner and this color is pretty, although much lighter on my eyelid than my preferred Brown/Black version of the same product.  </li>
            <li>But it is also easy to fall down after drawing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a deep plum/wine color, very close to how black eyeliners show up on you, but it is actually a very light, shimmery purple color.</li>
            <li>(where I live it is humid,</li>
            <li>Since the Define-A-Line eyeliner was brand new to me, I had to consider that it may have been the culprit of my eye irritation.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it looks brownish black, but regarldess I love it!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The pencil lasts fairly long too, even in hot weather.</li>
            <li>cool color, didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner especially for green or brown eyes.  </li>
            <li>Raisin gives the eyes a softer, more subtle look than a standard brown pencil, and it goes very well with mauve or purple-toned eye shadows.</li>
            <li>my eyes went back to normal.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>If your eyes are sensitive... especially to pencils, I wouldn&#x27;t take the risk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad, since I liked the color so much, but I simply can&#x27;t wear it without an extreme reaction.</li>
            <li>Like two hours later I had barely something on my eye...</li>

            <li> Like two hours later I had barely something on my eye...</li>
            <li> The color was what I expected, but (like other reviewers) for some reason this eyeliner really irritated my eyes with a burning sensation and redness.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for several years now but have noticed that it is harder and harder to find in the stores (boo!).</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I really liked the product.  </li>
            <li> I wore it on a rainy day (when pollen was low) and my eyes burned and ached within a half an hour of putting it on.</li>
            <li> But, I recently purchased  Define-A-Line, and it made my eyes red and irritated, and it caused a thick discharge.  </li>
            <li> Very strange!!</li>
            <li> The color is also long-lasting and not prone to smudging or smearing, as sometimes occurs with other  pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have felt a slight burning sensation if I sweat or tear up.  </li>
            <li> Within less than 2 hours, my eyes again looked like a case of conjunctivitis.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before from other local retailers and have never experienced something like this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched through and through for a wine-colored eye pencil, but it&#x27;s been very disappointing that other brands such as Revlon or Covergirl carry nothing but brown pencils under the guise of deceiving names that suggest ruby or wine colors.</li>
            <li> It seems impossible to find this color in stores these days, so I was overjoyed to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , maybe she won&#x27;t have a bad reaction.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This looks great on anyone with hazel/green eyes. It really makes your eye color pop. I like that it has a smudger on the end which helps with application.</li>
            <li> This color compliments green eyes wonderfully. I&#x27;ve used it for many years and would recommend it to anyone looking for a long lasting, affordable, convenient product.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for several years now but have noticed that it is harder and harder to find in the stores (boo!). I now buy 3 or 4 at a time on Amazon and just stock up! This pencil not only goes on smoothly and evenly, it is very soft when applied and looks nice on my fair skin. The only one I have found that comes even close in comparison (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot in this &#x27;shade&#x27;), is Mary Kay&#x27;s version of a raisin color. I like Maybelline&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> The product had an over powerful smell of crayon.  I used it and it made my eyes burn and water.  I have ordered this product before from other local retailers and have never experienced something like this.  I ended up throwing it away.  Will not use this merchant again.</li>
            <li> I thought this eyeliner was great, but not for me. I have a tanned skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t really show up on me at all. I thought it was going to be a deep plum/wine color, very close to how black eyeliners show up on you, but it is actually a very light, shimmery purple color.

            <li> Stores I have went to wanted $7 for this eyeliner, so the price on here is great. I like this liner but like another seller said, it doesn&#x27;t show up that great on darker skin tones. It goes on great, just alittle hard to see the color unless someone gets real close to your face. Other than that it looks brownish black, but regarldess I love it!</li>
            <li> Does not go on very well like it is dried out.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and was super pumped to finally find the perfect color for my blue eyes. Except it caused my eyes to itch, water, swell, and produce discharge. Love the color Maybelline but let&#x27;s find a better chemical combo!</li>
            <li> Great color and product!</li>
            <li> cool color, didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It seems impossible to find this color in stores these days, so I was overjoyed to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched through and through for a wine-colored eye pencil, but it&#x27;s been very disappointing that other brands such as Revlon or Covergirl carry nothing but brown pencils under the guise of deceiving names that suggest ruby or wine colors. When I found this pencil it felt like at last I had found the perfect color I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich Raisin gives the eyes a softer, more subtle look than a standard brown pencil, and it goes very well with mauve or purple-toned eye shadows. I particularly like how it seems to enhance the eyelashes rather than create a severe \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; look on days when I want to do my eyes, but don&#x27;t want them to look too \\&quot;jarring\\&quot; and outlined.

            <li> I normally use this product and when I bought it from amazon my eyes swell up... Whats the difference? Very strange!!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this brand of eyeliner and this color is pretty, although much lighter on my eyelid than my preferred Brown/Black version of the same product.  Since it is lighter, it can be seen that I am wearing eyeliner where the darker one blends rather well with my own lashes.  Good product, probably nicer on green eyes, red hair, or for blonds.</li>

            <li> its the perfect color for green/grey-ish eyes but it really doesn&#x27;t last long. After one hour I went to the restroom and I had part of the eyeliner melted under my eye. Like two hours later I had barely something on my eye... (where I live it is humid, Dominican Republic)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cheap and nice color, but if you think about the wait and longevity of this eyeliner, its not worth it. (Do not buy)</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this shade of eyeliner in my  local drug stores.  Love this product.  Great price so I stocked up</li>
            <li> I thought that the pollen season was to blame for my swollen red eyes, but after not wearing this eye liner for a couple of days my eyes went back to normal. I wore it on a rainy day (when pollen was low) and my eyes burned and ached within a half an hour of putting it on. I gave it to my roommate, maybe she won&#x27;t have a bad reaction. I went to the store and bought raisin by Almay (spelling?) it says it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, maybe this will be a better/safer alternative. This color is killer and looks great with my gray blue eyes, just beware if you are sensitive in any way!</li>
            <li> I liked the color, and the twistable feature it has, but this was one of the only products that have occasionally irritated my eyes. I have never had a product conflict with my eyes before, but this one does sometimes make my eyes water a lot, to the point where the eyeliner has come off my waterline.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments with this color. Dark purple looks awesome with hazel blue/grey/green eyes. Yay for Loreal</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and received quickly!  Will definitely be ordering from again in the future.  Didn&#x27;t even need to leave my desk!</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast which was good because I was out and needed a replacement fast.  Easy to glide-on and go.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline eye products since I started wearing make-up about 30 years ago.  In fact, it is the only eye make-up I use.  I have never had any problems.  But, I recently purchased  Define-A-Line, and it made my eyes red and irritated, and it caused a thick discharge.  When I used it the first time, I thought I had contracted conjunctivitis somewhere.  I did not even consider that it might be the eyeliner.  But, after I washed my make-up off that night, I woke the next morning with no irritation in my eyes.  Since the Define-A-Line eyeliner was brand new to me, I had to consider that it may have been the culprit of my eye irritation.  I waited until I was just staying home for the day; I cleaned the tip of the eyeliner off, and I tried it again.  Within less than 2 hours, my eyes again looked like a case of conjunctivitis.  I am so disappointed because I really liked the product.  It went on super smooth, and it just felt like it would last for a good amount of time. That is, of course, until I started rubbing my eyes from the irritation.  I just thought I would share as maybe it will help somebody else. I rated it a four star because it just didn&#x27;t work for me, but if it works for somebody else, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The color was what I expected, but (like other reviewers) for some reason this eyeliner really irritated my eyes with a burning sensation and redness.</li>
