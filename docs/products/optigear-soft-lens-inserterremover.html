    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>ON AMAZON, WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, a fair price would be 50 cents.</li>
            <li>So, their intentions were good, however, it DOES NOT WORK well.</li>
            <li>Great for getting contact into my eyes without touching my eye lids.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Great I love it very easy to work with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as handy as the one from OptiGear.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t honestly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to insert .</li>
            <li>But the OptiGear one does work somewhat better than the one from DMV.</li>
            <li>Many days I would give up trying to get them in and go to work with my glasses.</li>
            <li>using your finger is better then using this thing at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>It was too floppy/soft to be able to use to get the contact out.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a container for my contacts :)</li>
            <li>your are better off just using your fingers.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it was just me and someone else will love them.</li>
            <li>IT WILL RELEASE THE CONTACT AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR EYE, TIP MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>any more than needed</li>
            <li>I had more success with my own fingers.</li>
            <li>As far as removing your lenses with either one of them, they aren&#x27;t that great  for that.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I ordered 3 types of available removers.</li>
            <li>In most cases on the first try.....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>I havent used the product but itt looks like it will be useful.</li>
            <li>Product may be useful for inserting lenses</li>
            <li>It is not an appropriate or useful tool for soft contact lens removal.</li>
            <li>so i  will keep trying to find the right thing for me to use.</li>
            <li>The product got to me very fast, and was as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the  price because it saves so much time and frustration.</li>
            <li>My trepidations melted away to nothing the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more when the next lense tech call comes in!</li>
            <li>I tried it and my eye was sore for days because I made so many attempts at grabbing the contact;  the white part of my eye became red---and I was NOT applying lots of pressure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works good for removal, better than expected by other reviews.</li>
            <li>This little widget is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is made of flimsy rubber and is very unsturdy.</li>
            <li>The arms are too soft to be useful.</li>
            <li>does not work very well...</li>
            <li>The gripper side of the tool doesn&#x27;t really grip the contact.</li>
            <li>I put lens on my thumb to test how much grip the tweezer had.....</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY DOES WORK</li>
            <li>It works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>This product gave him help in asking for his first pair of soft contact lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still trying to get the hang of using it, I wish it was a little more rigid.</li>
            <li>It took a little more time for me to get use to this</li>
            <li>Great concept, but fails as usage is concerned.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool to use when you need a little help in getting out your contacts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to contact lenses</li>
            <li>If you are a new user or getting readjusted to wearing contact lens, this is helpful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M NEW TO WEARING CONTACTS</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this....PLEASE!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s practically no learning curve with regular soft lenses; they go in the first time every time and come out with the &#x27;tweezer&#x27; end</li>
            <li>I bought it because I am having trouble inserting my soft contact lens, and this is supposed to help you insert the lens easily into your eyes.</li>
            <li>I believe it ( because of the HARD PLASTIC) will cause more damage for contact lens wearers--over time, it will cause damage to the eye.</li>
            <li>I bought this inserter for home and a DMV soft lens inserter for my purse.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re multi focal soft contacts and I&#x27;ve been struggling with them since I got them.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend the DMV  soft lens inserter/remover.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I prefer the Lobob Soft Contact Insertion/Removal Kit for removing my contacts.</li>
            <li>I like that its soft</li>
            <li>i would not wasted your money on this.</li>
            <li>It was so soft, it just went all gumby on me.</li>
            <li>TO PUTTING MY CONTACTS IN SINCE THEY ARE SOO SOFT.</li>
            <li>However I do use the other end for loading, it has a wide cup to hold lens steady and secure.</li>
            <li>The inserter plunger is larger and the  lens goes in much easier with the larger inserter plunger.</li>
            <li>It is too thick and does not allow for easy use.</li>
            <li>Being of the aging population (I&#x27;m 50) and needing multifocal lenses I was fitted with the Synergyese, which is a hybrid lens which is a hard lens with a soft lens skirt, which you have to insert with it full of saline to insert, or you&#x27;ll get air bubbles which impedes your vision.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>I am 72 and been wearing contacts for 20 years and in the last I have had trouble removing and inserting the new ones, This was a real life saver</li>
            <li>the contact surfaces with the lenses are not large enough nor pliable (soft).&lt;br /&gt;The whole contraption is an aqwuard design to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>I have large fingers and have trouble removing my lenses, I was hoping that I could grip the lens with these easier and stop giving myself problems.  </li>

            <li> Something like a vacuum cup?</li>
            <li> This was purchased to try on myself before purchasing multiples to use on set (as single use items for actors and stunties).</li>
            <li> No more panic how to insert or remove your Soft Contact Lens.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit difficult to remove the contact lens, but once you get use to it, it &#x27;s going to be easy.</li>
            <li> THAT THE INSERTER IS WET.</li>
            <li> Your better off just using your finger, trust me :(</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these inserter/removers due to diabetes and my inability to feel the contact on removal.  </li>
            <li> edges also seem way to sharp to have around your eyes</li>
            <li> Do you have other options?</li>
            <li> , SOO I HAVENT HAD TO USE THE OTHER SIDE YET.</li>
            <li> The tool was not worth a penny.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This little piece of rubber is definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> BUT IT HAS A LITTLE HOLE ON IT</li>
            <li> dont poke your eyes out with this, its a waste.</li>
            <li> tried them with my sclera lenses but they get tricky since the sclera lenses are so heavy.</li>
            <li> but I bought it as I have trouble removing them</li>
            <li> Waste of a few dollars.</li>
            <li> a nifty little contraption!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money folks!</li>
            <li> No more contact sticking to my finger.</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> Very difficult to grab the soft lens with this tool.  </li>
            <li> hard to use.</li>
            <li> hard plastic hurts your eye.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time using these.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time taking my contacts out</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it could help me remove my lens, but it was worse than my fingers.</li>
            <li> For myself and a family member ( hated thinking he could not get the lens on his eyes, but wanted to try Soft  Contact Lens).</li>
            <li> Sorry, it&#x27;s just the truth.</li>
            <li> useless, I can&#x27;t remove  my lens with it</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using my fingertip to insert my contact lens.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> It bends when you try to grab the contact  making it nearly impossible to get the contact out of the eye.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand the bad reviews on this product....</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t feel too bad about it hitting the trash</li>
            <li> , bad thing is if I buy something like this my wife has to have one too. . .  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it to get my contacts out. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> Luckily my worst problem is not getting them out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works good for removal, better than expected by other reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this inserter for home and a DMV soft lens inserter for my purse. I&#x27;m new to contact lenses but I&#x27;ve been wearing them now since  last fall. They&#x27;re multi focal soft contacts and I&#x27;ve been struggling with them since I got them. This inserter is a God Send!! I usually get the lenses in the first time with this tool. It&#x27;s fantastic. I would  recommend it to anyone who is wondering about it. It&#x27;s well worth the  price because it saves so much time and frustration. I haven&#x27;t lost a  lens either since I&#x27;ve been using it!! I would not recommend the DMV  soft lens inserter/remover. It&#x27;s not as handy as the one from OptiGear.  .....Sorry, it&#x27;s just the truth. The inserter plunger is larger and the  lens goes in much easier with the larger inserter plunger. As far as removing your lenses with either one of them, they aren&#x27;t that great  for that. But the OptiGear one does work somewhat better than the one from DMV. Luckily my worst problem is not getting them out.</li>
            <li> Great for getting contact into my eyes without touching my eye lids.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I bought it because I am having trouble inserting my soft contact lens, and this is supposed to help you insert the lens easily into your eyes. The lens sticks to the rubber end, and does not come off when in contact with your eye! It is made of flimsy rubber and is very unsturdy. Don&#x27;t waste your money folks! Your better off just using your finger, trust me :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand the bad reviews on this product....I have been struggling with getting my contacts in every since I started using contacts. Many days I would give up trying to get them in and go to work with my glasses. Then I got this last week. WOW it works ....In most cases on the first try.....No more contact sticking to my finger.A drop of solution on the contact before insertion also helps.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit difficult to remove the contact lens, but once you get use to it, it &#x27;s going to be easy. &lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to insert .</li>
            <li> hard to use. looks simple but does not work for me</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t honestly recommend this. I found it&#x27;s actually easier to use your finger which rather negates the point of the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these inserter/removers due to diabetes and my inability to feel the contact on removal.  One of my contacts split and am looking for another product.</li>
            <li> this did not work well for me so i  will keep trying to find the right thing for me to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> The product got to me very fast, and was as described. I have a very hard time taking my contacts out so I ordered 3 types of available removers. I am still trying to get the hang of using it, I wish it was a little more rigid. I prefer the Lobob Soft Contact Insertion/Removal Kit for removing my contacts. I never had problems putting them in so I can&#x27;t evaluate that.</li>
            <li> dont poke your eyes out with this, its a waste. using your finger is better then using this thing at all.</li>
            <li> The arms are too soft to be useful.</li>
            <li> Trying to take them out using the arms burns my eyes, so i just use qtips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this item. It&#x27;s awkward/ cumbersome, and even more difficult to use than my fingers. Great concept, but fails as usage is concerned.</li>
            <li> Being of the aging population (I&#x27;m 50) and needing multifocal lenses I was fitted with the Synergyese, which is a hybrid lens which is a hard lens with a soft lens skirt, which you have to insert with it full of saline to insert, or you&#x27;ll get air bubbles which impedes your vision.&lt;br /&gt;Having a slight tremor made it hard to insert without spilling the saline, but this has made it so easy to insert and hold the lens in the proper inserting position.</li>

            <li> it´s useless, I can&#x27;t remove  my lens with it</li>
            <li> This was purchased to try on myself before purchasing multiples to use on set (as single use items for actors and stunties). I&#x27;m in love. This little widget is amazing. My trepidations melted away to nothing the first time I used it. There&#x27;s practically no learning curve with regular soft lenses; they go in the first time every time and come out with the &#x27;tweezer&#x27; end just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them with my sclera lenses but they get tricky since the sclera lenses are so heavy. With practice, however, it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nifty little contraption! I&#x27;ll be buying more when the next lense tech call comes in!</li>
            <li> The tool was not worth a penny.  It was too floppy/soft to be able to use to get the contact out.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using my fingertip to insert my contact lens.  Thankfully I found this product and I love it!  I use it to insert my contacts every morning!</li>
            <li> I have large fingers and have trouble removing my lenses, I was hoping that I could grip the lens with these easier and stop giving myself problems.  Basically have no grip and they sit in a drawer.  found it was just easier to use both hands and my index finger on each to pinch the lens.  I use disposable so once they come off they hit the trash anyway.  Never used the cup but it seems way to big to insert with anyway, I would expect the edge of the lens to be outside of the cup to insert properly and it&#x27;s just swallowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges also seem way to sharp to have around your eyes but it was only a couple bucks so don&#x27;t feel too bad about it hitting the trash, bad thing is if I buy something like this my wife has to have one too. . .  so two of them just sit there.</li>
            <li> does not work very well...</li>
            <li> The gripper side of the tool doesn&#x27;t really grip the contact. When you squeeze the arms together, it never once grabbed the contact.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to grab the soft lens with this tool.  Hurts the eye before you can get the lens out.</li>
            <li> This product was obviously not tested before releasing it to the public. If it had they would have found that this product will not remove the contact lens from the eye. I had more success with my own fingers.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it could help me remove my lens, but it was worse than my fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool to help me extract lenses. I put lens on my thumb to test how much grip the tweezer had.....nothing!!! Completely useless. However I do use the other end for loading, it has a wide cup to hold lens steady and secure. 1 star.</li>
            <li> No advantage found over manual insertion/retraction.</li>
            <li> I havent used the product but itt looks like it will be useful. I like that its soft and it comes with a container for my contacts :)</li>
            <li> It meet my expectations and it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> the contact surfaces with the lenses are not large enough nor pliable (soft).&lt;br /&gt;The whole contraption is an aqwuard design to hold and manipulate. Do you have other options? Something like a vacuum cup?</li>
            <li> not worth the money.  hard plastic hurts your eye. your are better off just using your fingers. i would not wasted your money on this.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time using these.  Could not get the hang of it.  Hopefully, it was just me and someone else will love them.</li>
            <li> If you are a new user or getting readjusted to wearing contact lens, this is helpful.  It took a little more time for me to get use to this but it works.  No more panic how to insert or remove your Soft Contact Lens.  Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three of them. For myself and a family member ( hated thinking he could not get the lens on his eyes, but wanted to try Soft  Contact Lens). This product gave him help in asking for his first pair of soft contact lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product to try.</li>
            <li> Great I love it very easy to work with</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool to use when you need a little help in getting out your contacts. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product may be useful for inserting lenses but I bought it as I have trouble removing them, product has no grip on lens at all. I would rate this as zero stars if it was possible.</li>
            <li> It was so soft, it just went all gumby on me. I couldn&#x27;t use it to get my contacts out. :( Waste of a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NEW TO WEARING CONTACTS AND I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON, WORKS GREAT!! I STILL CANT GET USED TO PUTTING MY CONTACTS IN SINCE THEY ARE SOO SOFT. THIS REALLY DOES WORK AT HELPING YOU GET THEM IN. I HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING THEM OUT, SOO I HAVENT HAD TO USE THE OTHER SIDE YET. IT LOOKS LIKE A SUCTION CUP BUT IT HAS A LITTLE HOLE ON IT THAT KEEPS THE CONTACT FROM STICKING TO IT. ALL YOU DO IS PLACE THE CONTACT ON IT AND PLACE ON YOUR EYE. IT WILL RELEASE THE CONTACT AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR EYE, TIP MAKE SURE THAT THE INSERTER IS WET. IT MAKES IT RELEASE EASIER.</li>
            <li> Cant figure out how to get it in my eye</li>
            <li> I use this to put in my contacts because I prefer to not have to handle them any more than needed and I don&#x27;t like putting my fingers in my eyes.  It works very well for that purpose.  I haven&#x27;t used it for removal, so I can&#x27;t attest to the efficiency of that.</li>
            <li> Please do not purchase this item. It is not an appropriate or useful tool for soft contact lens removal. It is too thick and does not allow for easy use. I tried it and my eye was sore for days because I made so many attempts at grabbing the contact;  the white part of my eye became red---and I was NOT applying lots of pressure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product ONE star because I understand what the developer was attempting to create. So, their intentions were good, however, it DOES NOT WORK well. I believe it ( because of the HARD PLASTIC) will cause more damage for contact lens wearers--over time, it will cause damage to the eye. Please beware...do not waste your money on this....PLEASE!</li>
