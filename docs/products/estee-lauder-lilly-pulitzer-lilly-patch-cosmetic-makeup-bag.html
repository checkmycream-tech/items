            <li>It is larger than I thought it would be, but that is good.</li>
            <li>This is an adorable bag but the colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as my screen made me think.</li>
            <li>I love this product not only because it has my favorite colors</li>

            <li>love the vivid colors</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Great to have and to give away with little gifts in them</li>
            <li>Though it was quite larger than I expected, It&#x27;s still a wonderful bag.</li>
            <li>Nice larger size and very convenient for all of my make up and toiletries when on the go!</li>
            <li>too big for everyday use but good quality and nice color.</li>
            <li>The bag is not really that cute to me but it was cheap</li>
            <li>This makeup bag is great its a little big so all of my makeup can fit in here.</li>

            <li>The product is beautiful &amp; silky but just too big for my everyday purse.</li>
            <li>Well made, looks and feels very high quality.</li>
            <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t looking something this size.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I should have measured more carefully.</li>

            <li>Nice cosmetic bag, big enough to hold everything,</li>
            <li>It was also delivered two days earlier than originally projected.</li>
            <li>I needed a pretty bag and large enough to hold every thing..</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and in new condition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Lilly fan and needed a new makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>but if it is just for a few trips a year should be just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is durable and if you have little to nothing in your purse it will fit in a medium size purse.</li>
            <li>The bag is much larger than I expected it would be and is in such a cute and summery print.</li>
            <li>It easily holds hreadphones (not earbuds yuck), lock, small brush and wallet.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and concluded it was bigger than expected, which proved to be true.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely product ~ but just too big for a small make up bag for my purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be definitely purchasing at least two more to keep my blushes, foundation, face cremes and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I needed a bigger make up bag, as my old one could no longer hold all the make up and supplies I had.</li>
            <li>It is quite large, so all of my everyday makeup fits there.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute bag. It can&#x27;t hold a lot of stuff just the regular essentials. It&#x27;s bright and cheery. Wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> too big for everyday use but good quality and nice color. Only complaint that there isn&#x27;t any inside pocket.</li>
            <li> I read the measurements but still didn&#x27;t realize it would be this big! It is perfect!!! Very sturdy and cute bag that fits all of my cosmetics and a hair brush.  I might buy some more as gifts!</li>
            <li> This is an adorable bag but the colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as my screen made me think. It&#x27;s a great size for a traveling case and is still quite girly, came in two days which is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my mini gym bag. It easily holds hreadphones (not earbuds yuck), lock, small brush and wallet. Very cute pattern.</li>
            <li> nice bags,  using for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated, girly and cute are the three words to describe this cosmetic bag.  I keep my 3 Urban Decay Naked palettes, Too Faced Chocolate Palette and my Wizard of Oz palette in this bag and I still have enough space left. I think it&#x27;s perfect to keep your makeup organized or just to fit your daily makeup whenever you are traveling.  I&#x27;ll be definitely purchasing at least two more to keep my blushes, foundation, face cremes and lipsticks.</li>
            <li> love the vivid colors</li>
            <li> Though it was quite larger than I expected, It&#x27;s still a wonderful bag. Any Lilly fan will love this bag&#x27;s quality and style.</li>
            <li> I got the bag in a good time frame. The bag is not really that cute to me but it was cheap then the other bags I would have rather gotten. The shipment did cost more then the bag it self. As for the bag, it is not to big or to little. The bag opens up very wide so you can put a lot in the bag. It is durable and if you have little to nothing in your purse it will fit in a medium size purse.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this bag. It appears a lot larger in the picture. It is not at all what I thought it would be or what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> The bag is very pretty. It is quite large, so all of my everyday makeup fits there. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, definitely recomment the seller. Thank you.</li>

            <li> Nice cosmetic bag, big enough to hold everything, but I really wasn&#x27;t looking something this size.  They need to put a size&lt;br /&gt;description.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom as a makeup bag for her purse. I loved the look and quality it was just too big.  I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Lilly fan and needed a new makeup bag.  This was the perfect solution! The bag is much larger than I expected it would be and is in such a cute and summery print. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good size bag and very happy to be able to get hold of the Lilly-Estee Lauder bags without spending a fortune on Estee cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Great to have and to give away with little gifts in them</li>
            <li> It is larger than I thought it would be, but that is good. It is made of good quality material and is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Perfect makeup bag? I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the size, the handle and the color! Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I needed a bigger make up bag, as my old one could no longer hold all the make up and supplies I had. This is perfect. Not too big, not too small. And, the design is really cute. Plus, its Lilly Pulitzer. VERY fairly priced. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I ordered this bag on Monday and just received it today Friday 09/15/14. Shipping was fast it arrived earlier than expected, I am in loveeee with this bag it is so adorable perfect fit someone who&#x27;s girly like myself. 😙</li>
            <li> PREFECT! Alot bigger then expected, which was what I was hoping for. Well made, looks and feels very high quality. The lining on the edges is a really pretty gold.  I&#x27;m using this as a toiletry travel bag. Definitely recommend this cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely product ~ but just too big for a small make up bag for my purse. I should have measured more carefully. It is more effective as a overnight bag to put bottle liquids in. The product is beautiful &amp; silky but just too big for my everyday purse.</li>
            <li> ~Its perfect I love it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent I&#x27;m very happy with this bag, it&#x27;s beautiful, brilliant colors and wide... I love I like this purchase....</li>

            <li> Love this cosmetic bag from the design,the colors and the fact that I can fit a lot of my cosmetics in this .Has a nice gold handle and is functional for every day use these bags are so pretty I have ordered others and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is sooo cute and worth the inexpensive listing price. I bought this for a friend and was happy to open the package. Good size for your makeup on the go.</li>
            <li> I love this product not only because it has my favorite colors but because it is roomy and able to carry all my cosmetics. I love that the bag came in good condition and it shipped fast !</li>

            <li> Good for travel. Big. Fits all her makup item! The colour is very nice!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my blood pressure cuff &amp; stethoscope for school, so I cannot comment on the cosmetic bag benefits. It is beautifully and strongly made, and serves its purpose. It zips too far down on the sides and I&#x27;m scared my stuff will fall out, but not a major problem. Other than that, fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> This bag is great ! Beautiful design and big inside I open it up and I can literally see all my makeup without having to really go through it to find what I need. Everyone that sees it says how nice it is and they want one!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel- colorful and lined</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT IT HAVE DIFFERENT SECTIONS INSIDE</li>
