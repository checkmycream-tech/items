            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>they are simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This felt too greasy, didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of pores, and just didn&#x27;t have a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>It did leave a silky feeling but so does a nice quality foundation that will do so much more than this product.</li>
            <li>Makes a HUGE difference in skin appearance!</li>
            <li>It holds up better than Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Skin and is not as greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products to just make everything look &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i love this product..</li>
            <li>I would of gotten more ...</li>
            <li>Literally makes the fine lines in my fourhead disappear and makes the pores around my cheeks disappear.</li>
            <li>Team this up with a light over coat of Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, evens out skin tone and takes care of pores.  </li>
            <li>really enjoy this stuff</li>
            <li>At The Original Store .</li>
            <li>It was ok considering I have really large pores, I will have to try again when I do another make up application</li>
            <li>Its really small but its perfect to see if its worth buying..</li>
            <li>I recieved the sample in the mail and loved it so thats why i ordered a bigger size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super tiny sample (but I knew that from the description) but the product is good.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying for the coverage it gives and maybe the flakes won&#x27;t happen to you.</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I would still purchase again because the flakes brush right off your face.</li>
            <li>I love this product but this bottle is tiny!</li>
            <li>But The Price Was Kinda Worth It For Being Really Expience</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Really reduces the looks of pores!</li>
            <li>Its cute :) only last me a week haha</li>
            <li>Just thought this would be an upgrade because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin, not many breakouts.</li>
            <li>Just as good if not better than pricey Dept stores.  </li>
            <li>Way smaller than expected works great though will be purchasing the full size in the future !</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really minimize my pores.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because it dries so fast</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute hoax as it did absolutely nothing to minimize the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>I was very upset.  </li>
            <li>Great little product that goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin and very problematic.</li>
            <li>Had to wash my face and reapply in the middle of my day, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s realy small, looks like a free sample.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice a major difference in my pores with this product.</li>

            <li> Had I noticed, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent as much on it as I had.</li>
            <li> I am only rating this 3 stars because I have DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot, but I thought it was going to be a bigger size for the 12 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave four stars is because it flakes up with these little white flakes as I am applying it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin - consider using BABY SKIN by Maybelline.</li>
            <li> This product is a tad dry in itself in comparison to BABY SKIN which has a silky finish to make my face look</li>
            <li> Surprised at how small it was.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have dry skin, well congratulations!</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, the larger tubes are uber expensive for regular working folks like myself.</li>
            <li> I would never pay $9.95 for such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> The price was unacceptable with such small size.</li>
            <li> This was not worth the money I spent. ...</li>
            <li> Very small and obviously just a sample size.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> its small dont doubt about it</li>
            <li> Did not know this item would be so small.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be.</li>
            <li> small.....</li>
            <li> small  </li>
            <li> Too small</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the tiny size.</li>
            <li> It was the a very small travel size.</li>
            <li> Why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and caused me to break out a lot.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed on the fact that the container was basically empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the size for the price.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in the size for the price!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Este producto es un engaño, di 12$ y no trae nada es una muestra.😠😠😠</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really minimize my pores. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Literally makes the fine lines in my fourhead disappear and makes the pores around my cheeks disappear. The only reason why I gave four stars is because it flakes up with these little white flakes as I am applying it. Maybe that&#x27;s because it dries so fast but I can&#x27;t apply it any faster than I already am and I still get the white flakes. I would still purchase again because the flakes brush right off your face. It&#x27;s worth trying for the coverage it gives and maybe the flakes won&#x27;t happen to you.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. I have fairly oily skin, not many breakouts. This felt too greasy, didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of pores, and just didn&#x27;t have a nice finish. I will stick with smashbox, and garnier blur, together they are simply amazing. Why fix what isn&#x27;t broken? Just thought this would be an upgrade because of all of the positive reviews. May work for others, but didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product but this bottle is tiny!</li>
            <li> This Was The Smallest Thing Ever! Size As My Pinky. Better Bust A Miracle! But The Price Was Kinda Worth It For Being Really Expience At The Original Store .</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot, but I thought it was going to be a bigger size for the 12 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> I got the trial tube of this and it&#x27;s great. The only problem is, the larger tubes are uber expensive for regular working folks like myself. It holds up better than Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Skin and is not as greasy feeling. Had to wash my face and reapply in the middle of my day, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Team this up with a light over coat of Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fit Me&amp;#34; Matte + Poreless foundation and you should be pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products to just make everything look &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;.  It goes on smooth, evens out skin tone and takes care of pores.  Just love this and won&#x27;t be without it, ever!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a major difference in my pores with this product. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product!  Just as good if not better than pricey Dept stores.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I am only rating this 3 stars because I have DRY SKIN and this did not work for me like it did for everyone else. If you have dry skin - consider using BABY SKIN by Maybelline. This product is a tad dry in itself in comparison to BABY SKIN which has a silky finish to make my face look hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have dry skin, well congratulations! Im sure this stuff works perfectly!</li>
            <li> its kool keep my make up in place its small dont doubt about it</li>
            <li> Great little product that goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Did not know this item would be so small. Dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I can return it! This is an absolute hoax as it did absolutely nothing to minimize the appearance of pores. It did leave a silky feeling but so does a nice quality foundation that will do so much more than this product.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!! I got this cause of all the good reviews on YouTube and I&#x27;m happy I did.. Its really small but its perfect to see if its worth buying..</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! LOVE it! Makes a HUGE difference in skin appearance! I always want use this terrific product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as another brand.</li>
            <li> It was good....i love this product..</li>
            <li> It was ok considering I have really large pores, I will have to try again when I do another make up application and I will write another review.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving. I would never pay $9.95 for such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> Best thing on the market to me!  Really reduces the looks of pores!</li>
            <li> way cheaper than in the store and was just enough to try it and see if i wanted to purchase a bigger bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this stuff and I do think it does help minimize the appearance of my pores!</li>
            <li> The price was unacceptable with such small size.</li>
            <li> Tiny.  Surprised at how small it was.  I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the size for the price. It&#x27;s realy small, looks like a free sample. Very expensive for the tiny size.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest. I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be. Had I noticed, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent as much on it as I had.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected works great though will be purchasing the full size in the future ! Also I recived a free Boscia sample from the seller very pleased with this packages service !</li>
            <li> small.....small  oh so tiny.</li>
            <li> I bought because of the reviews. I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin and very problematic. This product is expensive and caused me to break out a lot. If you have skin like mine...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super tiny sample (but I knew that from the description) but the product is good.</li>
            <li> So I got this product two days ago... and I was very disappointed on the fact that the container was basically empty. I got only two uses out of it ...I was very upset.  This was not worth the money I spent. ...as for the product itself, it&#x27;s really good. Just wished  I would of gotten more ...</li>
            <li> Eliminates pores and smells great.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or make me breakout.  It makes my makeup look smoother and helps hide my pores.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product wanted to try it out!! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the product said a bigger size. All i got was a sample. I recieved the sample in the mail and loved it so thats why i ordered a bigger size. Or so i thought.</li>
            <li> I have used product for years but this was overpriced. It was the a very small travel size.</li>
            <li> Too small but it works</li>
            <li> Its cute :) only last me a week haha</li>
            <li> Reduces pores definitely but I get oily</li>
            <li> Very small and obviously just a sample size. $5 for a sample size? No thanks. Great product though!</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I thought, but then again it&#x27;s a travel size</li>
            <li> This takes care of the squint lines between my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> loove this...pay attention to size. As they come in different tube sizes.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in the size for the price!  I thought I was getting 1 oz. for 12 bucks.  Instead I got 0.01 oz for 12 bucks!  It is not enough for a trial size to even evaluate the product. I feel ripped off</li>
