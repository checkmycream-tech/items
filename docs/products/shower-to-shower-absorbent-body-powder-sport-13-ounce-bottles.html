            <li>Good price, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I discovered the original Shower to Shower many years ago and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making my purchases all so easy.</li>
            <li>I find the lavender a bit strong as I do the &#x27;sport\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has a  surprisingly nice scent and is the first one I go to on my bath shelf.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product alot.</li>
            <li>Now seems to be available again.</li>
            <li>As a man currenty living in a hot and humid environment I have discovered the many joys of body powder used on some of the neither regions.</li>
            <li>Talk about a great powder, my satchel stays dry and fresh while boasting a sporty scent!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great powder for someone who wants an adult product that is not saturated in perfumes.</li>
            <li>Just love this powder, does not smell flowery, shipped super fast</li>
            <li>Keeps everything nice and dry and moving about freely.</li>
            <li>I like how it keep me fresh</li>
            <li>this product - does the trick without leaving me smelling like a freshly powdered baby.(Baby powder gives me a headache)&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>I used Summer&#x27;s Eve Powder, but i find that Shower to Shower&#x27;s fresh feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Incredibly good deal, received the products fast and am still using them even after daily use!  </li>
            <li>have also been a cancer patient for the last 28 months and the chemo, radiation and &#x27;other nice things&#x27; I&#x27;ve experienced have burned my skin, caused shingles, irritations, itching, and scads of other interesting skin phenomena.</li>
            <li>the Sport Scent WWwhich is not always carried by retailerI use to use Old Spice Powder years ago which is no longer available</li>
            <li>When I was unble to locate this product at my local Walmart, I was able to purchase it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more as needed.</li>
            <li>Way over priced by mail about 7.00 per unit finally found out at a store locally for 4.00 glad I was able to find it when I did tho</li>
            <li>but not very cost effective in spray form.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely order this again, though that may be a while since they come so many in a pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the scents Shower to Shower has, Sport is just my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>so I found it on Amazon and as usual very fast delivery, good price.</li>
            <li>Dontt get me wrong if I am not going to be sweating its great and feels very soft and smooth, more-so than gold bond...</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering this.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to wait to get them all at once which I appreciated since I was almost out at the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I enjoy White Diamonds powder when I can afford it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff helps to make me comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li>Good price today, but can often be found locally for a bit less, so I make sure I begin shopping around when I open my last &#x27;bottle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does better to avoid heat rashes than any other powder!</li>
            <li>But if you want something to keep you dry and comfortable under tougher conditions pass on this and go for the orange gold bond powder, or the spray works well too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been unable to find it any longer at local drug stores, so I was very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>The boys swing about without gluing themselves to my legs---how did I live without this product?</li>
            <li>prefer the original, but have tried the other scents along the way.</li>
            <li>To make it last longer, I combine baby powder with cornstarch and aloe, this original product and my White Diamonds.</li>
            <li>This keeps me dry, and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>during the summer, I must admit I do perspire like a man, so I combo this powder with Men&#x27;s Old Spice sport deo.</li>
            <li>However this particular product I find I only will use after a shower in the evening because if I am doing anything that will cause me to sweat this starts to have a sort of slimy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I cannot find this particular fragrance in any local stores and it is the one my husband likes to use.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s absorbent and doesn&#x27;t smell like a baby or a little old lady.</li>
            <li> While mixing them together used to be a mess with powder fluff and residue getting everywhere, I smartened up and now poof it all in an airtight/watertight plastic kitchen container, shake the daylights out of it to mix it up, then transfer the combined mixture to my &#x27;old&#x27; fancy powder tin with powder puff and pop the lid on it.</li>
            <li> When the tin starts getting empty, I just refill it from the plastic container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchased when not available at local Walmart.</li>

            <li> Hard to find in stores, 4-pack should last all year.</li>
            <li> That way, no one scent overpowers the other and it lasts much longer than the plain fancy, expensive powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m plus sized and active with two little kids, so i can sweat.</li>
            <li> Unable to find this at any local retailers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago when my leg was in a brace &amp; the chafing was driving me</li>
            <li> Everytime I find it, it is FAR too expensive.</li>
            <li> I been using bath powder all my lifeI like the scent I find it hard to findI been using Shower toShower for yearsI like</li>
            <li> Not good...</li>
            <li> Its very hard to find, with all of the scare from the use of talc.</li>
            <li> We like this powder, but it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
            <li> All Items were in poor condition, when shipped a statement on shipment</li>
            <li> Yeah, so you have to buy four bottles at a time, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s gonna go bad!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Unable to find this at any local retailers for a long time.  Nice fresh scent; non-feminine non-baby powder smell.  Good value in the four pack.  I like that it has corn starch and sodium bicarbonate in addition to talc.  Thanks Amazon for offering this.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this talc--it&#x27;s absorbent and doesn&#x27;t smell like a baby or a little old lady. I&#x27;ve been unable to find it any longer at local drug stores, so I was very happy to find it here. Yeah, so you have to buy four bottles at a time, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s gonna go bad!</li>
            <li> One of the only over the counter body powders out there you can use without smelling like a baby or a girl. Hard to find in stores, 4-pack should last all year. Good frugal alternative to the $50 and up designer stuff.</li>
            <li> It is always a good experience doing business with Amazon.com, fast, efficient service and good products. I never have to worry about an order.  Thank you for making my purchases all so easy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product alot. I like how it keep me fresh I been using bath powder all my lifeI like the scent I find it hard to findI been using Shower toShower for yearsI like the Sport Scent WWwhich is not always carried by retailerI use to use Old Spice Powder years ago which is no longer available</li>
            <li> This powder smells wonderful but gave my husband a major rash in his armpits</li>
            <li> When I was unble to locate this product at my local Walmart, I was able to purchase it at Amazon. Price was great and so was the service!!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to anti-perspirants and many fragrances used in cosmetics and soaps. I discovered the original Shower to Shower many years ago and have used it for years. By chance, I found the SPORT variety of the product at the drugstore and LOVED it. Works as deodorant and has a great fragrance and I&#x27;m not allergic to the fragrance. Then could not FIND it at the store again. Looked on line, saw I could get it from Amazon, found a book I liked and so got free shipping--saved a lot of time and gas and have a good supply! Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> It is really challenging to find sport shower to shower in a store. The price on amazon is fair and the shipping is free. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Nice fragrance, not flowery like the others. Can&#x27;t seem to find in stores so I found it on Amazon and as usual very fast delivery, good price.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago when my leg was in a brace &amp; the chafing was driving me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;After my surgery, I just kept using it on other areas.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs moisture, prevents clothing from chafing skin, very refreshing product.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product - does the trick without leaving me smelling like a freshly powdered baby.(Baby powder gives me a headache)&lt;br /&gt;Has a refreshing sporty scent that would work for men or women - the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long, and I sometimes receive compliments on how I smell (I don&#x27;t wear perfumes due to allergies).&lt;br /&gt;This is a great powder for someone who wants an adult product that is not saturated in perfumes.</li>
            <li> But am very glad you carry it!  I order it in bulk so I won&#x27;t run out.  It does better to avoid heat rashes than any other powder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I used to buy it at Wal Mart but they don&#x27;t carry it in our store anymore.  The seller was also excellent as they shipped two at first because they didn&#x27;t have 4.  I didn&#x27;t have to wait to get them all at once which I appreciated since I was almost out at the time.  This stuff helps to make me comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li> I love Shower to Shower powder. Its very hard to find, with all of the scare from the use of talc. I have been looking for Shower to Shower for some time. Everytime I find it, it is FAR too expensive. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for almost 35 years. Only recently needed to replenish my &#x27;supply&#x27; so here I am on Amazon. Good price today, but can often be found locally for a bit less, so I make sure I begin shopping around when I open my last &#x27;bottle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the original, but have tried the other scents along the way. I find the lavender a bit strong as I do the &#x27;sport\\&quot; (more for men, I think)but during the summer, I must admit I do perspire like a man, so I combo this powder with Men&#x27;s Old Spice sport deo. Works like a charm and it isn&#x27;t overpowering for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I enjoy White Diamonds powder when I can afford it. To make it last longer, I combine baby powder with cornstarch and aloe, this original product and my White Diamonds. That way, no one scent overpowers the other and it lasts much longer than the plain fancy, expensive powder. While mixing them together used to be a mess with powder fluff and residue getting everywhere, I smartened up and now poof it all in an airtight/watertight plastic kitchen container, shake the daylights out of it to mix it up, then transfer the combined mixture to my &#x27;old&#x27; fancy powder tin with powder puff and pop the lid on it. When the tin starts getting empty, I just refill it from the plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been a cancer patient for the last 28 months and the chemo, radiation and &#x27;other nice things&#x27; I&#x27;ve experienced have burned my skin, caused shingles, irritations, itching, and scads of other interesting skin phenomena. Using this powder combined with the baby powder has worked wonders for helping me get through some of the more difficult days without wanting to scratch or peel my skin off for relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, this is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m happy to have made its acquaintance. I&#x27;ll be back for more as needed.</li>
            <li> Way over priced by mail about 7.00 per unit finally found out at a store locally for 4.00 glad I was able to find it when I did tho</li>
            <li> Talk about a great powder, my satchel stays dry and fresh while boasting a sporty scent!  The boys swing about without gluing themselves to my legs---how did I live without this product?</li>
            <li> This product is a bit of a double edged sword for me. As a man currenty living in a hot and humid environment I have discovered the many joys of body powder used on some of the neither regions. Keeps everything nice and dry and moving about freely. However this particular product I find I only will use after a shower in the evening because if I am doing anything that will cause me to sweat this starts to have a sort of slimy feel to it. Many would probably describe this sensation as &amp;#34;swamp ass&amp;#34; ....Not good... Dontt get me wrong if I am not going to be sweating its great and feels very soft and smooth, more-so than gold bond... But if you want something to keep you dry and comfortable under tougher conditions pass on this and go for the orange gold bond powder, or the spray works well too but not very cost effective in spray form.</li>
            <li> I especially like the deodorant it provides.  Stores seem to just carry scents that appeal to women.  Will re-order when current supply is gone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this in years or maybe never.  It has a  surprisingly nice scent and is the first one I go to on my bath shelf.  I&#x27;d definitely order this again, though that may be a while since they come so many in a pack.</li>
            <li> Hot days it always good to have my STS handy...been using it for years and lost without it</li>
            <li> I received the product in good condition, it worked fine and I am satisfied with it, the delivery was quick and rec&#x27;d in good conditon.</li>
            <li> use it after every shower and am very happy</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> All Items were in poor condition, when shipped a statement on shipment said  AS/IS  in big letters, when I bought, there was no mention of AS/IS</li>
            <li> purchased when not available at local Walmart. Love the scent and functions well. Now seems to be available again.</li>
            <li> wish I could buy this where I live great product also arrived on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m plus sized and active with two little kids, so i can sweat. I use this in areas of body, like under breasts, and the folds of my fat. This keeps me dry, and smelling fresh. One bottle lasts me about 2-3 months, but i&#x27;m a big girl, so if you are smaller it might last you longer. i&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now. I&#x27;ve used all the scents Shower to Shower has, Sport is just my personal favorite. I use to buy in at Target or kmart, but for some reason they don&#x27;t keep it stock, or don&#x27;t sell it anymore. I used Summer&#x27;s Eve Powder, but i find that Shower to Shower&#x27;s fresh feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Incredibly good deal, received the products fast and am still using them even after daily use!  It works wonderfully definitely shower to shower.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this particular fragrance in any local stores and it is the one my husband likes to use.</li>
            <li> We like this powder, but it&#x27;s very hard to find. We are so happy we found it here. Good powder.</li>
            <li> Just love this powder, does not smell flowery, shipped super fast and well packaged.will purchase again from this&lt;br /&gt;Merchant. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like babies or women.  THis is the only powder we use in our house.  Perfect for absorbing odor, sweat, etc.</li>
