            <li>The best for oily skin makeup users !</li>
            <li>What an awesome awesome product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again - LOVE!</li>
            <li>This primer worked amazing.</li>
            <li>I need to continue my quest for an effective primer.</li>
            <li>This product works great and is quick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the full size now!</li>
            <li>Just discovered this amazing new product from Skindinavia and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This kept me oil free for maybe an hour.</li>
            <li>Significant improvement in makeup longevity.</li>
            <li>I also use it liberally over my brush when using powder foundation and the finish is gorgeous, soft and dewy!&lt;br /&gt;Totally controls the oiliness and generally makes the skin look amazing</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but it works great, feels great and really controls my oil problem!</li>
            <li>So happy to shed my heavy primer and trade it in for this lightweight spray.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>It might work great for others but if you have extremely oily skin,  only mildly oily, I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the full size as this did not at all perform as I expected.  </li>
            <li>This primer is easy to use but I will keep looking for a little more oil stopping power.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>and the price is tooooo High for me to pay evey week ...</li>
            <li>Might not be good for your pores for long term use for how stiff it feels.</li>
            <li>Honestly I am glad I got the small bottle.</li>

            <li> If you have sensitive skin, it may dry your skin out a little.  </li>

            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the full size as this did not at all perform as I expected.  I could have just as well not have used it and gotten the same results.</li>
            <li> The best for oily skin makeup users !</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin. This primer worked amazing. I will be purchasing the full size now!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. This prep works all day. Not enough product for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it did not work for me.  I was oily again in a few hours.</li>
            <li> seems to help keep makeup on longer when I use in conjunction with finishing spray</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.  I will not be buying the bigger version</li>
            <li> If you get an oily T-zone try to not get it on that area maybe hold a cotton ball there while you spray it other wise it will just make the shine worse. Keeps make up from sliding but makes face shiny like putting hairspray on my face. Might not be good for your pores for long term use for how stiff it feels.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is quick and easy to apply.  If you have sensitive skin, it may dry your skin out a little.  I have oily skin but still get dry so I use an extra moisturizer at night when i go to bed and that seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and I have searched forever for a product that could help. I read a lot of the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. Honestly I am glad I got the small bottle. This kept me oil free for maybe an hour. It felt like my makeup was melting off my face. Even with using mattifying moisturizers and a matte foundation this did not help at all. It might work great for others but if you have extremely oily skin,  only mildly oily, I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> What an awesome awesome product! Been using this for the last 3 days and my skin looks fab!&lt;br /&gt;I use it after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing - morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;Love the way my skin looks in the morning..I also use it liberally over my brush when using powder foundation and the finish is gorgeous, soft and dewy!&lt;br /&gt;Totally controls the oiliness and generally makes the skin look amazing&lt;br /&gt;Again - LOVE!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this just didn&#x27;t work for me. My makeup disappeared at the same rate as before... I need to continue my quest for an effective primer.</li>
            <li> Saves time and gives a great base for foundation.</li>
            <li> I was hopping for oil control around my nose and across my forehead.  This primer is easy to use but I will keep looking for a little more oil stopping power.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Just discovered this amazing new product from Skindinavia and absolutely love it. So happy to shed my heavy primer and trade it in for this lightweight spray. I was a bit skeptical at first, but it works great, feels great and really controls my oil problem! Thank you Skindinavia â€¦ just in time for summer!</li>
            <li> the sad thing is it goes to fast......and the price is tooooo High for me to pay evey week ...how long it lasted</li>
            <li> Significant improvement in makeup longevity. A bigger bottle is sorely needed.</li>
            <li> Noticed a smalllllll difference.</li>
