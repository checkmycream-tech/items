            <li>The magnums are nice shovel head tips</li>
            <li>so I sorted them to make sure all sizes were good</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very smooth with no burrs no buff off, I recommend these</li>
            <li>My set was delivered very quickly and in a nice case.</li>
            <li>i like these more than the plastic tips.</li>
            <li>I will post a update once the ok ones go through the ultrasonic and autoclave</li>
            <li>I love this kit, I waited and waited for them to be delivered throughout the week</li>
            <li>I love the veriety of the tips, they don&#x27;t have any RS tips</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m enjoying it..</li>
            <li>Love them what else can I say</li>
            <li>Got here in great time, box was undamaged so that was nice, open the box</li>
            <li>Plus the tips were freely at the bottom of the shipping box.</li>
            <li>These are not some cheap set of tips.</li>
            <li>Giving it three stars because they&#x27;re not of really high quality, they&#x27;re a decent set, I have seen and own way better quality tips than these.</li>
            <li>nice kit a must have for the money conscious tattoo artist</li>
            <li>exactly what i eeded i had lost many of my tips and now have every one i need price was just right</li>
            <li>so I had to super glue it on the case.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are good.</li>
            <li>Great little carrying case marked with size on the box.</li>
            <li>Kinda bummed but not really these did not cost much at all and will be happy if only a couple work out</li>
            <li>Ones I got were actually stainless.</li>
            <li>It really depends on what seller you get them from.</li>
            <li>The steel tips are not shaped all the same size so not all of them fit my steel tubes</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>shipping fast..</li>
            <li>but I can get a separate kit if I really need it</li>
            <li>the other ones look ok</li>
            <li>Made from high quality material.</li>
            <li>was all mixed up and half if them dont fit the needle size it says its for.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish was that the tips were marked as well for days when you have several close sizes out.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re made of rolled up steel, not milled or forged like other tips that I own, and some of the RLs and DTs needed a little sanding and grinding (not much) because they were sharp at the opening and had some excess steel inside of the tip, so be careful if you decide to order these, and if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s looking for high quality, I suggest you look some where else.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t vouch for ones from other sellers as there is a LOT of fake chrome plated crap on the market.</li>
            <li> (sorry my hands have paint</li>
            <li> but I noticed all Diamond tips were all misshaped and I don&#x27;t think i can use them :(</li>
            <li> really bad quality, don&#x27;t buy this stuff!</li>

            <li> Great deal. Just wish i would of thought about a grip when ordering this. oh well..</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Ones I got were actually stainless. It really depends on what seller you get them from. I got mine from 2020 Co and they are perfect. Can&#x27;t vouch for ones from other sellers as there is a LOT of fake chrome plated crap on the market.</li>
            <li> I only received 21 tips not 22. Plus the tips were freely at the bottom of the shipping box.</li>
            <li> bought these as a last second item, just to have backups when my disposibles ran out. i like these more than the plastic tips.</li>
            <li> Product is different than shown in the image. The letters labeling the tips are above the tips and are white. Tips FELL OUT OF THE CASE during shipment, which really sucks because its difficult to determine the tips with their corresponding numbers. As mentioned, the triangular shaped tips have a bit of excess metal at the ends. Definitely from China. I do not recommend this product, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> exactly what i eeded i had lost many of my tips and now have every one i need price was just right</li>
            <li> beautiful set of tips that are very precise.</li>
            <li> The steel tips are not shaped all the same size so not all of them fit my steel tubes</li>

            <li> Tips are great.. shipping fast.. I&#x27;m a mobile artist so i had planned to keep the tips organized in the box they came in which I&#x27;ve had no problem with but label for sizes was falling off as soon as i got it.. not a big problem tho..</li>
            <li> Got here in great time, box was undamaged so that was nice, open the box and they are all out of place so I sorted them to make sure all sizes were good but I noticed all Diamond tips were all misshaped and I don&#x27;t think i can use them :( the other ones look ok I will post a update once the ok ones go through the ultrasonic and autoclave *  Also the labels are white not blue like the picture Think next order I will order different ones.. Kinda bummed but not really these did not cost much at all and will be happy if only a couple work out (sorry my hands have paint I was painting the night before xD )</li>
            <li> I think it works great</li>
            <li> Good quality and nice packaging</li>

            <li> not cheap..love the tips..well packaged..i recommend these to starters to pros.</li>
            <li> got these for a friend that is a tattooist and he loves them</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves these they are a little hard to clean but part of it</li>
            <li> Love them what else can I say</li>
            <li> A couple tips were bent so the tattoo needle will not go through.  Other than that they are good.</li>
            <li> this is garbage! really bad quality, don&#x27;t buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> Timely delivery good product</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase.  Is as it says very happy.</li>
            <li> They work great but the labels keep falling off so I had to super glue it on the case.</li>
