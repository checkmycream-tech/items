            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy ! :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I swore I would never find a better pencil eyeliner than MAC Powerpoint Engraved</li>
            <li>(because everywhere I find it : I buy it...), to be sure I&#x27;ve enough of them for many years (one pencil lasts almost 1 year)...!!!</li>
            <li>It is a very intense eyeliner and would be good for the top of eyelid</li>
            <li>This eyeliner in particular is amazing!</li>
            <li>These are very good takes a second to use</li>
            <li>LOVE how buttery smooth</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the description says, it stays on for more then 10 hours its amazing.</li>
            <li>Easy to go on.  </li>
            <li>The color is just right though and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner has gorgeous black pigments and goes on very easy and smooth, but it runs very easy, you need a lighter for all day wear.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth also, no heating required.</li>
            <li>if not then much longer then that and its amazing</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something lasting, intense and perfect... then, THIS is the one to buy !</li>
            <li>and this one far far THE Best Ever</li>
            <li>Super smooth, glides on perfectly, and the black is like..black.</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite liner!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It goes on SUPER smoothly...</li>
            <li>BEST eyeliner hands down, even after shopping plenty at MAC, Sephora, Camera Ready Cosmetics and so on and so forth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first pack of 3 but am ordering more because I love them that much.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but perhaps as they get older, they shrink within the tube so that the lead slides out!</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>It is pretty intense, so I just use it on the top lash.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li>Overall a nice eyeliner for the price.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on you have to smudge right away if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve used, drugstore brand or expensive.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and dark it goes on - it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the intensity I want.</li>
            <li>how only 3 eyeliners can last that long, its perfect and especially that this isnt animal tested and all that extra good</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was a bit too heavy because I really was not expecting that kind of smoothness and intensity.  </li>
            <li>And for this price, its great its cost like $7 bucks in the store and 3 will last you like 4 1/2 - 5 months, with people that use a lot everyday,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy</li>
            <li>but no eyeliner really does.</li>
            <li>This also glides on just like UD 24/7, very creamy and doesn&#x27;t smudge on me.</li>
            <li>I use Mac or Clinique eyeliner and find that over the course of a day, the liner really fades.  </li>
            <li>without much pressure or effort.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily eye lid</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>These prestige pencils go on so smooth and don&#x27;t feel dry, no breakage either.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a VERY black eyeliner and this is perfect, I have a hard time with liquid</li>
            <li>Wow, that&#x27;s some intense eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a UD 24/7 girl for years, and was in the love when they released the perversion (pitch black) eyeliner except it was only available in their anniversary set, not individually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh if your wondering if your gonna get the right product, you definitely will</li>
            <li>It glides right on really easily, with no pulling or tugging at the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is the blackest eyeliner ever and it glides on sooo smooth, it might even be a little too smooth for you since its so black but even so it&#x27;s a pack of three so save one, throw one in the fridge for your daytime looks and keep the other one in room temperature for a sexy smudged smokey eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dark black and it does manage to stay on longer than a lot of eyeliners.</li>
            <li>You have to sharpen it ALL THE TIME because right after one quick line, the pencil is already dull.</li>
            <li>I have used Prestige eyeliners for years, dabbling back and forth with other more high end brands here and there as well, but I always come back to Prestige!</li>
            <li>---clearly</li>
            <li>I was so surprised by this liner.  </li>
            <li>I came here because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stock locally lately.</li>
            <li>MAC is equally long lasting and smudge free but can have the tendency to be a little more dry and break off.</li>
            <li>but it often seems that is the only way to get a super black color.</li>
            <li>this is such a high quality liner that it definately is up there with Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>so it needs to be applied carefully and gently.</li>
            <li>Also, you can smudge it out a bit right after you apply it; it appears to \\&quot;set\\&quot; about a minute or so after it&#x27;s on, so you have a little bit of room to play with smudging</li>
            <li>I also picked one of these up in the brown color, which I think might be more suited for me for everyday wear since I don&#x27;t wear my makeup too heavy for work.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The Prestige Total Intensity in deepest black is an exact dupe, every bit as dark as perversion and mac&#x27;s feline.</li>
            <li> I use it on my waterline, too and it doesn&#x27;t last as long there</li>
            <li> I usually need to set a pencil eyeliner with a little black eyeshadow on top but this one I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The result is an intense, liquid looking dark black line that just doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> The pencil lasts long, it doesn&#x27;t smear all over your under eye throughout the day if you wear it on your water line.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 with Amazon, even if I had 3 other same pencils  </li>
            <li> the only thing is it smears a little</li>
            <li> The only downside to these for me is that prestige is hard to find locally in the SLC area, thank goodness for amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get a thin, non-skipping straight line because it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; but the color does last all day!  </li>
            <li> You put it on one place and then it multiplies, perfectly - dark black lines everywhere</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be warned that the Deepest Black color is *very* black.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m really lazy.</li>
            <li> SO I don&#x27;t review products I usually like.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day for me, like at least 8 hours and has never smudged or flaked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wrong!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE how buttery smooth it goes on my eyelids but it tends to smear in humid weather. Overall a nice eyeliner for the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a VERY black eyeliner and this is perfect, I have a hard time with liquid but it often seems that is the only way to get a super black color. I was hesitant to order this because I had to get 3 at a time, but I am SOOOO glad I did. I already have gifted one out to a friend who was looking for something like this for her wedding. This has become my new favorite liner!</li>
            <li> Hard to get a thin, non-skipping straight line because it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; but the color does last all day!  Once it&#x27;s on you have to smudge right away if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve used, drugstore brand or expensive. It lasts all day for me, like at least 8 hours and has never smudged or flaked. I usually need to set a pencil eyeliner with a little black eyeshadow on top but this one I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very creamy so it needs to be applied carefully and gently.

            <li> literally the best eyeliner i&#x27;ve used for the price i paid for three. i agree with everyone else this is such a high quality liner that it definately is up there with Urban Decay. In my opinion, this is the blackest eyeliner ever and it glides on sooo smooth, it might even be a little too smooth for you since its so black but even so it&#x27;s a pack of three so save one, throw one in the fridge for your daytime looks and keep the other one in room temperature for a sexy smudged smokey eye. love this. i will buy over and over and over and over again</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something lasting, intense and perfect... then, THIS is the one to buy ! I bought 3 with Amazon, even if I had 3 other same pencils  (because everywhere I find it : I buy it...), to be sure I&#x27;ve enough of them for many years (one pencil lasts almost 1 year)...!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a UD 24/7 girl for years, and was in the love when they released the perversion (pitch black) eyeliner except it was only available in their anniversary set, not individually. The Prestige Total Intensity in deepest black is an exact dupe, every bit as dark as perversion and mac&#x27;s feline. It may be too black for some, but I adore super pitch black liners.     This also glides on just like UD 24/7, very creamy and doesn&#x27;t smudge on me. The only downside to these for me is that prestige is hard to find locally in the SLC area, thank goodness for amazon prime. Hopefully they keep stocking this set!</li>
            <li> So this eyeliner is just ok. Nothing more, nothing less. I got this because it seemed similar to urban decay&#x27;s eyeliners. It&#x27;s not. You have to sharpen it ALL THE TIME because right after one quick line, the pencil is already dull. The color is just right though and it is very easy to apply. Not bad, but I&#x27;m sticking with the Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Within the hour I had the rubbed off eyeliner in the corners of my eyes. It is a very intense eyeliner and would be good for the top of eyelid</li>
            <li> this eyeliner has gorgeous black pigments and goes on very easy and smooth, but it runs very easy, you need a lighter for all day wear.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this eyeliner.  I use Mac or Clinique eyeliner and find that over the course of a day, the liner really fades.  I was so surprised by this liner.  It goes on SUPER smoothly...without much pressure or effort.  The first time I used it I was a bit too heavy because I really was not expecting that kind of smoothness and intensity.  Love this liner.  I&#x27;m sharing with friends since I got 3 for the price of one Clinique liner.  Yay!</li>
            <li> I love the prestige line of pencils.  These are very good takes a second to use and you are done.  Stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s some intense eyeliner. Love it! Super smooth, glides on perfectly, and the black is like..black. Just need to get the perfect sharpener for it. Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li> the best eye liner I have found</li>
            <li> The pencil lasts long, it doesn&#x27;t smear all over your under eye throughout the day if you wear it on your water line. It also stays relatively intact for the day. It goes on smooth also, no heating required.</li>
            <li> I had read about this eyeliner on a makeup forum, where several people said that the Total Intensity version of this eyeliner is comparable to higher-end brands like MAC and Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7 eyeliners, and I have to agree!  It glides right on really easily, with no pulling or tugging at the delicate eye area.  It also lasts all day, with no fading or creasing.  Also, you can smudge it out a bit right after you apply it; it appears to \\&quot;set\\&quot; about a minute or so after it&#x27;s on, so you have a little bit of room to play with smudging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be warned that the Deepest Black color is *very* black.  I also picked one of these up in the brown color, which I think might be more suited for me for everyday wear since I don&#x27;t wear my makeup too heavy for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice product.  I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review after I use these eyeliners a bit more.</li>
            <li> So I been using this eyeliner for about a year I suppose, and its the best. It does exactly what the description says, it stays on for more then 10 hours its amazing. And for this price, its great its cost like $7 bucks in the store and 3 will last you like 4 1/2 - 5 months, with people that use a lot everyday, if not then much longer then that and its amazing how only 3 eyeliners can last that long, its perfect and especially that this isnt animal tested and all that extra good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh if your wondering if your gonna get the right product, you definitely will&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy ! :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m really lazy. SO I don&#x27;t review products I usually like. But I am an eyeliner ADDICT. I will buy eyeliner from every and anywhere just in order to test the blackest, richest, smoothest, and \\&quot;lastibility\\&quot; of each. None comes close to Prestige, which holds a 5 in each category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first pack of 3 but am ordering more because I love them that much. BEST eyeliner hands down, even after shopping plenty at MAC, Sephora, Camera Ready Cosmetics and so on and so forth! I&#x27;ve stopped looking for my gold mine in eyeliner. This is it!</li>
            <li> Easy to go on.  It is pretty intense, so I just use it on the top lash.  It tends not to smudge too!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Glides on nice the only thing is it smears a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dark black and it does manage to stay on longer than a lot of eyeliners. I do wish though I could find an eyeliner that does not come off until I want it to.</li>
            <li> This is the smoothest, blackest and most beautiful eye liner I have ever owned. Worth every penny! Definitely recommend! It gives the look of liquid liner with the ease of a pencil. Great quality!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but perhaps as they get older, they shrink within the tube so that the lead slides out! I liked the easy glide of the product on my lids.</li>
            <li> I have used Prestige eyeliners for years, dabbling back and forth with other more high end brands here and there as well, but I always come back to Prestige! This eyeliner in particular is amazing! I love how smooth and dark it goes on - it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the intensity I want. I came here because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stock locally lately. This is a great deal on Amazon for an AMAZING eyeliner!!!</li>
            <li> I swore I would never find a better pencil eyeliner than MAC Powerpoint Engraved ---clearly I&#x27;m wrong! MAC is equally long lasting and smudge free but can have the tendency to be a little more dry and break off. These prestige pencils go on so smooth and don&#x27;t feel dry, no breakage either. WOOHOO! The price is unbeatable too.</li>
            <li> You put it on one place and then it multiplies, perfectly - dark black lines everywhere - now it&#x27;s all up on the bone of my eye socket.</li>
            <li> All the five star reviews here are spot on.  This is what I have been looking for years!  AWESOME eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Amazing pencil best ever so far. I have really oily eye lid and this one far far THE Best Ever</li>
