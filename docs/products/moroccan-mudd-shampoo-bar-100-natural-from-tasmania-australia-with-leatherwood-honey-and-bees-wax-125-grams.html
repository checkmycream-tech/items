            <li>this is by far the best shampoo bar that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with nice healthy hair and so is my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo but found that I needed to condition slightly more often than I prefer to keep my hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>The thing that I liked about this shampoo is that made easy for me to brush it and helps with the rebel hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo bar is easy to use, creates good lather, and leaves my hair feeling silky and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>smells great and leaves your hair clean clean and very shinny  great product</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this Mudd Shampoo.</li>

            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use for travel and love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and frankly, I did love the product before it cut me up...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been really enjoying this bar shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>Shampoo is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product that I purchased along with their conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased to have found this product.</li>
            <li>I love Bar soap</li>
            <li>and I love the way this feels.  </li>
            <li>, i smell a bit of orange but more so patchouli than anything.</li>
            <li>Love that I can use this shampoo with no conditioner (I blow dyer my hair every morning) still get volume and softness.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and shiny with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo bar so much!  </li>
            <li>Clean, manageable hair!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this soap is that it does not take all of my hair oil from the scalp like any other chemical shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply which is a plus</li>
            <li>I have colored and over process highlighted fine hair, with ethnic hispanic wave/curls.</li>
            <li>They told me that the manufacture process was plastic-free so I believe them when they say that this was some bizarre fluke.</li>
            <li>We both find Moroccan Mudd Shampoo Bar to be effective and gentle.  </li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using it wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair product is good</li>
            <li>so this is VERY economical.</li>
            <li>If I choose to use the conditioner I can leave my hair with it natural curl or works great to set curls with a hot iron vs hair damaging hair spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing a significant improvement in my hair already with using the bar just twice.</li>
            <li>I have fine gray hair that I color, and this shampoo adds tremendous body and volume.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly red hair and this product is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>This bar gets my (and my thicker haired daughter&#x27;s) scalp and hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Get your hair really clean.</li>
            <li>The bar lathers and my hair rinses clean...</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to love the product...</li>
            <li>Also has a nice natural</li>
            <li>hair feels really soft and my curls are nicely defined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Falling out more than normal.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and good value.  </li>
            <li>His is very thick and more coarse, mine is very fine and this shampoo bar works beautifully for both of us.</li>
            <li>Thus far I&#x27;m pleased with the product, it is serving it&#x27;s purpose for me.</li>
            <li>This led me to seek out an even more natural alternative to see if it would make a difference.</li>
            <li>so far I will be ordering more when the ones I have are gone.</li>
            <li>I will admit that it has taken time to get use to using the product, but it is worth experimenting with for the results.</li>
            <li>I bought this bar because it had none of the same ingredients as shampoo and have used it 4 times so far and love it!!</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product my hair felt like straw.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using bar shampoo</li>
            <li>Overall I love both products and would order again.  </li>
            <li>As with the honey silk hair conditioner bar, I used this for the first time today.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time i use shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have finally found something that meets all of our needs.</li>
            <li>I admit it is a bit spendy but very well worth</li>
            <li>If you rub the bar on your head it leathers quite quickly and rinsed out easy, I have fine hair that breaks easy and have noticed considerably less hair left in the bottom of the shower.</li>
            <li>I am still deciding on this one it does seem to add body to my hair, I hate clean static fly away hair</li>
            <li>a little herbally but nice.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how this works in the summer with our high humidity in NJ!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be too much of a change from my already organic/natural regimen since I cut out crappy SLS drugstore products years ago.</li>
            <li>Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo bar a lot more than I expected to.  </li>
            <li>will also be testing the voodoo bamboo charcoal shampoo bar, as the seller suggested it might work very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helped my dry/ damaged hair recover.</li>
            <li>I have tried several shampoo bars and most either strip my hair and make it dry and brittle or don&#x27;t clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Very earthy scent</li>
            <li>Obviously natural ingredients are key to a healthy body.</li>
            <li>Other times, without adding more water, I pick up the bar and add another stroke or 2 and lather up again.</li>
            <li>It made more room for other liquid products.</li>
            <li>Soap left my hair and scalp feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair smelling clean.</li>
            <li>And, I got used to have dull looking but very healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo  has work very good for my hair, I have used it for a few months now and won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very  nice and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>If at first it seems to make hair dry and unmanageable, try several more washes then decide.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me and I was going to order again but the bar was unavailable when I needed it, so I tried a different bar from this company that I like even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I first get my hair absolutely soaked through with water first, then stroke the top of my head 3-4 times with the small end of the bar that it&#x27;s enough to get a decent lather.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was awesome.</li>
            <li>So far this formula (Moroccan Mudd) is dealing very well with my frizz.</li>
            <li>It is also gentle on natural hair.</li>
            <li>but I have struggled to either make a shampoo that works, or find one that I can buy that is both all natural and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really do worry about what my family puts on our bodies, but if a product is all natural but doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li>After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try some others for fun, but am not opposed to coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn&#x27;t at all</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair improves with this new regimen.</li>
            <li>No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  </li>
            <li>First thing I loved is that it is plastic-free and has minimal (and recyclable) packaging which is important to me and my goal of producing as little waste as possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously been using Desert Essence Organic fragrance free shampoo and conditioner followed by kinky curly leave-in and kinky curly curling custard.</li>
            <li>I used it this morning, I didn&#x27;t notice the plastic because the top layer of soap had JUST melted down to reveal it, and now I have a deep scratch running across my chest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always said that I love the product, and I take back my previous \\&quot;You&#x27;ve lost me as a customer!\\&quot; rant.</li>
            <li>Any company that cares enough to send multiple emails and refund not only this specific product but every other product that I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past (the VooDoo bar, also fabulous) is a company that I will happily continue to do business with.</li>
            <li>so this is great for that dirty hair look, but then again the texture is wiry, but it looks shiny.</li>
            <li>I was going to return it when I figured I&#x27;d give it another shot hoping it was just the natural aspect instead of commercialized product.</li>
            <li>All natural and no harmful</li>
            <li>It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  </li>
            <li>It left my hair really really greasy.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft after rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I have long hair but decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Since my son was born nine years ago, I have been on a quest to find all natural bath and body products for my family.</li>
            <li>but it cleans your hair while keeping it moisturized and bouncy with out stripping your needed natural oils.</li>
            <li>and my hair doesn&#x27;t have the completely stripped of texture</li>
            <li>It seems the natural oils react to the heat and help polish my hair.</li>
            <li>I am new to the shampoo-bar movement and only have tried about 3 brands so far.</li>
            <li>Several washings later I&#x27;ve found it works wonders and the compliments I&#x27;ve received on my hair are all in the positive.</li>
            <li>and it feels much gentler on my dry winter scalp.</li>
            <li>So far the bar of shampoo is lasting much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this bar only twice so far and am already amazed by it.</li>
            <li>I accidentally used a bit too much and spent ages rinsing it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine that&#x27;s from keeping it as dry as possible during the whole process.</li>
            <li>The soap held up will in my plastic soap box for about three weeks before it became soft and more difficult to get out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it without the Apple Cider Vinegar rinse and did feel a little residue on my hair</li>
            <li>It was easy to work into a lather and into my long thick hair.</li>

            <li> This bar gets my (and my thicker haired daughter&#x27;s) scalp and hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Get your hair really clean.</li>
            <li> The bar lathers and my hair rinses clean...</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to love the product...</li>
            <li> Also has a nice natural</li>
            <li> hair feels really soft and my curls are nicely defined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Falling out more than normal.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and good value.  </li>
            <li> His is very thick and more coarse, mine is very fine and this shampoo bar works beautifully for both of us.</li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;m pleased with the product, it is serving it&#x27;s purpose for me.</li>
            <li> This led me to seek out an even more natural alternative to see if it would make a difference.</li>
            <li> so far I will be ordering more when the ones I have are gone.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it has taken time to get use to using the product, but it is worth experimenting with for the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this bar because it had none of the same ingredients as shampoo and have used it 4 times so far and love it!!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product my hair felt like straw.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using bar shampoo</li>
            <li> Overall I love both products and would order again.  </li>
            <li> As with the honey silk hair conditioner bar, I used this for the first time today.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time i use shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li> So glad to have finally found something that meets all of our needs.</li>
            <li> I admit it is a bit spendy but very well worth</li>
            <li> If you rub the bar on your head it leathers quite quickly and rinsed out easy, I have fine hair that breaks easy and have noticed considerably less hair left in the bottom of the shower.</li>
            <li> I am still deciding on this one it does seem to add body to my hair, I hate clean static fly away hair</li>
            <li> a little herbally but nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how this works in the summer with our high humidity in NJ!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be too much of a change from my already organic/natural regimen since I cut out crappy SLS drugstore products years ago.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo bar a lot more than I expected to.  </li>
            <li> will also be testing the voodoo bamboo charcoal shampoo bar, as the seller suggested it might work very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped my dry/ damaged hair recover.</li>
            <li> I have tried several shampoo bars and most either strip my hair and make it dry and brittle or don&#x27;t clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Very earthy scent</li>
            <li> Obviously natural ingredients are key to a healthy body.</li>
            <li> Other times, without adding more water, I pick up the bar and add another stroke or 2 and lather up again.</li>
            <li> It made more room for other liquid products.</li>
            <li> Soap left my hair and scalp feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair smelling clean.</li>
            <li> And, I got used to have dull looking but very healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo  has work very good for my hair, I have used it for a few months now and won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very  nice and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> If at first it seems to make hair dry and unmanageable, try several more washes then decide.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me and I was going to order again but the bar was unavailable when I needed it, so I tried a different bar from this company that I like even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I first get my hair absolutely soaked through with water first, then stroke the top of my head 3-4 times with the small end of the bar that it&#x27;s enough to get a decent lather.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was awesome.</li>
            <li> So far this formula (Moroccan Mudd) is dealing very well with my frizz.</li>
            <li> It is also gentle on natural hair.</li>
            <li> but I have struggled to either make a shampoo that works, or find one that I can buy that is both all natural and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really do worry about what my family puts on our bodies, but if a product is all natural but doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li> After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try some others for fun, but am not opposed to coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn&#x27;t at all</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair improves with this new regimen.</li>
            <li> No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  </li>
            <li> First thing I loved is that it is plastic-free and has minimal (and recyclable) packaging which is important to me and my goal of producing as little waste as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using Desert Essence Organic fragrance free shampoo and conditioner followed by kinky curly leave-in and kinky curly curling custard.</li>
            <li> I used it this morning, I didn&#x27;t notice the plastic because the top layer of soap had JUST melted down to reveal it, and now I have a deep scratch running across my chest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always said that I love the product, and I take back my previous \\&quot;You&#x27;ve lost me as a customer!\\&quot; rant.</li>
            <li> Any company that cares enough to send multiple emails and refund not only this specific product but every other product that I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past (the VooDoo bar, also fabulous) is a company that I will happily continue to do business with.</li>
            <li> so this is great for that dirty hair look, but then again the texture is wiry, but it looks shiny.</li>
            <li> I was going to return it when I figured I&#x27;d give it another shot hoping it was just the natural aspect instead of commercialized product.</li>
            <li> All natural and no harmful</li>
            <li> It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  </li>
            <li> It left my hair really really greasy.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft after rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I have long hair but decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Since my son was born nine years ago, I have been on a quest to find all natural bath and body products for my family.</li>
            <li> but it cleans your hair while keeping it moisturized and bouncy with out stripping your needed natural oils.</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t have the completely stripped of texture</li>
            <li> It seems the natural oils react to the heat and help polish my hair.</li>
            <li> I am new to the shampoo-bar movement and only have tried about 3 brands so far.</li>
            <li> Several washings later I&#x27;ve found it works wonders and the compliments I&#x27;ve received on my hair are all in the positive.</li>
            <li> and it feels much gentler on my dry winter scalp.</li>
            <li> So far the bar of shampoo is lasting much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bar only twice so far and am already amazed by it.</li>
            <li> I accidentally used a bit too much and spent ages rinsing it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I imagine that&#x27;s from keeping it as dry as possible during the whole process.</li>
            <li> The soap held up will in my plastic soap box for about three weeks before it became soft and more difficult to get out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it without the Apple Cider Vinegar rinse and did feel a little residue on my hair</li>
            <li> It was easy to work into a lather and into my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using these natural shampoos since January and notice alarming amount of comedones naturally extracting themselves where other shampoos would create acne.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for damaged and dry partially wavy hair for a luxurious soft, bouncy and manageable mane!</li>
            <li> The lather does die down rather quickly, but I usually feel like it did well enough and rinse off at that point.</li>
            <li> I have long, somewhat dry, chemically treated (highlighted) hair.  </li>
            <li> Other shampoo worked but managed to make my scalp and back break out.</li>
            <li> Dry.</li>
            <li> My husband tends to dry hair while mind tends to oily.  </li>
            <li> It does leave the hair feeling like it has residue, but even so I haven&#x27;t found that to be a problem after letting my hair dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was awfully dry, and tangled.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> Since I have very dry skin, I don&#x27;t feel itchy or dry after I use this product</li>
            <li> We have done no poo, made various shampoo recipes and still haven&#x27;t  found something that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of searching for a chemical-free shampoo I have finally found it!</li>
            <li> I use the bar followed by an ACV rinse recipe of 1c water:1Tbs ACV and a few drops lavender and rosemary essential oil.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this company.</li>
            <li> but this is not what expected.</li>
            <li> Felt very dry but at the same time as if I washed my hair with hair spray because of how stiff it was.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde, which has been damaged by highlighting my more brassy dirty blonde natural hair color and it was really in bad condition.  </li>
            <li> This may just be me personally, but my dirty blond hair got 2 shades darker after the first week or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definately going to try other Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars once I finish using this.</li>
            <li> I havehad to quit using styling gel and other products in my hair too.</li>
            <li> so it took a little experimenting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t trust a company with such poor quality control.</li>
            <li> I hate that &amp;#34;squeeky-clean&amp;#34; sound, and the tangling of my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used it twice and still very drying and tangaled my hair badly.</li>
            <li> Out of the shower I use a small amount of Dr Bronner style creme.</li>
            <li> I just take a small chunk of the bar with me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about separating &#x27;liquids&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Support small businesses and try this product over &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/ringlet hair and it&#x27;s been quite damaged lately.</li>
            <li> Another bar hair product that doesn&#x27;t work for hai like mine, which is medium-course thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Even though I hated the conditioner bar, I really like this bar soap.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was not happy with he results that I was getting from healthier/eco-friendly shampoos.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I then try to use the soap on my body, but my skin got painfully itchy.</li>
            <li> makes my hair waxy and like straw :(</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first tried this product my hair felt like straw. I was going to return it when I figured I&#x27;d give it another shot hoping it was just the natural aspect instead of commercialized product. Several washings later I&#x27;ve found it works wonders and the compliments I&#x27;ve received on my hair are all in the positive. I&#x27;ve changed nothing except shampoo ( the bar stated here) and quinoa bar conditioner. I&#x27;ve changed my review from a three to a five star. If at first it seems to make hair dry and unmanageable, try several more washes then decide. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be displeased</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Mudd Shampoo. This is my first time using bar shampoo so it took a little experimenting. I&#x27;ve found that if I first get my hair absolutely soaked through with water first, then stroke the top of my head 3-4 times with the small end of the bar that it&#x27;s enough to get a decent lather. The lather does die down rather quickly, but I usually feel like it did well enough and rinse off at that point. Other times, without adding more water, I pick up the bar and add another stroke or 2 and lather up again. So far the bar of shampoo is lasting much longer than I expected. I imagine that&#x27;s from keeping it as dry as possible during the whole process.</li>
            <li> I received the bar on time. I just retired and subsequently cut my hair short. With a trip on the horizon this shampoo made sense for both travelling and the shortened hair. Thus far I&#x27;m pleased with the product, it is serving it&#x27;s purpose for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this shampoo bar and am quite pleased with the results. I had tried Wen before and was still left with a lot of frizz. So far this formula (Moroccan Mudd) is dealing very well with my frizz. Can&#x27;t wait to see how this works in the summer with our high humidity in NJ!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly red hair and this product is AWESOME!  I definitely recommend.  When I straighten my hair I use their Moroccan Mud Shampoo Bar by Beauty and the Bees.  All natural and no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;On days that I want to let my hair be curly I use the Rosemary &amp; Mint Shampoo Bar by Beauty and the Bees.  It leaves my hair so soft and shiny with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a couple of times.  Cleans my hair good</li>
            <li> I am still deciding on this one it does seem to add body to my hair, I hate clean static fly away hair so this is great for that dirty hair look, but then again the texture is wiry, but it looks shiny. it&#x27;s  different every shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bar only twice so far and am already amazed by it. I didn&#x27;t think it would be too much of a change from my already organic/natural regimen since I cut out crappy SLS drugstore products years ago. I&#x27;d previously been using Desert Essence Organic fragrance free shampoo and conditioner followed by kinky curly leave-in and kinky curly curling custard. I have thick curly/ringlet hair and it&#x27;s been quite damaged lately. Breaking. Dry. Falling out more than normal. This led me to seek out an even more natural alternative to see if it would make a difference. I&#x27;m seeing a significant improvement in my hair already with using the bar just twice. My hair is softer, lighter, bouncier, and has more volume. I use the bar followed by an ACV rinse recipe of 1c water:1Tbs ACV and a few drops lavender and rosemary essential oil. Out of the shower I use a small amount of Dr Bronner style creme. Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair improves with this new regimen. (I know it says I&#x27;m not a verified purchaser of this product but that&#x27;s because I order through my bro&#x27;s prime account).</li>
            <li> I stopped using shampoo for environmental and health reasons. Also, I was not happy with he results that I was getting from healthier/eco-friendly shampoos. I have been using different kinds of olive oil soap for my hair for over 4 years. And, I got used to have dull looking but very healthy hair. I decided to try this Moroccan Mudd Shampoo bar to see if there will be any difference on my hair. This is the best shampoo soap I have tried so far. The results were amazing. I also purchased the Honey Silk Conditioner Bar. Together, they are the best!</li>
            <li> Works ok. A little disappointed. I like the lemon chamomile for my hair the best!</li>
            <li> Another bar hair product that doesn&#x27;t work for hai like mine, which is medium-course thick hair.  Easy to apply which is a plus but I have yet to see any difference in my strands after several weeks of use.  I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> great product and perfect for those of us who don&#x27;t check luggage!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for travel and love it. It made more room for other liquid products. Love it.</li>
            <li> INITIAL REVIEW: I guess I already wrote this review under the seller&#x27;s profile, so bear with me if you&#x27;ve heard it before. There is a piece of plastic embedded in my soap bar. I used it this morning, I didn&#x27;t notice the plastic because the top layer of soap had JUST melted down to reveal it, and now I have a deep scratch running across my chest. Be careful with this company. As much as I wanted to love the product...and frankly, I did love the product before it cut me up...I can&#x27;t trust a company with such poor quality control. I&#x27;ll be purchasing similar products from another company from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED REVIEW: Ok. So I am amending this review because the representatives of the company have been 110% responsive, and were horrified that this happened. They told me that the manufacture process was plastic-free so I believe them when they say that this was some bizarre fluke. I&#x27;ve always said that I love the product, and I take back my previous \\&quot;You&#x27;ve lost me as a customer!\\&quot; rant. Any company that cares enough to send multiple emails and refund not only this specific product but every other product that I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past (the VooDoo bar, also fabulous) is a company that I will happily continue to do business with.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  But I had heard your hair or scalp has to adjust to shampoo bars so I kept using it.  After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become. It also leaves your body nice and moisturized and so smooth too!  I also use the Tasmania conditioner bar just on the ends of my hair and it compliments this bar very nicely.  No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  I am a blonde, which has been damaged by highlighting my more brassy dirty blonde natural hair color and it was really in bad condition.  Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn&#x27;t at all and it does have a pleasant clean scent, nothing overpowering just a hint of a fruity or citrus scent.  It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  Overall I love both products and would order again.  Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.  Would recommend for damaged and dry partially wavy hair for a luxurious soft, bouncy and manageable mane!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo bar a lot more than I expected to.  I have long, somewhat dry, chemically treated (highlighted) hair.  This shampoo bar is easy to use, creates good lather, and leaves my hair feeling silky and tangle free.  Also has a nice natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this bar for traveling - I just take a small chunk of the bar with me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about separating &#x27;liquids&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of searching for a chemical-free shampoo I have finally found it! First thing I loved is that it is plastic-free and has minimal (and recyclable) packaging which is important to me and my goal of producing as little waste as possible. Second, it actually works! The bar produces suds, which is something that after 18 months of chemical-free shampoo I realize I need the suds to feel like my hair is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Beauty and the Bees for this wonderful product! Now if I could just find it locally...</li>
            <li> Soap left my hair and scalp feeling clean.  The soap held up will in my plastic soap box for about three weeks before it became soft and more difficult to get out of the box.  You don&#x27;t need much to work up a good lather.  Lasts a long time and good value.  It helped my scalp problem a bit, but not a cure.  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was awesome.</li>
            <li> As with the honey silk hair conditioner bar, I used this for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very  nice and you only need a small amount. I accidentally used a bit too much and spent ages rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels really soft and my curls are nicely defined.&lt;br /&gt;I will also be testing the voodoo bamboo charcoal shampoo bar, as the seller suggested it might work very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped my dry/ damaged hair recover. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about fixing my frizz before I leave the house :)  This may just be me personally, but my dirty blond hair got 2 shades darker after the first week or so. something to consider. I keep my bar in a plastic case to keep it moist, but be warned. When hydrated, the bar is fairly soft and can break apart so be careful. I like the product and will be ordering another for college. Support small businesses and try this product over &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have shampooed my hair about once every 2-3 months for over 10 years. I hate that &amp;#34;squeeky-clean&amp;#34; sound, and the tangling of my thick curly hair. This bar gets my (and my thicker haired daughter&#x27;s) scalp and hair clean without drying it out. I even used it on my Virgin Indian Remy weave hair, and it didn&#x27;t require conditioning, afterward.</li>
            <li> This bar lathers well and smells great. It is also gentle on natural hair.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best shampoo bar that I have ever tried. it lathers so well and it rinses out amazingly. no felt over.reduces. my hair is smooth and it smells nice. a little herbally but nice. I will never buy any thing else!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  My husband tends to dry hair while mind tends to oily.  We both find Moroccan Mudd Shampoo Bar to be effective and gentle.  I use the vinegar rinse and he uses a cream rinse.  No scalp itching!  Clean, manageable hair!</li>
            <li> I did not like the Mudd Shampoo Bar. It left my hair really really greasy. I would like to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I use organic shampoo but this is not what expected.</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo but found that I needed to condition slightly more often than I prefer to keep my hair from becoming frizzy. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me and I was going to order again but the bar was unavailable when I needed it, so I tried a different bar from this company that I like even better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!. I am new to the shampoo-bar movement and only have tried about 3 brands so far. I just keep coming back to this one every time, I absolutely love it. My biggest problem used to be frizzy hair, and this is the only shampoo that seems so take  care of that problem for me. It does leave the hair feeling like it has residue, but even so I haven&#x27;t found that to be a problem after letting my hair dry. If you find yourself having that problem you can either try a vinegar rinse or a conditioner bar (I am actually using the Honey Silk Hair conditioner from the same company).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have tried several shampoo bars and most either strip my hair and make it dry and brittle or don&#x27;t clean my hair.  This bar is a nice balance of cleaning and conditioning.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!! My hair was awfully dry, and tangled.  I then try to use the soap on my body, but my skin got painfully itchy. I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
            <li> makes my hair waxy and like straw :(</li>
            <li> This shampoo  has work very good for my hair, I have used it for a few months now and won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoos. The thing that I liked about this shampoo is that made easy for me to brush it and helps with the rebel hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo bar so much!  It made my hair soft after rinse it out.  The best thing about this soap is that it does not take all of my hair oil from the scalp like any other chemical shampoos.  Since I have very dry skin, I don&#x27;t feel itchy or dry after I use this product and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make my hair soft.  I&#x27;m definately going to try other Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars once I finish using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really enjoying this bar shampoo. I experimented with a lot of all-natural washing options and this has left my hair feeling its cleanest.</li>
            <li> first time i use shampoo bar.  I love it  smells great and leaves your hair clean clean and very shinny  great product</li>
            <li> Shampoo is ok. Get your hair really clean.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar!! I feel comfortable using it wash my hair. It won&#x27;t make my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product that I purchased along with their conditioner.  Even though I hated the conditioner bar, I really like this bar soap.  It lathers well, cleans well, and leaves your hair looking shiny.  The only reason for four stars is the price.  For this price, I would have liked to see some sort of soap dish to store it in.  Otherwise, I would expect a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this shampoo bar. I was hesitant at first because I have long hair but decided to try it.  The bar lathers and my hair rinses clean...no build up!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Since my son was born nine years ago, I have been on a quest to find all natural bath and body products for my family. We make our own deodorant, lotion, bug spray and soap but I have struggled to either make a shampoo that works, or find one that I can buy that is both all natural and reasonably priced. We have done no poo, made various shampoo recipes and still haven&#x27;t  found something that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down or greasy. Based on the great reviews, I took a chance and bought this bar. It is honestly so wonderful. My husband and I have very different hair. His is very thick and more coarse, mine is very fine and this shampoo bar works beautifully for both of us. It lathers up very nicely and It smells really good as well. For my husband, no conditioner is necessary. For my hair, I have been following with the silk conditioning bar. My hair looks really good and feels and smells good too. We have had the bar for only a week but I am hooked. I followed another reviewers suggestion and cut about an inch off the end and we use that in the shower and keep the rest put away to extend the life of the bar, and from the size of the bar at the end of this week, I am estimating that my family of four will get about three weeks out of each segment and I think I will get about five segments from each bar so this is VERY economical. I am really pleased to have found this product. I really do worry about what my family puts on our bodies, but if a product is all natural but doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a no go. So glad to have finally found something that meets all of our needs.</li>
            <li> Very drying. Felt very dry but at the same time as if I washed my hair with hair spray because of how stiff it was. I am Caucasian with nice healthy hair and so is my boyfriend. I used it twice and still very drying and tangaled my hair badly. My boyfriend used it and he felt the same way. So I&#x27;ve decided to stick to the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; method hair cleanser. You can get the same type of hair conditioning cleanser at Sally&#x27;s. It&#x27;s also like a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; type of hair cleaner but it cleans your hair while keeping it moisturized and bouncy with out stripping your needed natural oils. It is called &#x27;Hair One&#x27; and I use the argan oil but there&#x27;s different picks. There&#x27;s also another one called &#x27;As I Am&#x27; - coconut cowash cleansing conditioner. Amazing on my hair and we are sticking to them.</li>
            <li> It works really well it washed my hair really good I have natural hair product is good I wanted to try something different not in a bottle and the bar shampoo I found</li>
            <li> I love Bar soap and I love the way this feels.  Lots of lather without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have fine gray hair that I color, and this shampoo adds tremendous body and volume.  It also seems to have cleared up bumps I would get on my scalp.  Lathers beautifully.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very earthy scent, i smell a bit of orange but more so patchouli than anything. It was easy to work into a lather and into my long thick hair. Left my hair smelling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using shampoo bars for a short time.  I started with Beauty and the Bees sample pack, which has 6 types, and this is the kind I tried.  I like the earthy smell, and the body.  I&#x27;m going to try some others for fun, but am not opposed to coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for about a year. I used Leggitt&#x27;s shampoo bar for about 6 months and loved it, but when the weather got colder I found it too drying. This has been working well for me. The first time I used it without the Apple Cider Vinegar rinse and did feel a little residue on my hair but after I read the directions and used the rinse I&#x27;ve been very happy and it feels much gentler on my dry winter scalp.</li>
            <li> For some reason I have started having issues with soaps and shampoos as they all cause me to break out in patches of eczema all over the back of my head and between my fingers. I havehad to quit using styling gel and other products in my hair too. Without conditioner getting a comb or brush through my hair is a joke. I bought this bar because it had none of the same ingredients as shampoo and have used it 4 times so far and love it!! If you rub the bar on your head it leathers quite quickly and rinsed out easy, I have fine hair that breaks easy and have noticed considerably less hair left in the bottom of the shower. The best part is if used on the rest of the body it moisturizes too and my hair doesn&#x27;t have the completely stripped of texture feel it gets when using bar soap like ivory soap. I admit it is a bit spendy but very well worth the.money so far I will be ordering more when the ones I have are gone.</li>
            <li> Love that I can use this shampoo with no conditioner (I blow dyer my hair every morning) still get volume and softness. It seems the natural oils react to the heat and help polish my hair. If I choose to use the conditioner I can leave my hair with it natural curl or works great to set curls with a hot iron vs hair damaging hair spray. I have colored and over process highlighted fine hair, with ethnic hispanic wave/curls. Other shampoo worked but managed to make my scalp and back break out. I have been using these natural shampoos since January and notice alarming amount of comedones naturally extracting themselves where other shampoos would create acne. Obviously natural ingredients are key to a healthy body. I will admit that it has taken time to get use to using the product, but it is worth experimenting with for the results.</li>
