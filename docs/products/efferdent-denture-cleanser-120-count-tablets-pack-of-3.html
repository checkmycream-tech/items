            <li> Cleaning your dental appliance with a toothbrush actually scratches its surface and creates grooves that bacteria can thrive in.  I have two retainers that I wear every night, and these tablets are all I use. Just drop one in warm water, then drop your appliance in, and you get a much more thorough cleaning. I switched to a local generic brand (cheaper) but they have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I will order from them again, their service is great asnd the prooduct is whast they say.</li>
