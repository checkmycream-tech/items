            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>I used it as a first step repellant against mosquito/bug bites during my two week mission trip to Tamale, Ghana, Africa.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing, I returned home yesterday around 5 PM.  </li>
            <li>and wow it works super well on her and me</li>
            <li>If I were in the store I would not purchase these is skip to the ones that had taken so much abuse .I</li>

            <li>I decided to go with the Skin-So-Soft + vinegar + water mix, and WOW</li>
            <li>the flies completely stopped bothering my thin-skinned Thoroughbred who has been getting eaten alive this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>.. would recommend putting it in a spray bottle as putting it on my hands first seem to dry my hands up..</li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area, and am allergic to mayflys.  </li>
            <li>Best inset repellent ever.</li>

            <li> Leave skin feeling soft, very soft!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not advertised to do so, but I&#x27;ve been using this for years to keep away bugs during the summer months.  I live in a very rural area, and am allergic to mayflys.  I put this on after I shower in the AM and don&#x27;t rinse it off.  Keeps my skin moisturized and the bugs away!</li>
            <li> Love it great price will be using it everyday</li>

            <li> My bottles came damaged and had dirt all over them 😐 no Bueno seriously the bottles looked like they had been kicked around on the concrete just scuffed all over and dirty . If I were in the store I would not purchase these is skip to the ones that had taken so much abuse .I love skin so soft so I know the product itself is good . But not so sure I&#x27;ll order from this seller again</li>

            <li> My daughter was getting lots of bug bites and nothing worked so&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this and ordered this and wow it works super well on her and me.. would recommend putting it in a spray bottle as putting it on my hands first seem to dry my hands up.. also the lotion works to just keep to the original for best results</li>
            <li> In fact it attracts mosquitos ,,,,if you are looking for the old skin so soft from the 80s this isnt it this version has more perfume it makes me want to gag and it does not repel mosquitos it attracts it went straight to the garbage worst buy. would not reccomend.</li>

            <li> Super. Love this. Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!!  I used it as a first step repellant against mosquito/bug bites during my two week mission trip to Tamale, Ghana, Africa.  I also used Off! repellant around my ankles and arms.  After long days in the villages, I would shower and add the Skin So Soft without applying Off! repellant.  I was never bitten!  Funny thing, I returned home yesterday around 5 PM.  It took 2 days travel to get back home.  Within two hours of being home and no Skin So Soft, I was bitten by a mosquito :(.  I&#x27;ll now be using this product in North Carolina!!</li>
            <li> It does seem to repel mosquitoes and ticks, but it just smells too strongly.  If it&#x27;s not the perfume keeping the bugs away I wish they would cut back on the fragrance. That way it could be a more healthy bug spray.</li>
            <li> Used for years. Great product.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  This is the real product from Avon at a very good price.  I love the scent.</li>

            <li> Great keeping the mosquitoes at bay.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, both in the bath water and as a body oil,&lt;br /&gt;to ward away insects and bees. Not sure why they hate the&lt;br /&gt;smell, I love it and it works better that the stinky ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product..it smells great. This product was a great asset while on active duty in south west asia...It served as a great insect repellent</li>
            <li> These arrived on time for Christmas and lit up my grandmother&#x27;s face. She kept talking about needing more Skin-So-Soft oil, and thankfully didn&#x27;t contact an Avon rep before I had a chance to surprise her. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I use it as an insect repellent.Very gentle &amp; effective.</li>
            <li> I started using this product as a teenager for the sole purpose of a bath oil.  Who would have figured that thirty years later I&#x27;d still be using it, only this time for a bug repellent!  Works wonderfully for both purposes.</li>
