            <li>They love to wear it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a nice nylon material, versus a plastic and is well sewn along the edge.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law owns a salon and really liked this cape for children.</li>
            <li>She liked the style and the material.</li>
            <li>nice kids sized cape.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely around the neck.</li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li>This cape was a perfect size for my eight and four year old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, I&#x27;ll give it that, and my boy really liked the pattern.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it effectively keeps most hair away from his body.</li>
            <li>It is a very cute print, and the nice smooth material allows hair to brush off easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking for a short-in-the-back, long-in-the-front smock with a cute pattern and a snap closure?</li>
            <li>We love this smock for kids.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Many snaps to adjust to as he grows.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect size for a toddler or any child under a teenage size.</li>
            <li>Well it just works ok.  </li>
            <li>Cute design too.  </li>
            <li>I love this cape it is adorable.</li>
            <li>Holds up well in the wash and the snaps are sturdy and much better</li>
            <li>He loves cute prints of this cape.</li>
            <li>If I can buy again, I would choose something with Velcro closure to better seal the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for a child ten years of age or under.</li>
            <li>Great to use for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>This was great for my 2 year old who I like to just take a pair of hair trimmers and buzz his hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more work to clean.  </li>
            <li>Is nice and at first, wished I ordered the velcro</li>
            <li>It has many snaps to easily get the right fit around your child&#x27;s neck.  </li>
            <li>Also fun for kids to have a cape that fits them :)</li>
            <li>This is perfect for small kids.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s washable and fun to look at and the price cannot be beat!  </li>
            <li>The hair slides right off and washes off easily too.</li>
            <li>Grandkids love the cute pattern, and I like the way it fits their necks tightly enough so that they don&#x27;t get covered with hair.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does make for a good super hero cape when not using it to catch hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>the job and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>In spite of having my hair cut at a salon for many many years, I can&#x27;t really remember (even just last week)</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, I ordered this because I wanted a Velcro closure and most of the other kids&#x27; smocks had snap closures.</li>
            <li>Mine tore right off the fabric when I was trying to pull the buttons apart.</li>
            <li>Hair comes right off</li>
            <li>and they always leave his good capes a sticky mess.</li>
            <li>Great for toddler hair cuts, to avoid getting hair all over them, since it&#x27;s hard to rinse all the hair off their body.</li>
            <li>It well covers my son body and he does not feel hot as well.</li>
            <li>Now he doesn&#x27;t argue much at all when the clipper comes out!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for at home cuts.</li>
            <li>if most hair capes cover all the way around including the back.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li>Over all nice design...good for keeping the kids distracted when you tell them to look down at the birds.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants to trim their child&#x27;s hair without hair falling onto the clothes/body.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really fall over his body.</li>
            <li>It was cute and finally made my 3 year old sit still for his hair cut.</li>
            <li>By using this styling cape, the dreaded shower after is a lot better (just have to rinse head, not try to get little pieces of hair off whole body) makes for a happier baby/toddler and mom!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for an older kid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely kid sized, but large enough for my son to sit criss-cross-applesauce and easily cover his knees and feet too.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>Numerous snap positions to fit various children&#x27;s neck sizes.</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to use and keep on little ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is decent and my kid loved the the angry bird pattern.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a 3 because even though the material is okay for the price its really hard to shake the hair off</li>
            <li>The material is soft, not stiff or plastic.  </li>
            <li>Life\\&quot; when the picture clearly shows nothing to do with sea creatures.</li>
            <li>Hair cutting is going much more smoothly now.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is a pleasantly soft, sturdy polyester.</li>
            <li>I used to use my barber&#x27;s cape on my three year old and couldn&#x27;t get him to sit still.  </li>
            <li>We were using the old &#x27;towel trick&#x27; as a cape but that just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 2 year old son.</li>
            <li>I wish I had just bought an adult one and used it for my kids.</li>
            <li>He is 5 years old, tall, the cape is not that long in the back</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got this for my 2 year old son.</li>
            <li> I wish I had just bought an adult one and used it for my kids.</li>
            <li> He is 5 years old, tall, the cape is not that long in the back</li>
            <li> We sit him in his booster seat and the back isn&#x27;t long enough to go over the booster seat and hte back of hte chair</li>
            <li> This is my first cape so not sure if this is normal, but I think it&#x27;s very frustrating to have so much hair sticking to the cape</li>
            <li> My kid kept on moving to scratch his neck, making it hard for me to cut his hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Our son has major sensory issues and hair cuts had been a nightmare, dreading them and usually cut as much as possible</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, what the picture doesn&#x27;t show is that it&#x27;s really quite short in the back.</li>
            <li> It seems too small for my 7 year old son and almost too small for my 5 year old (not in the neck but in the length).</li>
            <li> However I wish it was a little longer in the back.  </li>
            <li> However, be careful undoing the buttons on this cape.  </li>
            <li> I have a front loading machine, so not exactly much to get tangled on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually have any characters from toy story, but it has an astronaut, a cowboy, an alien, a unicorn....</li>
            <li> Not too big but not too small.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my plain white tie back cape with this one for cutting hair on my 2 and 5 year old sons.  </li>
            <li> but it has allowed us to cut his hair with less drama.</li>
            <li> There was at little hole in it when i reciewed it ;(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a dad saving a few bucks trimming my kids hair, so I have no experience with cape sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the Amazon listing calls this \\&quot;Sea</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who is a barber because he didn&#x27;t have a kids cape, he gives the unruly kids suckers while they are getting their haircut</li>
            <li> He still cries hard, but at least the hair isn&#x27;t all over his body now!</li>
            <li> We cut our son&#x27;s hair at home and he always hated getting hair down his neck/shirt etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s supposed to work for cutting, but I got this</li>
            <li> so because I have to wipe the hair off its time consuming and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old son hated getting haircuts at home because the hair got all over him.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cape was a perfect size for my eight and four year old.  Like the snap size options.  The cape was made out of a good quality material.  Great packaging and timely shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my 5-year-old son&#x27;s haircuts. It&#x27;s cute, I&#x27;ll give it that, and my boy really liked the pattern. The fabric is a pleasantly soft, sturdy polyester. Unfortunately, what the picture doesn&#x27;t show is that it&#x27;s really quite short in the back. I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s supposed to work for cutting, but I got this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to change his clothes after his haircuts. I hoped that the smock would keep itchy hair off his shirt. But it&#x27;s too short in back to serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, I ordered this because I wanted a Velcro closure and most of the other kids&#x27; smocks had snap closures. The description says \\&quot;Velcro closure.\\&quot; But the one I got had a snap closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a short-in-the-back, long-in-the-front smock with a cute pattern and a snap closure? This is perfect for you! Meanwhile, for me, the search for a long-all-the-way-around children&#x27;s haircutting smock continues....</li>
            <li> Great for toddler hair cuts, to avoid getting hair all over them, since it&#x27;s hard to rinse all the hair off their body. By using this styling cape, the dreaded shower after is a lot better (just have to rinse head, not try to get little pieces of hair off whole body) makes for a happier baby/toddler and mom!</li>
            <li> The cape has multi buttons to adjust based on the size of the person. It well covers my son body and he does not feel hot as well. Well made!</li>
            <li> The hair sticks to the cape a lot.  This is my first cape so not sure if this is normal, but I think it&#x27;s very frustrating to have so much hair sticking to the cape</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old son hated getting haircuts at home because the hair got all over him. We ordered this cape to make it more bearable for him, and it is working great. I&#x27;m not sure why the Amazon listing calls this \\&quot;Sea Life\\&quot; when the picture clearly shows nothing to do with sea creatures. The package we got called the theme \\&quot;Toy Land\\&quot; and it looks like a knock-off toy story. It doesn&#x27;t actually have any characters from toy story, but it has an astronaut, a cowboy, an alien, a unicorn....you get the idea. It is a very cute print, and the nice smooth material allows hair to brush off easily. It&#x27;s definitely kid sized, but large enough for my son to sit criss-cross-applesauce and easily cover his knees and feet too. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for small kids.  The material is soft, not stiff or plastic.  It makes it easy to use and keep on little ones.</li>
            <li> Grandkids love the cute pattern, and I like the way it fits their necks tightly enough so that they don&#x27;t get covered with hair.</li>
            <li> We love this smock for kids.  It has many snaps to easily get the right fit around your child&#x27;s neck.  It&#x27;s made of a nice nylon material, versus a plastic and is well sewn along the edge.  It&#x27;s washable and fun to look at and the price cannot be beat!  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to trim their child&#x27;s hair without hair falling onto the clothes/body.</li>
            <li> I used to use my barber&#x27;s cape on my three year old and couldn&#x27;t get him to sit still.  Now with this one he seems to like it and let&#x27;s me cut his hair with no problem..  Seems durable.  Have used it three times with no problems</li>
            <li> Grandson likes it, when he gets his hair cut.  He feels like a superhero. Works well to keep the hair off him too.</li>
            <li> We cut our son&#x27;s hair at home and he always hated getting hair down his neck/shirt etc.  We were using the old &#x27;towel trick&#x27; as a cape but that just didn&#x27;t work.  We got this and bingo!  it works great along with the neck strips you can buy on amazon as well.  Now he doesn&#x27;t argue much at all when the clipper comes out!  :)</li>
            <li> decided to cut grandsons hair myself and he likes to wear this, keep pointing out different ones</li>
            <li> Great to use for my 4 year old. Many snaps to adjust to as he grows.</li>
            <li> Not too big but not too small.  However, be careful undoing the buttons on this cape.  Mine tore right off the fabric when I was trying to pull the buttons apart.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for at home cuts. Great price too. Seems to be the same as the ones they use at the salon.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law owns a salon and really liked this cape for children. She liked the style and the material. Very professional.</li>
            <li> nice kids sized cape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber stylist,with that being said this cape  does not allow hair to fall on my Clients ! So I would recommend for Anyone in the Hair business  !</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size for a toddler or any child under a teenage size. I gave this product a 3 because even though the material is okay for the price its really hard to shake the hair off and I even tried brushing the hair off the cape and it didn&#x27;t seem to work to well either. so because I have to wipe the hair off its time consuming and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This cape is great! I&#x27;m a hair dresser and I got this to cut my kids hair at home. They are 2 and this fits them perfectly!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 2 year old son. Well it just works ok.  I would recommend this for an older kid. Maybe 4 and up.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for a child ten years of age or under. Fits nicely around the neck. Cute design too.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I love this cape it is adorable. I got this for my boyfriend who is a barber because he didn&#x27;t have a kids cape, he gives the unruly kids suckers while they are getting their haircut and they always leave his good capes a sticky mess. Also fun for kids to have a cape that fits them :)</li>
            <li> good product. Thank you</li>
            <li> It seems too small for my 7 year old son and almost too small for my 5 year old (not in the neck but in the length). I wish I had just bought an adult one and used it for my kids. It works, but it was smaller than I thought. I&#x27;m just a dad saving a few bucks trimming my kids hair, so I have no experience with cape sizes. On the other hand, it does make for a good super hero cape when not using it to catch hair.</li>
            <li> Is nice and at first, wished I ordered the velcro but since getting used to the snaps is not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This does not wrap all the way around in the back.</li>
            <li> This is great quality and nice material.  Holds up well in the wash and the snaps are sturdy and much better then Velcro ones I have bought.</li>
            <li> My boy always cry during a haircut no matter it is done at a salon or at home. After I bought this cape, he allows me to cut his hair without any fuss. He loves cute prints of this cape. And most importantly, it effectively keeps most hair away from his body.</li>
            <li> In spite of having my hair cut at a salon for many many years, I can&#x27;t really remember (even just last week) if most hair capes cover all the way around including the back. Either way, this one doesn&#x27;t, but it works well even so, especially since kid is sitting on a chair so it doesn&#x27;t really fall over his body. Before we had this (I know, why did we deal with haircuts before this?) our son&#x27;s hair (he was like 8 months old) would fall all over his body and mine since I was holding him and it made him cry even harder. He still cries hard, but at least the hair isn&#x27;t all over his body now! The hair slides right off and washes off easily too.</li>
            <li> Used this for my son for about six months now.  great for toddlers.  Hair comes right off</li>
            <li> The Snap closure doesn&#x27;t fully seal the neck, so some hair got in and caused itch.  My kid kept on moving to scratch his neck, making it hard for me to cut his hair straight.  If I can buy again, I would choose something with Velcro closure to better seal the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is decent and my kid loved the the angry bird pattern.  I&#x27;ll keep it for now and will try to insert some napkins into the slack in the neck seal next time.</li>
            <li> Our son has major sensory issues and hair cuts had been a nightmare, dreading them and usually cut as much as possible so they are not too often. Since using this product we can sigh and celebrate how great he does when he needs a hair cut. He is 5 years old, tall, the cape is not that long in the back but it has allowed us to cut his hair with less drama. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to.  Fits my 2-year-old and the hair slides off it.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Numerous snap positions to fit various children&#x27;s neck sizes. Washes up well. Nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Kids love it! No longer fight when I get the clippers out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a lemon, but this ripped at the neck during the second wash. I have a front loading machine, so not exactly much to get tangled on. Too bad. It was cute and finally made my 3 year old sit still for his hair cut.</li>
            <li> I replaced my plain white tie back cape with this one for cutting hair on my 2 and 5 year old sons.  Hair cutting is going much more smoothly now.  They love to wear it!</li>
            <li> my son loves to cut hair now!</li>
            <li> There was at little hole in it when i reciewed it ;(</li>
            <li> This was great for my 2 year old who I like to just take a pair of hair trimmers and buzz his hair.  However I wish it was a little longer in the back.  We sit him in his booster seat and the back isn&#x27;t long enough to go over the booster seat and hte back of hte chair so we get hair between them and it&#x27;s more work to clean.  Over all nice design...good for keeping the kids distracted when you tell them to look down at the birds.</li>
