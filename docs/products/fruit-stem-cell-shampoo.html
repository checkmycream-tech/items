            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I want a nice smelling shampoo that smells like some type of soap, not this.  </li>
            <li>but it is very fine.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again, makes for a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many organic shampoos.</li>
            <li>Its ok-</li>
            <li>also didn&#x27;t find hair lose more ,I wont buy again ,need to look for something else</li>
            <li>love the formula in that brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more body in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>

            <li>Love this shampoo, makes my hair shiny and fuller.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair looks and feels with this shampoo...</li>
            <li>I had been trying to find a shampoo and conditioner that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals and this was one of the many I tried.</li>
            <li>I use Paul Mitchell now and it works much better.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to help keep my scalp healthy and provides much more volume to my hair after shampooing than Neutrogena&#x27;s T Gel,  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a great scent, it lathers really well, and it conditions your hair.</li>
            <li>the it truly leaves your hair clean and shiny!</li>
            <li>but if you have fine hair, maybe you won&#x27;t be satisfied to pay that price for shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo helps give it volume</li>
            <li>But I would wait until it goes on sale, because I am cheap.</li>
            <li>so I could use even the cheapest shampoo available at the drugstore</li>
            <li>good, natural product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to switch to a more natural, organic shampoo and I chose this one because it has pretty good reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this at a marshalls fro $4.99 I was so excited to try</li>
            <li>I really love the smell, and the sudsy-ness and the way it leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>and it would clean my scalp sufficiently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other biotin shamps and to be quite honest it leaves my hair smelling amazing</li>
            <li>Andalou Naturals Full Volume Shampoo has somehow defied the odds and been the one shampoo that just cannot clean my hair and head.</li>
            <li>and it really does give my hair volume and texture that lasts for more than one day.</li>
            <li>I have mild psoriasis which sometimes affects my scalp.  </li>
            <li>that mumbo jumbo basically comes down to a very good smelling, gentle on your hair shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this isn&#x27;t really doing anything for me.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and this product really gives it volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those that have a minty type of smell mixed in with what smells like some kind of herbs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it and my hair is still voluminous, soft, thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels right now.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and you need very little of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it because I experience hair loss and Ireally see that it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is great ,low lather do to the better low sulfate ingredients, left my hair soft and dandruff free.</li>
            <li>First of all, there needs to be an igredients list on this product page.</li>
            <li>First things affected, hair and nails.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to get less oily, is more manageable and I can actually style it more since it doesn&#x27;t just slip around from being so fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is full of body, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>But since I read on the GMO website that Andalou was offering good products of quality, really natural and soft, I will purchase again since I need a non-sulfate shampoo with biotin to help recover from that medical mistake.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave buildup and leaves my hair super soft and shiny though</li>
            <li>Therefore, I can&#x27;t really hope for volume.</li>
            <li>so much I added the conditioner to my hair routine.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine grey hair and this shampoo works for me.  </li>
            <li>I have a fine and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I found that if I used a tiny bit at first, rinsed it out and applied another slightly larger dollop, then it would lather up just fine.</li>
            <li>I am very very very sensitive to smells and do not like perfume-y or chemical based scents, but the lavender in this is really relaxing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa.</li>
            <li>It probably helps that lavender is one of the few scents I can tolerate, and my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This truly left my hair fuller and with more body than any other shampoo has ever done.  </li>
            <li>its ok ,not for oily hair ,at the second day hair started to have the odd oil smell ,I didn&#x27;t find hari get fuller .but</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as soft or shiny as it was.  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold on Andalou products.</li>
            <li>THAT IT IS NATURAL</li>
            <li>If you already have thick hair, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to waste a lot for lather and my hair/scalp feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is magic.</li>

            <li> Seriously, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> The non lathering shampoos left a film in my hair, making it flat and oily.  </li>
            <li> It really shows that it&#x27;s almost \\&quot;bad chemicals\\&quot; free.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly but I blow dry it straight alot.</li>
            <li> Not only do I notice no difference, after using it for several months, but it does not clean well.</li>
            <li> It even feels dry.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> it will dry out your hair ...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my head does not get oily</li>
            <li> It left my hair limp, stringy and gross looking.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; aroma they are going for, but I sent mine back.  </li>
            <li> However, I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> Other than that, I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> So my hair feels stronger, thicker, bouncier and CLEANER longer between washes, AND this experience has not faded over months of use like with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced such a noticeable and LASTING difference in the quality of my hair since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> BUT other stuff out there that contains the same ingredients make my hair uber thick and voluminous.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I found that my hair was a lot bouncier, stronger (due to the B vitamins?)and</li>
            <li> Lot less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker in a way after using this shampoo, and while thicker feeling hair from other shampoos usually means my hair is weighed down, this is not the case with the Andalou Lavender and Biotin.</li>
            <li> but my hair feels maybe a little thicker than when I started using this.  </li>
            <li> maybe its just me but also a little depth/oomph in color after use too...</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is just to limp</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, dirty blonde hair</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to the shampoo not lathering like a conventional product, but I realized I have hard water</li>
            <li> no better than any....</li>
            <li> I tried the Jason Biotin products for awhile and my hair felt thicker but also greasy, grimy and dull.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not thrilled by the results.</li>
            <li> Thought it was organic, not so, read ingred, investigate yourself, any sulfate is not good for our bodies, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sorry organic lovers</li>
            <li> I have been prescribed the wrong dosage of Synthroid for 3 months, a mistake of the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>

            <li> First of all, there needs to be an igredients list on this product page. Here is what is printed on the back of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Juice,&lt;br /&gt; Aqua (water),&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Glucosides Hydroxypropyl Sulfonate,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Cocoyl Methyl Taurate,&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable Glycerin,&lt;br /&gt; Guar Gum,&lt;br /&gt; Lavender Extract,&lt;br /&gt; Hydrolyzed Barley Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B Complex,&lt;br /&gt;Soy Protein,&lt;br /&gt;Noni Juice,&lt;br /&gt; Jojoba Oil,&lt;br /&gt; Camelina Sativa Oil,&lt;br /&gt; Vit E,&lt;br /&gt; Apple,Grape, Billberry Fruit Stem Cell Cultures and BioActive 8 Berry COmplex,&lt;br /&gt; White Tea,&lt;br /&gt; Hibiscus Rosa Sinesis Extract,&lt;br /&gt; Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lavender Oil&lt;br /&gt; ( a lot of these ingredients are organic and fair trade, which is nice to have)&lt;br /&gt;All that mumbo jumbo basically comes down to a very good smelling, gentle on your hair shampoo. It took me a little while to get used to the shampoo not lathering like a conventional product, but I realized I have hard water and that was why. I found that if I used a tiny bit at first, rinsed it out and applied another slightly larger dollop, then it would lather up just fine. After a few uses, I found that my hair was a lot bouncier, stronger (due to the B vitamins?)and the lavender scent is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly buy this again. But I would wait until it goes on sale, because I am cheap.</li>
            <li> no better than any....my scalp gets itchy, only since using this product</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and losing my hair. I bought this to try to combat the loss. My hair is softer and feels wonderful and healthy, however I still have hair loss. This is the only reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a month now.  I&#x27;ve decided to switch to a more natural, organic shampoo and I chose this one because it has pretty good reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.  I have fine hair and this isn&#x27;t really doing anything for me.  My hair isn&#x27;t as soft or shiny as it was.  It even feels dry.  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels right now.  I am already making a switch to a different product.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again, makes for a healthy head of hair. With the conditioner and this shampoo your hair looks fuller and it will take on a beautiful shine. Also try their style spray, and hold spray. All of them together did the job for me. I use hair color, and these products work well if you color your hair. Rita</li>
            <li> Thought it was organic, not so, read ingred, investigate yourself, any sulfate is not good for our bodies, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and you need very little of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it necessarily does a ton for volume but my hair feels maybe a little thicker than when I started using this.  It doesn&#x27;t leave buildup and leaves my hair super soft and shiny though so I like it anyway!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, and the sudsy-ness and the way it leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many organic shampoos. This products isn&#x27;t 100% organic, but it has a great rating on the EWG website.  And it lathers!  Sorry organic lovers, I need a shampoo that lathers. The non lathering shampoos left a film in my hair, making it flat and oily.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t do that! My hair is full of body, soft, and manageable. Great product!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly but I blow dry it straight alot. When I am stressed I notice I get dandruff and my hair is dry. I have tried their skincare cleanser and loved it.When I saw this at a marshalls fro $4.99 I was so excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great ,low lather do to the better low sulfate ingredients, left my hair soft and dandruff free.No frizz,either.</li>
            <li> Its ok- I&#x27;ve used other biotin shamps and to be quite honest it leaves my hair smelling amazing but it does not give it enough volume. Maybe my hair is just to limp and I have to come to terms with it BUT other stuff out there that contains the same ingredients make my hair uber thick and voluminous. So i&#x27;d say yes to the glorious scent and the wonderful tingle on the scalp and the it truly leaves your hair clean and shiny! BUT unfortunately I need more volume on my limpy straw like hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; aroma they are going for, but I sent mine back.  It&#x27;s one of those that have a minty type of smell mixed in with what smells like some kind of herbs.  I want a nice smelling shampoo that smells like some type of soap, not this.  Maybe it&#x27;s not just a women&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li> good, natural product</li>
            <li> Wonderful light lavender scent. Gives your hair body and shine and works great on all types of hair. I have baby fine grey hair and this shampoo works for me.  My sister tried it while visiting and she loved it also, her hair is thicker and colored and looked great.  My husband started using it also along with the conditioner and has been very happy as well.</li>
            <li> its ok ,not for oily hair ,at the second day hair started to have the odd oil smell ,I didn&#x27;t find hari get fuller .but also didn&#x27;t find hair lose more ,I wont buy again ,need to look for something else</li>
            <li> I just learned yesterday that my thyroid was way too low. I have been prescribed the wrong dosage of Synthroid for 3 months, a mistake of the doctor&#x27;s office. First things affected, hair and nails. Therefore, I can&#x27;t really hope for volume. But since I read on the GMO website that Andalou was offering good products of quality, really natural and soft, I will purchase again since I need a non-sulfate shampoo with biotin to help recover from that medical mistake. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the formula in that brand of shampoo. It really shows that it&#x27;s almost \\&quot;bad chemicals\\&quot; free. The foam is different from the commercial brands. However, I wash my hair every other day and I can&#x27;t tell that I feel that my hair is manageable with that shampoo. I have a fine and dry hair. I wake up in the morning and it seems that the volume I had the day before is gone. I&#x27;m going to use it because I experience hair loss and Ireally see that it&#x27;s very gentle but I&#x27;m not thrilled by the results. If you already have thick hair, it&#x27;s okay but if you have fine hair, maybe you won&#x27;t be satisfied to pay that price for shampoo. I was expecting more body in my hair. It didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> very good item, delivered on time. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Love that it contains nothing toxic and works well. Doesn&#x27;t lather much but smells great and does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, makes my hair shiny and fuller. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with biotin.  Lathers well and smells great.  Will continue to buy this shampoo, it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair by the handfuls .. I do believe this shampoo and conditioner works for me.  Lot less hair loss.  HOWEVER, I do not use this every day ... it will dry out your hair ... but, I rotate it with my regular shampoo.  I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks and feels with this shampoo...I don&#x27;t need to waste a lot for lather and my hair/scalp feel clean after use. Hair has shine and maybe its just me but also a little depth/oomph in color after use too...Im happy with the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> It may work for some people but for me it did not. I had been trying to find a shampoo and conditioner that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals and this was one of the many I tried. It left my hair limp, stringy and gross looking. I use Paul Mitchell now and it works much better. It may not be the shampoo itself, it may just have been how it reacted to my hair because I have read a lot of great reviews about this product. Try it for yourself and see I guess.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that actually does what it says.  This truly left my hair fuller and with more body than any other shampoo has ever done.  I like it so much I added the conditioner to my hair routine.  This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3 months.  I have mild psoriasis which sometimes affects my scalp.  This shampoo seems to help keep my scalp healthy and provides much more volume to my hair after shampooing than Neutrogena&#x27;s T Gel,  It smells nicer, too!</li>
            <li> Two stars for this shampoo because, quite frankly, it smells wonderful! Other than that, I was unimpressed. I bought this shampoo to hopefully help with the thinning of my hair. Not only do I notice no difference, after using it for several months, but it does not clean well. I have dry skin and my head does not get oily so I could use even the cheapest shampoo available at the drugstore and it would clean my scalp sufficiently. Andalou Naturals Full Volume Shampoo has somehow defied the odds and been the one shampoo that just cannot clean my hair and head.</li>
            <li> Everything I have tried in this product line if excellent.  I have baby fine hair, and this product really gives it volume and shine.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used in years, maybe ever. I have never experienced such a noticeable and LASTING difference in the quality of my hair since I started using this shampoo. I have thin, straight, dirty blonde hair and it really does give my hair volume and texture that lasts for more than one day. My hair feels thicker in a way after using this shampoo, and while thicker feeling hair from other shampoos usually means my hair is weighed down, this is not the case with the Andalou Lavender and Biotin. My hair seems to get less oily, is more manageable and I can actually style it more since it doesn&#x27;t just slip around from being so fine.  So my hair feels stronger, thicker, bouncier and CLEANER longer between washes, AND this experience has not faded over months of use like with other shampoos.  I am completely sold on Andalou products. I tried the Jason Biotin products for awhile and my hair felt thicker but also greasy, grimy and dull.  Also, regarding the scent. I am very very very sensitive to smells and do not like perfume-y or chemical based scents, but the lavender in this is really relaxing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa. It probably helps that lavender is one of the few scents I can tolerate, and my favorite scent.  UPDATE 1/27/16: I&#x27;m still using it and my hair is still voluminous, soft, thicker and more manageable. Seriously, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a great scent, it lathers really well, and it conditions your hair. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo helps give it volume</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  A friend recommended it as I have a lot of hair but it is very fine. This made is fuller, thicker and shinier and I will buy it forever!</li>
            <li> IT DOES  SEEM  TO GIVE SOME  VOLUME.  I DO NOT  LIKE  THE SCENT  AT ALL  IT WAS A FAIR VALUE  I LIKE THAT IT IS NATURAL</li>
