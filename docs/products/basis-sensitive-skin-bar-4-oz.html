            <li>I have always used this in the shower to clean my face.</li>
            <li>This soap is perfect for an overall natural clean.</li>
            <li>Great for winter time, when skin starts to get dry out from furnace and dryer winter air.</li>
            <li>If what you need is a clean feeling</li>

            <li>My husband is very sensitive to any kind of chemicals in body soap, shampoo, dryer sheets, etc</li>
            <li>but I do love the fact that this product is fragrance and additive free, and not very expensive.</li>
            <li>Other than that the soap seems very mild, and sudses very nicely.</li>
            <li>Love this pure product with no dyes or additives.</li>
            <li>My Face Pure Olive Oil bars are better.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean without drying, it also does a good job of cleaing even &amp;#34;car grease&amp;#34; after I work on my car.</li>

            <li>It is a true blessing.</li>
            <li>Nice for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i buy them 6 or more at a time and the price is much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>Decided if the doctor recommended it for teenage son it would be good for his mother.  </li>
            <li>It is safe for your face as well as your whole body.</li>
            <li>This is a good personal soap, no fragance.  </li>
            <li>I cant say enough good for it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to this soap and that&#x27;s what I love about it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted to have it back in my shower.</li>
            <li>Cleans well for sensitive skin and rinses away nicely.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for them</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cleansing bar for decades and feel confident that it has contributed to my unusually youthful skin.</li>
            <li>It is, also, just the right size to be comfortably held in your hand.</li>
            <li>I got the best price here as my local store only sells one bar at a time.  </li>
            <li>The lather is nice enough that you could probably use it for light shaving too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I stumbled onto this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a doctor, but believe this could help with some mild skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, or itchy skin).</li>
            <li>May try to use a mild vinegar rinse to cut the film, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It is mild, cleans you, refreshes you, and suds up well.  </li>
            <li>She is able to use this soap with no negative effects.  </li>
            <li>Best soap ever made, mild, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I found these under the super saver store for Amazon and have a regular order shipped to my home (I love that!).</li>
            <li>Very mild and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry, it doesn&#x27;t smell, it feels good,</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out... pretty much just because it can, and most soaps just aggravate it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice large bar so it lasts a long time through many showers.</li>
            <li>If you combine it with your favorite&lt;br /&gt;daily facial scrub, you&#x27;ll get even better results!</li>
            <li>This  soap feels good going on washes off easy even with bed baths being disabled.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying Basis because it will get your skin clean without over-stripping or causing irritation!</li>
            <li>Gently cleans and keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li>A great soap that is sensitive enough for both my daughter and my husband who have eczema.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this soap...perfect size, smell and doesn&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Simple honest soap.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Basis has proven every bit as effective and I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li>I love this sensitive skin bar.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this Facial Soap!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Basis Sensitive Skin Bar for over&lt;br /&gt;20 years, its a mainstay in my daily routine ... &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has been my go-to soap for many years now with no adverse skin reactions.</li>
            <li>but I feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it, and this is coming from a guy that used Ivory all his life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind of soap I can use that will not give me a skin rash.  </li>
            <li>For sensitive skin, this seems to be better than all.</li>
            <li>This soap has no artificial scents or byproducts.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used this item for 30 years or more and have found nothing else that works as good due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like this soap better than any of the many other bars out there, including cetaphyl, dove, etc.</li>
            <li>I felt clean and smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>, moisturizing lather with just the right amount</li>
            <li>It is one of very few soaps that really is great for many people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it as a general body bar and it cleans effectively, yet gently.</li>
            <li>Basis soothes my skin while really getting it clean.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers really well and leaves my skin with that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make me like it better would be if there could be a version just as good that a. was made out of natural ingredients completely and b. was made by a company here in the US.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous and I highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and most important it soothes itchiness.  </li>
            <li>soap lathers rather well with loofah, and doesn&#x27;t need much to get my full body.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers very well, does not have a strong smell, and rinses completely off leaving you squeaky clean with nothing to break you out.</li>
            <li>long Cetaphil nice</li>
            <li>This is great soap for a person that wants to feel clean and fresh but can&#x27;t handle the price of the other sensitive skin soaps.  </li>
            <li>It cleans ok, but we prefer something a little more scented.</li>
            <li>Certainly!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and cleans effectively.</li>
            <li>Many years ago Basis Skin Bar was recommended to me by my Dermatologist,I have used it ever since,Basis Bar and soft water is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite soaps, now getting difficult to find, but great for allergies.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this soap is non-irritating and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic soap for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had a  rash , large blotches that hurt , itch , and burned and after the first time using this soap the healing started !</li>
            <li>I usually shy away from anything scented as I’m almost guaranteed to have issues with it if it smells nice, and am left using oatmeal based soaps and goat’s milk soap – neither of which smell very pleasant –</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Basis is the only brand of bar soap I will use because it cleans gently, washes off easily, and leaves a clean, fresh smell on my body.</li>
            <li>It is a supperfatted soap, and is very gentle and hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle...</li>
            <li>I have eczema and need a very gentle, unperfumed soap.</li>
            <li>Still worth a try if you can&#x27;t afford real soap</li>
            <li>Fragrance free for those sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it when the Eucerin sensitive skin soap bar was no longer available.</li>
            <li>love how simple it is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only Basis soap for both bathing and hand washing for more than 35 years ever since my skin broke out from stress and a dermatologist recommended this soap.  </li>
            <li>It works well in many different types of water.</li>
            <li>I went back to buy more</li>
            <li>This basis sensitive skin soap is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about 2 weeks and had had no adverse reactions on my combination skin, and actually the dryness on my forehead is much better, but</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My husband tried it and really likes it too!</li>
            <li>I really like it; no slimy or tacky feeling after rinsing, and no reactions from my skin!</li>
            <li>I have just stumbled upon this soap in my local Wal Mart and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>but it always makes my face feel funny</li>
            <li>No surprise, gotta love corporate America.</li>
            <li>the lack of a chemical-like scent that is present in many face washes/bars is</li>
            <li>Most soaps cause her skin to break out with a red rash.</li>
            <li>Basis really helps!</li>
            <li>I used it many years ago and lost touch with its availability in the local stores.</li>
            <li>No matter how many others I try, I always end up back to this one.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and film free.</li>
            <li>so this stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>My first review ever on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Noticed the difference within the first 2 uses</li>
            <li>This product is OK but actually seems to make us break out a bit.</li>
            <li>I learned last year that I am allergic to many preservatives found in soaps and lotions and this soap was on my &amp;#34;approved to use&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>we tried so many different soups, but they do not work.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the alleged sensitive skin friendly soaps on the market and this is the first that&#x27;s been true to its word.</li>
            <li>Basis leaves my skin soft and fresh - I really feel clean when I use it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, cleans well and has a very slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very clean without over-drying it.</li>
            <li>It is unscented and feels good on my somewhat sensitive and very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>One other nice thing is that it does not leave a lot of residue in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>gentle non-drying, non-irritating washes off easily, leaves a clean but not perfume smell, lives up to it&#x27;s recommendation;, formula is always dependable, bar lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>These are hands down the best conventional bars I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Soft  clean</li>
            <li>The lather was smooth, no harsh smells, and went on really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough on his skin while keeping him clean.....</li>
            <li>I am using this for obvious reasons, sensitive skin and while it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; fragrance, it does smell like just soap which is nice, if that makes sense</li>
            <li>It simply gets me clean!</li>
            <li>simple clean for your face!</li>
            <li>Great for getting sun block off after a long bike ride without a lot of effort, and won&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>As he aged, my husband noticed that his favorite Dial soap was starting to dry his skin; he also switched to Basis and is happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Still cleans very well but gentle on skin!</li>
            <li>She has trouble finding it locally, so I was glad to surprise her with a smiley box of her own.</li>
            <li>Basis is as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I have tried using moisturizing washes in the past but none of them work as good on me as Basis.</li>
            <li>But it treats the most sensitive parts of your body without drying or irritating -- and is fairly long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Very economical compared to other fragrance free soaps</li>
            <li>Usually the fragrance free bars either have some strong smell (to me) or they aren&#x27;t worth a flip.  </li>
            <li>I tried other soaps after just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my mind playing tricks on me, but, sure enough, I noticed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin, won&#x27;t dry it out, but has great cleaning power--gets everything off your face without leaving anything else on like other face washes do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never experienced such an incredible clean face washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just makes my skin even more dry, but this soap does not</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t always easy to find locally.</li>
            <li>My son dry skin look better already.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin plus asthma that reacts to fragrances.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, you can buy large quantities and get it shipped to your door cheaper than the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I never really saw much lather which, to me, is necessary to feel clean and Basis gets nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is super expensive (although a great product).  </li>
            <li>Like most people commenting, I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap is all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell funny!</li>
            <li>Face soap and creamy don&#x27;t seem to fit in the same description---until I tried Basis Soap.  </li>
            <li>Creamy, gentle,</li>
            <li>a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Have skin issues and the use of this product has really helped</li>

            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>His answers: He washed alot so he needed a gentle soap to prevent drying out.</li>
            <li>His face was very oily</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>It cleans well while being gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>No Fragrance and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH BASIS.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand perfumed soap and besides, it really does number on my skin.</li>
            <li>Cost is reasonable too</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle with no perfume issues.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause too much dryness.</li>
            <li>The lathered bar gently washes and cleanses the skin and removes the toughest of makeups.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the replacement.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>This stuff is what I have been looking for my whole life.</li>
            <li>I have I especially sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My whole family has begun using it now.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize as much with this soap, even though it does not contain any moisturizing elements.</li>
            <li>but I am looking forward to the summer to really put it to the test.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY PLEASE with this soap I didn&#x27;t go to buy this&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>well I might as well give it an try because I really do&lt;br /&gt;need soap.</li>
            <li>However, it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>it really stings.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to get it this way.</li>
            <li>And trust me, I really have tried a LOT of stuff.</li>
            <li>Rarely available at local stores</li>
            <li>And the soap does not seem to wash off very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I buy it for my mother who doesn&#x27;t like to spend so much on soap but LOVES it when I give her these.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper to purchase this on amazon..</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and and we&#x27;ve tried many different skin washes and soaps over the years.</li>
            <li>This soap gets the highest rating for being pretty natural yet not outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this soap to deal with a couple of skin issues I have recently come across and have found this particular soap to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>My kp is less noticeable and my skin is super soft, I will continue to use this soap, I love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading other reviews and am extremely pleased with the Basis cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li>I have used Basis soap for many years and prefer it over other soaps.  </li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t say before is that it lathers much better than a lot of other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; soap bars.</li>
            <li>My Dermatologist recommended Basis to me and it still works better on me than any other bar soap I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Over the years we have tried other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps, but none are as safe as Basis.  </li>
            <li>This is a great sensitive skin bar; it is mild, unscented, not harsh or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>Only caution is that you can&#x27;t leave the bar in a water filled soap dish because it will melt because of its high soluability.  </li>
            <li>so this simple clean face soap works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>so you get a cleaner feel after rinsing - leaving you refreshed and getting that overall clean feeling</li>
            <li>I have dry skin in the winter and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t make me itchy and didn&#x27;t have a strong perfume like scent.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong to dry the skin and might require a couple of lathers.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it has become more difficult to find this product of late, and so I&#x27;m especially happy to be able to purchase it in bulk here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be buying it regularly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s mild enough that you can even use it on sunburned skin without it stinging.  </li>
            <li>My top and only choice for facial soap.</li>
            <li>I decided that as I am getting older, (age 42)</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like much.  </li>
            <li>I admit that as I&#x27;m older, I do use a moisturizing cleanser for my face now, but this is still my soap of choice.</li>
            <li>One of the only soaps I found that I&#x27;m not irritated by.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with the product and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li>I believe the perfume in the soap is the main problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone back to using anything else to keep my face clear and clean.</li>
            <li>After much searching and experimenting, this soap is the clear winner for unscented.</li>
            <li>If you have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am very fragrance sensitive and this bar HAS A FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>I occassionally bathe with the bar during the winter when my skin is dry and itchy, and the feeling of clean</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel almost rough instead of silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Great soap, unable to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Dove for many many years, but unfortunately, my skin in extremely sensitive and had to switch to Basis.  </li>
            <li>I have been using cetaphil for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>If you do this, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth from Basis.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff and doesn&#x27;t leave a soap scum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin and have NEVER been able to use soap on a regular basis without it irritating/drying the heck out of my skin until I came across this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and this soap keeps me clean without dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic soap and I have extreme sensitivities and this stuff did not bother me at all  </li>
            <li>With several small children with sensitive skin this soap is a good value and works well.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin it does clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and body.</li>
            <li>Using this soap has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and will be using this from now on.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and have problems with fragrances I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap very much and can only find it at Amazon!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with acne.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use it on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommended soap for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for ca.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my childrens&#x27; very sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and use this soap both in the shower and just for washing my hands as well.</li>
            <li>I have an autoimmune skin disorder that leaves my skin very sensitive, and problematic.</li>
            <li>it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(Or stinging more than plain old water on a sunburn will...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the rock star of natural bar soaps!</li>
            <li>He said it leaves him feeling clean, like all the soap is gone, unlike with other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy when lathered and is practically fragrance free - which are a big plus to avoid possible further skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately is&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the more popular soaps</li>
            <li>Gentle soap that does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li>While this bar is indeed very mild and I have no skin reaction or itching, I find I am getting some acne after having showered with it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used this soap for years and with my sensitive skin I find that is the only soap that I can us consistently and not have a skin reaction.</li>
            <li>This soap has no fragrance, albeit an extremely faint (pleasant) smell</li>
            <li>This soap works for your whole body, will not irritate sensitive skin, and will not dry you out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to find it in a six pack...because the single bar price at the store can get a bit pricey...and now that the world has gone shower gel crazy...</li>
            <li>Love this soap and have for years, but it is so hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li>With hard water, it seems to work better just to use shampoo for everything or a glycerin soap.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore or even find a better priced substitute that works as well.</li>
            <li>But it is usually hard to find in most drug stores and soap outlets.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding it in stores anymore, so I am glad Amazon sells it</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good , doesn&#x27;t dry you out too bad, but it&#x27;s too strong to use on my face, dries t out and turns it red .</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP ROCKS, IT&#x27;S SO CREAMY, IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GREAT IN THE REALLY COLD WINTER.EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT.</li>
            <li>I bought the clear brown one first(forgot</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I can really use because I&#x27;m so sensitive.</li>
            <li>and it helps keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>so for someone with sensitive sinuses or allergies</li>
            <li>I have delicate skin that breaks out in an itchy rash when I use most scented or colored soaps .  </li>
            <li>and my doctor recommended it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or dermatitis like me.</li>

            <li>Leave no residue, work well for sensitive skin or problem skin.</li>
            <li>This is all I use on my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>We are a family of five, and each one of us with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I switched to dove sensitive unscented, and that truly smells like nothing but soap.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have sensitive skin (have had it</li>
            <li>so I found Basis Sensitive Skin Bar.</li>

            <li>I recommend this soap to sensitive skin people like me.</li>
            <li>I like this over Dove sensitive skin soap.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Basis for my sensitive skin and tendency toward rosacea redness.  </li>
            <li>It also pleases my sensitive nose as there is no perfume or chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li>It also is very gentle for dry, sensitive, Rosacea or problematic types of skin.</li>
            <li>Also these bars seem to last way longer than the normal brands!</li>
            <li>It fits easily in my hand, which is small.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised to find that the soap lasts a while, perhaps this is due to the lack of filler material they put into the soap - but either way, you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This is the only reasonably priced skin bar we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my husband&#x27;s major allergies.</li>
            <li>Also parts of my body even extra sensitive this soap only heals no stinging or pain no uncomfortable feelings.</li>
            <li>would only purchase the new !</li>
            <li>After trying many products such as Neutrogena, Simple, and Bioderma to name a few, I can say that I&#x27;ve finally found the right facial soap!</li>
            <li>&quot; and this soap is one of the few things I can use to get my skin clean without drying everything out.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that is dissolves quickly in the soap dish, so I purchased a cheap plastic soap dish that keeps it off the flat surface, and that helps.  </li>
            <li>Plus other brands of bar soap I&#x27;ve tried were very drying and many of them left my skin feeling way too tight.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling super clean with no residue left behind.</li>
            <li>It does melt a little too quickly</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, especially in the winter when it tends to get dry (and I run the shower too hot).</li>
            <li>It last a long time and is very gentle for a bar soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is used by my 89 year old aunt who have extremely sensitive and fragile skin.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well, heals and does not dry out sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i then by mistake ordered the white or sensitive skin one and the clear one as well.</li>
            <li>THAT IT IS THE ONE AND ONLY FOR ANYONE WHO IS ODER SENSITIVE AND HAS SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>soap is unbelievable in keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li>She has had trouble with dry skin on her face, and she chaps easily.</li>
            <li>Too bad, they were great bars to use as face soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and only trust Basis.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any added scent, which apparently does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I was getting low and found this in the isle near the cetaphil and thought well for $1.86</li>
            <li>Basis is not only gentle enough that it didn’t cause any redness and irritation, but it actually has helped combat my skin issues.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin, this is the only soap you should use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser/soap that has ever made my skin so soft and so clear.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY sensitive skin bar I&#x27;ve found that we don&#x27;t react to.  </li>
            <li>Basis for sensitive skin is the only soap I use for my body when bathing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but much more expensive than regular soap.  </li>
            <li>I am unable to use soap that leaves any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>This soap will not cause an allergic reaction and will calm your skin down from one if your skin is currently reacting to something you are allergic to.</li>
            <li>Basis works much better and is much, much less messy.</li>
            <li>The bar is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I orderered my special Basis bath soap from Amazon, as it is becoming very difficult to purchase locally.</li>
            <li>Always used Dove in the past but never felt clean enough.  </li>
            <li>I want something very gentle to cleanse my face, and I found it in this little bar of basis.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing that leaves the same &amp;#34;clean but solf&amp;#34; feeling on my oily face as this Basic sensitive skin bar.  </li>
            <li>This is the only soap my husband will use, as it is non-drying, especially in Winter months, and does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soap does not have a perfume smell and does not dry out my skin or hair like shampoo does.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have near as many &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; with it, but it does leave a weird residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>No dry, itchy, eczema-flaring skin with this soap.</li>
            <li>No dry spots, no rashes.  </li>
            <li>Cost of the bar is very modest because the bar lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>So many unscented products actually have their own scent, and I hate that!</li>
            <li>Body washes and other things make me break out; Basis is the only soap I can use really, either on my face or body.</li>
            <li>Unscented, lasts a long time, sensitive, affordable.</li>
            <li>Usually that clean feeling would mean that my skin would be super dry, but nope,my skin is left soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The bar is highly soluable and I usually only need to touch it with a wet hand to wash my face or hands.  </li>
            <li>Since my skin is quite dry and sensitive, I use Basis Soap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this bar to anyone who has sensitive, irritated, or dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, this is the soap for you.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft and not chaffed or dry</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a dermatologist nearly forty years ago for dry skin leading to eczema.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry, sensitive skin and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean, has no perfumes or harsh chemicals like other soaps</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and find that basis is really the only soap i can use that won&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially good when weather is cold and dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well in my opinion, just a little.</li>
            <li>Finally, a soap that does not cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry up!</li>
            <li>lathers up really well and continues to do so until that little piece that&#x27;s left at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband is very sensitive to any kind of chemicals in body soap, shampoo, dryer sheets, etc</li>
            <li> but I do love the fact that this product is fragrance and additive free, and not very expensive.</li>
            <li> Other than that the soap seems very mild, and sudses very nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this pure product with no dyes or additives.</li>
            <li> My Face Pure Olive Oil bars are better.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean without drying, it also does a good job of cleaing even &amp;#34;car grease&amp;#34; after I work on my car.</li>

            <li> It is a true blessing.</li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i buy them 6 or more at a time and the price is much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Decided if the doctor recommended it for teenage son it would be good for his mother.  </li>
            <li> It is safe for your face as well as your whole body.</li>
            <li> This is a good personal soap, no fragance.  </li>
            <li> I cant say enough good for it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to this soap and that&#x27;s what I love about it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted to have it back in my shower.</li>
            <li> Cleans well for sensitive skin and rinses away nicely.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> If only I could find a shampoo this good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleansing bar for decades and feel confident that it has contributed to my unusually youthful skin.</li>
            <li> It is, also, just the right size to be comfortably held in your hand.</li>
            <li> I got the best price here as my local store only sells one bar at a time.  </li>
            <li> The lather is nice enough that you could probably use it for light shaving too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I stumbled onto this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a doctor, but believe this could help with some mild skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, or itchy skin).</li>
            <li> May try to use a mild vinegar rinse to cut the film, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It is mild, cleans you, refreshes you, and suds up well.  </li>
            <li> She is able to use this soap with no negative effects.  </li>
            <li> Best soap ever made, mild, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I found these under the super saver store for Amazon and have a regular order shipped to my home (I love that!).</li>
            <li> Very mild and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry, it doesn&#x27;t smell, it feels good,</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out... pretty much just because it can, and most soaps just aggravate it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice large bar so it lasts a long time through many showers.</li>
            <li> If you combine it with your favorite&lt;br /&gt;daily facial scrub, you&#x27;ll get even better results!</li>
            <li> This  soap feels good going on washes off easy even with bed baths being disabled.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying Basis because it will get your skin clean without over-stripping or causing irritation!</li>
            <li> Gently cleans and keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li> A great soap that is sensitive enough for both my daughter and my husband who have eczema.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this soap...perfect size, smell and doesn&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Simple honest soap.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Basis has proven every bit as effective and I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li> I love this sensitive skin bar.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Facial Soap!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Basis Sensitive Skin Bar for over&lt;br /&gt;20 years, its a mainstay in my daily routine ... &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product has been my go-to soap for many years now with no adverse skin reactions.</li>
            <li> but I feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it, and this is coming from a guy that used Ivory all his life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind of soap I can use that will not give me a skin rash.  </li>
            <li> For sensitive skin, this seems to be better than all.</li>
            <li> This soap has no artificial scents or byproducts.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for 30 years or more and have found nothing else that works as good due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like this soap better than any of the many other bars out there, including cetaphyl, dove, etc.</li>
            <li> I felt clean and smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> , moisturizing lather with just the right amount</li>
            <li> It is one of very few soaps that really is great for many people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it as a general body bar and it cleans effectively, yet gently.</li>
            <li> Basis soothes my skin while really getting it clean.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers really well and leaves my skin with that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make me like it better would be if there could be a version just as good that a. was made out of natural ingredients completely and b. was made by a company here in the US.</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous and I highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and most important it soothes itchiness.  </li>
            <li> soap lathers rather well with loofah, and doesn&#x27;t need much to get my full body.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers very well, does not have a strong smell, and rinses completely off leaving you squeaky clean with nothing to break you out.</li>
            <li> long Cetaphil nice</li>
            <li> This is great soap for a person that wants to feel clean and fresh but can&#x27;t handle the price of the other sensitive skin soaps.  </li>
            <li> It cleans ok, but we prefer something a little more scented.</li>
            <li> Certainly!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and cleans effectively.</li>
            <li> Many years ago Basis Skin Bar was recommended to me by my Dermatologist,I have used it ever since,Basis Bar and soft water is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite soaps, now getting difficult to find, but great for allergies.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap is non-irritating and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic soap for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had a  rash , large blotches that hurt , itch , and burned and after the first time using this soap the healing started !</li>
            <li> I usually shy away from anything scented as I’m almost guaranteed to have issues with it if it smells nice, and am left using oatmeal based soaps and goat’s milk soap – neither of which smell very pleasant –</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Basis is the only brand of bar soap I will use because it cleans gently, washes off easily, and leaves a clean, fresh smell on my body.</li>
            <li> It is a supperfatted soap, and is very gentle and hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle...</li>
            <li> I have eczema and need a very gentle, unperfumed soap.</li>
            <li> Still worth a try if you can&#x27;t afford real soap</li>
            <li> Fragrance free for those sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it when the Eucerin sensitive skin soap bar was no longer available.</li>
            <li> love how simple it is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only Basis soap for both bathing and hand washing for more than 35 years ever since my skin broke out from stress and a dermatologist recommended this soap.  </li>
            <li> It works well in many different types of water.</li>
            <li> I went back to buy more</li>
            <li> This basis sensitive skin soap is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> Much better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 2 weeks and had had no adverse reactions on my combination skin, and actually the dryness on my forehead is much better, but</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband tried it and really likes it too!</li>
            <li> I really like it; no slimy or tacky feeling after rinsing, and no reactions from my skin!</li>
            <li> I have just stumbled upon this soap in my local Wal Mart and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> but it always makes my face feel funny</li>
            <li> No surprise, gotta love corporate America.</li>
            <li> the lack of a chemical-like scent that is present in many face washes/bars is</li>
            <li> Most soaps cause her skin to break out with a red rash.</li>
            <li> Basis really helps!</li>
            <li> I used it many years ago and lost touch with its availability in the local stores.</li>
            <li> No matter how many others I try, I always end up back to this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and film free.</li>
            <li> so this stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li> My first review ever on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed the difference within the first 2 uses</li>
            <li> This product is OK but actually seems to make us break out a bit.</li>
            <li> I learned last year that I am allergic to many preservatives found in soaps and lotions and this soap was on my &amp;#34;approved to use&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> we tried so many different soups, but they do not work.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the alleged sensitive skin friendly soaps on the market and this is the first that&#x27;s been true to its word.</li>
            <li> Basis leaves my skin soft and fresh - I really feel clean when I use it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, cleans well and has a very slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very clean without over-drying it.</li>
            <li> It is unscented and feels good on my somewhat sensitive and very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> One other nice thing is that it does not leave a lot of residue in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> gentle non-drying, non-irritating washes off easily, leaves a clean but not perfume smell, lives up to it&#x27;s recommendation;, formula is always dependable, bar lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best conventional bars I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Soft  clean</li>
            <li> The lather was smooth, no harsh smells, and went on really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough on his skin while keeping him clean.....</li>
            <li> I am using this for obvious reasons, sensitive skin and while it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; fragrance, it does smell like just soap which is nice, if that makes sense</li>
            <li> It simply gets me clean!</li>
            <li> simple clean for your face!</li>
            <li> Great for getting sun block off after a long bike ride without a lot of effort, and won&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> As he aged, my husband noticed that his favorite Dial soap was starting to dry his skin; he also switched to Basis and is happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Still cleans very well but gentle on skin!</li>
            <li> She has trouble finding it locally, so I was glad to surprise her with a smiley box of her own.</li>
            <li> Basis is as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I have tried using moisturizing washes in the past but none of them work as good on me as Basis.</li>
            <li> But it treats the most sensitive parts of your body without drying or irritating -- and is fairly long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Very economical compared to other fragrance free soaps</li>
            <li> Usually the fragrance free bars either have some strong smell (to me) or they aren&#x27;t worth a flip.  </li>
            <li> I tried other soaps after just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my mind playing tricks on me, but, sure enough, I noticed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin, won&#x27;t dry it out, but has great cleaning power--gets everything off your face without leaving anything else on like other face washes do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such an incredible clean face washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just makes my skin even more dry, but this soap does not</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t always easy to find locally.</li>
            <li> My son dry skin look better already.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin plus asthma that reacts to fragrances.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, you can buy large quantities and get it shipped to your door cheaper than the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> I never really saw much lather which, to me, is necessary to feel clean and Basis gets nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is super expensive (although a great product).  </li>
            <li> Like most people commenting, I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap is all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell funny!</li>
            <li> Face soap and creamy don&#x27;t seem to fit in the same description---until I tried Basis Soap.  </li>
            <li> Creamy, gentle,</li>
            <li> a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Have skin issues and the use of this product has really helped</li>
            <li> This soap is apparently very soothing and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> His answers: He washed alot so he needed a gentle soap to prevent drying out.</li>
            <li> His face was very oily</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> It cleans well while being gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> No Fragrance and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH BASIS.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand perfumed soap and besides, it really does number on my skin.</li>
            <li> Cost is reasonable too</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle with no perfume issues.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause too much dryness.</li>
            <li> The lathered bar gently washes and cleanses the skin and removes the toughest of makeups.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the replacement.</li>
            <li> It is no longer available at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is what I have been looking for my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have I especially sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My whole family has begun using it now.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize as much with this soap, even though it does not contain any moisturizing elements.</li>
            <li> but I am looking forward to the summer to really put it to the test.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY PLEASE with this soap I didn&#x27;t go to buy this&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> well I might as well give it an try because I really do&lt;br /&gt;need soap.</li>
            <li> However, it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li> it really stings.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to get it this way.</li>
            <li> And trust me, I really have tried a LOT of stuff.</li>
            <li> Rarely available at local stores</li>
            <li> And the soap does not seem to wash off very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my mother who doesn&#x27;t like to spend so much on soap but LOVES it when I give her these.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper to purchase this on amazon..</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and and we&#x27;ve tried many different skin washes and soaps over the years.</li>
            <li> This soap gets the highest rating for being pretty natural yet not outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this soap to deal with a couple of skin issues I have recently come across and have found this particular soap to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> My kp is less noticeable and my skin is super soft, I will continue to use this soap, I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading other reviews and am extremely pleased with the Basis cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li> I have used Basis soap for many years and prefer it over other soaps.  </li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t say before is that it lathers much better than a lot of other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; soap bars.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended Basis to me and it still works better on me than any other bar soap I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Over the years we have tried other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps, but none are as safe as Basis.  </li>
            <li> This is a great sensitive skin bar; it is mild, unscented, not harsh or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Only caution is that you can&#x27;t leave the bar in a water filled soap dish because it will melt because of its high soluability.  </li>
            <li> so this simple clean face soap works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> so you get a cleaner feel after rinsing - leaving you refreshed and getting that overall clean feeling</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t make me itchy and didn&#x27;t have a strong perfume like scent.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong to dry the skin and might require a couple of lathers.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it has become more difficult to find this product of late, and so I&#x27;m especially happy to be able to purchase it in bulk here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely be buying it regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s mild enough that you can even use it on sunburned skin without it stinging.  </li>
            <li> My top and only choice for facial soap.</li>
            <li> I decided that as I am getting older, (age 42)</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like much.  </li>
            <li> I admit that as I&#x27;m older, I do use a moisturizing cleanser for my face now, but this is still my soap of choice.</li>
            <li> One of the only soaps I found that I&#x27;m not irritated by.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with the product and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I believe the perfume in the soap is the main problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone back to using anything else to keep my face clear and clean.</li>
            <li> After much searching and experimenting, this soap is the clear winner for unscented.</li>
            <li> If you have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very fragrance sensitive and this bar HAS A FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> I occassionally bathe with the bar during the winter when my skin is dry and itchy, and the feeling of clean</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel almost rough instead of silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great soap, unable to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dove for many many years, but unfortunately, my skin in extremely sensitive and had to switch to Basis.  </li>
            <li> I have been using cetaphil for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> If you do this, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth from Basis.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff and doesn&#x27;t leave a soap scum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin and have NEVER been able to use soap on a regular basis without it irritating/drying the heck out of my skin until I came across this soap.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this soap keeps me clean without dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic soap and I have extreme sensitivities and this stuff did not bother me at all  </li>
            <li> With several small children with sensitive skin this soap is a good value and works well.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin it does clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and body.</li>
            <li> Using this soap has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and will be using this from now on.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and have problems with fragrances I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap very much and can only find it at Amazon!  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with acne.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use it on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommended soap for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for ca.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my childrens&#x27; very sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use this soap both in the shower and just for washing my hands as well.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune skin disorder that leaves my skin very sensitive, and problematic.</li>
            <li> it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (Or stinging more than plain old water on a sunburn will...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the rock star of natural bar soaps!</li>
            <li> He said it leaves him feeling clean, like all the soap is gone, unlike with other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy when lathered and is practically fragrance free - which are a big plus to avoid possible further skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately is&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the more popular soaps</li>
            <li> Gentle soap that does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li> While this bar is indeed very mild and I have no skin reaction or itching, I find I am getting some acne after having showered with it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years and with my sensitive skin I find that is the only soap that I can us consistently and not have a skin reaction.</li>
            <li> This soap has no fragrance, albeit an extremely faint (pleasant) smell</li>
            <li> This soap works for your whole body, will not irritate sensitive skin, and will not dry you out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to find it in a six pack...because the single bar price at the store can get a bit pricey...and now that the world has gone shower gel crazy...</li>
            <li> Love this soap and have for years, but it is so hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li> With hard water, it seems to work better just to use shampoo for everything or a glycerin soap.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore or even find a better priced substitute that works as well.</li>
            <li> But it is usually hard to find in most drug stores and soap outlets.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in stores anymore, so I am glad Amazon sells it</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good , doesn&#x27;t dry you out too bad, but it&#x27;s too strong to use on my face, dries t out and turns it red .</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP ROCKS, IT&#x27;S SO CREAMY, IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GREAT IN THE REALLY COLD WINTER.EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT.</li>
            <li> I bought the clear brown one first(forgot</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can really use because I&#x27;m so sensitive.</li>
            <li> and it helps keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> so for someone with sensitive sinuses or allergies</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin that breaks out in an itchy rash when I use most scented or colored soaps .  </li>
            <li> and my doctor recommended it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or dermatitis like me.</li>
            <li> This soap is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin and tend to get eczema.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Leave no residue, work well for sensitive skin or problem skin.</li>
            <li> This is all I use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a soap, not a detergent, so if you are sensitive to detergents, this is product is for you.  </li>
            <li> When my fathers dermatologist recommend that he use Basis Sensitive Skin Bars, I began using them to wash my hands, body and, hair.</li>

            <li> Never upsets my sensitive skin and washes off in the soft water.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and helps with my eczema.</li>
            <li> We are a family of five, and each one of us with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I switched to dove sensitive unscented, and that truly smells like nothing but soap.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have sensitive skin (have had it</li>
            <li> so I found Basis Sensitive Skin Bar.</li>
            <li> but it leaves a residue on your skin like old school soaps used to.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, &amp; my doctor recommended this soap.</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap to sensitive skin people like me.</li>
            <li> I like this over Dove sensitive skin soap.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Basis for my sensitive skin and tendency toward rosacea redness.  </li>
            <li> It also pleases my sensitive nose as there is no perfume or chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li> It also is very gentle for dry, sensitive, Rosacea or problematic types of skin.</li>
            <li> Also these bars seem to last way longer than the normal brands!</li>
            <li> It fits easily in my hand, which is small.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised to find that the soap lasts a while, perhaps this is due to the lack of filler material they put into the soap - but either way, you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is the only reasonably priced skin bar we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my husband&#x27;s major allergies.</li>
            <li> Also parts of my body even extra sensitive this soap only heals no stinging or pain no uncomfortable feelings.</li>
            <li> would only purchase the new !</li>
            <li> After trying many products such as Neutrogena, Simple, and Bioderma to name a few, I can say that I&#x27;ve finally found the right facial soap!</li>
            <li> &quot; and this soap is one of the few things I can use to get my skin clean without drying everything out.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is dissolves quickly in the soap dish, so I purchased a cheap plastic soap dish that keeps it off the flat surface, and that helps.  </li>
            <li> Plus other brands of bar soap I&#x27;ve tried were very drying and many of them left my skin feeling way too tight.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling super clean with no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> It does melt a little too quickly</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, especially in the winter when it tends to get dry (and I run the shower too hot).</li>
            <li> It last a long time and is very gentle for a bar soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is used by my 89 year old aunt who have extremely sensitive and fragile skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well, heals and does not dry out sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i then by mistake ordered the white or sensitive skin one and the clear one as well.</li>
            <li> THAT IT IS THE ONE AND ONLY FOR ANYONE WHO IS ODER SENSITIVE AND HAS SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> soap is unbelievable in keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> She has had trouble with dry skin on her face, and she chaps easily.</li>
            <li> Too bad, they were great bars to use as face soap.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and only trust Basis.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any added scent, which apparently does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I was getting low and found this in the isle near the cetaphil and thought well for $1.86</li>
            <li> Basis is not only gentle enough that it didn’t cause any redness and irritation, but it actually has helped combat my skin issues.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin, this is the only soap you should use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser/soap that has ever made my skin so soft and so clear.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sensitive skin bar I&#x27;ve found that we don&#x27;t react to.  </li>
            <li> Basis for sensitive skin is the only soap I use for my body when bathing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but much more expensive than regular soap.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to use soap that leaves any kind of residue.</li>
            <li> This soap will not cause an allergic reaction and will calm your skin down from one if your skin is currently reacting to something you are allergic to.</li>
            <li> Basis works much better and is much, much less messy.</li>
            <li> The bar is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I orderered my special Basis bath soap from Amazon, as it is becoming very difficult to purchase locally.</li>
            <li> Always used Dove in the past but never felt clean enough.  </li>
            <li> I want something very gentle to cleanse my face, and I found it in this little bar of basis.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing that leaves the same &amp;#34;clean but solf&amp;#34; feeling on my oily face as this Basic sensitive skin bar.  </li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use, as it is non-drying, especially in Winter months, and does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soap does not have a perfume smell and does not dry out my skin or hair like shampoo does.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have near as many &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; with it, but it does leave a weird residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> No dry, itchy, eczema-flaring skin with this soap.</li>
            <li> No dry spots, no rashes.  </li>
            <li> Cost of the bar is very modest because the bar lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> So many unscented products actually have their own scent, and I hate that!</li>
            <li> Body washes and other things make me break out; Basis is the only soap I can use really, either on my face or body.</li>
            <li> Unscented, lasts a long time, sensitive, affordable.</li>
            <li> Usually that clean feeling would mean that my skin would be super dry, but nope,my skin is left soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The bar is highly soluable and I usually only need to touch it with a wet hand to wash my face or hands.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin is quite dry and sensitive, I use Basis Soap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this bar to anyone who has sensitive, irritated, or dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, this is the soap for you.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and not chaffed or dry</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist nearly forty years ago for dry skin leading to eczema.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry, sensitive skin and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean, has no perfumes or harsh chemicals like other soaps</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and find that basis is really the only soap i can use that won&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially good when weather is cold and dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well in my opinion, just a little.</li>
            <li> Finally, a soap that does not cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry up!</li>
            <li> lathers up really well and continues to do so until that little piece that&#x27;s left at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Every other one dries out her skin so bad, but this one helps greatly.</li>
            <li> Finally, the soap lasts long and keeps its shape</li>
            <li> Long lasting, no smell, and no residue.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not especially sensitive</li>
            <li> It is long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> It is a very gentle soap and does not dry my skin like other soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;I was having a hard time finding it in stores and then found it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years, and though I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive brands, nothing beats this.</li>
            <li> It does not tighten or dry out my skin like regular soap.</li>
            <li> As a former makeup consultant, clients often complain of oily or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin a bit dry but not enough to deter me from buying this again!</li>
            <li> This bar is waxy, low sudsing, leaves my skin dry and &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; and causes breakouts on my face and body.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t always been a bar soap person because too many I&#x27;ve used in the past left dirt or some sort of film behind when you rinse the soap off.</li>
            <li> The bars last a long time if allowed to dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> Every other soap I&#x27;ve used has either dried out my skin too much or causes bumps or something else.</li>
            <li> Usually dry soaps left my skin too dry, but did take away the oil.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin  the way other soap do.  </li>
            <li> I have used Basis sensitive soap for 15 years tried a lot of soap but still buy basis soap; other soaps make me itch and don&#x27;t like the smell of other soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my mother we are both long time users.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find in pharmacies now and only some Walmarts as well as Amazon carry it!!!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time to.</li>
            <li> I should have thought of this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Soap has been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Other like products do well in not make my conditions worse, they just don&#x27;t get my skin clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain, but the basis soap bar looks smaller than it used too.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to the soap is that you need to be very careful not to leave it wet or it won’t last long.</li>
            <li> Bought it to relieve dry cracking skin in the winter and now use it all year long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time if you keep it dry after using it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer basic&#x27;s other soaps to this one.</li>
            <li> Tried using other products an always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> If you dry skin use this soap.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my face without my skin feeling dry and irritated afterward.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or add any perfume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone with a dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> There are no strong fumes, no hidden fragrances.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin, try it...</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I get dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by the dermatologist for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Have not noticed dry skin in winter since using this soap; however, it doesn&#x27;t feel like all of the soap is rinsed off after showering.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin</li>
            <li> A few years ago a friend gave me several bars of a French luxury soap with lavender with a heavenly fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Less toxic than Dove and Irish Spring and cheaper than Toms Maine.</li>
            <li> It does not contain the fragrance elements you typically see in your regular soap</li>
            <li> This item works well for ones who very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Skin has tight feeling like soap residue is left on skin.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin due to the winter and EVERY soap both liquid and bar</li>
            <li> if I had soft water, but with our hard water, it leaves a sticky film.  </li>
            <li> **not real soap</li>
            <li> Not real fragrant, but clean-smelling.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost imperceptible, actually it probably is to others who don&#x27;t have nose that smells and is allergic to everything!  </li>
            <li> These bars don&#x27;t moisturize as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected..</li>
            <li> it was expensive because it was fresh with no perfume that bothers me.</li>
            <li> When I use other kinds of soap when visiting or dining out, my hands feel very dry, unlike when I use Basis.  </li>
            <li> My skin may be less dry and rough</li>
            <li> This bar doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years as requested by a dermatologist and am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and will not consider any other product.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is extremely...</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s due to the warmer weather, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> This Basis soap has absolutely not bothered my hand AT ALL!</li>
            <li> The facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried in the past either caused me to breakout or over-dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this due to eczema</li>
            <li> I have other soaps to use up</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t compete if you choose to use cologne or other scented products.</li>
            <li> In that aspect, it holds up and lasts longer than other soaps I have used.  </li>
            <li> I do not use any other soap on my face due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> i am confused re the new or used ?   </li>
            <li> Would not recommend for people with dry skin, my husband can&#x27;t use it because it keeps his skin too dried out.</li>
            <li> Other soaps I looked at that neutralized pool chlorine were so expensive and the shipping cost as much as the soap itself.</li>
            <li> Previously, we used Ivory all year &#x27;round and added bath oil in dry weather.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, so I order it online and can always get it.</li>
            <li> These are so hard for us to find in store, and it&#x27;s the only soap my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start showing any facial wrinkles until my late fifties.</li>
            <li> and she does not do well with the average soap.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this soap, it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; my chlorine itch since i swim at least 3 times every week, no more itching after i start to use this soap!</li>
            <li> In cold dry weather, my whole family switches from Ivory to Basis because it keeps out skin moist and flexible.</li>
            <li> prone to break outs \\&quot;down there\\</li>
            <li> After washing my face I was shocked, it was literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about the bad smell, but I don&#x27;t smell much of anything when the bar is wet or when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> I had been buying basis for year, but unable to find it in the local stores including the big chains.</li>
            <li> I still get breakouts, but they are less severe with Basis.  </li>
            <li> I was using the typical soaps and decided to give this a try and see if there would be any improvement.</li>
            <li> (I.e. doesn&#x27;t turn into a mushy mess).</li>
            <li> After rinsing my face, my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight; it felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me breakout, but it did leave my skin feeling tight after use.</li>
            <li> Turns out that after just a few uses my Plaque Psoriasis is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but, my daughter was getting these little reddish bumps on her cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I think me and my little BOX will be around</li>
            <li> Pls read the label carefully!!!</li>
            <li> It is my everyday shower up soap.</li>
            <li> and I use everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of the few bar soaps i&#x27;ve used where i didnt have the ick feeling.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a while and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you dried out.</li>
            <li> You can find it at a few drugstores and grocery stores too.</li>
            <li> and it is one of a few soaps sold at my hospital&#x27;s pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I buy it in lots of six from Amazon every few months.</li>
            <li> It works well as an everyday bath soap with no unwanted side effects.  </li>
            <li> This soap is not cheap</li>
            <li> No strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented but, that doesn&#x27;t mean scent less.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;It has very little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past.</li>
            <li> I had been using Aveeno for the past twenty years and   </li>
            <li> By the way, since I leave the bar on the sink, I usually use it to wash my hands.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to call it soap because not sure it is</li>
            <li> They always seem to have the harshest perfumes and they take forever to rinse off, but no matter how thoroughly I rinse they always leave me with a slick residue.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s difficult for me to open my eyes to reach for the faucet handles.</li>
            <li> Ordinary soap can be drying.  </li>
            <li> I have become increasingly sensitive to the artificial fragrances added to soap, air fresheners, etc.  </li>
            <li> what a waste!</li>
            <li> Excelent Price on a product we use everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a superfatted soap with no fragrances or other irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap, but certainly less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Having eczema it is very hard to find a soap for everyday showering.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend with serious skin issues who came to stay with me for a few days and went away with a bar of soap!  </li>
            <li> I like this soap because it&#x27;s hard to find a bar of soap without fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding Basis at the chain drugstores around me.</li>
            <li> it becomes hard milled and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This soap is often hard to find at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> This has been around for years, but is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to find in grocery stores.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill perfectly, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> Other soaps were drying me out in the winter, and making me itch in the summer, and I didn&#x27;t want to go find some expensive dedicated soaps for each season.</li>
            <li> After one time using my rash is almost gone no more itching burninf pain !</li>
            <li> The previous face bar was getting too expensive that he had as a face bar</li>
            <li> I tried it after seeing on the deal of the day (as this can be a little expensive for bar soap).  </li>
            <li> Not a good combo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years now, after constantly searching for a face wash that wouldn&#x27;t dry me out to the point of leather, and cause terrible flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap paired with acne.org benzoyl peroxide 2.5% cream spread generously has been my working solution to acne for at least 8 years!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find at stores</li>
            <li> The dermatologist says it is dry skin and gave me some cr&amp;egrave;me for when it gets bad and the bumps break out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this soap doesn&#x27;t deal with hard water</li>
            <li> all the grease and dirt leaving nothing behind.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re tired of perfumed soaps...</li>
            <li> I recently moved to AZ where hard water is terrible.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
            <li> I want to add I use this soap from head to toe and have the worst sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a faint</li>
            <li> This soap is difficult to find in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> and now I am obsessed!  </li>
            <li> I had fairly bad acne</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this soap.  </li>
            <li> it is odorless, and lathers well, but dries my skin terribly.  </li>
            <li> For years I have paid outrageous prices for &amp;#34;natural soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it smells horrible!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it just made my skin (face) horribly dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if you can find it, the price is outrageous.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are hands down the best conventional bars I&#x27;ve tried. Less toxic than Dove and Irish Spring and cheaper than Toms Maine. Note that Basis is ***not real soap*** Soap is made from fats and alkali and include such brands as Nubian Heritage/Out Of Africa/Skin Trip. Pls read the label carefully!!! Basis is listed as a bar because it doesnt contain fats and alkali. Still worth a try if you can&#x27;t afford real soap</li>
            <li> Best soap, no real perfume, but just very good facial grade soap, maybe the best.  I got the best price here as my local store only sells one bar at a time.  This is easily a year or two supply for my shower.</li>
            <li> A demonologist recommended this to me in 1974 and I use it whenever I can find it. There&#x27;s no detergent in it.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. I like the texture. Makes you feel really clean!</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it&#x27;s hard to find a bar of soap without fragrance. This is mild and effective (without the smelly stuff) so for someone with sensitive sinuses or allergies it&#x27;s a good choice. It does melt a little too quickly or I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have allergies, this is the soap for you. It cleans well, but does not generate any reactions. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The product was packaged well and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> Great price. This soap has been excellent for my skin.</li>
            <li> Basis soap was Doctor-recommended to me years ago.  I have delicate skin that breaks out in an itchy rash when I use most scented or colored soaps .  As he aged, my husband noticed that his favorite Dial soap was starting to dry his skin; he also switched to Basis and is happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free for those sensitive to perfumes. Gentle soap that does not dry your skin. Very economical compared to other fragrance free soaps</li>
            <li> We love this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for years. My daughter has sensitive skin and and we&#x27;ve tried many different skin washes and soaps over the years. I finally gave her a bar of Basis and it has worked beautifully for her.</li>
            <li> Face soap and creamy don&#x27;t seem to fit in the same description---until I tried Basis Soap.  It has the moisture I need to keep my skin from drying out, and it feels wonderful.  Not real fragrant, but clean-smelling.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Basis soap exclusively for over 25 years, at the recommendation of his dermatologist.  Nothing else has ever allowed him to be so free of skin problems, and the price through Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years as requested by a dermatologist and am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Tthis is the only thing I shower with. My store was out so I purchased online. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Have been using Basis soap for years.  Creamy, gentle, no alcohol, a rich soapy lather and no feeling of residue afterwards.  My dermatologist recommended it when the Eucerin sensitive skin soap bar was no longer available. Lastly, and this is a personal opinion/preference, I will take the Basis soap bar over the Lubriderm soap bar for the reasons above.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading other reviews and am extremely pleased with the Basis cleansing bar.  I have very sensitive skin and will be using this from now on.  It arrived in no time at all.</li>
            <li> we have allergies at my house and this works well for us a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> If your skin is easily irritated there&#x27;s a remedy.</li>
            <li> Have skin issues and the use of this product has really helped</li>
            <li> Very good product. My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is my everyday shower up soap. love how simple it is</li>
            <li> I have used Basis Soap for many years now and just love it.  Because of my sensitive skin and my sensitivity to fragrances I have to be careful what I use. This is one of the best products for both problems.  If you have sensitive skin and have problems with fragrances I would highly recommend this product.  This is one of the best soaps on the market for both problems.  I give Basis 5+ stars.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my sister. She swears that this is the BEST soap she&#x27;s used for her sensitive skin. She has had trouble with dry skin on her face, and she chaps easily. This soap is apparently very soothing and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the one soap that does not irritate my skin, smells nice and I use everyday in the shower. I order it 12 bars at a time. Really like it and my doctor recommended it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic soap and I have extreme sensitivities and this stuff did not bother me at all  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much and can only find it at Amazon!  Our local stores used to carry it but not anymore for some reason or another.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is quite dry and sensitive, I use Basis Soap. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com because it is no longer sold in drug stores. I&#x27;m glad I found this wonderful product on Amazon.com.  Pamela</li>
            <li> This soap is used by my 89 year old aunt who have extremely sensitive and fragile skin.  She is able to use this soap with no negative effects.  It is a true blessing.</li>
            <li> This is great soap for a person that wants to feel clean and fresh but can&#x27;t handle the price of the other sensitive skin soaps.  I love it and will definitely be buying it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use on my face.  I have sensitive skin and only trust Basis.  My face feels clean and smooth with out any irritation.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap for my daughter it is the only soap she can use on her face.She has used it for years and our local stores no longer cary it.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite soap.  She has trouble finding it locally, so I was glad to surprise her with a smiley box of her own.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I was shocked, it was literally squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve never experienced such an incredible clean face washing. The lather was smooth, no harsh smells, and went on really well. It also comes off very easily bringing with it all the grease and dirt leaving nothing behind. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I will never use another soap. This is like bathing with milky smooth moisture. I love it! If you have sensitive skin or dermatitis like me. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only Basis soap for both bathing and hand washing for more than 35 years ever since my skin broke out from stress and a dermatologist recommended this soap.  My skin healed using Basis.  It is very mild and non-drying.  When I use other kinds of soap when visiting or dining out, my hands feel very dry, unlike when I use Basis.  I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Was purchased for mother in law, only soap she will buy! Every other one dries out her skin so bad, but this one helps greatly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Oilatum, but they don&#x27;t make it any more.  This is a pretty good substitute.</li>
            <li> Great unscented soap, we like it.</li>
            <li> it was on sale and i read the reviews.  i&#x27;m glad i took the chance and purchased it!  it&#x27;s one of the few bar soaps i&#x27;ve used where i didnt have the ick feeling.  it&#x27;s light and doesnt have the leftover residue feeling.</li>
            <li> This soap is for sensitive skin. I have used it in the past. Very mild. I recommend this brand as do dermatologists. I also recommend the seller. Dorothea Smith.</li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife seem to be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this soap for him and he recommended it to me.  We both have sensitive skin and tend to get eczema.  I love this soap.  It has no scent and it rinses very easily, leaving my skin very clean feeling.  Most grocery stores and drugstores don&#x27;t carry it.  So, I have a subscription to it on Amazon!  I get 6 bars every 6 months at a very good price.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but certainly less expensive on Amazon. This is the very best unscented soap you can buy.  It does not dry out your skin and cleans beautifully.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Soft  clean well  like it</li>
            <li> A great soap that is sensitive enough for both my daughter and my husband who have eczema.</li>
            <li> I personally did not like it, neither did my husband. It cleans ok, but we prefer something a little more scented.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and will not consider any other product.  My doctor recommended it.  For sensitive skin it does clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and body.</li>
            <li> Using this soap has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Great if you have sensitive skin and tired of the weird smelling soaps. Bonus is not having to try and find them in store and having them delivered instead.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP ROCKS, IT&#x27;S SO CREAMY, IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GREAT IN THE REALLY COLD WINTER.EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and arrived in time with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I tried a sample of this and now I am obsessed!  I love everything about this soap...perfect size, smell and doesn&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> I started using Basis when I was 12 and I&#x27;ve been using Basis soap ever since. My skin makes me look 10 years younger than 65. I started because I noticed that my father, a doctor, always used Basis Soap. Why? His answers: He washed alot so he needed a gentle soap to prevent drying out. His face was very oily so he needed a soap that cleared away the oil. He had a lot of allergies so he wanted to avoid getting rashes. And finally, for the sake of his patients, he wanted to avoid fragrence. I travel a lot more than my father and take Basis with me at all times. It works well in many different types of water. Some years ago I was looking at the soap box and read it differently: B-AS-IS (be as is): the basis of life is to be who you are. Simple honest soap.</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t make me break out! My entire family uses it.</li>
            <li> I have used Basis sensitive soap for 15 years tried a lot of soap but still buy basis soap; other soaps make me itch and don&#x27;t like the smell of other soaps. I feel clean after using this soap</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my mother we are both long time users. I like buying in bulk for such reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent soap.  The \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is extremely...well...mild.  Almost not there at all.  Really...all you smell is whatever the lathering agent is...so if you&#x27;re tired of perfumed soaps...Basis Sensitive Skin is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mild enough that you can even use it on sunburned skin without it stinging.  (Or stinging more than plain old water on a sunburn will...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to break outs \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and this soap is one of the few things I can use to get my skin clean without drying everything out.  The lather is nice enough that you could probably use it for light shaving too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be goop resistant.  I can leave the bar in my shower soap dish without it gooping to the dish...which is always a problem for me with \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; bars.  What&#x27;s the point if I need power tools to get it off of my soap dish?  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to find it in a six pack...because the single bar price at the store can get a bit pricey...and now that the world has gone shower gel crazy...I have a hard time finding Basis at the chain drugstores around me.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite soap. It cleans well while being gentle to the skin. It is, also, just the right size to be comfortably held in your hand. One other nice thing is that it does not leave a lot of residue in the soap dish. All around a great soap and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove for many many years, but unfortunately, my skin in extremely sensitive and had to switch to Basis.  I like it, it&#x27;s not my Dove, but it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; soap...it is odorless, and lathers well, but dries my skin terribly.  Ok if you have a more oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving ths 5 stars because I&#x27;ve used it for years. It is one of very few soaps that really is great for many people with sensitive skin. NO dyes, NO perfumes, etc. The only thing that would make me like it better would be if there could be a version just as good that a. was made out of natural ingredients completely and b. was made by a company here in the US.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter uses it ---price is good compared to store with free shipping. Dale Starks</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart used to stock this item. Their loss is an Amazon gain. I have used this item for 30 years or more and have found nothing else that works as good due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price on this specialty soap is excellent, and it&#x27;s nice not to search all over town for it, only to find it&#x27;s 6 bucks a bar, or they no longer carry the soap.</li>
            <li> Good price and received order promptly.</li>
            <li> After purchasing just 1 bar of basis soap sensitive skin , I found it is truly the best one I have ever used.  I originally purchased it at Walgreens which is in my neighborhood . I went back to buy more but they told me they have ordered it but have not been able to get it for quite awhile, tried Rite Aid and cvs noone seems to have it . I had been using Aveeno for the past twenty years and   like basis much much more , Glad i could find it at Amazon i am confused re the new or used ?   would only purchase the new !</li>
            <li> We have used Basis soap for many years.  Recently it has not been in the local stores.  Shopping through Amazon has made it very easy for us to buy Basis.  Now we don&#x27;t have to go on a soap hunt through our local stores.</li>
            <li> My top and only choice for facial soap. It&#x27;s cheap and very effective, what more can you ask for. It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin, won&#x27;t dry it out, but has great cleaning power--gets everything off your face without leaving anything else on like other face washes do. This soap paired with acne.org benzoyl peroxide 2.5% cream spread generously has been my working solution to acne for at least 8 years!</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review, but this product is deserving. I get hives from allergies and have seborrhea. Basis soothes my skin while really getting it clean. It even removes my mascara. Other like products do well in not make my conditions worse, they just don&#x27;t get my skin clean. It&#x27;s the only soap in our shower, great for shaving, great for everyone. It lathers well and lasts.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and cannot use all soaps.  This soap was recommended by a dermatologist years ago but you cannot purchase it in the local drugstores anymore.  It is very good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap and the Dial Basics. This soap is great. No Fragrance and cleans very well. My skin may be less dry and rough feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The Dial Basics I could not use because of the strong fragrance. Had to give it away.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Feels great on my skin and it lasts a long time.  No strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Very mild and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but much more expensive than regular soap.  Lathers up and rinses off well.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again as it&#x27;s much more expensive than regular soap.</li>
            <li> Basis was recommended to me by a dermatologist over 30 years ago and I am thankful it is still available.  Cleans well, heals and does not dry out sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> AND CAN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING.  THEN USE THIS.  IT HAS NO SCENT BUT LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING CLEAN AND YOU WON&#x27;T BREAK OUT ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended by my Dr. I bought the clear brown one first(forgot which Basis this is) and loved it. i then by mistake ordered the white or sensitive skin one and the clear one as well. All three of these soaps are wonderful. Leave no residue, work well for sensitive skin or problem skin. i love the feel. i am also highly sensitive to smells and this soap is great with no added scent to it.    I also decided to buy the face liquid that comes in the tube and this works wonderful as i have never used a regular bar soap on my face. Bar soap always made my face red.     I have continued to order this product through Amazon as it has the best price. i buy them 6 or more at a time and the price is much cheaper than in the stores. That is IF you can find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema all my life.  This basis sensitive skin soap is FANTASTIC.  I use it as my hand soap and also in the shower.  My skin has never been better than it is now that I use this soap.  There is something about it that leaves your skin holding moisture and not drying it out.  I totally love this soap.  It is getting harder to find in pharmacies now and only some Walmarts as well as Amazon carry it!!!</li>
            <li> I orderered my special Basis bath soap from Amazon, as it is becoming very difficult to purchase locally. Amazon took my order, via my iPhone, and scheduled a regular shipment. To my surprise it was received a couple days earlier than promised. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This is all I use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Basis years ago when I had a rash.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  It is a soap, not a detergent, so if you are sensitive to detergents, this is product is for you.  It is cheaper when ordered online in quantity that at the drug store.</li>
            <li> This soap is non allergenic and I love it in the summer.  great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> excellent for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When my fathers dermatologist recommend that he use Basis Sensitive Skin Bars, I began using them to wash my hands, body and, hair. The soap does not have a perfume smell and does not dry out my skin or hair like shampoo does. I have  been using it for over twenty years and I have not reason to switch to another product.  [[ASIN:B000HGIQRG basis Sensitive Skin Bar, Cleans + Soothes, 4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found this soap. Other soaps I looked at that neutralized pool chlorine were so expensive and the shipping cost as much as the soap itself. Luckily I stumbled onto this soap. It is not advertised as chlorine neutralizing, but the ingredients make it one. And it actually works!</li>
            <li> Been using the product for years and it is very good on my sensitive skin.  Moved and couldn&#x27;t find product at stores so ordered at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema, and has used BASIS for the last 4 years... It&#x27;s mild enough on his skin while keeping him clean..... It&#x27;s the only bath soap he uses.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a liquid form.</li>
            <li> I have used Basis soap for many years and prefer it over other soaps.  It is unscented and feels good on my somewhat sensitive and very dry skin.  It is no longer available in any local drugstore, so I am happy that it is available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this pure product with no dyes or additives. The chamomile makes your skin silky smooth. This is the rock star of natural bar soaps!</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, will buy more!</li>
            <li> A dermatologist suggested our son use basis soap 30 years ago.  He did and helped his skin problems.  Decided if the doctor recommended it for teenage son it would be good for his mother.  Been using ever since. I purchase in quantity and I unwrap the bars and store.  Exposed to air it becomes hard milled and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis soap for years. I love it. It has no odor, it&#x27;s so soft, and it lathers perfectly. Best facial soap anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin due to the winter and EVERY soap both liquid and bar I&#x27;ve tried just makes my skin even more dry, but this soap does not, it&#x27;s wonderful and very much worth the price! It rinses clean, has no perfumes or harsh chemicals like other soaps have and it feels amazing on your skin and the face wash isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
            <li> If you dry skin use this soap.</li>
            <li> My husband and son love this soap.  First, it is good for sensitive skin.  It cleans well.  It doesn&#x27;t have all that perfume that many men do not like and people can have allergic reactions to. Finally, the soap lasts long and keeps its shape (I.e. doesn&#x27;t turn into a mushy mess).</li>
            <li> So many unscented products actually have their own scent, and I hate that! After much searching and experimenting, this soap is the clear winner for unscented.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and have for years, but it is so hard to find anymore. So I stocked up :)</li>
            <li> Love Basis soap! Much better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried over the years to find a bar soap that won&#x27;t cause me splotches and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance that  bothers my chemical sensitivities.  This is the one!!!!  I am so excited that I found this.  Usually the fragrance free bars either have some strong smell (to me) or they aren&#x27;t worth a flip.  This one has a very very light nice scent...it&#x27;s almost imperceptible, actually it probably is to others who don&#x27;t have nose that smells and is allergic to everything!  Had I known it had even a hint of a scent, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it because I would have thought that it would break me out.  So don&#x27;t let it deter you.  Not even a hint of redness after I bathe.  This soap is fabulous and I highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3 1/2 years later and this is still the only soap bar I use!  It&#x27;s wonderful and I don&#x27;t get nearly as many rashes as I used to.  I just can&#x27;t say enough how grateful I am I found this soap.  BTW...One thing I didn&#x27;t say before is that it lathers much better than a lot of other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; soap bars.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so for years I couldn&#x27;t use soap at all.  Basis leaves me clean and will rinse off.  Soap can be a wonderful thing, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one I can use.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. It&#x27;s gentle and nice. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and buy it in bulk. I would never try another soap after using this one.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best cleanser either. I prefer basic&#x27;s other soaps to this one. It&#x27;s literally just \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I decided that as I am getting older, (age 42) I want something very gentle to cleanse my face, and I found it in this little bar of basis.  I read reviews about the bad smell, but I don&#x27;t smell much of anything when the bar is wet or when it is dry.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and had had no adverse reactions on my combination skin, and actually the dryness on my forehead is much better, but maybe that&#x27;s due to the warmer weather, I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that I will be buying this again.  It&#x27;s simple and perfect and I love that it has chamomile in it.  I see they have a vitamin bar as well maybe I&#x27;ll try too.</li>
            <li> While this bar is indeed very mild and I have no skin reaction or itching, I find I am getting some acne after having showered with it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had been buying basis for year, but unable to find it in the local stores including the big chains. I found these under the super saver store for Amazon and have a regular order shipped to my home (I love that!). This is a great sensitive skin bar; it is mild, unscented, not harsh or irritating to the skin. I would recommend this bar to anyone who has sensitive, irritated, or dry skin. I&#x27;m not a doctor, but believe this could help with some mild skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, or itchy skin).</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so finding a good soap is important my skin and sanity. Usually dry soaps left my skin too dry, but did take away the oil. I thought after a while that that just can&#x27;t be good. So I ventured from body washes to soap bars, and found the basis Sensitive Skin soap.&lt;br /&gt;In a word: sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers rather well with loofah, and doesn&#x27;t need much to get my full body. My skin does indeed feel smother and softer during and after the wash. I tried other soaps after just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my mind playing tricks on me, but, sure enough, I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but for oily and sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far. There may be a better soap, but I haven&#x27;t found it. Amazon sure makes it easy to order this soap, and it works just as nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rinse off well.  Would be okay if I had soft water, but with our hard water, it leaves a sticky film.  Like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  May try to use a mild vinegar rinse to cut the film, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  With hard water, it seems to work better just to use shampoo for everything or a glycerin soap.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin. Has no scent and is a good all over body Soap.  Very soothing. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very sensitive skin and we get this soap on auto-order so we never run out. Our local Walmart carries it, but I can never count on it to always be on stock when I need it. The auto-order price is cheaper than buying it local anyway. The soap does not irritate our skin or leave any kind of residue. It is safe for your face as well as your whole body. It does not lather a great deal, so it&#x27;s not that great for shaving your legs (although I have used it for this as well), so I use Aveeno Body Wash for that and it seems to be working on my legs (no itching or irritation). This is a great soap for those with sensitive, irritable skin!</li>
            <li> Finally, a soap that does not cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry up! I have tried many of the alleged sensitive skin friendly soaps on the market and this is the first that&#x27;s been true to its word.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best soap on the market. If you have real sensitive skin. Try it you will like it,</li>
            <li> This is a good personal soap, no fragance.  Every woman should use this soap. I&#x27;ll recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with acne. This stuff is super-gentle and is non-irritating. Just look up the review on acne.org</li>
            <li> Best soap you can use will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Only soap I use on my face for years! I now have 16 bars which may last me a life time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have one hand that dries out and gets itchy bumps on it. The dermatologist says it is dry skin and gave me some cr&amp;egrave;me for when it gets bad and the bumps break out. This soap has been great. I could tell my old soaps were aggravating my hand. This Basis soap has absolutely not bothered my hand AT ALL! I use it in the shower. It lasts a long time to. It is not one of those bars that is gone in no time! Just great and a good price on Amazon. My husband tried it and really likes it too! He said it leaves him feeling clean, like all the soap is gone, unlike with other bar soaps. I cant say enough good for it. if you have sensitive skin, or are trying to stay away from chemically laden soaps, this is a good soap to try! I am going to use this soap when I need bar soap for my children!!! And I will be able to feel good about it!!!!!!! Mark helpful if this was helpful! I appreciated all the good reviews on this product when I was looking at it. It has no smell and I like the white color!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me several years ago to use either Cetaphil or Basis.  Cetaphil is super expensive (although a great product).  Basis is great - my skin doesn&#x27;t break out or turn red.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Basis soap for years.  I can use it on my face without my skin feeling dry and irritated afterward.  It produces a lot of suds but still lasts for a good while and rinses clean.  It is the best soap I have ever used and I have tried many brands during my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years...</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to this soap and that&#x27;s what I love about it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or add any perfume.  It simply gets me clean!</li>
            <li> Amazing soap leaves you clean not oily.</li>
            <li> I HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO MEDICINE. I ORDERED BASIS AND IT&#x27;S THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED. MY DAUGHTER ORDERED IT AND SHE SAYS THE SAME ABOJT IT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH BASIS.</li>
            <li> The only soap I use for my face and overall body as recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> I have always used this in the shower to clean my face. It last a long time and is very gentle for a bar soap. Having it delivered to my front door is just the icing on top!</li>
            <li> I am very fragrance sensitive and this bar HAS A FRAGRANCE. It will disappear from your skin after a while. Other than that the soap seems very mild, and sudses very nicely. I will be able to use this soap in my guest bath. I think the term &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; is misleading.</li>
            <li> These bars don&#x27;t moisturize as well as I expected. Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty nice soap. I&#x27;ll get something else next time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and find that basis is really the only soap i can use that won&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; ever. Basis leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. It does not tighten or dry out my skin like regular soap. I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that leaves the same &amp;#34;clean but solf&amp;#34; feeling on my oily face as this Basic sensitive skin bar.  I have used it for 20+/- years.  I occassionally bathe with the bar during the winter when my skin is dry and itchy, and the feeling of clean but solf is the same even after just 1 use.  I love it.  By the way, since I leave the bar on the sink, I usually use it to wash my hands.  Not only does it clean without drying, it also does a good job of cleaing even &amp;#34;car grease&amp;#34; after I work on my car. Cost of the bar is very modest because the bar lasts a very long time.  The bar is highly soluable and I usually only need to touch it with a wet hand to wash my face or hands.  Only caution is that you can&#x27;t leave the bar in a water filled soap dish because it will melt because of its high soluability.  Emanuel</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to call it soap because not sure it is but, it does work.  it was not acne or pimples but, my daughter was getting these little reddish bumps on her cheeks.  I have been using basis for years and asked her to try it and it worked!  Now her complexion is very smooth.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin and have NEVER been able to use soap on a regular basis without it irritating/drying the heck out of my skin until I came across this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t have any added scent, which apparently does the trick.  I can imagine that some people wouldn&#x27;t like the &#x27;scentless scent&#x27;, but I&#x27;ve gotten quite used to it and it leaves me feeling clean, smooth, and non-irritated(skin).  Its especially effective with irritated private parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone with a dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand perfumed soap and besides, it really does number on my skin. For years I have paid outrageous prices for &amp;#34;natural soap&amp;#34;. When Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to drastically raise their prices, I went looking, read all the reviews and decided to try Basis. I have been really pleased. Very moderately priced, no perfume and great lather. This is a keeper. It is so refreshing to find a good simple product that doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a Starbucks Latte.</li>
            <li> Like most people commenting, I have very dry skin.  I have been using Basis for about 12 months as a replacement for Oilatum, my soap of choice for two decades.  Basis has proven every bit as effective and I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use that cleans well and does not leave my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;It has very little fragrance. i have used it for many years. Great product!</li>
            <li> Basis soap is great for those of us who have sensitive skin.  It cleans well and does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Switched to this from Dove sensitive skin bar.  I really like it; no slimy or tacky feeling after rinsing, and no reactions from my skin!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can really use because I&#x27;m so sensitive. Body washes and other things make me break out; Basis is the only soap I can use really, either on my face or body. It also lasts a while and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you dried out. Best soap ever.</li>
            <li> simple clean for your face!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. There are no strong fumes, no hidden fragrances. This soap is perfect for an overall natural clean.</li>
            <li> This is great bath soap.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and cleans effectively. I have used it for years.  it isn&#x27;t always easy to find locally.</li>
            <li> This bar is meant for faces I believe, but I use it all over my body. Other soaps were drying me out in the winter, and making me itch in the summer, and I didn&#x27;t want to go find some expensive dedicated soaps for each season. This soap works for your whole body, will not irritate sensitive skin, and will not dry you out. Cost is reasonable too</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, this is the soap for you.  Cleans effectively and keeps skin moist!</li>
            <li> I have just stumbled upon this soap in my local Wal Mart and it is fantastic!  I have sensitive, fair, and oily/acne prone skin... Not a good combo.  I have been using cetaphil for normal to oily skin but it always makes my face feel funny and it smells horrible!  I was getting low and found this in the isle near the cetaphil and thought well for $1.86 im gonna try it.  I went home and washed my face and it was awesome!  It felt as if I had washed toned and moisturized after just washing!  I felt clean and smooth and soft.  It was wonderful... I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I AM 63, AND WAS TURNED ON TO THIS SOAP ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO, SO CANT REMEMBER BY WHO;  I DO REMEMBER IT WAS PRESENTED AS A &amp;#34;SUPER FATTED SOAP&amp;#34;,  WHICH WAS GREAT FOR FACIIAL SKIN;  HAVE THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA OVER 25-30 YEARS?  IS IT STILL CONSIDERED &amp;#34;SUPER FATTED&amp;#34;?  I DONT KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT IS THE ONE AND ONLY FOR ANYONE WHO IS ODER SENSITIVE AND HAS SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years. I have eczema and it helps a lot. I cannot buy it at the stores I used too. For some reason they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Big mistake for them. A dermatologist suggested using this soap about 25 years ago. This is the only soap I use for my face and to shower with.</li>
            <li> Just the right soap!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap for my super-sensitive skin.  Great product at a much more affordable price than the glycerin bar alternative.</li>
            <li> This item works well for ones who very dry skin. My son dry skin look better already. And he only been using this soap for two days.</li>
            <li> I love this sensitive skin bar.  I have very sensitive skin.  I have not found any make up I can use, and most lotions cause a reaction as do most soaps.  This soap is gentle with no perfume issues.  The bar is large enough to last a long time. I like the oval shape of the bar as well.  It fits easily in my hand, which is small.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. No smells and our hands feel smooth. Also, I use it on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin. No allergic reaction at all.</li>
            <li> After trying many products such as Neutrogena, Simple, and Bioderma to name a few, I can say that I&#x27;ve finally found the right facial soap! I have ultra sensitive skin. It gets aggravated at the slightest thing.  The facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried in the past either caused me to breakout or over-dry my skin. So after reading the reviews, I took a chance on this, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It has a very rich, creamy texture and rinses out easily. It left my skin feeling very clean without over-drying it. This soap has no fragrance, albeit an extremely faint (pleasant) smell and I could feel its soothing effect whenever I worked up a lather. After rinsing my face, my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight; it felt hydrated. I am very happy with it and I hope Amazon never discontinues from selling it (because I can&#x27;t find this brand in my country). Do I recommend this soap? Certainly!</li>
            <li> the best soap available for sensitive skin!  Long lasting, no smell, and no residue.  Hard to find locally, so I order it online and can always get it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended soap for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for ca. 30 years and won&#x27;t part from it.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for 20 years and can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use after a couple of weeks.  No scent, a plus for me.  My only complaint is that is dissolves quickly in the soap dish, so I purchased a cheap plastic soap dish that keeps it off the flat surface, and that helps.  I&#x27;m not certain, but the basis soap bar looks smaller than it used too.  No surprise, gotta love corporate America.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Doesn&#x27;t cause too much dryness.</li>
            <li> This is the only reasonably priced skin bar we&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my husband&#x27;s major allergies.</li>
            <li> Works great clean skin without any reactions</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have found and have used it for over 20 years. Great for sensitive skin and leaves no residue on your body.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years. Works great for sensitive skin all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years now, after constantly searching for a face wash that wouldn&#x27;t dry me out to the point of leather, and cause terrible flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I have acne prone skin, this face wash compliments my regimen perfectly, and I have seen much better results and improved facial clarity ever since I introduced it into my regimen, since it is not harsh at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the lack of a chemical-like scent that is present in many face washes/bars is an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I&#x27;ll stop using it is if they stop making it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect facial soap bar for all skin types.  As a former makeup consultant, clients often complain of oily or dry skin.  This bar doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  It&#x27;s very creamy when lathered and is practically fragrance free - which are a big plus to avoid possible further skin irritation.  I use this bar to cleanse my face whether I have makeup on or not - no cold cream needed!  The lathered bar gently washes and cleanses the skin and removes the toughest of makeups.  Sometimes, I use this as a body bar, too because it&#x27;s that GOOD!</li>
            <li> I use this due to eczema and I like that I don&#x27;t have near as many &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; with it, but it does leave a weird residue on my skin. It also makes my skin feel almost rough instead of silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Most soaps cause her skin to break out with a red rash. This solves the problem. She uses it exclusively, even travelling.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know seems to have jumped on the liquid soap train, but I can&#x27;t stand liquid soaps. They always seem to have the harshest perfumes and they take forever to rinse off, but no matter how thoroughly I rinse they always leave me with a slick residue. Basis soap smells like soap, not perfume. There is a hint of chamomile, but nothing offensive. Most importantly, I feel clean after washing with Basis because they don&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It does not dry out my skin  the way other soap do.  My skin feels so good.</li>
            <li> Basis leaves my skin soft and fresh - I really feel clean when I use it. My skin is sensitive, especially in the winter when it tends to get dry (and I run the shower too hot). Basis really helps! This is a nice large bar so it lasts a long time through many showers.</li>
            <li> In cold dry weather, my whole family switches from Ivory to Basis because it keeps out skin moist and flexible. Previously, we used Ivory all year &#x27;round and added bath oil in dry weather. Basis works much better and is much, much less messy.</li>
            <li> Bout this because dermitologist recommended I try.  Works like he said it would.</li>
            <li> Great skin care soap.</li>
            <li> Nice and very mild. Does not irritate my childrens&#x27; very sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Basis soap for over 20 years since my dermatologist recommendend. A few years ago a friend gave me several bars of a French luxury soap with lavender with a heavenly fragrance.  I tried a bar but my skin started itching because of the dryness.  I put the remaining bars in a bowl in the guest bath which smells heavenly.  Buying the six pack here is about 1/2 the price as in drug stores.</li>
            <li> My skin can&#x27;t even take Ivory soap, but Basis is great.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and most important it soothes itchiness.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and I think my mother turned me onto this product sometime when I was in college. I haven&#x27;t gone back to using anything else to keep my face clear and clean. Thank goodness I&#x27;ve found this product on Amazon when one of the big box stores stop carrying the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me breakout, but it did leave my skin feeling tight after use. This also stings my eyes, so not so good for removing eye makeup. Also, it&#x27;s difficult for me to open my eyes to reach for the faucet handles. Still in search for an affordable facial cleanser without sulfates or parabens that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling taut or hurt when it gets into my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dermatitis especially contact dermatitis than this is the soap for you. This soap will not cause an allergic reaction and will calm your skin down from one if your skin is currently reacting to something you are allergic to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the last five years and my friends can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m nearing 60. I use it as a general body bar and it cleans effectively, yet gently.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  My son and I use it all the time and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore or even find a better priced substitute that works as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  I really love the soap.  Thanks for the replacement.</li>
            <li> No dry, itchy, eczema-flaring skin with this soap. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good soap, cleans, lathers, rinses well. It is not heavily perfumed, though it does have a bit of scent.  It&#x27;s also quite inexpensive and there are no plastic bottles you have to pay for or worry about recycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I wanted to compare this product with Dove&#x27;s hypoallergenic brand. Basis is as good if not better. However, I noticed that build up of residue on my tub is quicker with Basis than Dove. I still get breakouts, but they are less severe with Basis.  Amendment: This product is excellent! In fact, I am sticking with it. I had no breakouts since I started using basis.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for sensitive skin.  It was recommended by a dermatologist.The bars last a long time if allowed to dry between uses.  It is no longer available at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> causes redness and flaking skin. ingredients include lanolin which many are allergic to.  I would not recommend . causes redness and flaking skin. ingredients include lanolin which many are allergic to.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome for all skin types if you&#x27;re looking for a bar of soap. Still cleans very well but gentle on skin! Love it.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and use this soap both in the shower and just for washing my hands as well. Buying it in the multi-packs via Amazon seems to be the best way to get a good price per bar. You can find it at a few drugstores and grocery stores too.</li>
            <li> Only soap I use!  Great for those with exczma !</li>
            <li> Item purchased and delivery were as promised - 100%</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap is non-irritating and my skin feels smooth. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> My sister claims it&#x27;s the best soap for her since she has skin allergy.</li>
            <li> Best general all-around soap for me!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like much.  I always have used Ivory but my father convinced me to try basis.  Cleans well  without beating up your skin.</li>
            <li> it is very clean feel and not loaded with perfumes, and that makes it for me. Family keeps borrowing so I will have to order more</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the product for you. I used it many years ago and lost touch with its availability in the local stores. But in the last year or two I rediscovered it and I&#x27;m delighted to have it back in my shower. So if you have dry skin, try it...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it is one of a few soaps sold at my hospital&#x27;s pharmacy.  It is gentle, cleans well and has a very slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My family uses this soap for our overall soap needs, including bathing.  With several small children with sensitive skin this soap is a good value and works well. Glad it&#x27;s part of the subscribe &amp; save offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years, and though I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive brands, nothing beats this. My facial skin is happiest when I use it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap!</li>
            <li> Great for winter time, when skin starts to get dry out from furnace and dryer winter air.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin plus asthma that reacts to fragrances. This is my go-to soap. No matter how many others I try, I always end up back to this one. I admit that as I&#x27;m older, I do use a moisturizing cleanser for my face now, but this is still my soap of choice. I buy it in lots of six from Amazon every few months.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Only soap I use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune skin disorder that leaves my skin very sensitive, and problematic. Basis is not only gentle enough that it didn’t cause any redness and irritation, but it actually has helped combat my skin issues. I usually shy away from anything scented as I’m almost guaranteed to have issues with it if it smells nice, and am left using oatmeal based soaps and goat’s milk soap – neither of which smell very pleasant – so I was really pleased with the light fragrance of Basis.&lt;br /&gt;Also, with those soaps I never really saw much lather which, to me, is necessary to feel clean and Basis gets nice and sudsy. It definitely cleanses well, and even removes all signs of make-up without an additional cleanser but doesn’t leave a filmy residue. The only downside to the soap is that you need to be very careful not to leave it wet or it won’t last long. Best bet for storage is to leave it exposed to the air. If you do this, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth from Basis.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use soap that leaves any kind of residue. This soap lathers very well, does not have a strong smell, and rinses completely off leaving you squeaky clean with nothing to break you out. This stuff is what I have been looking for my whole life.</li>
            <li> Great soap without perfumes, it works beautifully for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;We all have allergies to perfumes and this soap is the answer to our precious skin! It&#x27;s a good size too!</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot...I&#x27;m midway through bar one and the best thing I can say about it so far is that I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry, it doesn&#x27;t smell, it feels good, I feel clean, it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love this face soap. Found it at CVS couple years ago and have used it ever since! I have I especially sensitive skin so this simple clean face soap works wonders for me. Leaves your face soft and not chaffed or dry and I have all the girls in my family using it now too! We all love it. Bought the bulk pack so I have back ups!</li>
            <li> Pros: gentle non-drying, non-irritating washes off easily, leaves a clean but not perfume smell, lives up to it&#x27;s recommendation;, formula is always dependable, bar lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Cons: isn&#x27;t always easy to find! A bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t always been a bar soap person because too many I&#x27;ve used in the past left dirt or some sort of film behind when you rinse the soap off. Plus other brands of bar soap I&#x27;ve tried were very drying and many of them left my skin feeling way too tight. Basis is the only brand of bar soap I will use because it cleans gently, washes off easily, and leaves a clean, fresh smell on my body. It also is very gentle for dry, sensitive, Rosacea or problematic types of skin. My Dermatologist recommended Basis to me and it still works better on me than any other bar soap I&#x27;ve ever found. I have tried using moisturizing washes in the past but none of them work as good on me as Basis. I highly recommend trying Basis because it will get your skin clean without over-stripping or causing irritation!</li>
            <li> Many years ago Basis Skin Bar was recommended to me by my Dermatologist,I have used it ever since,Basis Bar and soft water is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a lot of products on my skin, but this one washes away and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything from my face to the shower.  It has a very light scent, which is important to me, a migraine sufferer.  It is good to my skin.  I have a friend with serious skin issues who came to stay with me for a few days and went away with a bar of soap!  It&#x27;s really wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist nearly forty years ago for dry skin leading to eczema.  It&#x27;s a superfatted soap with no fragrances or other irritating ingredients.  It works well as an everyday bath soap with no unwanted side effects.  This was a good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin, this is the only soap you should use.  My whole family has begun using it now.  It leaves you feeling very smooth and clean, and is safe on a baby&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> I use this soap because of allergy to paraben based products. No problems to report. Also, I use it as a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Best soap in the world. Using it for over 30 years. Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was using the typical soaps and decided to give this a try and see if there would be any improvement. Turns out that after just a few uses my Plaque Psoriasis is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Good soap and no smell. Hard to find in stores. Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this bar is far and away the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up really well and continues to do so until that little piece that&#x27;s left at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice shape too.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best skin soaps that I have been able to find. Silky smooth and luxurious, this soap pampers your skin in soothing comfort and protection.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Leaves your skin soft and film free. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over 15 years and would never switch. I have dry skin in the winter and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t make me itchy and didn&#x27;t have a strong perfume like scent. This fits the bill perfectly, at least in my case. When we could no longer find it locally I turned to Amazon, and lo and behold, I could get it at a much better price. I should have thought of this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This soap gets the highest rating for being pretty natural yet not outrageously expensive.  I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works as promised, and good during the winter.  Good lather and rinses quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good when weather is cold and dry.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my ezcema. Its very good for people with any allergic condition. Has no smell but cleanses nicely without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li> best soap for allergies! if your a woman and you suffer a lot from infections or cystitis..... this is the ONLY soap for you!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected..</li>
            <li> If what you need is a clean feeling this is the soap you need. It may leave skin feeling dry but if you have oily skin this product is great.</li>
            <li> The best quality soap.  Gently cleans and keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to be so careful with sensitive skin and allergs to find products I can use. This  soap feels good going on washes off easy even with bed baths being disabled.The soap leaves no film like I mention feels awesome going on and makes sores and other skin issues feel better. I had a  rash , large blotches that hurt , itch , and burned and after the first time using this soap the healing started ! After one time using my rash is almost gone no more itching burninf pain ! I have other soaps to use up but I will bever buy a different type of soap This soap is a winner  ten  stars !!!&lt;br /&gt; I want to add I use this soap from head to toe and have the worst sensitive skin. Also parts of my body even extra sensitive this soap only heals no stinging or pain no uncomfortable feelings. I was like WOW it feels so good going on and  lather nice lots of creamy like soap it really feels good on your body. Also it rinses excellent and I have to take bed baths being bed bound. I am thrilled I fount this soap and it gives me no pain or rash I Love it !!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin so this stuff works pretty well and it helps keeps my skin clear. Would not recommend for people with dry skin, my husband can&#x27;t use it because it keeps his skin too dried out.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this soap to deal with a couple of skin issues I have recently come across and have found this particular soap to be quite effective. It does not contain the fragrance elements you typically see in your regular soap so you get a cleaner feel after rinsing - leaving you refreshed and getting that overall clean feeling you&#x27;re looking for after a shower/bath. I was also surprised to find that the soap lasts a while, perhaps this is due to the lack of filler material they put into the soap - but either way, you get your money&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize as much with this soap, even though it does not contain any moisturizing elements. Overall I recommend this soap to anyone who has sensitive skin and is looking for a good deal and a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry, sensitive skin and cleans well.  I also like that it fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for my face.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is great. My skin breaks out... pretty much just because it can, and most soaps just aggravate it. But for sensitive skin folks like myself, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> My first review ever on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is unbelievable in keeping my face clean. This is my FACIAL soap. Every other soap I&#x27;ve used has either dried out my skin too much or causes bumps or something else. I had fairly bad acne but this soap works well for me and I hope it does for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give rave reviews often, and who would think it would be about Soap, so I hope that says a lot.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Facial Soap!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Basis Sensitive Skin Bar for over&lt;br /&gt;20 years, its a mainstay in my daily routine ... &#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;Rich, moisturizing lather with just the right amount&lt;br /&gt;of cleansing, it leaves your skin perfectly clean&lt;br /&gt;and smooth. If you combine it with your favorite&lt;br /&gt;daily facial scrub, you&#x27;ll get even better results!</li>
            <li> Got this soap after my doctor recommended it.  Very hard to find at stores but I eventually found it at Walgreens and it was $3 a bar!!! I bought one just to see if I liked it and boy did I.  I was happy to see that I could find it on Amazon at about $0.80 cheaper plus free shipping since I bought 2 packs of 6 and qualified for free shipping.  Always used Dove in the past but never felt clean enough.  After telling my doctor, he recommended this soap and I am so happy he did.  He had to remind me that Although Dove is a moisturizing beauty bar, it&#x27;s not a cleansing bar or hypoallergenic.  Noticed the difference within the first 2 uses but I am looking forward to the summer to really put it to the test.  Unfortunately is&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the more popular soaps but I think it is well worth the money!  Leaves my skin a bit dry but not enough to deter me from buying this again!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000HGIQRG basis Sensitive Skin Bar, Cleans + Soothes, 4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]]  I&#x27;ve used this for years on the recommendation of -- oops, can&#x27;t remember.  But it treats the most sensitive parts of your body without drying or irritating -- and is fairly long-lasting.  No dye or perfume so it won&#x27;t compete if you choose to use cologne or other scented products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a family member with sensitive skin. It was just what the doctor recommended. Calmed the red skin.</li>
            <li> Have used basis for years.  Never upsets my sensitive skin and washes off in the soft water.</li>
            <li> I am VERY PLEASE with this soap I didn&#x27;t go to buy this&lt;br /&gt;but they were out of my regular face soap Cetaphil so I&lt;br /&gt;decided to give this an try and I am so glad I did I have&lt;br /&gt;been useing Cetaphil for more than 12 plus years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never heard of this soap let alone ever seen it in&lt;br /&gt;the stores I just happen to see this at Walmart so I said&lt;br /&gt;oh well I might as well give it an try because I really do&lt;br /&gt;need soap.

            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product has been my go-to soap for many years now with no adverse skin reactions.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Bought it to relieve dry cracking skin in the winter and now use it all year long. Will definitely buy again. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic soap for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have sensitive skin so I tried this when I saw a lightning deal. I am glad I did! This soap has a nice light scent and leaves our skin soft. I plan to try the facial soap next. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I use</li>
            <li> I prefer the glycerin version, however this is a good backup!</li>
            <li> Good product good price</li>
            <li> This is the BEST bar soap ever.  My skin feels nice and clean after showering and there&#x27;s no scent lingering on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but actually seems to make us break out a bit. Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil bars are better.</li>
            <li> I like this soap better than any of the many other bars out there, including cetaphyl, dove, etc. Keeps my skin soft and helps with my eczema.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap on the market for sensitive skin.  However, it is very pricey.  On Amazon, you can buy large quantities and get it shipped to your door cheaper than the grocery store.  This soap is not cheap but I feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean when using this soap.  I like that is doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; when left in the shower.  In that aspect, it holds up and lasts longer than other soaps I have used.  I will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> We love this soap at our house! Cleans well for sensitive skin and rinses away nicely.  Do not get it in your eyes though...it really stings.  This soap is often hard to find at Walmart or Walgreens. Buying it with Prime membership and in bulk made it cheaper per bar anywhere else we&#x27;ve looked. Don&#x27;t leave it in an area where it will sit in water.  It will become mushy.  We bought a 3m command soap dish made for the shower from amazon that has drainage holes.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> excellent soap.  I have eczema and when I use this soap exclusively, I don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> It is a supperfatted soap, and is very gentle and hypoallergenic.  I have been using for years.  Feels wonderful, and my face clean, no residue.</li>
            <li> This has been around for years, but is hard to find in stores.  It&#x27;s the only soap I can use without having it irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff and doesn&#x27;t leave a soap scum.  Lasts a long time if you keep it dry after using it.  Well worth it, and this is coming from a guy that used Ivory all his life.</li>
            <li> Great deal. This soap works wonderfully for my ultra sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My husband gets eczema on his legs and since we started using this bar soap he has not had another breakout! Also these bars seem to last way longer than the normal brands! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are so hard for us to find in store, and it&#x27;s the only soap my husband will use. So glad that I can get it on Amazon and for a good price.</li>
            <li> buying by subscription, the purchasing works well as does the soap and at a good price</li>
            <li> One of the only soaps I found that I&#x27;m not irritated by.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with the product and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I love Basis soap. It&#x27;s very gentle...even on the most delicate/sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so am relieved that amazon has it in stock.</li>
            <li> When it comes to removing make-up from my face, this product is the best!  It is not too strong to dry the skin and might require a couple of lathers.  Ordinary soap can be drying.  This just cleans.  There&#x27;s no breaking out that results.  It&#x27;s the only way I take make-&lt;br /&gt;up off my face.  It&#x27;s great and gets my vote!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use, as it is non-drying, especially in Winter months, and does not irritate sensitive skin. He also appreciates that this soap has no added perfume/scent. As other reviewers have noted, it has become more difficult to find this product of late, and so I&#x27;m especially happy to be able to purchase it in bulk here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Recommended to my daughter-in law with skin issues by dermatologists at an Ivy League med school.  If it&#x27;s good enough for them it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell funny! My dermatologist recommended it to help with my acne and so far it&#x27;s been great to me. I use it on my face and my back.</li>
            <li> Best soap for sensitive skin I ever found. Been using it for years and years. No annoying fragrance or irritants. If only I could find a shampoo this good.</li>
            <li> Great soap, unable to find in stores.  Good price in pack of six.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 25 years.  I do not use any other soap on my face due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and need a very gentle, unperfumed soap. This is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP! So clean and it works with my skin well . Will purchase forever!!!!</li>
            <li> Years ago, my dermatologist recommended Basis soap as the best for sensitive skin care.  But it is usually hard to find in most drug stores and soap outlets.</li>
            <li> I have become increasingly sensitive to the artificial fragrances added to soap, air fresheners, etc.  This soap is the best one I have found for eliminating these overpowering fragrances that are found in almost all consumer soaps.  It causes zero irritation with skin contact as well.  I now take this soap along when I go on a trip, it&#x27;s so addictive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Basis bars for years and they have always been great leaving my skin clean and soft. I recently moved to AZ where hard water is terrible. Unfortunately this soap doesn&#x27;t deal with hard water well. I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for something that will. Still a good buy though!</li>
            <li> We are a family of five, and each one of us with sensitive skin.  Basis was recommended by our pediatrician, and then by our dermatologist, many years ago.  It is not cheap - though Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I have found.  Over the years we have tried other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps, but none are as safe as Basis.  It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good , doesn&#x27;t dry you out too bad, but it&#x27;s too strong to use on my face, dries t out and turns it red . It&#x27;s unscented but, that doesn&#x27;t mean scent less. It has a faint, grandma smell that I just can&#x27;t pinpoint. Something flowery. I switched to dove sensitive unscented, and that truly smells like nothing but soap.</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews for this product, so of course I wanted to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it just made my skin (face) horribly dry.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think my skin does well with soaps.</li>
            <li> Having eczema it is very hard to find a soap for everyday showering.  I tried it after seeing on the deal of the day (as this can be a little expensive for bar soap).  Very happy with this product, does not irritate my skin and leaves a nice clean feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I get dry skin during the winter. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well in my opinion, just a little.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have sensitive skin (have had it all my life) and Basis soap has been a godsend for me. I don&#x27;t know what happened with this order, but there is NO WAY this is my Basis soap! I&#x27;ve been using Basis for 30+ years as both a face and body soap, and this is not that product. This bar is waxy, low sudsing, leaves my skin dry and &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; and causes breakouts on my face and body. I haven&#x27;t decided whether to go to the effort to return these bars to amazon or to just throw them in the trash, but I won&#x27;t be using them. Six bars...what a waste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser/soap that has ever made my skin so soft and so clear. I will never go back to using anything else. Feels lovely, lathers really well, and makes you feel very clean!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s the only kind of soap I can use that will not give me a skin rash.  I have a hard time finding it in stores anymore, so I am glad Amazon sells it and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Best face soap, been using it for 20 years. Tried using other products an always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Clean smell. Clean feeling.</li>
            <li> pros:  clean feeling, doesn&#x27;t melt like cetaphil bar soaps, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:  none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t be dis appoint ed.  buy now</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for my husband before, and his mother needed some too.  Much cheaper to get it this way.</li>
            <li> My kids and I are allergic to dyes and perfumes on our skin.  This is the ONLY sensitive skin bar I&#x27;ve found that we don&#x27;t react to.  And trust me, I really have tried a LOT of stuff.</li>
            <li> Unscented, lasts a long time, sensitive, affordable. You will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s the only bar that I will use.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I am grateful to my pharmacist for recommending Basis. For sensitive skin, this seems to be better than all. It leaves one&#x27;s skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever made, mild, long lasting. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great soap for people with allergies or sensitive skin. Rarely available at local stores and if you can find it, the price is outrageous.  Good value.</li>
            <li> My  dermatologist recommended that I buy a bar soap for my face as I needed one. The previous face bar was getting too expensive that he had as a face bar so I found Basis Sensitive Skin Bar. I have been using it for over twenty years and, while I have tried others, this is superior to them in every way I can think of.</li>
            <li> The only soap I can use on my hands. Hard to find in grocery stores. An essential in the house.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by the dermatologist for dry skin.  It has eliminated flaky skin, lasts for quite a while, lathers easily and rinses off welll.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed dry skin in winter since using this soap; however, it doesn&#x27;t feel like all of the soap is rinsed off after showering. Skin has tight feeling like soap residue is left on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.. I had problems with itchy skin which kept up most of the night scratching.  That is all gone now.&lt;br /&gt;Try it if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Great product for acne or oily skin. Use on your face ONLY.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for several months now and have no problem with itching skin and it rinses off well</li>
            <li> Super good soap! Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this soap any where local.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite soaps, now getting difficult to find, but great for allergies.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it is hypoallergenic and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not supposed to be a scent, but I still smell something.  And the soap does not seem to wash off very well.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for the perfect soap - this one isn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
            <li> Using it for pool rash so it&#x27;s probably good for any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> it is good and unscented like dove soap but it lasts longer. only thing is it leaves some residue and i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Great for getting sun block off after a long bike ride without a lot of effort, and won&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered online because I can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Have used for many years and love it.  Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> According to the company that makes these - this bar was discontinued.  Too bad, they were great bars to use as face soap.</li>
            <li> I am using this for obvious reasons, sensitive skin and while it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; fragrance, it does smell like just soap which is nice, if that makes sense but it leaves a residue on your skin like old school soaps used to. I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> The best soap I have ever used for my very sensitive skin.  I will continue to order the 6 pack because it&#x27;s much more affordable</li>
            <li> My husband is very sensitive to any kind of chemicals in body soap, shampoo, dryer sheets, etc...This is the best soap we have tried.  Believe me when I say we tried them all!  This is the best.  I buy this in bulk for him so he never runs out.  No dry spots, no rashes.  You will not be disappointed with this soap.  My only question is....Do they make shampoo?</li>
            <li> Works as needed, no problems. Cheaper than going to a store and buying individual bars.</li>
            <li> I have used this bar for acouple of years and have avoided skin rashes.  Our grocery store quit selling it and I had to find another source.  It is mild, cleans you, refreshes you, and suds up well.  I purchased this set to have sent to a family member.  We&#x27; had also tried the vitamin (amber colored) version of the skin bar and it works well also.  It&#x27;s been a relief to not have rashes from the chemicals in soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap has no artificial scents or byproducts. Just good clean soap that works well. Thanks for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love this non-drying soap.  Great Price!!</li>
            <li> Have used it for years</li>
            <li> Received okay.  Package somewhat folded in, but that was alright, as it was soap.  Bars were all in good condition.  I would order this product again when needed.  This soap is difficult to find in stores in my area.  It lasts a long time and is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this is great.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this soap, it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; my chlorine itch since i swim at least 3 times every week, no more itching after i start to use this soap!</li>
            <li> I started using this soap because my dermatologist recommended it for my keratosis pilaris, about 10 years ago. The soap lathers really well and leaves my skin with that squeaky clean feeling. Usually that clean feeling would mean that my skin would be super dry, but nope,my skin is left soft and hydrated. My kp is less noticeable and my skin is super soft, I will continue to use this soap, I love it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, &amp; my doctor recommended this soap. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin &amp; it&#x27;s easy to travel with since I can&#x27;t use anything else. Wish they made it in liquid body wash form also.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleansing bar for decades and feel confident that it has contributed to my unusually youthful skin. I didn&#x27;t start showing any facial wrinkles until my late fifties.</li>
            <li> I learned last year that I am allergic to many preservatives found in soaps and lotions and this soap was on my &amp;#34;approved to use&amp;#34; list.  It is a nice soap with good lather.</li>
            <li> Used this for years even tho it was expensive because it was fresh with no perfume that bothers me. I changed to liquid soap &amp; body wash for a time but my hands broke out in a rash so I&#x27;m back to my tried &amp; true.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hand has been peeling off since two years ago. we tried so many different soups, but they do not work. after my daughter used basis for just three days, her skins recovered. it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful allergy soap. So convenient to have it delivered instead of hunting for it in stores.</li>
            <li> Excelent Price on a product we use everyday!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I local store stop selling it. So glad i found it again. It doesn&#x27;t irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Basis is the best soap for sensitive skin.  I buy it for my mother who doesn&#x27;t like to spend so much on soap but LOVES it when I give her these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years. My skin is not especially sensitive but I do love the fact that this product is fragrance and additive free, and not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used Basis for years.  It is a very gentle soap and does not dry my skin like other soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;I was having a hard time finding it in stores and then found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;So easy and amazingly quick to get.  The deals are also cheaper than store price!&lt;br /&gt;Win! Win!</li>
            <li> Gave as gift and she said it was her favorite</li>
            <li> This is great for acne prone oily skin. Leaves your skin feeling super clean with no residue left behind. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years and with my sensitive skin I find that is the only soap that I can us consistently and not have a skin reaction.</li>
            <li> This is my go to soap for washing my face, has been for years.</li>
            <li> Soap has been around for a long time. Found a good price on Amazon. Great for dry or problem skin.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper to purchase this on amazon.. I recommend this soap to sensitive skin people like me. I like this over Dove sensitive skin soap.</li>
            <li> Basis for sensitive skin is the only soap I use for my body when bathing. I have very dry skin and this soap keeps me clean without dryness or flaking. I use a Cetaphil bar for my face, though - Cetaphil is a non-soap cleanser and since the skin on my face gets even drier than the rest of my skin, bar soap is too drying. For your body, you can&#x27;t do better than Basis. I&#x27;ve tried many other soaps and this one is the best for me. It is long lasting as well. Doesn&#x27;t get mushy in the shower. Amazon has excellent prices for it too. Even better than Bed Bath and Beyond, which is the next best price.</li>
            <li> My mother was coming for a visit and she does not do well with the average soap. I believe the perfume in the soap is the main problem. She had used Ivory soap for years but one of her doctors had recommended this product and she has been using it ever since. I sent her home with the remaining bars but kept the opened one with me, I was very pleased with how it felt on the skin and how it cleaned. I can see why she loves this soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon because my local stores are often sold out.  My dermatologist recommended Basis for my sensitive skin and tendency toward rosacea redness.  This cleansing bar is gentle but effective. It has never caused my face to be red.  It also pleases my sensitive nose as there is no perfume or chemical fragrance.</li>
