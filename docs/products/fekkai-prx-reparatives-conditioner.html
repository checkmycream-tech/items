    <ol>
            <li>The best shampoo and conditioner you can use.</li>
            <li>Best product in their line!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for aging color-treated hair!</li>
            <li>at the legendary Fekkai</li>
            <li>Best price is AMAZON!</li>
            <li>and it is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Perfect for Damaged hair</li>
            <li>It smells so delicious.</li>
            <li>As wonderful with damaged hair as the shampoo!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>excellent price for an excellent product</li>
            <li>Her hair looks beautiful and smells great though!</li>
            <li>good stuff!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a great scent and does a great job on my daughter&#x27;s medium-thickness hair.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smelled great, but just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to.</li>
            <li>I would happily purchase this again depending on the price.  </li>
            <li>I would pay up to about six dollars a bottle for it based off of what a great job it did on my hair.  </li>
            <li>it is great.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Have many Fekkai products that I believe are excellent.    </li>
            <li>As soon as i opened the top i smelled the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>of all, it has the most wonderful scent - vanilla bean !</li>
            <li>The both have a pleasant vanilla scent.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good conditioners.</li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>Good conditioner for damages hair.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the vanilla scent but it ends up smelling like argan oil afterwards when your hair dries.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit of an indulgence; however, if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, it&#x27;s a good line of products to do that with.</li>
            <li>One of the things I like best about higher-end conditioners is that they&#x27;re more concentrated, more viscous, so that all of the conditioner ends up on your hair instead of dripping out of your hands on the way *to* your hair.</li>
            <li>They both have a very pleasant, mildly vanilla/coconut aroma.  </li>
            <li>love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai products for many years!  </li>
            <li>The smell and texture were both amazing.</li>
            <li>I can rave for pages on products that ARE AMAZING, this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, It really is an effective repair conditioner.</li>
            <li>thought this was a nice product that can be recommended for split and unruly ends.</li>
            <li>I will say that the scent of this conditioner is very nice, much better than most without being overbearing.</li>
            <li>but at any rate it is a light and pleasant scent, not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li>My hair breaks off very easily, so I decided to try both the Fekkai Prx Shampoo and Conditioner together as a set to help the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This means that it breaks off very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is not a useless one, it is just lacking in anything that I would be delighted to rave about!</li>
            <li>Argan is one of the best natural products around.</li>
            <li>Will depend on your hair type, but for me (or rather my wife) this is so far an impressive hair care</li>
            <li>A little works great, rinses out easily, nice fragrance - and best of all it leaves your hair shiny and smooth without feeling weighed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!!</li>
            <li>conditioner was very good at adding softness (textural quality was greatly improved by use of this product) and tamping down what I&#x27;d call the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>that I was totally satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I expect more from Fekkai and will not be getting any more.  </li>
            <li>It was okay on my hair, but for some reason it clogged my pipes.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this conditioner, LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite was a Curly blend that I haven’t seen in years.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too.</li>
            <li>I used it and it helped give my hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again</li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The conditioner smelled really good and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the Fekkai brand &amp; am so happy that I&#x27;ve found it online for a more reasonable price. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite has turned out to be Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I had to use a LOT more of it than the Glossing conditioner to be able to get out my tangles.  </li>
            <li>frizziness that can happen around the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I think this product would suit people with shorter and coarser hair better than longer, softer hair.</li>
            <li>I love most of their products, but this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>She also blow drys her hair most of the time as it is quite long.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>and it is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed this is warm water and then followed up with a cool rinse.</li>
            <li>Leaves my damaged and treated hair very sleek and smooth, which feels great.</li>
            <li>I think I found my new favorite product!!</li>
            <li>leaves hair smooth and smelling fresh just like advertised, very good product and price on amazon much cheaper than drugstore prices</li>
            <li>Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with my conditioner and can tell immediately if it&#x27;s a good match for my hair.  </li>
            <li>They have a great scent, if not a little overpowering with the finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it so much i&#x27;ve already purchased the full size!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d choose any of their other wonderful conditioners before this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to rinse off from hair and there was no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It was so strong that it gave me a headache each time I tried it</li>
            <li>It also tangles easily because it is fine.  </li>
            <li>I tried it with my fine hair</li>
            <li>- they work fine either way.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, this is not the product for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells</li>
            <li>It smoothed my highlighted fine hair immediately.</li>
            <li>and she said it felt very clean and full with body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just one use, I noticed a huge difference in my daughter’s hair.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my hair was silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Like the shampoo, it is a heavy formula -- if you have a lot of hair to control, this is a wonderful conditioner.</li>
            <li>it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to make your hair feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>After washing out, your hair still feels really smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this conditioner from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li>I was recently given a complimentary sample of this product via infuenster and loved it immediately!  </li>
            <li>First, it has a light vanilla - almond fragrance … love the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and left my hair super smooth.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is rich and creamy, with a luxurious feel to it.</li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with this (hair still soft and</li>
            <li>(and I tried it multiple times so that I could be sure to review it as thoroughly and honestly as I could).  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and the conditioner both do what they&#x27;re supposed to do; my hair is softer and stays clean longer, now that I&#x27;ve switched to this.  </li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner, it has a relatively simple formulation and is not packed full of &#x27;buzzword filler&#x27; ingredients like many high end conditioners (ahem, Alterna)</li>
            <li>One can buy a large tube of Feria conditioner (called color moisturizing treatment on the package) for slightly more than 1/2 the price of this Fekkai conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper conditioners are often thinner and don&#x27;t always do a good job at preventing further damage.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>For the conditioner, use a decent-sized amount and make sure you don&#x27;t rinse it out right away, and it will do exactly what you would expect a conditioner to do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster for the complimentary testing product!!</li>
            <li>have tried many, many different conditioners over the years.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is very thick and rich, the scent is light and pleasant, and my fair feels soft and manageable after using.  </li>
            <li>and I frankly have better luck finding what I want at used clothing stores than on the racks of new.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this Conditioner, a light slightly vanilla scent that lingers in the hair all day.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is a very rich conditioner that makes your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>She has curly hair that is fine in texture, but it is not thin.</li>
            <li>My hair was also very tangly after lightly towel drying it.  </li>
            <li>That being said, while it is worth the price</li>
            <li>The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Concentrate conditioner on the ends of hair, avoiding the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;•Repair and protect hair daily with the effective care of PrX Reparatives</li>

            <li>/&gt;Repair and protect hair daily with the indulgently effective care of PrX Reparatives Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to really rinse it out thoroughly, and don&#x27;t use too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottle is a nice, pleasing, calm shade of blue (says daughter).</li>
            <li>I recieved this product from influenster complimentary</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>wife has has perm treated hair, that tends to become greasy with too frequent washing, and she has tried many conditioners.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Loved the conditioner as well as the other two products all together.</li>
            <li>and it just all washed right out.</li>
            <li>packaging though, and a good product...but just not right for me.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but I think it&#x27;s making my hair feel a bit better and less damaged.  </li>
            <li>There are similar options (Tresemme comes to mind) which are more economical and have similar good qualities for my particular type of hair.</li>
            <li>have not investigated the ethics of this company, I know many folks are concerned about this; it is, however, my understanding that Fekkai is owned by one of the giant corporations now, so it would be worth looking into.</li>
            <li>Like most Fekkai products, this is terrific and worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have natural blond hair that is baby fine</li>
            <li>It felt so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li>I am horrified at what she is willing to spend on products.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I buy too many books, but let&#x27;s not get too personal here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more, definitely!</li>
            <li>This one left my hair feeling hydrated, smooth, bouncy and full of life.  </li>
            <li>, it has worked best in a two stage way.&lt;br /&gt;Having read from another website that someone recommended a small amount of conditioner massaged into the hair ends PRIOR to washing and then repeating after shampoo application made her hair feel clean, but also it looked shiny and felt soft, even after blow</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t take a huge amount of product to coat my long, coarse hair, which I appreciate as far too many conditioners require me to use globs and globs of the stuff just to make sure my hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this conditioner would be too heavy for fine hair but would be very suitable for hair that is medium textured to coarse.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry hair and had not been able to find a conditioner (salon or drug store brand)</li>
            <li>It is very creamy.</li>

            <li>Her hair was very manageable after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>while I continue to buy second-hand and off-brand, not so much because I&#x27;m a cheapskate</li>
            <li>Much like the matching Shampoo</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or too often.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster and Thanks Fekkai&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, this fades within seconds of getting out of the shower, so I don&#x27;t mind it much.  </li>
            <li>Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products, so it&#x27;s not only the cheap stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is a very high-quality product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why my results differed from those many of the other reviewers</li>
            <li>Would not recommend its use for every shampoo follow up as it is rich and deeply conditions.    </li>
            <li>I generally find most shampoos/conditioners to be about the same.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li>It would have been better in one of those bottles that&#x27;s designed to sit upside down, or in a wide-necked jar.</li>
            <li>Would i buy it again, no I would not, simply because there are dozens out there doing the same or even better</li>
            <li>The main points that I need from a conditioner are softening, shine, and body retention along with control of frizziness.</li>
            <li>I have never spent that kind of money on cosmetics, shampoos, conditioners and products that just go down the drain.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t see any difference in performance of shampoos/conditioners that would merit the high prices of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Primarily it works well because it includes behentrimonium chloride, which is a more expensive and higher performing conditioning agent than the more common cetrimonium chloride which is used in most lower-end</li>
            <li>Fekkai is one of my favorite brands of specialty hair products, even when they were sold in little 4 ounce bottles.  </li>
            <li>, in the shower, it is a little overwhelming with the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no</li>
            <li>The only downsides for me are that my ends still seemed pretty dry and somehow more tangly and there are other salon brand conditioners that I just feel are better overall.</li>
            <li>Really conditions hair and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product-</li>
            <li>I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft but not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or weighed down like many conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has thick, dark hair, that can be a bit dry and these products leave it brilliantly shiny, smooth, and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m guessing this is an issue due to my scalp and others wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have the same issue), but it is pretty effective in keeping body and wave while smoothing flyaway hair and imparting softness.</li>
            <li>I have heavily highlighted medium length straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair does not seem to respond to a blow-dryer heat and round brush as easy as normally.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My hair looked very dried out when I finished drying it, but it did look nice when I fixed it the next morning</li>
            <li>, the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large.</li>
            <li>I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable, and didn&#x27;t feel waxy or residue-y/    </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, by far the biggest issue for me was the smell.  </li>
            <li>I tend to shower at a cooler temp, and my regular name brand conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft but frizzy.  </li>
            <li>After blowdrying and straightening, my hair was still so soft and controlled.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and manageable after applying.</li>
            <li>This buttery conditioner makes it feels soft.  </li>
            <li>Love the vanilla-almond scent and thick, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny, not remotely greasy, and looked nice whether blown dry or blown dry and straightened with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe salon stylists who say professional products sold at stores like Target have been watered down, but daughter tells me it&#x27;s true: the Fekkai conditioner from Target was watery.</li>
            <li>The product has a soft vanilla scent that is pleasant but subtle, so it won&#x27;t overpower any other scent you decide to apply.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the less-than-positive aspects of the product: it may have initially made my hair soft, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for tangles especially since after the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down or change my blonde color</li>
            <li>It has a subtle Vanilla scent that is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>That’s not typically the case.</li>
            <li>Mom, after all, is so cool, Daughter had little to oppose except Mom&#x27;s frugal habits.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and using this product has made it so much easier for me to comb out after shampooing and my hair does not get tangled,</li>
            <li>It pretty much lives up to the \\&quot;Moisture Protection, Lustrous Shine\\&quot; claimed on the bottle (although not sure how to judge moisture protection</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expecting to like this Conditioner, I was feeling very sorry for myself and my hair when this turned out not to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair that tends to look dull and damaged, but continued use of the conditioner and masque have restored my hair&#x27;s health and shine.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has some problems,  If I use a small amount or rinse too quickly, it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair soft and shiny all day long - which I admit surprised me.  </li>
            <li>- it did not dry out my hair, anyway).    </li>
            <li>but I found that I needed far less of it to condition my hair than I do normally.  </li>
            <li>Makes my somewhat over-bleached hair feel much softer and less &amp;#34;snappy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It spreads really well allowing you to cover a lot of your hair without having to use half the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my thin hair soft and full.</li>

            <li> at the legendary Fekkai</li>
            <li> Best price is AMAZON!</li>
            <li> and it is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Damaged hair</li>
            <li> It smells so delicious.</li>
            <li> As wonderful with damaged hair as the shampoo!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> excellent price for an excellent product</li>
            <li> Her hair looks beautiful and smells great though!</li>
            <li> good stuff!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a great scent and does a great job on my daughter&#x27;s medium-thickness hair.  </li>
            <li> Great conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smelled great, but just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to.</li>
            <li> I would happily purchase this again depending on the price.  </li>
            <li> I would pay up to about six dollars a bottle for it based off of what a great job it did on my hair.  </li>
            <li> it is great.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Have many Fekkai products that I believe are excellent.    </li>
            <li> As soon as i opened the top i smelled the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> of all, it has the most wonderful scent - vanilla bean !</li>
            <li> The both have a pleasant vanilla scent.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good conditioners.</li>
            <li> so good</li>
            <li> Good conditioner for damages hair.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I loved the vanilla scent but it ends up smelling like argan oil afterwards when your hair dries.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit of an indulgence; however, if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, it&#x27;s a good line of products to do that with.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like best about higher-end conditioners is that they&#x27;re more concentrated, more viscous, so that all of the conditioner ends up on your hair instead of dripping out of your hands on the way *to* your hair.</li>
            <li> They both have a very pleasant, mildly vanilla/coconut aroma.  </li>
            <li> love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai products for many years!  </li>
            <li> The smell and texture were both amazing.</li>
            <li> I can rave for pages on products that ARE AMAZING, this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, It really is an effective repair conditioner.</li>
            <li> thought this was a nice product that can be recommended for split and unruly ends.</li>
            <li> I will say that the scent of this conditioner is very nice, much better than most without being overbearing.</li>
            <li> but at any rate it is a light and pleasant scent, not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks off very easily, so I decided to try both the Fekkai Prx Shampoo and Conditioner together as a set to help the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This means that it breaks off very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is not a useless one, it is just lacking in anything that I would be delighted to rave about!</li>
            <li> Argan is one of the best natural products around.</li>
            <li> Will depend on your hair type, but for me (or rather my wife) this is so far an impressive hair care</li>
            <li> A little works great, rinses out easily, nice fragrance - and best of all it leaves your hair shiny and smooth without feeling weighed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> conditioner was very good at adding softness (textural quality was greatly improved by use of this product) and tamping down what I&#x27;d call the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> that I was totally satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I expect more from Fekkai and will not be getting any more.  </li>
            <li> It was okay on my hair, but for some reason it clogged my pipes.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner, LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li> My all time favorite was a Curly blend that I haven’t seen in years.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too.</li>
            <li> I used it and it helped give my hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again</li>
            <li> i love this stuff</li>
            <li> Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The conditioner smelled really good and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai brand &amp; am so happy that I&#x27;ve found it online for a more reasonable price. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite has turned out to be Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a LOT more of it than the Glossing conditioner to be able to get out my tangles.  </li>
            <li> frizziness that can happen around the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I think this product would suit people with shorter and coarser hair better than longer, softer hair.</li>
            <li> I love most of their products, but this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> She also blow drys her hair most of the time as it is quite long.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed this is warm water and then followed up with a cool rinse.</li>
            <li> Leaves my damaged and treated hair very sleek and smooth, which feels great.</li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite product!!</li>
            <li> leaves hair smooth and smelling fresh just like advertised, very good product and price on amazon much cheaper than drugstore prices</li>
            <li> Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with my conditioner and can tell immediately if it&#x27;s a good match for my hair.  </li>
            <li> They have a great scent, if not a little overpowering with the finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved it so much i&#x27;ve already purchased the full size!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d choose any of their other wonderful conditioners before this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to rinse off from hair and there was no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It was so strong that it gave me a headache each time I tried it</li>
            <li> It also tangles easily because it is fine.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with my fine hair</li>
            <li> - they work fine either way.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, this is not the product for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells</li>
            <li> It smoothed my highlighted fine hair immediately.</li>
            <li> and she said it felt very clean and full with body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one use, I noticed a huge difference in my daughter’s hair.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my hair was silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, it is a heavy formula -- if you have a lot of hair to control, this is a wonderful conditioner.</li>
            <li> it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to make your hair feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> After washing out, your hair still feels really smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this conditioner from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a complimentary sample of this product via infuenster and loved it immediately!  </li>
            <li> First, it has a light vanilla - almond fragrance … love the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and left my hair super smooth.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is rich and creamy, with a luxurious feel to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with this (hair still soft and</li>
            <li> (and I tried it multiple times so that I could be sure to review it as thoroughly and honestly as I could).  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and the conditioner both do what they&#x27;re supposed to do; my hair is softer and stays clean longer, now that I&#x27;ve switched to this.  </li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner, it has a relatively simple formulation and is not packed full of &#x27;buzzword filler&#x27; ingredients like many high end conditioners (ahem, Alterna)</li>
            <li> One can buy a large tube of Feria conditioner (called color moisturizing treatment on the package) for slightly more than 1/2 the price of this Fekkai conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper conditioners are often thinner and don&#x27;t always do a good job at preventing further damage.  </li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> For the conditioner, use a decent-sized amount and make sure you don&#x27;t rinse it out right away, and it will do exactly what you would expect a conditioner to do.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for the complimentary testing product!!</li>
            <li> have tried many, many different conditioners over the years.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is very thick and rich, the scent is light and pleasant, and my fair feels soft and manageable after using.  </li>
            <li> and I frankly have better luck finding what I want at used clothing stores than on the racks of new.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this Conditioner, a light slightly vanilla scent that lingers in the hair all day.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is a very rich conditioner that makes your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> She has curly hair that is fine in texture, but it is not thin.</li>
            <li> My hair was also very tangly after lightly towel drying it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, while it is worth the price</li>
            <li> The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Just be sure to really rinse it out thoroughly, and don&#x27;t use too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> wife has has perm treated hair, that tends to become greasy with too frequent washing, and she has tried many conditioners.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Loved the conditioner as well as the other two products all together.</li>
            <li> and it just all washed right out.</li>
            <li> packaging though, and a good product...but just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but I think it&#x27;s making my hair feel a bit better and less damaged.  </li>
            <li> There are similar options (Tresemme comes to mind) which are more economical and have similar good qualities for my particular type of hair.</li>
            <li> have not investigated the ethics of this company, I know many folks are concerned about this; it is, however, my understanding that Fekkai is owned by one of the giant corporations now, so it would be worth looking into.</li>
            <li> Like most Fekkai products, this is terrific and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have natural blond hair that is baby fine</li>
            <li> It felt so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> I am horrified at what she is willing to spend on products.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I buy too many books, but let&#x27;s not get too personal here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more, definitely!</li>
            <li> This one left my hair feeling hydrated, smooth, bouncy and full of life.  </li>
            <li> , it has worked best in a two stage way.&lt;br /&gt;Having read from another website that someone recommended a small amount of conditioner massaged into the hair ends PRIOR to washing and then repeating after shampoo application made her hair feel clean, but also it looked shiny and felt soft, even after blow</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t take a huge amount of product to coat my long, coarse hair, which I appreciate as far too many conditioners require me to use globs and globs of the stuff just to make sure my hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this conditioner would be too heavy for fine hair but would be very suitable for hair that is medium textured to coarse.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and had not been able to find a conditioner (salon or drug store brand)</li>

            <li> However, this fades within seconds of getting out of the shower, so I don&#x27;t mind it much.  </li>
            <li> Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products, so it&#x27;s not only the cheap stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is a very high-quality product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why my results differed from those many of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Would not recommend its use for every shampoo follow up as it is rich and deeply conditions.    </li>
            <li> I generally find most shampoos/conditioners to be about the same.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li> It would have been better in one of those bottles that&#x27;s designed to sit upside down, or in a wide-necked jar.</li>
            <li> Would i buy it again, no I would not, simply because there are dozens out there doing the same or even better</li>
            <li> The main points that I need from a conditioner are softening, shine, and body retention along with control of frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have never spent that kind of money on cosmetics, shampoos, conditioners and products that just go down the drain.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t see any difference in performance of shampoos/conditioners that would merit the high prices of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Primarily it works well because it includes behentrimonium chloride, which is a more expensive and higher performing conditioning agent than the more common cetrimonium chloride which is used in most lower-end</li>
            <li> Fekkai is one of my favorite brands of specialty hair products, even when they were sold in little 4 ounce bottles.  </li>
            <li> , in the shower, it is a little overwhelming with the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no</li>
            <li> The only downsides for me are that my ends still seemed pretty dry and somehow more tangly and there are other salon brand conditioners that I just feel are better overall.</li>
            <li> Really conditions hair and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product-</li>
            <li> I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft but not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or weighed down like many conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has thick, dark hair, that can be a bit dry and these products leave it brilliantly shiny, smooth, and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m guessing this is an issue due to my scalp and others wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have the same issue), but it is pretty effective in keeping body and wave while smoothing flyaway hair and imparting softness.</li>
            <li> I have heavily highlighted medium length straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not seem to respond to a blow-dryer heat and round brush as easy as normally.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My hair looked very dried out when I finished drying it, but it did look nice when I fixed it the next morning</li>
            <li> , the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large.</li>
            <li> I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable, and didn&#x27;t feel waxy or residue-y/    </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, by far the biggest issue for me was the smell.  </li>
            <li> I tend to shower at a cooler temp, and my regular name brand conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft but frizzy.  </li>
            <li> After blowdrying and straightening, my hair was still so soft and controlled.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft and manageable after applying.</li>
            <li> This buttery conditioner makes it feels soft.  </li>
            <li> Love the vanilla-almond scent and thick, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny, not remotely greasy, and looked nice whether blown dry or blown dry and straightened with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe salon stylists who say professional products sold at stores like Target have been watered down, but daughter tells me it&#x27;s true: the Fekkai conditioner from Target was watery.</li>
            <li> The product has a soft vanilla scent that is pleasant but subtle, so it won&#x27;t overpower any other scent you decide to apply.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the less-than-positive aspects of the product: it may have initially made my hair soft, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for tangles especially since after the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down or change my blonde color</li>
            <li> It has a subtle Vanilla scent that is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> That’s not typically the case.</li>
            <li> Mom, after all, is so cool, Daughter had little to oppose except Mom&#x27;s frugal habits.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and using this product has made it so much easier for me to comb out after shampooing and my hair does not get tangled,</li>
            <li> It pretty much lives up to the \\&quot;Moisture Protection, Lustrous Shine\\&quot; claimed on the bottle (although not sure how to judge moisture protection</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expecting to like this Conditioner, I was feeling very sorry for myself and my hair when this turned out not to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair that tends to look dull and damaged, but continued use of the conditioner and masque have restored my hair&#x27;s health and shine.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has some problems,  If I use a small amount or rinse too quickly, it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair soft and shiny all day long - which I admit surprised me.  </li>
            <li> - it did not dry out my hair, anyway).    </li>
            <li> but I found that I needed far less of it to condition my hair than I do normally.  </li>
            <li> Makes my somewhat over-bleached hair feel much softer and less &amp;#34;snappy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It spreads really well allowing you to cover a lot of your hair without having to use half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my thin hair soft and full.</li>
            <li> Finally a conditioner that is not going to make my hair go flat and oily!</li>
            <li> The only drawback was that since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, I only got 2 uses out of the sample they sent me.</li>
            <li> As a blonde, it stays in my hair even after a long time rinsing.</li>
            <li> On daily blow dry, flat ironed styling it does the damage control when used once a week.</li>
            <li> I use a wide toothcomb to pull the conditioner thru and bring it in briefly thru three quarters of my hair length, elminating roots as much as possible.    </li>
            <li> Both products are very concentrated and less is needed than typical shampoos or conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t add much shine, though it didn&#x27;t really dull my hair either.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that you only needed a small amount of conditioner for it to work.</li>
            <li> The product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since each person&#x27;s hair is different and products affect hair based on individual aspects, I will preface this review by saying my hair is very relatively soft, long, thick, wavy, and aging (I&#x27;m 49).</li>
            <li> I have to use deep conditioners several times a week, but I also have to be carefule what type I use so that it doesn&#x27;t look weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li> The smell stayed with me even after my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> My ends are usually really dry</li>
            <li> used it, too, but Mom uses hotel shampoo and conditioner and is nowhere near as discriminating as expensive daughter whose standards are so high, Mom wonders</li>
            <li> only (I apply to the bottom half of my hair) with no additional time frame needed.  </li>
            <li> Especially with such a thick product, this makes it hard to get the last dregs out, and at this price point, you definitely want all of it.</li>
            <li> However I found that it is harder to style your hair after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can justify spending this much on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> But if you used only a small amount with each use, and taking into consideration</li>
            <li> This item works well and, while it&#x27;s not in my usual budget, it&#x27;s definitely a product I&#x27;ll remember when I&#x27;m in the mood to splurge.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering it&#x27;s for damaged hair, I&#x27;d probably buy it again, but I&#x27;d switch off with other conditioners (says</li>
            <li> will also probably be getting her other products from Fekkai to try.</li>
            <li> of all, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is very rich and thick and only a very small amount is needed or it is difficult to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is easier to dispense than some bottles, thanks to the flip-cap, but it&#x27;s still thick and slow coming</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, dry hair</li>
            <li> Rating 3 1/2 stars, rounded down to 3 stars, mostly due to cost.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The rest of the bottoe was poured down the drain and the bottle was recycled.  </li>
            <li> this did not weigh my hair down whatsoever</li>
            <li> main negative aspect was that it left my scalp a bit itchy and it is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I spend less than that on books, and those don&#x27;t get rinsed down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe a half step down from salon conditioner.</li>
            <li> If I use too much or leave it on too long, It becomes very difficult to rinse out of my hair .  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is on par with the conditioners you would typically buy in a salon.  </li>
            <li> but with these results, and at a price I consider to be no where near as expensive as some other products, I expect to be asked to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it’s well worth the money for those that have tried endless products that fail to contain their frizzy, unhealthy looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell out of the bottle is nothing to write home about, but that matters little when a product works so well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a sample of Fekkai Prx Conditioner from Influenster.  I have extremely dry hair and had not been able to find a conditioner (salon or drug store brand) that I was totally satisfied with.  The Fekkai conditioner is thick and smells heavenly.  After rinsing, my hair was silky and smooth.  It worked!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner you can use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this stuff is expensive. I used it after bleaching my hair one day, and then toning my hair white the next. That being said, while it is worth the price I&#x27;m not sure I can justify spending this much on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> leaves hair smooth and smelling fresh just like advertised, very good product and price on amazon much cheaper than drugstore prices</li>
            <li> Love the vanilla-almond scent and thick, creamy consistency. Makes my somewhat over-bleached hair feel much softer and less &amp;#34;snappy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First, it has a light vanilla - almond fragrance … love the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, It really is an effective repair conditioner. On daily blow dry, flat ironed styling it does the damage control when used once a week. The results are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, just a dab is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-star good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of the conditioner. It is very creamy.</li>
            <li> Best product in their line!  Perfect for aging color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance to try FEKKAI PRX CONDITIONER 8 FL OZ. My daughter has thick, course, frizzy hair. We are always on the lookout for a product to help tame her uncontrollable hair. The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, I noticed a huge difference in my daughter’s hair. Wow! Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount. I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt. I too have frizzy, course hair, and the FEKKAI products made it as though I didn’t. Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell out of the bottle is nothing to write home about, but that matters little when a product works so well. I was surprised that you only needed a small amount of conditioner for it to work. That’s not typically the case. The shampoo lathers up, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large. But if you used only a small amount with each use, and taking into consideration how well it works, it’s well worth the money for those that have tried endless products that fail to contain their frizzy, unhealthy looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Infused with Argan extracts.&lt;br /&gt;•Scented by vanilla and crme.&lt;br /&gt;•Fortifying conditioner silkens, protects and infuses hair with movement.&lt;br /&gt;•Weak hair has the strength to resist future damage.&lt;br /&gt;•Tip from the Fekkai Salon: Concentrate conditioner on the ends of hair, avoiding the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;•Repair and protect hair daily with the effective care of PrX Reparatives Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;•Used at the legendary Fekkai Salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Warning&lt;br /&gt;Avoid contact with eyes.

            <li> Leaves my damaged and treated hair very sleek and smooth, which feels great. However I found that it is harder to style your hair after using this. Hair does not seem to respond to a blow-dryer heat and round brush as easy as normally.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, dry hair and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good conditioners. This item works well and, while it&#x27;s not in my usual budget, it&#x27;s definitely a product I&#x27;ll remember when I&#x27;m in the mood to splurge.    One of the things I like best about higher-end conditioners is that they&#x27;re more concentrated, more viscous, so that all of the conditioner ends up on your hair instead of dripping out of your hands on the way *to* your hair. This one is no exception. The upshot is that it goes farther than you might think. It made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable, and didn&#x27;t feel waxy or residue-y/    The product has a soft vanilla scent that is pleasant but subtle, so it won&#x27;t overpower any other scent you decide to apply.    ETA: Now that I&#x27;m getting to the bottom of the bottle, I&#x27;m finding it an annoying design flaw that the bottle does not sit upright when you turn it upside down. Especially with such a thick product, this makes it hard to get the last dregs out, and at this price point, you definitely want all of it. It would have been better in one of those bottles that&#x27;s designed to sit upside down, or in a wide-necked jar.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t take a huge amount of product to coat my long, coarse hair, which I appreciate as far too many conditioners require me to use globs and globs of the stuff just to make sure my hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the less-than-positive aspects of the product: it may have initially made my hair soft, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for tangles especially since after the first couple of uses, I noticed my hair started to look and feel increasingly drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, by far the biggest issue for me was the smell.  I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch, but the product didn&#x27;t have even a hint of the vanilla scent noted by other reviewers.  To me, this conditioner had a musty, floral odor that was just overpowering.  The smell stayed with me even after my hair was dry.  In fact, it stayed with me until the next time I washed my hair.  It was so strong that it gave me a headache each time I tried it (and I tried it multiple times so that I could be sure to review it as thoroughly and honestly as I could).  I simply couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why my results differed from those many of the other reviewers had, unless I really did somehow get a bad batch. At the end of the day, this conditioner just didn&#x27;t work for me on multiple levels.</li>
            <li> This is among one of the nicer conditioning products that  I have tried in the past year. While it is supposedly infused with Argsn Oil, I thought I picked up on a citrus/vanilla mix. The purpose of this conditioner is to work on split ends. Unfortunately my ends aren&#x27;t split but they can be a bit flyaway. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have this product fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken (split). I was hoping the ends would get tamed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this 5 days ago and have used it daily. Following instructions, I paid specific attention to distributing this on the ends of my hair and left it on for a couple of minutes. I rinsed this is warm water and then followed up with a cool rinse. My hair was shiny, not remotely greasy, and looked nice whether blown dry or blown dry and straightened with a flat iron. When doing the later my hair seemed fuller and had a lot of volume without additional product being used,&lt;br /&gt;What sold me on this is the addition of Argan Oil. Argan is one of the best natural products around. I use it cosmetically quite often and have even used it as a pre-conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was a nice product that can be recommended for split and unruly ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, so I had my daughter test out this product. She has curly hair that is fine in texture, but it is not thin. Her hair was almost sparkly when she went out in the sun because it was so shiny. It felt so smooth and soft and she said it felt very clean and full with body. Her hair was very manageable after using this conditioner. We would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has some problems,  If I use a small amount or rinse too quickly, it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything.  If I use too much or leave it on too long, It becomes very difficult to rinse out of my hair .  If I use it in the shower, it tends to stick to skin so getting it off of your skin becomes a chore.  I expect more from Fekkai and will not be getting any more.  The rest of the bottoe was poured down the drain and the bottle was recycled.  I do not recommend it to anyone at any time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a great scent and does a great job on my daughter&#x27;s medium-thickness hair.  I tried it with my fine hair and I was a frizz ball.  Her hair looks beautiful and smells great though!</li>
            <li> It was okay on my hair, but for some reason it clogged my pipes.  I tend to shower at a cooler temp, and my regular name brand conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging though, and a good product...but just not right for me.</li>
            <li> Our family has all tried this pricey conditioner, as well as its companion shampoo.  They both have a very pleasant, mildly vanilla/coconut aroma.  For the conditioner, use a decent-sized amount and make sure you don&#x27;t rinse it out right away, and it will do exactly what you would expect a conditioner to do.  These types of products always encourage you to use them with their companion product (the shampoo bottle suggest you use the Fekkai conditioner, etc.), and doing so seems to be helpful, especially in terms of the way your hair smells!  And, at the very least, my frizzies have been reduced...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not investigated the ethics of this company, I know many folks are concerned about this; it is, however, my understanding that Fekkai is owned by one of the giant corporations now, so it would be worth looking into. [Review also used for the shampoo]</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Fekkai products.  I used the shampoo and conditioner in the PrX Reparatives line.  Both products are very concentrated and less is needed than typical shampoos or conditioners.  The both have a pleasant vanilla scent.    The conditioner is similar to a lot of the silicone conditioners (reminds me of conditioners that come with hair coloring products like Colorsilk or Feria).  It is very rich and thick and only a very small amount is needed or it is difficult to rinse out.  It dispenses in a thick ribbon.  It pretty much lives up to the \\&quot;Moisture Protection, Lustrous Shine\\&quot; claimed on the bottle (although not sure how to judge moisture protection - it did not dry out my hair, anyway).    I have used the PrX shampoo and conditioner both separately and as a system - they work fine either way.  The price is very expensive (eighteen dollars for eight ounces) but very little product is needed for each condition, so it may not be too much worse of a value compared to standard salon brands.  One can buy a large tube of Feria conditioner (called color moisturizing treatment on the package) for slightly more than 1/2 the price of this Fekkai conditioner.  Rating 3 1/2 stars, rounded down to 3 stars, mostly due to cost.</li>
            <li> Like most Fekkai products, this is terrific and worth a try. A little works great, rinses out easily, nice fragrance - and best of all it leaves your hair shiny and smooth without feeling weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner, LOVE the smell.  Best price is AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe salon stylists who say professional products sold at stores like Target have been watered down, but daughter tells me it&#x27;s true: the Fekkai conditioner from Target was watery. This is not the watered-down stuff.  The conditioner is rich and creamy, with a luxurious feel to it. Really conditions hair and makes it soft. The smell is &amp;#34;okay, but not fantastic,&amp;#34; daughter says. The product goes a long way. Just be sure to really rinse it out thoroughly, and don&#x27;t use too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a nice, pleasing, calm shade of blue (says daughter). The conditioner is easier to dispense than some bottles, thanks to the flip-cap, but it&#x27;s still thick and slow coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering it&#x27;s for damaged hair, I&#x27;d probably buy it again, but I&#x27;d switch off with other conditioners (says daughter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom used it, too, but Mom uses hotel shampoo and conditioner and is nowhere near as discriminating as expensive daughter whose standards are so high, Mom wonders if it&#x27;s the one form of rebellion Dear Daughter can think of. Mom, after all, is so cool, Daughter had little to oppose except Mom&#x27;s frugal habits. Would I personally pay $20 for an 8-ounce bottle of shampoo for myself? Only if it was the last bottle on earth. I have never spent that kind of money on cosmetics, shampoos, conditioners and products that just go down the drain. Oh, I let Daughter indulge...while I continue to buy second-hand and off-brand, not so much because I&#x27;m a cheapskate but because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; thing to do and I frankly have better luck finding what I want at used clothing stores than on the racks of new. And I don&#x27;t see any difference in performance of shampoos/conditioners that would merit the high prices of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; products. Daughter might see a difference. I am horrified at what she is willing to spend on products. I spend less than that on books, and those don&#x27;t get rinsed down the drain. (Yes, I buy too many books, but let&#x27;s not get too personal here. I&#x27;m the mother! I rule whether anyone else acknowledges it or not!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is astronomical.&#x27;s not get too personal here. I&#x27;m the mother!

            <li> Just as the shampoo feels &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;  so does the conditioner.  If you have fine hair, this is not the product for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good though - but don&#x27;t be lulled in by the vanilla.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is one of my favorite brands of specialty hair products, even when they were sold in little 4 ounce bottles.  My all time favorite was a Curly blend that I haven’t seen in years.  I would have stocked up if I had known it was going to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expecting to like this Conditioner, I was feeling very sorry for myself and my hair when this turned out not to be very effective.  It was not a good detangler and it was not a good conditioner.  It made my hair soft but frizzy.  It was very sad.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from influenster complimentary and it is just wonderful. It made my hair feel softer and healthier than it has in years! Definitely will buy this line</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Smells great and left my hair super smooth. My ends are usually really dry and I usually have to put in a leave in conditioner and I didn&#x27;t have to do that after using the Fekkai Prx conditioner. I think I found my new favorite product!! Thanks to Influenster for the complimentary testing product!!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I followed up the shampoo with this conditioner and I don&#x27;t feel that it actually repaired my hair. I put it in and let it sit for a few minutes and it just all washed right out. It smelled great, but just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to.</li>
            <li> Much like the matching Shampoo I loved the smell of this Conditioner, a light slightly vanilla scent that lingers in the hair all day.  This conditioner left my hair soft and shiny all day long - which I admit surprised me.  I generally find most shampoos/conditioners to be about the same.  I would happily purchase this again depending on the price.  The bottle is small but I found that I needed far less of it to condition my hair than I do normally.  I would pay up to about six dollars a bottle for it based off of what a great job it did on my hair.  It&#x27;s maybe a half step down from salon conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner for damages hair. It smoothed my highlighted fine hair immediately. Like the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to rinse off from hair and there was no greasy residue. It also didn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down or change my blonde color (some brands do that).&lt;br /&gt;It says not to use it on the scalp, maybe because of argan oil content which can make hair look greasy?</li>
            <li> Have many Fekkai products that I believe are excellent.    This conditioner is one of them.    Would not recommend its use for every shampoo follow up as it is rich and deeply conditions.    Instructions advise to use on ends only (I apply to the bottom half of my hair) with no additional time frame needed.  Just comb thru the conditioner and rinse.    I have heavily highlighted medium length straight fine hair.  I use a wide toothcomb to pull the conditioner thru and bring it in briefly thru three quarters of my hair length, elminating roots as much as possible.    It appears that this product smoothes and softens without limpness.    Again, use as needed to complement your hair product regimen.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but I think it&#x27;s making my hair feel a bit better and less damaged.  \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. I constantly dye my hair so lots of conditioners are a must for me!! It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!! Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in my Influenster box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner! I have extremely thick, coarse hair. This product left my hair feeling SO soft. Like the shampoo, it is a heavy formula -- if you have a lot of hair to control, this is a wonderful conditioner. After blowdrying and straightening, my hair was still so soft and controlled. I will definitely be purchasing this to use in my regular hair routine.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well. It has a subtle vanilla scent- it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too. The only drawback was that since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, I only got 2 uses out of the sample they sent me. Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product- this did not weigh my hair down whatsoever it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change. I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair! It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> I received this in a VoxBox to review. I used it and it helped give my hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again (I used the reparative mask for my hair and the shampoo as well). Don&#x27;t use too much or too often. It was difficult to rinse out and my hair did feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; after so per instructions, I&#x27;d definitely mix up your hair care regime with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Received this product as a sample from Influenster to try along with the shampoo and mask. Loved the conditioner as well as the other two products all together. My hair felt so soft and manageable after applying. The smell and texture were both amazing. I will definitely be switching over to the Fekkai products for my hair routine.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;I received this hair conditioner as a testing product to try and give my personal opinion from Influenster. I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine. I usually just go with the damaged hair rather than the greasy, looking like i haven&#x27;t washed it hair. As soon as i opened the top i smelled the wonderful scent. i loved the smell. When i rinsed it out i could almost instantly tell tell it was not going to be greasy. i love this stuff it is great. Finally a conditioner that is not going to make my hair go flat and oily! Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34; Thanks Influenster and Thanks Fekkai&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smelled really good and fresh. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to make your hair feel smooth and hydrated. It spreads really well allowing you to cover a lot of your hair without having to use half the bottle.  After washing out, your hair still feels really smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. It smells so delicious. It has a subtle Vanilla scent that is not at all overwhelming. The conditioner makes my thin hair soft and full.</li>
            <li> As wonderful with damaged hair as the shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this conditioner from Influenster to try out. I like it. It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing, not watery and weak like some other conditioners. I loved the vanilla scent but it ends up smelling like argan oil afterwards when your hair dries.</li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai brand &amp; am so happy that I&#x27;ve found it online for a more reasonable price. :)</li>
            <li> This is a conditioner with no exceptional qualities. It is not a useless one, it is just lacking in anything that I would be delighted to rave about! Considering the hype on these Prx Fekkai products, i am not finding them anything to write home about. Would i buy it again, no I would not, simply because there are dozens out there doing the same or even better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the product suffice to say it is merely ordinary and there, is nothing wrong with that. I can rave for pages on products that ARE AMAZING, this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like foody smells in my toiletries (or candles, etc.) - I prefer florals.  But I picked this up with its shampoo because I needed something, and because reviews said it wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, in the shower, it is a little overwhelming with the vanilla smell.  However, this fades within seconds of getting out of the shower, so I don&#x27;t mind it much.  The shampoo and the conditioner both do what they&#x27;re supposed to do; my hair is softer and stays clean longer, now that I&#x27;ve switched to this.  I&#x27;ll buy more, definitely!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this Fekkai Prx conditioner alongside the Prx shampoo and finishing oil.  She has thick, dark hair, that can be a bit dry and these products leave it brilliantly shiny, smooth, and soft to the touch.  They have a great scent, if not a little overpowering with the finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price of this product, it&#x27;s a bit of an indulgence; however, if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, it&#x27;s a good line of products to do that with.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks off very easily, so I decided to try both the Fekkai Prx Shampoo and Conditioner together as a set to help the condition of my hair.  I have natural blond hair that is baby fine but I have a lot of it.  It has a texture that can sometimes almost be like bleached hair.  This means that it breaks off very easily.  It also tangles easily because it is fine.  I have to use deep conditioners several times a week, but I also have to be carefule what type I use so that it doesn&#x27;t look weighed down and greasy.  However, if I don&#x27;t use a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough conditioner, my hair is very tangly and looks dried out. Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products, so it&#x27;s not only the cheap stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many different conditioners over the years.  My favorite has turned out to be Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing Conditioner.  So that is the conditioner I compare others to.  I didn&#x27;t like the vanilla scent of this Prx conditioner.  I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  I had to use a LOT more of it than the Glossing conditioner to be able to get out my tangles.  I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower to comb through my conditioner.  I had a lot of trouble getting this combed through.  My hair was also very tangly after lightly towel drying it.  It just felt like I was breaking a lot of hair trying to comb it before using a hair dryer.  That would make me think that it definitely wouldn&#x27;t repair my hair as it is advertised to do, but it seems it would do quite the opposite.  My hair looked very dried out when I finished drying it, but it did look nice when I fixed it the next morning (I used extra hair oil when styling it).</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and damaged.  This buttery conditioner makes it feels soft.  It also smells like sugar cookies.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Since each person&#x27;s hair is different and products affect hair based on individual aspects, I will preface this review by saying my hair is very relatively soft, long, thick, wavy, and aging (I&#x27;m 49). The main points that I need from a conditioner are softening, shine, and body retention along with control of frizziness. I don&#x27;t need something that adds volume or body addition, but rather am looking at something which doesn&#x27;t suppress those characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner was very good at adding softness (textural quality was greatly improved by use of this product) and tamping down what I&#x27;d call the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; frizziness that can happen around the top of my head. It didn&#x27;t do so well at changing the frizz at the bottom of my hair or dealing with split ends. It also didn&#x27;t add much shine, though it didn&#x27;t really dull my hair either. I think this product would suit people with shorter and coarser hair better than longer, softer hair. It also did well for smoothing combing out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative aspect was that it left my scalp a bit itchy and it is quite expensive. There are similar options (Tresemme comes to mind) which are more economical and have similar good qualities for my particular type of hair. I will say that the scent of this conditioner is very nice, much better than most without being overbearing. All in all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go with this again because of the price and the itchiness it imparted (I&#x27;m guessing this is an issue due to my scalp and others wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have the same issue), but it is pretty effective in keeping body and wave while smoothing flyaway hair and imparting softness.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner, it has a relatively simple formulation and is not packed full of &#x27;buzzword filler&#x27; ingredients like many high end conditioners (ahem, Alterna) but it includes premium ingredients where it counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primarily it works well because it includes behentrimonium chloride, which is a more expensive and higher performing conditioning agent than the more common cetrimonium chloride which is used in most lower-end conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to describe, I guess I would say it is &#x27;beachy&#x27;.. but at any rate it is a light and pleasant scent, not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I confess to being a bit fussy about my conditioners - I typically only use salon conditioners because my hair can be a bit &amp;#34;temperamental&amp;#34;.  This conditioner is on par with the conditioners you would typically buy in a salon.  Cheaper conditioners are often thinner and don&#x27;t always do a good job at preventing further damage.  This conditioner is very thick and rich, the scent is light and pleasant, and my fair feels soft and manageable after using.  I have used this conditioner for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with this (hair still soft and no increase in split ends).  I think this conditioner would be too heavy for fine hair but would be very suitable for hair that is medium textured to coarse.  For reference, my hair is medium to thick, wavy, and damaged on the ends from heat styling and coloring.</li>
            <li> I love most of their products, but this is not my favorite.  I&#x27;d choose any of their other wonderful conditioners before this one.  As a blonde, it stays in my hair even after a long time rinsing.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. My hair is long and using this product has made it so much easier for me to comb out after shampooing and my hair does not get tangled,</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair that tends to look dull and damaged, but continued use of the conditioner and masque have restored my hair&#x27;s health and shine. My hairdresser was amazed with the results and started recommending it to her clients.  I started buying it when Bath and Body Works carried the product, then Ulta (my local store) dropped it too.  TRY this because I don&#x27;t want them to ever stop making it!  P.S. I don&#x27;t care for the shampoo and use John Frieda&#x27;s Blonde line instead.</li>
            <li> Will depend on your hair type, but for me (or rather my wife) this is so far an impressive hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has has perm treated hair, that tends to become greasy with too frequent washing, and she has tried many conditioners. She also blow drys her hair most of the time as it is quite long.&lt;br /&gt;Using this Fekkai and concentrating on the hair ends and tips, and NOT the scalp, it has worked best in a two stage way.&lt;br /&gt;Having read from another website that someone recommended a small amount of conditioner massaged into the hair ends PRIOR to washing and then repeating after shampoo application made her hair feel clean, but also it looked shiny and felt soft, even after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;As a guy of course I am skeptical about hair care products, but with these results, and at a price I consider to be no where near as expensive as some other products, I expect to be asked to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I will also probably be getting her other products from Fekkai to try.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It leaves my hair soft but not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or weighed down like many conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it has the most wonderful scent - vanilla bean ! I had a couple people actually ask me what I used because it smelled so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this now for a few weeks and it is my favorite conditioner.  I will have to buy their shampoo as well.  And&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best of all, a little goes a long way! It is a very high-quality product.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> excellent price for an excellent product</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing!  Also, it is a very rich conditioner that makes your hair very soft.  Overall, I really liked it.  The only downsides for me are that my ends still seemed pretty dry and somehow more tangly and there are other salon brand conditioners that I just feel are better overall.</li>
            <li> Not bad but I think I&#x27;ll stick to my Chi products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai products for many years!  I was recently given a complimentary sample of this product via infuenster and loved it immediately!  I&#x27;m very picky with my conditioner and can tell immediately if it&#x27;s a good match for my hair.  This one left my hair feeling hydrated, smooth, bouncy and full of life.  I loved it so much i&#x27;ve already purchased the full size! Obsessed!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Took away my flyaways!</li>
