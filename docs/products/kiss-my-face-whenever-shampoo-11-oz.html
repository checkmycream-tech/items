            <li>I have been using this for years and my hair dresser keeps asking me what I use to keep my hair so nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked what I read and decided to give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li>did not purchase the conditioner, as I have magical hair that hates conditioner, but the reviews on that seem quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>And, as we all know, the ladies love a guy who smells good.</li>
            <li>The light smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li>My Face shampoo is a pretty good find!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo arrived fairly quickly and OMG it smells so sweet and delicious!!</li>
            <li>the best part about it is it is cruelty free and made with organic ingredients its very light weight and leaves my hair feeling light, very clean and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is natural and organic and it&#x27;s great for your hair !</li>
            <li>Another shampoo you might want to check out that is also wonderful and all natural is NaturOli.  </li>
            <li>Upon the first use, I noticed a wonderful clean and citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Whatever I do to it, it still looks great and not brittle from the hot iron.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a great price for an organic shampoo, so check one in favor.&lt;br /&gt;Second,</li>
            <li>Sounds almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo...</li>
            <li>I know that most organic shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather...</li>
            <li>and this one i have bought many times.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s a magic miracle</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and more manageable and it has a shine that I never noticed before.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed using this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great and feel great, it also makes my hair smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>I found that JASON sells a better tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li>So, I went on a quest for a decent shampoo for my hair that was healthy to the body; the environment and animals, that would also be affordable, and I&#x27;m happy to say that this Kiss</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and leaves my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle for the first time, I loved the scent.</li>
            <li>This smells great and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>i very rarely buy a shampoo brand more than once.</li>
            <li>This stuff is safe and environment friendly.</li>
            <li>Now I can comb through it easily after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this shampoo, I used to use a whole bunch of products for 1 wash, now I absolutely love the results with just this shampoo,  </li>
            <li>I switched all of my products over to more natural ones and have loved this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t have damaged hair from coloring and styling it, it&#x27;d prob be fine.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to finally be able to find a good shampoo that does not contain the toxic ingredient called, propolyne glycol, which is readily absorable into the human skin and causes major cell structure problems,as well as breast cancer and tumors.</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo because it is paraben free and organic.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can get it (today) on Amazon, tax free, AND free shipping, delivered right to your home is just another reason I love Amazon, and will do so when I am out.</li>
            <li>and it smells so FRESH!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great shampoo but the texture and because it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; up on hair you have to add more than regular to get it going.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean without an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  </li>
            <li>but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine)..</li>
            <li>and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  </li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely pair it with the conditioner. :)</li>
            <li>a side point- as I have a mild bacne issue</li>
            <li>So far I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like the old formula way better</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband, he wanted a more natural, non-drying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it was so much softer &amp; felt healthy, unlike most shampoos, which strip my hair &amp; leave it super dry.</li>
            <li>I have very fine Asian thin hair &amp; because it&#x27;s summer I&#x27;ve been swimming a lot more, but the chlorine does a great deal of damage on my hair.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time, and it has a nice lather, fresh, natural smell, feels squeaky clean, and my hair dried nicely with shine and manageability and no frizz</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from bleaching it in the past and it&#x27;s important for me to use the best, highest quality ingredients to protect it from further damage and repair it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is natural and organic and it&#x27;s great for any type of hair, It leaves a real shiny look to it, you don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner, It also has a nice natural smile to it which I love, I&#x27;ve used many of shampoo&#x27;s in the past, and hands down</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give you the soft, relaxed feeling that the many positive reviews have suggested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with shampoo because my hair tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li>Pretty great - gentle enough to use as often as you desire, it will keep your hair looking lustrous and never dry!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two years now, it is natural and it does a fine job.</li>
            <li>No awful smells, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to give it a try first</li>
            <li>, I know I will have to trim the ends that are just so severely burnt and chemically damaged, but this shampoo left my hair a lot more manageable and shinier than it ever has been.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely keeping the damage at bay way better than anything else</li>
            <li>First, you need to put A-LOT of this shampoo on your hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li>I finally found a shampoo that I can feel confident using and knowing that it isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>i will be purchasing this product in the future for sure</li>
            <li>but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh feeling of my hair after a long day!</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and be little generous, it&#x27;s a pretty fine and healthy hair, one that has never been chemically-treated.</li>
            <li>straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature..</li>
            <li>It feels soft and clean and I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo is free of harsh sulfates and preservatives, allowing your hair to receive the healthy benefits of moisturizers and therapeutic organic compounds.</li>
            <li>Then other times, you know right away that you love something</li>
            <li>My hair feels, smells and looks better than it has in a very long time.</li>
            <li>and we all really like it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; in soften your hair or anything.</li>
            <li>just so i&#x27;d have something to wash my hair with until i thought i&#x27;d have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted....</li>
            <li>It left my hair smelling great after I dried off and through the whole day</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural shampoo product that leaves my hair clean and fairly soft that I don&#x27;t need to follow with a conditioner, because I don&#x27;t want to add to my scalp problem.</li>
            <li>It gets more shiny , the quality of your hair is better and you don&#x27;t even have to use the conditioner , and I mean it , my hair is very hard to manage without conditioner , but with this one, my hair is much, much better!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something all natural, and this very much fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, the first bottle I bought was their old formula, the one without Moroccan argan oil, and</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a low-priced, high quality product for a while now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever feel that it&#x27;s too dry or completely strip me of my natural oils my hair needs to be healthy.</li>
            <li>In this case however, I was very pleasantly surprised as this shampoo really has held up to the claims.</li>
            <li>(Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)...</li>
            <li>(Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been needing a new shampoo &amp; saw this on clearance and thought why not.</li>
            <li>the second one was their new formula since that was the only one available.</li>
            <li>I felt as though it did not strip my hair of natural oils, just the normal dirt/sweat/grease that happens to build up through a normal day of work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a religious hair straightener as well, so the damage to my hair is very real.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different all natural, chemical free shampoos now, but they all have left my hair super dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to brush and extremely shiney!</li>
            <li>Based on the product picture I assumed I would get the old shampoo, but I received the new formula shampoo instead.</li>
            <li>Good thing is at least, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B004XF0BPC Wheat Germ Oil - 100% Pure and Organic 8 Oz]] actually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature...</li>
            <li>My hair is also naturally curly</li>
            <li>All natural and no harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo for the reason that it is a natural shampoo with none of the chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>It was not weak but definitely not overpowering.</li>
            <li>so it is dry as well, and the only way to smooth it out is by straightening it with the blower and flat iron,</li>
            <li>but I have to use SO much conditioner to help with how dry and tangly it gets.  </li>
            <li>all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking...</li>
            <li>all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking...</li>
            <li>The other times I bought this at Whole Foods, but I ordered online this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NOT DRY</li>
            <li>other shampoos irritate me, mainly b/c of their harmful ingredients I suppose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, apart from it being a natural product and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair,</li>
            <li>thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  </li>

            <li> My hair is very damaged from bleaching it in the past and it&#x27;s important for me to use the best, highest quality ingredients to protect it from further damage and repair it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is natural and organic and it&#x27;s great for any type of hair, It leaves a real shiny look to it, you don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner, It also has a nice natural smile to it which I love, I&#x27;ve used many of shampoo&#x27;s in the past, and hands down</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give you the soft, relaxed feeling that the many positive reviews have suggested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with shampoo because my hair tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li> Pretty great - gentle enough to use as often as you desire, it will keep your hair looking lustrous and never dry!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two years now, it is natural and it does a fine job.</li>
            <li> No awful smells, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to give it a try first</li>
            <li> , I know I will have to trim the ends that are just so severely burnt and chemically damaged, but this shampoo left my hair a lot more manageable and shinier than it ever has been.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely keeping the damage at bay way better than anything else</li>
            <li> First, you need to put A-LOT of this shampoo on your hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> I finally found a shampoo that I can feel confident using and knowing that it isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> i will be purchasing this product in the future for sure</li>
            <li> but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it</li>
            <li> and I love the fresh feeling of my hair after a long day!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and be little generous, it&#x27;s a pretty fine and healthy hair, one that has never been chemically-treated.</li>
            <li> straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature..</li>
            <li> It feels soft and clean and I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> Whenever Shampoo is free of harsh sulfates and preservatives, allowing your hair to receive the healthy benefits of moisturizers and therapeutic organic compounds.</li>
            <li> Then other times, you know right away that you love something</li>
            <li> My hair feels, smells and looks better than it has in a very long time.</li>
            <li> and we all really like it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; in soften your hair or anything.</li>
            <li> just so i&#x27;d have something to wash my hair with until i thought i&#x27;d have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted....</li>
            <li> It left my hair smelling great after I dried off and through the whole day</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural shampoo product that leaves my hair clean and fairly soft that I don&#x27;t need to follow with a conditioner, because I don&#x27;t want to add to my scalp problem.</li>
            <li> It gets more shiny , the quality of your hair is better and you don&#x27;t even have to use the conditioner , and I mean it , my hair is very hard to manage without conditioner , but with this one, my hair is much, much better!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something all natural, and this very much fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, the first bottle I bought was their old formula, the one without Moroccan argan oil, and</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a low-priced, high quality product for a while now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever feel that it&#x27;s too dry or completely strip me of my natural oils my hair needs to be healthy.</li>
            <li> In this case however, I was very pleasantly surprised as this shampoo really has held up to the claims.</li>
            <li> (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)...</li>
            <li> (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new shampoo &amp; saw this on clearance and thought why not.</li>
            <li> the second one was their new formula since that was the only one available.</li>
            <li> I felt as though it did not strip my hair of natural oils, just the normal dirt/sweat/grease that happens to build up through a normal day of work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a religious hair straightener as well, so the damage to my hair is very real.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different all natural, chemical free shampoos now, but they all have left my hair super dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to brush and extremely shiney!</li>
            <li> Based on the product picture I assumed I would get the old shampoo, but I received the new formula shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> Good thing is at least, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004XF0BPC Wheat Germ Oil - 100% Pure and Organic 8 Oz]] actually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature...</li>
            <li> My hair is also naturally curly</li>
            <li> All natural and no harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for the reason that it is a natural shampoo with none of the chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> It was not weak but definitely not overpowering.</li>
            <li> so it is dry as well, and the only way to smooth it out is by straightening it with the blower and flat iron,</li>
            <li> but I have to use SO much conditioner to help with how dry and tangly it gets.  </li>
            <li> all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking...</li>
            <li> all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking...</li>
            <li> The other times I bought this at Whole Foods, but I ordered online this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT DRY</li>
            <li> other shampoos irritate me, mainly b/c of their harmful ingredients I suppose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, apart from it being a natural product and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair,</li>
            <li> thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  </li>
            <li> The product is not too thick and not too runny, just right for getting the correct amount in your hand.</li>
            <li> i was a little worried, because it didn&#x27;t lather much, like other shampoos do, but i noticed a major difference in how my hair felt as soon as i rinsed the shampoo out of my hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; i recommended it, especially for those with dry damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> or my hair was a wild, frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthy</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my scalp in any way.</li>
            <li> See some people saying it leaves their hair dry...  </li>
            <li> when i got it i thought it might dry my hair out because of the citrus in it</li>
            <li> but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol</li>
            <li> alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off...</li>
            <li> but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol</li>
            <li> alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off...</li>
            <li> straight... thin in the front... grows a lil thicker in the middle with baby hair on my neck... but gets frizzy sometimes...</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, as it doesn&#x27;t really lather that much, but after I dried off my hair, I saw that it worked!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have super dry hair, &amp; i was skeptical about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, switching to a natural product, I would have at least expect this product to leave my hair softer than before I wash it.</li>
            <li> Whenever Shampoo will now be my regular everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less split ends in even just the short amount of time since I started using this shampoo, which has been a big problem for me with shampoos in the past.</li>
            <li> will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it...</li>
            <li> will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review a product like shampoo because everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
            <li> So, when someone says that the shampoo was too drying for their hair, it&#x27;s hard to take that as necessarily fully the fault of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and although I love the color I hate what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a jell with a slight herbal fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I had to run out to the grocery store for a few things and while I was there, I picked up this shampoo instead or ordering it.</li>
            <li> It really dried out my hair and made my scalf itchy.  </li>
            <li> nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)...</li>
            <li> Theres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)...</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this off and on for the past few years</li>
            <li> and this lasts me from work in the morning to a dinner out in the late evenings without looking weighed down throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after using it that it works well against hair styling products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I usually buy moroccan argan oil separate, but the shampoo has the oil in it, without leaving oil residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> Almost all of our foods and cosmetics and toiletries contains propolyne glycol, and the manufactureres know about the recent research on this toxic substance, and the facts of ill health it causes, as well as eventual death.</li>
            <li> But, apparently, in reading the reviews on THAT website, over 140 people are crazy about it, too.  </li>
            <li> A LIL DULL (without oil after) BUT</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d been using the same shampoo for over 15 years until they stopped making it (creme of nature - orginal version)... pissed me off because i&#x27;m crazy picky about what i use on my skin and hair...</li>
            <li> i have been trying to find \\&quot;the perfect\\&quot; shampoo for years, and everytime i try a new one i am disappointed</li>
            <li> I find it very hard on your hair.</li>
            <li> i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad</li>
            <li> i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad</li>

            <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo at all.  </li>
            <li> crazy shiney...</li>
            <li> the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthyn it</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me Kiss My Face shampoo is a 5 star product. It&#x27;s a jell with a slight herbal fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger. It cleans my hair, and leaves no residue. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my scalp in any way.</li>
            <li> I had to run out to the grocery store for a few things and while I was there, I picked up this shampoo instead or ordering it. I decided I wanted to give it a try first and then next time will get it from Amazon, if I like it.  Shampoos are just such a personal thing, ya know? It&#x27;s hard to review a product like shampoo because everybody&#x27;s hair is different. And so is their diet, their habits, their shower water; their environment; their health; medications they are on, and the list goes on and on.   So, when someone says that the shampoo was too drying for their hair, it&#x27;s hard to take that as necessarily fully the fault of the shampoo.  Then other times, you know right away that you love something and so do dozens of others. I have a shampoo in mind that I tried as a sample and went nuts over it. I researched it only to find that it&#x27;s not in my budget, let alone the shipping cost! So, it will remain a &#x27;wish&#x27; for sometime..But, apparently, in reading the reviews on THAT website, over 140 people are crazy about it, too.  So, I went on a quest for a decent shampoo for my hair that was healthy to the body; the environment and animals, that would also be affordable, and I&#x27;m happy to say that this Kiss My Face shampoo is a pretty good find!  I just used it for the first time, and it has a nice lather, fresh, natural smell, feels squeaky clean, and my hair dried nicely with shine and manageability and no frizz (the air is not humid today).  The fact that you can get it (today) on Amazon, tax free, AND free shipping, delivered right to your home is just another reason I love Amazon, and will do so when I am out. I think it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo...it makes my hair feel great and the ingredients are even better. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> So far I love this shampoo.  Leaves my hair feeling clean without an itchy scalp. other shampoos irritate me, mainly b/c of their harmful ingredients I suppose. This stuff is safe and environment friendly. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different all natural, chemical free shampoos now, but they all have left my hair super dry and tangled. I know that most organic shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather...and that&#x27;s fine...but I have to use SO much conditioner to help with how dry and tangly it gets.  My search continues for a non-toxic shampoo that cleans without drying out.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo i keep going back to. i have been trying to find \\&quot;the perfect\\&quot; shampoo for years, and everytime i try a new one i am disappointed and this is the one i keep coming back to so it is the best one i have ever tried. i very rarely buy a shampoo brand more than once. and this one i have bought many times. the best part about it is it is cruelty free and made with organic ingredients its very light weight and leaves my hair feeling light, very clean and leaves no residue. and it smells so FRESH!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is natural and organic and it&#x27;s great for your hair ! It gets more shiny , the quality of your hair is better and you don&#x27;t even have to use the conditioner , and I mean it , my hair is very hard to manage without conditioner , but with this one, my hair is much, much better!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on a recommendation , as I have been looking for some sort of salvage for my hair.  I have been dying it for 30+ years and although I love the color I hate what it does to my hair. I tried the no poo method which did not work for me.  I have been looking for something all natural, and this very much fits the bill.  My hair is also naturally curly so it is dry as well, and the only way to smooth it out is by straightening it with the blower and flat iron, so now it is heat fried too.  I sorely needed help!  The shampoo arrived fairly quickly and OMG it smells so sweet and delicious!! Couldn&#x27;t wait to use it on that alone!  I can&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s a magic miracle, I know I will have to trim the ends that are just so severely burnt and chemically damaged, but this shampoo left my hair a lot more manageable and shinier than it ever has been.  It is definitely keeping the damage at bay way better than anything else had.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this off and on for the past few years and we all really like it. In our case, it is a matter of finding it locally or buying it online. We would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural shampoo product that leaves my hair clean and fairly soft that I don&#x27;t need to follow with a conditioner, because I don&#x27;t want to add to my scalp problem. I have relaxed hair and be little generous, it&#x27;s a pretty fine and healthy hair, one that has never been chemically-treated. I don&#x27;t even straighten my hair or anything. So, switching to a natural product, I would have at least expect this product to leave my hair softer than before I wash it. But sadly, it doesn&#x27;t turn out that way. First, you need to put A-LOT of this shampoo on your hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather well. Also, it doesn&#x27;t exactly give you the soft, relaxed feeling that the many positive reviews have suggested. Good thing is at least, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, apart from it being a natural product and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; in soften your hair or anything. Bear in my mind that I tried this product out WITHOUT the conditioner, so just some info for you folks.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair too coarse after washing. But if you don&#x27;t have damaged hair from coloring and styling it, it&#x27;d prob be fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and my hair dresser keeps asking me what I use to keep my hair so nice.  Great shampoo and awesome price Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. No awful smells, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Whenever Shampoo is free of harsh sulfates and preservatives, allowing your hair to receive the healthy benefits of moisturizers and therapeutic organic compounds. The delicious smell makes you wish you could eat it too! Kiss My face - Whenever Shampoo is one of the healthiest shampoos you will find on the market!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is AMAZING!!!   All natural and no harsh chemicals in it. When using this shampoo you don&#x27;t even need conditioner.  Just buy it already!  Another shampoo you might want to check out that is also wonderful and all natural is NaturOli.  Just search for it in amazon in All Departments.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo because it is paraben free and organic. My hair is very damaged from bleaching it in the past and it&#x27;s important for me to use the best, highest quality ingredients to protect it from further damage and repair it. When I opened the bottle for the first time, I loved the scent. It was not weak but definitely not overpowering. My hair smells amazing after using this shampoo. I also feel a difference in my hair. It feels soft and clean and I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner if I don&#x27;t want to. Using conditioner was never an option before, I had no choice but to use it or my hair was a wild, frizzy mess. Now I can comb through it easily after shampooing. My hair is softer and more manageable and it has a shine that I never noticed before. Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo will now be my regular everyday shampoo. I finally found a shampoo that I can feel confident using and knowing that it isn&#x27;t damaging my hair. My hair feels, smells and looks better than it has in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for the reason that it is a natural shampoo with none of the chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce. It has a nice smell and leaves my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is natural and organic and it&#x27;s great for any type of hair, It leaves a real shiny look to it, you don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner, It also has a nice natural smile to it which I love, I&#x27;ve used many of shampoo&#x27;s in the past, and hands down this is the best I ever used, I would defintely recommend this to anyone, my hair feels much better and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product, great smell, leaves no residue Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my hair very soft. Best of all is that I haven&#x27;t had an itchy scalp after using it. I use it with the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo, I used to use a whole bunch of products for 1 wash, now I absolutely love the results with just this shampoo,  and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two years now, it is natural and it does a fine job. I just finished my second bottle of this stuff and the one I just ordered and received from Amazon is my third bottle. The other times I bought this at Whole Foods, but I ordered online this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the first bottle I bought was their old formula, the one without Moroccan argan oil, and the second one was their new formula since that was the only one available. I like the old formula way better which is why I searched for it on Amazon. Based on the product picture I assumed I would get the old shampoo, but I received the new formula shampoo instead. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo at all.  It really dried out my hair and made my scalf itchy.  The conditioner from the same line didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> i have super dry hair, &amp; i was skeptical about this shampoo. i saw great reviews on it, all of which were 5 stars, so i decided to give it a shot, &amp; i&#x27;m so glad i did! i was a little worried, because it didn&#x27;t lather much, like other shampoos do, but i noticed a major difference in how my hair felt as soon as i rinsed the shampoo out of my hair. it was so much softer &amp; felt healthy, unlike most shampoos, which strip my hair &amp; leave it super dry. it smells great too! i will be purchasing this product in the future for sure &amp; i recommended it, especially for those with dry damaged hair like mine. you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Winner! I love this shampoo and it lathers so nicely!!!! Awesome shampoo and my hair feels amazing after I wash it. Soft, easy to brush and extremely shiney! I use the whenever conditioner too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got mixed hair texture.... straight... thin in the front... grows a lil thicker in the middle with baby hair on my neck... but gets frizzy sometimes... i&#x27;d been using the same shampoo for over 15 years until they stopped making it (creme of nature - orginal version)... pissed me off because i&#x27;m crazy picky about what i use on my skin and hair... theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  bought this just so i&#x27;d have something to wash my hair with until i thought i&#x27;d have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted.... but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it... didnt have to go looking for anything else... this plus organic wheat germ oil i bought on here [[ASIN:B004XF0BPC Wheat Germ Oil - 100% Pure and Organic 8 Oz]] actually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature... i just wash it with this shampoo.. leave a lil in my hair like a conditioner and add a lil organic wheat germ oil and my hair looks like salon hair.. crazy shiney... straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature.. this shampoo probably makes any texture hair look good but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine).. smells good too.. just like limes... not like a stinky perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE A LIL DULL (without oil after) BUT NOT DRY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I See some people saying it leaves their hair dry...  if that happens just use hair oil after.. it&#x27;ll leave it shiney ... i never used this shampoo without rubbing a lil wheat germ oil on my hair after.. and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  plus i leave a lil of this in my hair like a leave in conditioner which probably helps it shine... when i got it i thought it might dry my hair out because of the citrus in it but it turned out shiney with the oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has 2 alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthyn it but it turned out shiney with the oil  Theres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has 2 alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hair  With this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new shampoo &amp; saw this on clearance and thought why not. I have very fine Asian thin hair &amp; because it&#x27;s summer I&#x27;ve been swimming a lot more, but the chlorine does a great deal of damage on my hair. I usually buy moroccan argan oil separate, but the shampoo has the oil in it, without leaving oil residue on my hair. I&#x27;m very picky with shampoo because my hair tends to get oily quickly and this lasts me from work in the morning to a dinner out in the late evenings without looking weighed down throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after using it that it works well against hair styling products. I&#x27;m a religious hair straightener as well, so the damage to my hair is very real. Whatever I do to it, it still looks great and not brittle from the hot iron. It smells great and I love the fresh feeling of my hair after a long day! I don&#x27;t ever feel that it&#x27;s too dry or completely strip me of my natural oils my hair needs to be healthy. I love it and would definitely pair it with the conditioner. :)</li>
            <li> I find it very hard on your hair. I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and shampoo. I can always count on this brand and feel good about using it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product before, until I was hunting for organic shampoo on Amazon.com and I stopped to read the ingredients. I liked what I read and decided to give this shampoo a try. I am very happy to finally be able to find a good shampoo that does not contain the toxic ingredient called, propolyne glycol, which is readily absorable into the human skin and causes major cell structure problems,as well as breast cancer and tumors. Almost all of our foods and cosmetics and toiletries contains propolyne glycol, and the manufactureres know about the recent research on this toxic substance, and the facts of ill health it causes, as well as eventual death. This shampoo is free of glycol, and doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum either, so I am very happy to be using this on my skin. I will be ordering this again. The light smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> I switched all of my products over to more natural ones and have loved this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband, he wanted a more natural, non-drying shampoo.  This pleases him as he can shampoo as often as he cares to.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a great price for an organic shampoo, so check one in favor.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Third, it actually works. I was a bit skeptical, as it doesn&#x27;t really lather that much, but after I dried off my hair, I saw that it worked!&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase the conditioner, as I have magical hair that hates conditioner, but the reviews on that seem quite good as well.&lt;br /&gt;For a side point- as I have a mild bacne issue, I&#x27;m hoping that this may help deal with that, as it doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals that irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Pretty great - gentle enough to use as often as you desire, it will keep your hair looking lustrous and never dry!! Extra benefits are... It&#x27;s organic!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a low-priced, high quality product for a while now and I came across this brand because of a friend&#x27;s recommendation. Upon the first use, I noticed a wonderful clean and citrus smell. The product is not too thick and not too runny, just right for getting the correct amount in your hand. I thoroughly enjoyed using this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smelled great&lt;br /&gt;2. It cleaned my oily hair&lt;br /&gt;3. It left my hair smelling great after I dried off and through the whole day&lt;br /&gt;4. I felt as though it did not strip my hair of natural oils, just the normal dirt/sweat/grease that happens to build up through a normal day of work&lt;br /&gt;5. Quality ingredients that do not cause dandruff</li>
            <li> Silky-soft, shiny and manageable? Sounds almost too good to be true. In this case however, I was very pleasantly surprised as this shampoo really has held up to the claims. I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less split ends in even just the short amount of time since I started using this shampoo, which has been a big problem for me with shampoos in the past. It also just makes my scalp feel great after I shower, which is always a nice way to start the day. Not only does it work great and feel great, it also makes my hair smell fantastic. And, as we all know, the ladies love a guy who smells good.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great shampoo but the texture and because it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; up on hair you have to add more than regular to get it going.  I found that JASON sells a better tea tree shampoo.</li>
