            <li>great for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for fine or thinning hair, makes your hair feel fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>I think we will try it for another year, then switch to something else if we still don&#x27;t have good results.</li>

            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love everyone of these products.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY mouses, spray in conditioners, etc.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shinier and appear to have more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this for my fiance, along with the shampoo and conditioner, as he become more and more self-conscious about his receding hairline.  </li>
            <li>I made a mistake and bought the colored one but its fine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help super fine.</li>
            <li>however, there haven&#x27;t been any significant changes.  </li>
            <li>Really hoping to be able to upgrade this to five stars.</li>
            <li>Have used a log of different products, this one seems to do better than most.</li>
            <li>Could be that its made for color treated hair and the extra conditioning would be needed, but I liked the old formula better.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend these products!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on my thin, lifeless hair and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t do much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li>I reevaluate after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It really works well</li>
            <li>This is a new product for me</li>
            <li>This also smells EXACTLY THE SAME as the Caviar Root Stimulator from Sephora, for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair looks alive.</li>
            <li>Using it for some time but not yet seen any result so far.</li>

            <li> This does make my hair feel thicker and also smoother as well. This also smells EXACTLY THE SAME as the Caviar Root Stimulator from Sephora, for a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s a great dupe. I spray this at the roots and also strands on my damp hair after washing.</li>
            <li> Have used a log of different products, this one seems to do better than most. My hair felt noticeably thicker after using it.</li>
            <li> Great product n order processed timely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on my thin, lifeless hair and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  I just love it.  It gives body and shine without weighing the hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Love everyone of these products.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. I&#x27;m very happy with all Bosley products and will always use them. I very highly recommend these products!  Just remember that you have to give it time to work...nothing happens overnight. 6 to 8 weeks and you will see a difference!</li>
            <li> The bottle sprayer I received failed to work early on. The product didn&#x27;t do much to thicken my hair.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cannot speak as to whether it helps hair grow since I have only been using it a week or so. I have tried MANY mouses, spray in conditioners, etc. this is one of my favorites. It makes my hair shinier and appear to have more volume.&lt;br /&gt;If I see any additional results I will update my posting.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have been using it for a long time.  It makes my hair looks alive.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky. My hair definitely looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Works well and I like it.  I made a mistake and bought the colored one but its fine.</li>
            <li> Thickens hair nicely and makes it easy to style. Bosley products all work as they describe. I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help super fine.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my thin lifeless hair. I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years, now. Also serves as a de-tangler.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance, along with the shampoo and conditioner, as he become more and more self-conscious about his receding hairline.  He has been on the Bosley system for a year.  After the first couple of months we saw some little baby hairs growing, and the system does seem to thicken hair slightly... however, there haven&#x27;t been any significant changes.  I think we will try it for another year, then switch to something else if we still don&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use the Bosley shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair and the conditioner is awful (more like a cream rinse) and I needed an product to beat tangles and this does the job and makes my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> great for thicker hair. worked in a months time to thicken my hair. will purchase again. also used the shampoo and conditioner. excellent product to grow and strenghten hair.</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me and I love it! It leaves my hair looking fuller and thicker! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Using it for some time but not yet seen any result so far. Yes, no further decrease.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for fine or thinning hair, makes your hair feel fuller and thicker. Would recommend for anyone with theses issues</li>
            <li> this thickens hair while adding shine!</li>
            <li> The formula is &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, but I find it a little greasy on my non-color treated hair.  I bought 2 bottles, so I will use them, but I may look for another leave in treatment when these run out.  Could be that its made for color treated hair and the extra conditioning would be needed, but I liked the old formula better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars because I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any difference after three weeks. Really hoping to be able to upgrade this to five stars. I reevaluate after using the whole bottle. My hair stylist recommended this brand so I have some faith.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some while now. Made this purchase online because my salon was out. It really works well and I will continue to use it.</li>
