            <li>I positively LOVE these.</li>
            <li>more then 1 get like i dont know 4</li>
            <li>The picture that is shown on the product page makes it look like you are getting a bit more material.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for something to put into you head band to look cute</li>
            <li>Not ordering this again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I love how this product came to me.</li>
            <li>Very fun!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get 10 for the price they are charging to get one put in your hair.</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and they are so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>we loved the so much</li>
            <li>But other than that, they&#x27;re a great way to spice up your hair!</li>
            <li>i belive it is nice!it does come with diffrent colors and is almost like 12\\&quot; for one extention.you can easily curl and straightnen it</li>
            <li>I guess that I was expecting something easy to put id does not come with clips.</li>
            <li>she loved hers, although there was only one of her favorite color which created some drama, but the quality was cheap and there was no way i was putting one in my hair!</li>
            <li>They were fine for the kids I bought them for.</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t arrive as fast as i would like to, but it was okay!</li>
            <li>Great quality for this low cost.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li>All of the hair in the pack could fit inside one straw that you get from McDonald&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Items received timely and as detailed in description.</li>
            <li>These are great, and come with things to put them in, you can take them out, or have all of them in at the same time!</li>
            <li>way they fit in the hair taking take a natureal</li>
            <li>this was exactly what i was looking for!!  </li>
            <li>They are a great length, fit long hair and can be cut shorter if needed....cool colors.  </li>
            <li>and she is going to love them, they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It was a really good price, but when i got it in the mail there was only the hair pieces and nothing to apply them with!</li>
            <li>I plan to use these for fly tying, and once I got this into my hands, I realize that I&#x27;m going to have to take markers to some other wig hair I bought from another vendor to suppliment this on my flies.  </li>
            <li>I really like the solid colored ones though- really bright fun colors that are fun to experiment with.  </li>
            <li>these were really not that good</li>
            <li>Only thing I liked was the color.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter is enjoying themvery much.</li>
            <li>But good none the less</li>
            <li>These are specified as synthetic and are exactly that.  </li>
            <li>The ones that are supposed to look like feathers look nothing like feathers, but I kind of expected that.  </li>
            <li>You get exactly what is in the picture,</li>
            <li>they were great because they were so long for my long hair and my girls hair</li>
            <li>they are nice and stay in a long time many different colors in package the same quality as a salon</li>
            <li>the extensions were long enough to match the length of my hair  and the colors were nice and vivid.  </li>
            <li>Definitely thought the pieces would be thicker, but they were super skinny.</li>
            <li>they are long enough for your hair and easy to just cut to the length you want!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these feathers or hair extensions.</li>
            <li>i got it for little bit more price</li>
            <li>br /&gt;we took them out after couple months to put new ones in.</li>
            <li>and i ordered these for myself and my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>But you would just have to get them professionally sewed on with the micro-circle bands it comes with.</li>
            <li>so I can take her to have them professionally put in.</li>
            <li>And this PITA stuff comes directly from China.</li>
            <li>These look like little feathers and they&#x27;re very pretty.</li>
            <li>I did not last long at all &amp; got tangled really fast.</li>
            <li>I really like them and they are very long!!</li>
            <li>love these a little hard to put the bead in and hand it to clip the bead holding the feather hair extension in</li>
            <li>Cheap, small, not worth it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> kinda cheap looking colors a little dull did</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair with them, take a flat iron to them, or anything else!</li>
            <li> also shipped earlier than expected  definitely purchasing from them again!</li>
            <li> But not adult quality.</li>
            <li> The hair was also coming a loose in strands.</li>
            <li> Not enough to make little braid.</li>
            <li> these were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Came quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish they would have come with the equipment for installation.</li>
            <li> When you get them, all of the hair gets stuck together and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> with the fad that is going on and the fact that I have a little girl.</li>
            <li> but i just ordered some beads to clamp my hair down with em!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> A few strands, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all, but then they are a gift to my granddaughter and she&#x27;ll probably like them.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> but you will end up disappointed like if i were you i would buy</li>
            <li> The hair was very thin!!</li>
            <li> i dont think you should get them because they are horrible.</li>

            <li> these were really not that good</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had many extensions and feathers in my hair and i ordered these for myself and my 3 year old. she loved hers, although there was only one of her favorite color which created some drama, but the quality was cheap and there was no way i was putting one in my hair!</li>
            <li> these we awesome! I really like them and they are very long!![: They do NOT come with the material needed to put them in but i dont care because i have everything!!</li>
            <li> These feathers really do last through swimming, shampooing and yes can even be cut with hair.  They have stayed in my grand daughters hair until&lt;br /&gt;we took them out after couple months to put new ones in. I highly recommend these feathers or hair extensions.</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my hair collection. I will continue ordering these for my friends and family! Very fun!</li>
            <li> These look like little feathers and they&#x27;re very pretty. Great quality for this low cost. But you would just have to get them professionally sewed on with the micro-circle bands it comes with.</li>
            <li> i belive it is nice!it does come with diffrent colors and is almost like 12\\&quot; for one extention.you can easily curl and straightnen it i got it for little bit more price but it is good try it.  p.s.   they also give you 10 beads with it to start with.</li>
            <li> Ithey were shown being clip ons and they are not.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what i was looking for!!  the extensions were long enough to match the length of my hair  and the colors were nice and vivid.  also shipped earlier than expected  definitely purchasing from them again!</li>
            <li> i got these feathers and its been two months and i still havnt got them i dont think you should get them because they are horrible.</li>
            <li> These are specified as synthetic and are exactly that.  The ones that are supposed to look like feathers look nothing like feathers, but I kind of expected that.  I really like the solid colored ones though- really bright fun colors that are fun to experiment with.  Don&#x27;t expect that these look anything like feathers and you will be satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I positively LOVE these. The only issue I have with these hair extensions is that they did not come with any beads or anything to put them in with so I put them in with glue.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t feathers. They are synthetic hair extensions with a racoon look. They were fine for the kids I bought them for. But not adult quality.</li>
            <li> with the fad that is going on and the fact that I have a little girl. I was very excited to get 10 for the price they are charging to get one put in your hair. They came when they said they would arrive and my daughter said I was the best mommy ever. So I would say they were an A+ buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cousin for christmas and figured they just clipped in, maybe this is something everyone knew but me, but they do not come with clips they do not come with beads either they are just feathers. But it ended up working out because she likes the ones that glue/braid in so I can take her to have them professionally put in.</li>
            <li> its okay its not the best like you can buy it if you like but you will end up disappointed like if i were you i would buy more then 1 get like i dont know 4 i guess</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all, but then they are a gift to my granddaughter and she&#x27;ll probably like them.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t have the clips included with them. would have liked to know that. wouldn&#x27;t have bought this item. sorry</li>
            <li> THESE R NOT EVEN CLIP INS. THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE AND I DO NOT SUGGEST THESE. THE SEND A BEAD LIKE THING AND YEA I CLD NOT EVEN USE THESE. ANOTHER ITEM THAT SITS IN MY HOUSE!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  The picture that is shown on the product page makes it look like you are getting a bit more material.  I plan to use these for fly tying, and once I got this into my hands, I realize that I&#x27;m going to have to take markers to some other wig hair I bought from another vendor to suppliment this on my flies.  And this PITA stuff comes directly from China.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all it doesn&#x27;t look like feathers at all looks like baby doll hair waiste of your money will not buy it again</li>
            <li> i like them but i was wondering on how to put them in, it has no clips nor pins or anything to put them in so i was wondering on how to put them in.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what is in the picture, well worth the price they are awesome.</li>
            <li> Received in 2 weeks...very cheap product but good for the price. My 6 year old daughter is enjoying themvery much. For the price...can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something to put into you head band to look cute this is it but don&#x27;t expect lots of hair. All of the hair in the pack could fit inside one straw that you get from McDonald&#x27;s. I tried and it worked. Only thing I liked was the color. The hair was also coming a loose in strands.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these. Definitely thought the pieces would be thicker, but they were super skinny. Not ordering this again, that&#x27;s for sure. Good thing it was cheap!</li>
            <li> these were not what I expected. Also I had to buy a crimper to attache them to my Granddaughters hair. they appeared to be clip in.</li>
            <li> Items received timely and as detailed in description. My daughter purchased the feather extensions.  They are just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> A few strands, not what I was expecting. Not enough to make little braid.</li>
            <li> Cheap, small, not worth it</li>
            <li> These are great, and come with things to put them in, you can take them out, or have all of them in at the same time! The only problem is they might get a bit tangled, or hair might fall out of them.</li>
            <li> i loved the hair extensions! but the only problem is that i didn&#x27;t get any beads with it to hold em in place but i just ordered some beads to clamp my hair down with em! would definitely buy again, but hopefully they come with beads! they are long enough for your hair and easy to just cut to the length you want! they can KINDA curl. you just have to ring it up with your finger to kinda guide it on which way to curl. they didn&#x27;t arrive as fast as i would like to, but it was okay!</li>
            <li> I like it because I can coordinate with my outfits</li>
            <li> kinda cheap looking colors a little dull didnt like they way they fit in the hair taking take a natureal look to what it is to form to your hair</li>
            <li> item lasted weeks in my granddaugther&#x27;s hair.  she wash, curl, straighten her with the hair feather still looking great. it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> These extensions are really cute! The only complaint I have is that I wish they would have come with the equipment for installation. But other than that, they&#x27;re a great way to spice up your hair!</li>
            <li> These are not feathers, they are actually just like hair extensions which is not what they explain when you order them. When you get them, all of the hair gets stuck together and it&#x27;s a mess. I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> they were great because they were so long for my long hair and my girls hair we loved the so much</li>
            <li> I love how this product came to me. Not only was is in plastic but they used a hair net so it wouldn&#x27;t tangle. The colors are amazing and they are so much fun to use.</li>
            <li> The hair was very thin!! I did not last long at all &amp; got tangled really fast. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND  ANYONE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!! A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! DISAPPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  They are a great length, fit long hair and can be cut shorter if needed....cool colors.  Came quicker than expected.  Thx!</li>
            <li> It was a really good price, but when i got it in the mail there was only the hair pieces and nothing to apply them with! not even clip things..... its a really good price and its cool to wear I just dont have anything to apply it in my hair with!!</li>
            <li> Good thought it was the ones with clips. But good none the less</li>
            <li> I guess that I was expecting something easy to put id does not come with clips.</li>
            <li> love these a little hard to put the bead in and hand it to clip the bead holding the feather hair extension in</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Awesome! The best price you&#x27;ll find for these things. I can wash my hair with them, take a flat iron to them, or anything else! Perfect to take to a festival to use for trade.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters bday party and she is going to love them, they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> they are nice and stay in a long time many different colors in package the same quality as a salon</li>
            <li> These extensions are GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were longer, but all in all they have vibrant colors and are very nice!</li>
