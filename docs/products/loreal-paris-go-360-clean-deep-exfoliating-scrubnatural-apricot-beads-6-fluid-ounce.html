            <li>hmm...that sounds good.  </li>
            <li>I used this one for body shampoo,pretty good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Ulta and loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can emphasize how good it smells.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t judge on whether or not it helps breakouts, but it smells and feels good during and after use.</li>
            <li>Cleans good but smells like grapefruit. .</li>
            <li>After healing with murad line for acne, I needed a good face wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>not as good as Neutrogena exfoliating face scrubs for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>face scrub pad was a good gimmick</li>
            <li>Seemed like a good bargain.  </li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell as well.</li>

            <li>The scent smells so good.</li>
            <li>The design is perfect to fit in your hand.  </li>

            <li>It felt good.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done ,good for the price</li>

            <li>The scrubby thing that comes on it seems like a good idea</li>

            <li>The fragrance is very interesting.  </li>
            <li>In samples taken from our expedition to The Great Lakes in 2012 we found these beads, in some cases numbering more than 600,000 per square kilometer!\\&quot; ... \\&quot;Micro-plastic particles have been found in fish, marine mammals and reptiles, and in the digestive and circulatory systems of mussels and worms.\\&quot;    I wrote this in a comment but wanted to share with</li>

            <li>It smells good, but it kind of dries my face out.</li>
            <li>This scrub smells so good, and it makes my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li>the cleanser on its own is good but the scrub is what exfoliates.</li>
            <li>The scrubber is very effective and make sure to exfoliate with your hands after.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much !!!!</li>

            <li>Bought this based on the amazing reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I remembered that my grandma used to use this stuff years ago over 30 years ago,</li>
            <li>Your face feels amazing after using.</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING, cleans SOOO WELL</li>
            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>the rubber scrub pad that comes with this cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was a nice soapy thing but</li>
            <li>but it really does smell that great!</li>
            <li>My face feels so nice after using this.</li>
            <li>The cleanser smells nice with a hint of apricot, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product but the bottle was very small,I will for now on check the bottle size.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin and a great way to start my day!</li>
            <li>(yes, eventually, I know I can make my own, but I&#x27;m just not there yet...</li>
            <li>I liked the scent, and the addition of the scrub was nice as well.</li>
            <li>So nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not like your skin smells like an apricot all day.</li>
            <li>but this is nice</li>
            <li>(I floss while I wait), then rinse off, using your hands or a washcloth and warm water, again moving in circles to loosen and remove the product.  </li>
            <li>and  It has a nice smell ( not too manly though).</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice.</li>
            <li>Also 1-2 days a week use something else, as you should with any kind of facewash</li>
            <li>I liked the gentleness of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>The face wash itself is nice but not mindblowing.</li>
            <li>So, kind of neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as a guy, its kind of embarassing recommending this to people</li>
            <li>I loved the scent of this scrub, and when used alone, I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, and you do feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li>Great wash for the face, it leaves it really clean and refreshed, but has SLS and my trying to go organic</li>
            <li>After a wash my skin feels great and clean.</li>
            <li>This face wash is nice, it smells sweet and the scrub is fun to use, but I dont know if it is the best thing out there.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser as an alternative because it&#x27;s much gentler and comes with a great scrubbing tool that fits perfectly in the bottle and on my hand.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice too, it smells more like peaches than apricot to me</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and the beads/ exforliating materials are not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you do have some kind of cream on after.</li>
            <li>excellent the skin is soft as mentioned on the product</li>
            <li>I had good, smooth skin, but it had its flaws.</li>
            <li>skin felt much better with the St. Ives apricot scrub; to me, it has much effective ingredient for breakout problems than this product.</li>
            <li>This one does the best job by far.</li>
            <li>The scrubber feels awsome on my skin and it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>the price is cheap and good for cleansing.</li>
            <li>I love the scrublet and how nice it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice hint of grapefruit smell and gotta love what it comes with</li>
            <li>Smells great, the exfoliating scrublet that comes with the bottle is pretty handy, leaves my skin feeling softer and brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my new exfoliating scrub, it&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
            <li>the scrub brush works great not flumsy and the package was right on time at this price</li>
            <li>It smells nice and light, and it feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>smells great and my face feels great using this and my electric facial cleanser tool</li>
            <li>It seems to really clean my face good.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great face wash--it lathers up really really well with the scrubber!</li>
            <li>The smell is really great too, it&#x27;s mild and fruity, unlike a lot of really strong chemical-y smelling face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is a very light exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a dude so this review may not be as informative for the more experienced ladies out there.</li>
            <li>had bought two of them...and i am really very happy with it...keeps face really clean and fresh.i am from a very humid climate so face gets more oily fast.but</li>
            <li>that feel pleasant and gentle, yet effective at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>so i quickly read the label and was relieved that my favorite face wash is good to go.</li>
            <li>I tried this product line and loved it from the first use!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and its cheap!</li>
            <li>Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>This scrub goes on so smooth and creamy!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for better results the longer</li>
            <li>The scrublet works great with the Olay Pore Scrub, but all of these products works really well with the Pro-X battery powered skin brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>and i already love it ..</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>On top of that the fragrance is so refreshing and the scrubber is so therapeutic.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, if I use one product for too many days in a row, its like my skin gets too used to it</li>
            <li>But I love that smell.</li>
            <li>And the wash itself is just ok.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the nifty scrubber, and fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>It works as well or better than the pricey stuff I used to get from the esthetician.     </li>
            <li>The best facial cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok product</li>
            <li>I like this product; it smells lovely, and the lil pop out scrubby pad is an innovative idea.</li>
            <li>I discovered that the scrubby has a suction cup on the top</li>
            <li>might try a more exfoliating product when I run out of this; but I am not opposed to buying this again.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with the products.  </li>
            <li>Well, the pad is the magic.</li>
            <li>and I love the rubber scrubber it comes with, great for really exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I&#x27;ve battled with acne since the day I got my &#x27;friend&#x27; (more like enemy).</li>
            <li>I love the scrubber that comes with it</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love using this scrub.  </li>
            <li>For the buck, you can&#x27;t get a better product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as it was recommended in a sub reddit of Reddit as being &amp;#34;the best for one&#x27;s skin&amp;#34;, not leaving microabrasions and such.</li>
            <li>do love the scrublet and tried to find them for sale by themselves.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I had so many break outs and scars on my skin</li>
            <li>so you can probably use this for around 2months :)</li>
            <li>I like it ok.</li>
            <li>This would probably be better for someone with oilier skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, would recommend it without hesitation, and will be buying more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but the scrublet is PERFECT for people with facial piercings (or just any pierced area the want to scrub).</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3-4 yeas of me using this product and up to this day, I still love how it does its job.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a &amp;#34;chemical peel&amp;#34; type exfoliating gel, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>I use this in my shower and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this face cleaner.  </li>

            <li>none of them worked, this even made me break out even more</li>

            <li>People tell me my face looks more \\&quot;bronze\\&quot; nowadays.</li>
            <li>But I fell in love with it anyway.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a great cleanser that really scrubs out all the dirt and makeup without tearing up your skin.  </li>
            <li>lot of people are saying this product isn&#x27;t that great or that the scrub doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU AMAZON. :)</li>
            <li>I feel like it could use a bit more.</li>
            <li>woukd recommend this cleanser but be sure to spot treat if you get bumps.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.</li>
            <li>need to order some more of this</li>
            <li>/&gt;ir is neessary to order some more.</li>
            <li>Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>For the money , you can&#x27;t get a better product than this.  </li>
            <li>love the way it feels when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love the microsrubbers.  </li>
            <li>Go buy it! :)</li>
            <li>did the job it has my face looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is held in the bottle</li>
            <li>For some reason, of all the face-washing products I have tried, this has been the most helpful in minimizing (but never curing)</li>
            <li>Great combination of cleansing and exfoliation- not harsh but effective.</li>
            <li>This leaves my face both feeling and looking more exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>and I sure have a thing for the peach smell.</li>
            <li>If you try and buy a product that is &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for use on the body, you&#x27;ll end up paying $10 or more.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love the scrub thingy.</li>
            <li>It is conveniently attached to the bottle and gives a better face scrub than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a nice light grapefruit</li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>Now think about more than just you using it.</li>
            <li>Either way, I enjoy them both!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it when I can choose items from my granddaughter&#x27;s wish list for birthdays and Christmas.  </li>
            <li>This one does everything and more that the top dollar creams and cleansers do, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating scrub brush.</li>
            <li>I like that L&#x27;Oreal gives more.  </li>
            <li>The scrubber is great and really helps you get your face nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and the exfoliating beads really do make your face smell fresh and feel even better!</li>
            <li>The scrubber is very gentle against your face and it does a good job at lathering the scrub, too.</li>
            <li>The idea of the attached scrubber is great that makes cleansing fast and easy.</li>
            <li>and it makes my face feel very clean</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant to give in to all the \\&quot;hoopla\\&quot; surrounding this product, but I needed a good exfoiliator</li>
            <li>Still pretty good product, I use it along with another one and rotate each day</li>
            <li>This is pretty good for getting rid of oil on the face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new face wash and purchased this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice apricot scent and is a mild exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>I could even fill the bottle with a cleanser that I like better, although the cleanser works just fine.</li>
            <li>Honestly this cleared up my acne which I&#x27;ve had for over 5 years now and within the first week I noticed a change!</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and healthy feeling since I started using it.</li>
            <li>AND of course the most important of all .....</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Daily use of this product helps my combination skin to look nice, be smooth and follow up with a moisturizer makes a great starter to apply foundation and go on with my day.</li>
            <li>just kidding, i loved it, really</li>
            <li>Very soothing and feels good to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite products for our faces and it&#x27;s super cheap on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The best part is: you get a new one each time you buy a new package of this stuff!</li>
            <li>so it makes the blackheads easy to see.  </li>
            <li>I love the scrublet from my 360 Cleanser and was considering purchasing this version for a deeper clean and another scrublet.</li>
            <li>I used to use the loofah on my face because I liked being to able to really scrub all the grime off, I just couldn&#x27;t do that with my hands or a wash-cloth, and my piercings would always catch on my loofah-</li>
            <li>and I love the clean smell and</li>
            <li>Its easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It made sense to me and this stuff is an easy preventative that is working.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use in the shower and if it gets in your eye</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The face scrub also comes with a pad to clean you face with which is lovely</li>
            <li>The exfoliating pad pops into a hole in the bottle for easy storage.</li>
            <li>We had tried the L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 when it first came out, but never this exfoliating kind.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, it&#x27;s probably a good buy.</li>
            <li>everything is so much easier and refreshing and clean of course!!</li>
            <li>This feels really clean and fresh and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Best facewash ever, hands down.</li>
            <li>This one works well and has a clean fresh scent that I liked.</li>
            <li>Even among the other Loreal go 360 line products, I&#x27;d give this one the gold medal--give it a try! :D</li>
            <li>At first it made my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I am a black woman and it is the best I have seen my medium brown skin tone.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise it cleans fine</li>
            <li>Finding a product that does not dry out my skin and fights blemishes is a great find in my book.</li>
            <li>The tiny scrub is awesome and this really exfoliates!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I think in buying products that say they heal blackhead or acne, we should look more closely on the inside rather than using a quick fix product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this is a good product to those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>The little face cleaner that the soap comes with is the best.</li>
            <li>tell ya that little scrublette is awesome.</li>
            <li>cheap, very effective, helps to avoid break outs, do not dry out skin...</li>
            <li>After using this for about two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my blackheads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge help and makes life easier</li>
            <li>and I have not had a huge breakout</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen huge results.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth, I can&#x27;t get over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
            <li>When I rinse off the face wash, I can immediately tell the texture of my skin is smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will buy again for under $5 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>but it also leaves my face fealing really smooth.</li>
            <li>It does leave the skin smooth for a reason.</li>
            <li>Usually not into cheap brands, but this product is gentle and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>he fact that its ver gentle, I like the kind where I think my skin is coming off.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I like how cheap this product is and comes with a lil scrubber.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>My blackheads were gone and my skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>it was cheap</li>
            <li>My face felt so silky and smooth after I got out.</li>
            <li>.my face is free of oil. .</li>
            <li>I got this one cheap too, and now the price is up up...</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a cheap exfoliating face wash that I like.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so great that I may even stop using foundation as part of my daily makeup regimen because my skin tone is looking so</li>
            <li>Brighten Up by Vasanti being one of the best I found that efficiently felt like you were removing dead skin but</li>
            <li>I use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System instead.  </li>
            <li>Great product  fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>The scrublet is really nice to use and is a big improvement from having to use your own fingers.</li>
            <li>It could exfoliate better, but its good enough.</li>
            <li>but it does seem to do a good job so far.</li>
            <li>Seems many reviewers really like it, but I find I get a better scrub just using my finger tips.  </li>
            <li>My friends and family tell me how good my face is looking and people ask me and I wearing makeup that is how clear my face has become.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty cool and the wash has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>After testing it to make sure the bottle contained the right product, i tried it.</li>
            <li>Love the way the scrubbing pad fits right into the container.</li>
            <li>My face feels very fresh and moisturized after using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare that I find something to put on my face that I trust</li>
            <li>I had been shopping around for the perfect makeup remover/cleanser for a few months when I stumbled upon the Go 360 Clean line.  </li>
            <li>It smells GREAT, like you just cut open an apricot, and it feels like your face is really clean after you get done using it.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done really well and leave a nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, I love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and clean without drying it.</li>
            <li>leaving my skin clean and smooth.</li>

            <li>Great face wash; you can feel it working as you scrub it in, smells pretty good too and the bottle lasts surprisingly long since you don&#x27;t need much each time</li>
            <li>LOVE AMAZON very much</li>
            <li>the fact that it is also able to stick to the wall made it super useful.</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>[...]    --    This was absolutely my favorite face wash...until reading the reviews here, I realized that there was just too much plastic involved in this product, aargh!</li>

            <li>My acne has significantly improved since switching to this cleanser.</li>

            <li>When I first used this product, I was very, very excited.</li>
            <li>my face feels clean .</li>
            <li>When i usually clean my face if have to scrub and rub my t-zone area to the point where it is on fire when i get out just to get it clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, breathing, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 clean</li>
            <li>I have this thing about brushes and how it builds up dirt even though you clean it after each usage.</li>
            <li>I cook all day and after I get home and use this I feel so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling and looking clean without overdrying.</li>
            <li>Its alright,keeps your face clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>This cleanser makes my skin feel so clean</li>
            <li>Again, that&#x27;s my recommendation as I have found it most effective, but I have no medical training</li>
            <li>Gentle scrubbing action, smells great.</li>
            <li>to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought this facewash only for the exfoliating pad that comes with it, but I fell in LOVE with the facewash.</li>
            <li>360 Clean does both.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean</li>
            <li>Makes my face super smooth.</li>
            <li>And after using it my face feels clean.</li>
            <li>Buy this if you want clean skin, but not exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>Daliy wash need it .price is super cheap .but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to find an exfoliator, but much harder to find one that smells this good!  </li>
            <li>I got it in the mail quickly and was pleased when I first used it.</li>
            <li>Okay, it&#x27;s gimmicky and I fell for it, but it&#x27;s also a very nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Great exfoliating scrub and the packaging is practical and very clever with the little scrubby having it&#x27;s own home on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells great, feels like a massage when you put it on with the scrubber and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING afterwards, not tight or dry like others.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend anyone using this to invest in a good moisturizer as exfoliating does make the skin dry.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean after using it and it smells great, but not strong.</li>
            <li>I love the deep cleaning exfoliating scrub it makes my face feel clean, soft and it feels great.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and leaves my face smooth, dead skin free, and smelling great...</li>
            <li>I also noticed my blackheads were slowly disappearing which I was also very happy with because everything else</li>
            <li>, just wish that i got a full bottle like i paid for.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean and refreshed and just super super clean.</li>
            <li>This shipped to my house fast and my acne is noticeably better.</li>
            <li>The product itself is has a nice scent and it scrub is soft for the face.</li>
            <li>You lose so much space for more liquid because there is a hole in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It especially feels good on my face</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash and finally stumped upon this one.</li>
            <li>My favorite time to use this cleanser is in the morning and it gives me a very refreshed, energized feeling.</li>
            <li>I love how well the exfoliating beads work, but they&#x27;re still gentle.</li>
            <li>also it well cleans the skin,your skin feels really cleansed,I love it and do intend to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are not abrasive - they&#x27;re more on the gentle side.</li>
            <li>The scrubs are perfect consistency - not too rough or big, but not whimpy or too many either.</li>
            <li>Cool bottle design.  </li>
            <li>Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scrublet -</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product so much that I got 2 bottles of it.</li>
            <li>The idea of it is cool</li>
            <li>I do love loreal but this product upset me so much</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this scrub was good and definitely made my face lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, for the scrubber more than the soap itself.</li>
            <li>I honestly purchased this as a mistake but was pleasantly surprised by how it worked.  </li>
            <li>Such a good price</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re not bad to begin with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;d say for $4 this is not a bad deal at all.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad cleanser, I just prefer the scrubby beads from the Proactiv cleanser.</li>
            <li>The scrublet is great not cheap at all and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Mainly just blackheads which honestly this is the first product that worked...</li>
            <li>Feels great and  makes my face feel softer and smoother than any other scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and the smell is great too its not overpowering like some other products</li>
            <li>it is great, this is my first time use exfoliating product, it really help to exfoliate, i love that little tool on it to help clean, i love the smell, everything, thanks alot!</li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean</li>
            <li>Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scublet - that makes cleansing fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The scrub feels nice, and it left my skin feeling smooth, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in blackheads/clogged pores.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating is the perfect amount, not too rough and not too soft.</li>
            <li>It lasts me a pretty long time as well and for the amount you pay for, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>give it 3 stars still for cleansing out my face,the cute scrublet, and the low price, but I&#x27;ve seen better exfoliators out there.</li>
            <li>With the facial cleaner and the scrub, this is one of the best deep-cleaning facial cleaners i have found.  </li>
            <li>my face is clearing up from the mild break outs I was having abd</li>
            <li>Super drying</li>
            <li>Sure, it takes away from total bottle oz, but for the novelty... I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li>quick service</li>
            <li>In my mind, there are better exfoliators out there for the same or better price.</li>
            <li>the scrublet works well in cleansing :) highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so something that&#x27;s still on the market that long has got to be good.    </li>
            <li>Hands down a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too rough, it smells good, and it leaves my face totally clean.</li>
            <li>I am about 3/4 way into my first bottle and will most certainly be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Also love the little beads in it &amp; it always makes my face feel so nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Update, my new favorite non-plastic based scrub is the [[ASIN:B001E0W30U</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite scrub.</li>
            <li>I typically use it once a week to exfoliate and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle for relatively inexpensive and it works well.</li>
            <li>The small beads on it make it a perfect tool for washing your face and really getting into your pores.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin you will need to use a good mosturizer after you cleanse.</li>
            <li>have found success in Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) wash (Glytone mild gel wash) for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>Only used it twice sofar, received it yesterday, but what an ingenious invention!</li>
            <li>I first started shopping on Amazon to see if I could find the product without the plastic scrubber since I never use it, and then realized that all of the exfoliating scrubby microbeads are also PLASTIC (polyethelene)!  </li>
            <li>Within the first use, the majority of the blackheads on my nose were gone!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li>and it works really well!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Note that I have used strong topical acne products (retin-A, benzaclin) for many years and have no problem using this in combination with those.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>its also very cheap and has natural exfoliating bead things.</li>
            <li>The scrub brush is pretty nice, it really does get into spots your hands or fingers normally couldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well,  didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or anything, and  my face felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve had no breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;Until I found L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing for sensitive skin, nice mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It has the little apricot polishing/exfoliating beads, smells pleasant, and gets the face clean.  </li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t see an improvement but it leaves my skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to remove the excess make up but gentle enough to keep your face good clean and not strip away too much of your natural good oils on your face.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, actually cheap.</li>
            <li>The beads are smooth and not irritating.</li>
            <li>It works great to get off dead skin as well for the morning</li>
            <li>I liked this deep cleaning and brush also.</li>
            <li>It has a yummy fresh grapefruit-y fragrance and granules for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>The Go 360 Clean is gentler and does a nice job of cleansing without leaving you with an overly dry or irritated complexion.  </li>
            <li>I actually find the gimmick of storing the pad in the bottle to be a nice convenience.  </li>
            <li>it was reslly worth it...</li>
            <li>, so this is a nice daily use wash.</li>
            <li>i rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a regular kind of face scrub.</li>
            <li>but I rarely go there</li>
            <li>have the most sensitive face.</li>
            <li>Instead, take le_revolution&#x27;s advice and try out the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]].  </li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling fresh faced.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, would buy again.</li>
            <li>, fresh citrus scent</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually effective with the scrub provided; I have seen noticeable difference with my nose blackheads/pores and the face overall.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it if buying things in a bundle purchase because the shipping price drops to zero.</li>
            <li>product works as well as the HeadBlade stuff, smells better, and costs far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li>my skin is still fresh.</li>
            <li>the exfoliating scrub brush thing is lots of fun to use.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Also it is rare that i get acne.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh, I really like the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>The little scrubby that comes with it is very nice too.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and does a great job and the scrubbing pad is just right for every day use.</li>
            <li>The flavor is awesome as well, I might want to try some other flavors next time!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this product is any better than many other products.</li>
            <li>This is a good facial cleanser, it makes your face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large pores and I&#x27;ve tried tons of products to help me keep them clean.</li>
            <li>More over, the scent of the facial cleaner is very nice, subtle, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Really exposes fresh clean skin after exfoliation</li>
            <li>Once done, my skin is clean, smooth and amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser has a nice mild scent,  doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and has helped keep my break outs under control.  </li>
            <li>But it is too clean, so I can only use it twice mostly, better once.</li>
            <li>Blackheads are a constant battle you need to make sure you don&#x27;t clog your pores with dirt and always clean your face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean afterwards and not dried out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li>When I first got this facial cleanser, my first through was that the rubber scrubber, while a nice addition, felt like it would fall apart quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it applies just the right amount of pressure to your skin</li>
            <li>The smell is just right.</li>
            <li>I exfoliated my face and then plucked the hair out of my face right afterwards.</li>
            <li>Right now my face is breaking out a lot (I&#x27;m guessing hormones) and</li>
            <li>This product was all right.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just right for applying the scrub.</li>
            <li>I never meant to right a review</li>
            <li>Its just the right consistency to pull blackheads out of my face.</li>
            <li>so i washed it right off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been prone to breakouts and my skin had been pretty clear compared to most of my friends.</li>
            <li>The scent is very refreshing, and the scrubbie brush really makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i do like this product but only gave it four stars because i&#x27;ll need to use it more to form a full opinion of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am modern man ( yup, I do  take care of  my skin ) with mix skin type, and let me tell you that L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean</li>
            <li>I couldnt really tell if it did anything special for me</li>
            <li>The actual product, the exfoliating cleaner, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as well as other brands, although it does leave a very pleasant smell on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I use St- Ives and enjoy the pasty texture of that product.</li>
            <li>, Deep Exfoliating Scrub is the best  on in the market, I just applied it and it  has left my skin  soft ,  </li>
            <li>After just the first use, my face was so much softer and felt extremely clean.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean when I use it, but it also feels that way with pretty much every cleanser.</li>
            <li>I really like the bottle of this product, and the little scrublet is a great idea in theory.  </li>
            <li>I love this and love the little scrubber and the way it is attached to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and really gets your face clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I never expected to love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>I totally regret my purchase and will do my best to encourage my friends and acquaintances to avoid these sham products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This exfoliating scrub smells so nice and works very well in deep cleaning your pores.</li>
            <li>Good and can use for half a year.</li>
            <li>I gave it a try and after a good month of using it at least once or twice a day, the blackheads have almost gone away and my face is smooth as hell.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and exfoliates gently so you can use it daily without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because the producer could easily swap out the plastic beads for something natural (walnut shells?)</li>
            <li>This product is very reasonably priced for what it does.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, it gets my face very clean and takes the dead skin off.  </li>
            <li>The little scrubber makes my pores look so good and this apricot smells</li>
            <li>This product really left my face feeling clean and smooth .</li>
            <li>This face wash keeps my face clear of breakouts while making my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my face feeling fresh, clean and clear of any pimples.</li>
            <li>I have used this since it first came on the market.</li>
            <li>I had lent it to a friend, before I was aware of the beginning of a breakout, when she used it it has caused her to break out immediately.</li>
            <li>first use</li>
            <li>The price is not bad, especially since you don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount.....</li>
            <li>.this is my first time using these cleanser</li>
            <li>I bought this product not even being aware it came with a \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When i first opened the product i figured</li>
            <li>I think this really works!</li>
            <li>...contain my enthousiasm ;)</li>
            <li>First of all, if you like a &amp;#34;fake chemical apricot&amp;#34; smell, perhaps the smell will be tolerable.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth when I use this as directed.</li>
            <li>--i dont want to end up in my 30s having used nearly everything and making my skin become immune to everything available on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably look for something more exfoliating/abrasive next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li>The only downside is if you wear eye make up, be sure not to get it around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love this face scrub....highly recommend as a daily wash!!</li>
            <li>I no longer have tiny bumps on my forehead, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say in about 4 years.</li>
            <li>Can I first express how bummed I am that Target doesn&#x27;t sell this in store anymore nor online?</li>
            <li>Especially when going on trips or something, it&#x27;s so convenient and cleans so much better than just using your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This stuff really delivers!</li>
            <li>This is a great way to gently cleanse your face and give it a teeny tiny massage at the same time.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I still get an occasional blemish (maybe once every month or so), but not even as many as I got using a cleanser by a brand known for anti-acne products.  </li>
            <li>It does clear up blackheads and leaves your face feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and have added it to my subscribe-and-save as a regular item.  </li>
            <li>aware, though, that this PROBABLY won&#x27;t get rid of your blackheads.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try it because it was my first time.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li>think I may be allergic to it because I find that I wake up with more red bumps on my face in the morning</li>
            <li>And it really smells like fresh peaches.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I had used one that had the &#x27;scrubbies&#x27; and after starting the exfoliating process again and not having them, I sure missed them.  </li>
            <li>The scrublet is so useful for cleaning your face really well</li>
            <li>The built in facial scrubber is ingenious.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the extra scrubbie attached.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li>I can finally go more than an hour without oily skin and my pores are always smaller after cleansing than before.</li>
            <li>I went back to my neutrogena exfoliator and put a mask on my skin and moisturizer and my skin is all better now</li>
            <li>This feels more like just a cream facial wash....</li>
            <li>Still on the look out for a better facial scrub.</li>
            <li>That way I know she is getting exactly what she wants!</li>
            <li>The scrubber it comes with is cute but its not necessary.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh smell, and the little beads create just the right amount of exfoliation for me.  </li>
            <li>This comes with a small rubber scrubber built right into the bottle that is really good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The product does what it says and is a good exfoliant, but not for people with sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is safe, gentle but exfoliates down to fresh clean skin.  </li>
            <li>It do exactly how it describe  skin soft, shiny and clean</li>
            <li>As for the exfoliating cleanser, it is just ok mainly because the scrubbing particles don&#x27;t really exfoliate well, they&#x27;re too suspended in the gel, and it is just a little bit drying, better for using during the summer.</li>
            <li>It works amazing, immediately I can see my pores got smaller and it makes my skin feel soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>After trying Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, and Biore products, I still had not found a product to minimize my pores AND oil production.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from Oxy, Biore, and Clean and Clear</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s make you&#x27;r skin soft and clean</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Since I just got this product, I can&#x27;t say how well it works yet at clearing up acne, but I know that after I use it, my face feels amazingly soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face so clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It deep cleans and leaves my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I recently tried using that again just to make sure it was really this causing issues and</li>
            <li>You really couldn&#x27;t get a better facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It also comes with its&#x27; own pad right on the bottle, which is rubber with little bumps on it.  </li>
            <li>Although the little scrublet is nice, the apricot beads help give it that extra bit to do a better job in exfoliating.</li>
            <li>within 3 days of using this i see positive results, makes my skin look</li>
            <li>The little beads inside the soap make your face feel refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>Of course I tried pretty much all the acne reducing products under the sun.</li>
            <li>every time when I use it, I need to wash my face for a long time to make sure i wash it out.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and I guess it cleans pretty well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure it does good job or not .won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful, is gentle, smoothes and soothes my skin, the scrubber is soft and easily conforms to your face,and a little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very harsh and gives you a sensation of clean skin.</li>
            <li>this stuff is comparable to top dollar cleansers, left my face soft, pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy</li>
            <li>After a few days of using it my blavkheads and pimples were gone, my pores were a lot smaller, and my skin was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face seeing as I&#x27;ve NEVER had completely smooth skin up until now.</li>
            <li>Different products work differently for different skin, and so far this one works best for mine.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It bends extremely easily and isn&#x27;t as fragile as it looks!     </li>
            <li>Skin is left feeling smooth and clean, no residue - like so far.</li>
            <li>Usually I love loreal but after using this I got pimples, bumps on my face, and backed up dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Go 360 Clean line but especially the Deep Exfoliating Scrub version.  </li>
            <li>If you use it wisely it does last long.</li>
            <li>My pores are rather large</li>
            <li>I am age 49 and have large pores and problems with blackheads.</li>
            <li>If you have large pores and blackheads, this is a must buy for you.</li>
            <li>I buy this product purely for the face scrubber that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of large pores.</li>
            <li>I have large pores but it seems to minimize them.  </li>
            <li>It contains large beads that i don&#x27;t feel exfoliates at all.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes far and makes your skin feel nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it would be really bad if I stopped using my face cream (its the best I&#x27;ve tried - super moisturizing without exacerbating my skin issues).  </li>
            <li>It cleans your face gently but the sponge exfoliant is soft enough to not harm your skin and love that it is attached to the bottle which I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I received it.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, I seriously did not even need to put any kind of makeup on!  </li>
            <li>so clever!</li>
            <li>As warm weather hits my skin goes a little nuts.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it, even for the pretty girls</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris deep exfoliating scrub is great once every week when I need to exfoliate my dead skin cells on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cleanser which have left my skin feeling greasy and heavy, but this is great.</li>
            <li>It has caused my self esteem to drop in a very drastic rate.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with how this turned out.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>My face looks much clearer and I no longer feel the blackhead &#x27;bumps&#x27; when I touch my nose or the skin around it.</li>
            <li>hahahahaha</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>Really like the brush attached to this bottle.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal really hit a home run with this model, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>but I find myself feeling SO MUCH HAPPIER having waited and using this product.  </li>
            <li>and It looked promising.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really one of those scrubs you don&#x27;t mind getting stuck in your nose.</li>
            <li>It smells like real apricots.</li>
            <li>my pores were really clogged</li>
            <li>But the exfoliating pad and the contents of the loreal product seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>The cap itself is not broken yet inside the cap</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>and it may irritate skin with too much use.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need that much of a cleaning.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks to le_revolution&#x27;s review</li>
            <li>Shopping on Amazon.com makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about it ridding blackheads since I don&#x27;t have much of that.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see as much exfoliation as it claims</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in breakouts and stuff</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works really well, exfoliates and cleans the face</li>
            <li>This really gets rid of blackheads on your nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Before I used this scrub, I had blackheads, and a face that gets very oily.</li>
            <li>Only rated it three stars because its nothing fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it really exfoliate as well.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face and body, it cleans skin very well.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; tingle &amp; gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Gentle and</li>
            <li>I have skin sensitivities, but I use this product in the evening and a gentle cleanser (like Cerave) in the morning.  </li>
            <li>But, it really depends on the skin type you have.</li>
            <li>The scrublet helps to exfoliate, but is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>but it cleans it really well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for a gentle face scrub.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub.</li>
            <li>the bottle&#x27;s look, the brush (even though I don&#x27;t use it much).</li>
            <li>beads are really exfoliating</li>
            <li>/&gt;It foams up really well</li>
            <li>Thanks to this face wash</li>
            <li>If it hadn&#x27;t bothered mine so much, I would have kept it.</li>
            <li>Also, exfoliation removes tans, so if you want to maintain a tan scrub gently.</li>
            <li>It was gentle and yet it felt like it was exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and smells very fragrant.</li>
            <li>fresh n young...</li>
            <li>Really like put on auto order.</li>
            <li>I really like the scrublet</li>
            <li>It has a detachable applicator that works very well.</li>
            <li>so real</li>
            <li>then \\&quot;dermanew\\&quot; products during whole month...</li>
            <li>And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the smell is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The beads don&#x27;t really do much on my face.</li>
            <li>but it really works that well.</li>
            <li>this product comes with a plastic rubber scrub which gently exfoliates your face.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It gentle</li>
            <li>As a busy executive, facing numerous people each day in meetings and otherwise, my face has to look as good as it possibly can.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and ex foliating without being too harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that since using this product I have been breaking out a lot more frequently, when I used to only break out during my &#x27;time of the month&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It smells sooo good, and left my skin looking clearer and feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li>Right after I wash, I definitely noticed a difference right away in terms of how clear my face looks, but I would recommend this product more for people with large pore/blackhead/oil issues than to people prone to getting a lot of actual pimples.</li>
            <li>If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right one for you.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild but clean and refreshing, and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>It really does clean 360 especially with the help of that sponge</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cleanser, particularly when the weather is warmer and sweat leaves me feeling gross.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells more peachy than citrusy, unlike the other commenters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I have done is use the scrubber with other cleansers- which works better than using my hands.</li>
            <li>I have used this only for 3 times (twice a day) and this has significantly improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to scrub my whole face, neck and chest that I find myself scrubbing longer than I normally do.</li>
            <li>You have an extra chore because you have to clean it or else</li>
            <li>such a clean feel</li>
            <li>A nice little prize!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this if you want that gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and not oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li>, this is not natural, organic, free from &amp;#34;harmful&amp;#34; chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true fan, and I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised by how much I like this face cleanser!</li>
            <li>must recommend that, in order to allow the salicylic acid to most effectively slough off dead cells/remove impurities and oil in pores, you wet your face and the scrublet, put a nickel-sized amount of the product on the scrublet, gently massage onto your face in circles, then let the foam sit on your face several seconds to a minute</li>
            <li>When your lips are dry and flaky, use the scrubber--without cleanser--on your lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>and when it is the winter I&#x27;m quite glad because less oil production.</li>
            <li>but it was a lot more drying and way less exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>The scrubber that comes with this cleanser is decent for that.</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back the Deep Exfoliating Scrub and love it.  </li>
            <li>Back in the day, I used to use the St. Yves almond kind, which was basically crushed almond shells.</li>
            <li>It is a very comfortable rubber with little scrublets.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the high priced products do</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This is a great daily face wash that not only cleanses and removes make up but gently exfoliated away dead skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I highly suggest giving this facewash a try, no matter your skin type.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s little exfoliating beads and gives you a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I will just refill the bottle with other face cleansers when it is empty - I don&#x27;t think the solution that matters, but this stuff does smell really good.</li>
            <li>back then, I felt like it stripped the good oils in my face and left my face extremely dry where I would need to pack up on the moisturizer to keep it from breaking my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use it once a week when i need to exfoliate my face because any more than that will dry it out too much.</li>
            <li>With other brands, I feel like I&#x27;m just kind of wasting my time or simply washing with soap.</li>
            <li>I love the little scrubby thing that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>The little exfoliating scrubber that it comes with is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has a little scrubber comes with it which is also a plus.  </li>
            <li>I wish it has more of the little beads</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a little face washing pad that is always with the wash because it sticks through the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the little scrubby and</li>
            <li>and i love the little scrub pad it comes with...</li>
            <li>I love the little scrubber that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the little apricot beads.</li>
            <li>I love the little scrub pad that comes with it.</li>
            <li>when I scrubbed I felt like I was getting a little more grit in</li>
            <li>, I had been using Olay&#x27;s Pro-X and the exfoliating face wash that comes with it, Simple Moisturizing Face Wash, and Clean and Clear Advantage</li>
            <li>The scrublet is actually useful and best of all isn&#x27;t hard and tough like you would imagine.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while now in my skincare routine, and it really helps my skin stay clear.</li>
            <li>My face is clean, ridiculously smooth, much less oily, and my pores are so tiny, they are virtually non existent.</li>
            <li>This cleaner does do everything that L&#x27;Oreal says it will- clean, reduce appearance of pores, and won&#x27;t over dry-</li>
            <li>However, the come-on that it has natural apricot seeds for exfoliating is very misleading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an islander and naturally I was born with very oily skin, matched with my tan skin if that has anything to do with it.</li>
            <li>Removes make up very well and it is not harsh on your skin at all.</li>
            <li>Second, the granules are just a bit too small and too sparse to do a good job scrubbing.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t carry my normal cleanser</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with occassional acne break outs.</li>
            <li>For the green colored one I thought the scrublet worked better, but for this one I would rather use my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh exfoliating facial scrub!</li>
            <li>u normally feel in scrubs</li>
            <li>this was a big success.</li>
            <li>The results of this facial exfoliator are neither better nor worse than most products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>things I really like about it:&lt;br /&gt;The little scrub is easy to use</li>
            <li>and the actual product is pretty good too, definitely no complaints, it makes my skin feel clean, a little bit dry, but a slight moisturizer can fix that easily-</li>
            <li>I love the little scrubbing disk, it&#x27;s very soft and glides over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser isn&#x27;t strong enough for me, so I wash with a second cleanser after.</li>
            <li>I have &#x27;normal&#x27; type skin, and I was not having a lot of breakouts, but I needed a new face wash, so I tried this out.</li>
            <li>The facial scrubby pad was a neat gimmick, I can&#x27;t tell if it really worked, but you do notice a clean feeling, especially around the area where your nose meets your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried St. Ives (which only made my skin really soft), Clean and clear (which got rid of the blackheads but gave me a lot of pimples) and then this product.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin smooth not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin that sometimes is very sensitive,</li>
            <li>The little hand-held scrubbing mat that comes with each bottle of face cleaner is a really nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>it really helps clean down in your pores.</li>
            <li>I thought i was supposed to be getting a NEW product??</li>
            <li>it is a new item.</li>
            <li>I have a new found confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin out like many other products do.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else really works well for me, no matter how much it may claim to \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; or \\&quot;unclog pores\\&quot; or \\&quot;kill bacteria.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to do it probably 2-3 times a week because my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love the little scrub pad, too!  </li>
            <li>but this tiny sponge really amazed me, even after my very first use of this product showed me bigger result</li>
            <li>The scrubber is a very soft rubber.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>It is a very soft rubber.</li>
            <li>being as I&#x27;m very young and</li>
            <li>But in high school, I developed hard-to-get-rid-of blackheads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first facial exfoliant (I&#x27;m very young but have some blackheads)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m all clear again!</li>
            <li>My face is clear and glowing!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The scrubber seemed flimsy at first but is actually quite sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li>I want a big one for the whole body!</li>
            <li>I wish I could use it on my entire body haha!</li>
            <li>Recently though it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li>I was surprised!</li>
            <li>I spotted one at a DAISO for $1.50, exact same thing.</li>
            <li>made facial wash exfoliants which was pretty unreal to read about</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smoother and cleans deep to remove oil and dirt making your pores appear smaller and smaller with every use, the exfoliating cleanser makes your skin appear more youthful and smoother while getting rid of the shine caused from oils.</li>
            <li>Curious who did the cool design.</li>
            <li>It is a little strong for me and drys my skin out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice daily exfoliating scrub - meaning it has little exfoliating beads, but they&#x27;re gentle enough for every day use.</li>
            <li>but when I reach for L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean because not only does it deeply exfoliate</li>
            <li>I have an unearthly oily nose and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to help much at all with that, however it&#x27;s very helpful with other parts of my skin.</li>
            <li>Clean Deep Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin that I purchased, trying to avoid these beads.</li>
            <li>i like this scrub pretty well so far since i have only used it once.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the little brush that comes with it</li>
            <li>Nice product and very delicate.</li>
            <li>I love the idea to have the little scrubber sitting in the middle of the bottle</li>
            <li>I love this scrub and the tiny little exfoliating scrub pad that comes with</li>
            <li>I love the little scrub thingy it comes with!!</li>
            <li>Does it clear blackheads and acne etc?...</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this product to make up the minimum purchase for free shipping and had absolutely no expectations of it.  </li>
            <li>It kept my skin clear, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to clear that up</li>
            <li>Also, this has helped clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the search for clear skin continues.   </li>
            <li>For severe cases, this should clear it up a bit, but not 100%.</li>
            <li>Sensitive on skin.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing pad is soft and rubbery, so it doesn&#x27;t seem abrasive to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Soft ...</li>
            <li>so it is extremely ingenious (at least to me) to have the scrubber attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and use this every day while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li>No harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li>You just got rid of dead skin cells, so it does leave the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Will be switching from my old brand.</li>
            <li>and oh so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>Has a soft plastic face scrubber attached to bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely not a waste.</li>
            <li>It makes the process so much easier and you can actually feel it working into your skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer with chronic adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Use a natural, cheaper product, like St. Ives or Mint Julep instead.</li>
            <li>, SCREW YOU, L&#x27;Oreal for using \\&quot;Natural Apricot\\&quot; in your label.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>The mini beads are gentle enough to exfoliate my skin and get rid of the dirt.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction like I sometimes do with face wash (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and i can see the difference...</li>
            <li>But so far they have not noticed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a big acne problem, but this really helps with blackheads.</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement in my skin while using this, and for the price I can find something else.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and supple after each wash.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin which st ives use to blister</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts me several months, making it very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its inexpensive anyway, but when you use it you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>Completely ineffective on blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive  skin but have not had issues.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than using a wash cloth (those always turn my face red or irritate it a lot)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>but it does not work very well to eliminate my larger bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scrubber it comes with is soft for your face</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and it does not cause break outs.  </li>
            <li>My skin color is completely even across my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle enough</li>
            <li>I dont have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li>not so much that you were taking off an entire epidermal layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just too soft with no grit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and actually quite relaxing.</li>
            <li>It makes me really feel like I&#x27;m getting deep into my pores.</li>
            <li>Who wants to by facial scrub every month?!  </li>
            <li>The little pad it comes to scrub your face is SOOO useful!</li>
            <li>This product is unique because it features a little scrubbie pad built into the bottle.</li>
            <li>but this prevented any small blemishes and was easy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin already but now that summers coming</li>
            <li>I generally have very sensitive skin, prone to products causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Even with my very sensitive skin, rosacea, and psoriasis, I have never had any issues with dryness or irritation, though I do generally use a moisturizer after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin, and it tends to flake, especially around my nose where I have blackheads.</li>
            <li>My face always comes out feeling soft and clean without being dried</li>
            <li>The fragrance is refreshing, fruity, and subtle.</li>
            <li>I technically wanted to give this product 3 1/2 stars, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used facial brushes in the past, and I like this scrubber better.</li>
            <li>But this is enough not to ruin my face for when I&#x27;m older.</li>
            <li>I started with the Deep Exfoliating Scrub the for my first time and switched to Deep Cream Cleanser</li>
            <li>I tried this out after thinking it&#x27;s a cool idea to have a little piece of silicon do the work for me.</li>
            <li>When I use this scrub, it leaves absolutely no trace of oil or dirt left on my face, and my skin is left soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>This is great for an everyday cleaner if you don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, but from my experience, it really doesn&#x27;t do much to clear troubled skin.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this products twice now, but have already felt such a big upgrade from my old cleanser which was the Neautrogena Deep Clean.</li>
            <li>As long as you are gentle while using the scrublet, you should not have any issues associated with over-exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>do use it daily because my skin gets gross pretty fast, but if you are going to do that I would suggest only using a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>: After a full 4 days of using it everyday, my nose started peeling a bit.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the cosmetic industry has taken to using these tiny little plastic beads in their products, claiming they&#x27;re the latest trend in facial scrubbing technology ... what a load of bull.</li>
            <li>, it comes with a rubber pad to wash ur face and it really gives u a deep clean with out tht hard grain pebbles</li>
            <li>It really massages my face and scrubs off the dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s and was concerned about using a deep cleaning system on my face so early on</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and pores look smaller!</li>
            <li>After my second use my blackheads are completely gone!</li>
            <li>I can use this scrub daily to remove all the dead skin, which is pretty much all I need.  </li>
            <li>So many of the facial scrubs come in such small containers.  </li>
            <li>The beads were a little harsh for my skin as I have very sensitive skin, so I will not purchase again, but if you really need to get in there and get those pores clean this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li>:) i&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days now (after using St. Ives apricot scrub daily for several years)</li>
            <li>This product is fun, because you get use of a little scrubber to use.</li>
            <li>I tucked it back into the hole in the bottle and my next thought was \\&quot;how clever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used only this L&#x27;Oreal face wash for 23 days in a row and only had ONE TEENY little bump, which was next to my hair line and can probably be more attributed to not rinsing out my conditioner enough.  </li>
            <li>chose this formula of the three available because it seemed to be the least chemical-ly, and I like the way it makes my skin feel and look so</li>
            <li>Overall, I do like this, but for my skin, I need something to help clear up my skin too.  </li>
            <li>Since I can suction it to the wall higher then they can reach its safe... until they figure out some crazy scheme to get to it</li>
            <li>So I went back to my old face wash</li>
            <li>And as an added bonus, even my husband loves to use the scrubber thing (I&#x27;m on my second bottle and let him have the one from my old bottle).</li>
            <li>so it can be aired out till the next cleaning</li>
            <li>It REALLY cleans without feeling rough at all.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently without being too rough</li>
            <li>The scrub in the middle of the bottle pops out, it is really soft rubbery silicone with tiny soft rubber molds of dimples on there</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin from being overly oily resulting in blackhead build up, as well as making my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft exfoliator brush, so you could use daily.</li>
            <li>my skin doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or anything it feels fresh</li>
            <li>Comes with a small pop out scrubber that you need to use for true exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent enough if you want a little deeper clean, but I wasn&#x27;t a big enough fan to justify using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I used to have to use only acne-fighting face cleaners, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that my face reacts to without a single problem (outside of any hormonal changes).</li>
            <li>have never been able to find a product that actually works without leading to negative effects, since my skin is so troublesome!</li>
            <li>This formula is a scrub, and I was worried how it would work with the scrub pad, but it&#x27;s not a very rough solution</li>
            <li>I thought it would just end up in the closet where I have whole ranges of other face and skin products.  </li>
            <li>It always feels ineffective and not penetrating enough if I gently scrub with my hand, so I usually put too much force and end up with a red/slightly hurting face.</li>
            <li>The microspheres are so little and soft that I sometimes I cannot teel it is really exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this because it also comes with a little scrub brush which helps get all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li>it really hurts and turn my eyes red and swollen for quite awhile, so I have to be careful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really dry.</li>
            <li>Each bottle comes with a clever little &amp;#34;scrublet&amp;#34; (soft flexible brush)</li>
            <li>When I first got this product and the cleansing one (green colored)</li>
            <li>I have big pores on certain parts of my face and tiny white bumps on my face, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on products trying to fix theses issues.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have to give it a thumbs down, but if you have REALLY oily skin</li>
            <li>I have cats, they love to steal little things like the scrubber or small face scrubbers from the tub and run off with them never to be seen again.</li>
            <li>I tried it a few days after I got it and was extremely surprised at how clean my face felt after using it with the little scrubbing thingy.  </li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a lower rating is because I know that part of the problem is my skin: it&#x27;s sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>I know L&#x27;Oreal got a lot of flack for hiring practices, racism, some other &#x27;isms&#x27;, and their \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth it\\&quot; tag line, but I have to give credit where it is due.</li>
            <li>The trick to getting the product to really exfoliate is to use the little rubber &#x27;scrublet&#x27; that is included in this package and run that all over the area you are using the product on.  </li>
            <li>also really like the little scrubber do-dad that comes with this face wash.  </li>
            <li>it feels like a very invigorating scrub and you can feel your face tingle a little bit.</li>
            <li>A gentle little massage.</li>
            <li>as a retiree, so much time and so little to do.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and does not dry it out like some other cleansers.</li>
            <li>This product has a delicate scent, which due to allergies, I can&#x27; t use anything with a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite products in the world, it&#x27;s great for any type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has a great smell.</li>
            <li> hmm...that sounds good.  </li>
            <li> I used this one for body shampoo,pretty good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Ulta and loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can emphasize how good it smells.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t judge on whether or not it helps breakouts, but it smells and feels good during and after use.</li>
            <li> Cleans good but smells like grapefruit. .</li>
            <li> After healing with murad line for acne, I needed a good face wash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> not as good as Neutrogena exfoliating face scrubs for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> face scrub pad was a good gimmick</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good bargain.  </li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, though.</li>

            <li> It feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent smells so good.</li>
            <li> The design is perfect to fit in your hand.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is just really really good.</li>
            <li> It felt good.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done ,good for the price</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel good</li>

            <li> The scrubby thing that comes on it seems like a good idea</li>
            <li> It  also smells great and has the handy scrubber attached that cleans even deeper.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is very interesting.  </li>
            <li> In samples taken from our expedition to The Great Lakes in 2012 we found these beads, in some cases numbering more than 600,000 per square kilometer!\\&quot; ... \\&quot;Micro-plastic particles have been found in fish, marine mammals and reptiles, and in the digestive and circulatory systems of mussels and worms.\\&quot;    I wrote this in a comment but wanted to share with</li>

            <li> I have purchased this product before and I am a very satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never been more happy to wash my face twice a day (which has a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m sure!!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells really nice &amp; does a good job exfoliating &amp; cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> i liked it but it does not work as good as the St.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it kind of dries my face out.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells so good, and it makes my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li> the cleanser on its own is good but the scrub is what exfoliates.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is very effective and make sure to exfoliate with your hands after.  </li>

            <li> For the price, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Bought this based on the amazing reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I remembered that my grandma used to use this stuff years ago over 30 years ago,</li>
            <li> Your face feels amazing after using.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING, cleans SOOO WELL</li>
            <li> amazing product.</li>
            <li> the rubber scrub pad that comes with this cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li> It was a nice soapy thing but</li>
            <li> but it really does smell that great!</li>
            <li> My face feels so nice after using this.</li>
            <li> The cleanser smells nice with a hint of apricot, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product but the bottle was very small,I will for now on check the bottle size.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin and a great way to start my day!</li>
            <li> (yes, eventually, I know I can make my own, but I&#x27;m just not there yet...</li>
            <li> I liked the scent, and the addition of the scrub was nice as well.</li>
            <li> So nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not like your skin smells like an apricot all day.</li>
            <li> but this is nice</li>
            <li> (I floss while I wait), then rinse off, using your hands or a washcloth and warm water, again moving in circles to loosen and remove the product.  </li>
            <li> and  It has a nice smell ( not too manly though).</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice.</li>
            <li> Also 1-2 days a week use something else, as you should with any kind of facewash</li>
            <li> I liked the gentleness of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> The face wash itself is nice but not mindblowing.</li>
            <li> So, kind of neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as a guy, its kind of embarassing recommending this to people</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this scrub, and when used alone, I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, and you do feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li> Great wash for the face, it leaves it really clean and refreshed, but has SLS and my trying to go organic</li>
            <li> After a wash my skin feels great and clean.</li>
            <li> This face wash is nice, it smells sweet and the scrub is fun to use, but I dont know if it is the best thing out there.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser as an alternative because it&#x27;s much gentler and comes with a great scrubbing tool that fits perfectly in the bottle and on my hand.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice too, it smells more like peaches than apricot to me</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and the beads/ exforliating materials are not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you do have some kind of cream on after.</li>
            <li> excellent the skin is soft as mentioned on the product</li>
            <li> I had good, smooth skin, but it had its flaws.</li>
            <li> skin felt much better with the St. Ives apricot scrub; to me, it has much effective ingredient for breakout problems than this product.</li>
            <li> This one does the best job by far.</li>
            <li> The scrubber feels awsome on my skin and it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> the price is cheap and good for cleansing.</li>
            <li> I love the scrublet and how nice it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice hint of grapefruit smell and gotta love what it comes with</li>
            <li> Smells great, the exfoliating scrublet that comes with the bottle is pretty handy, leaves my skin feeling softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new exfoliating scrub, it&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
            <li> the scrub brush works great not flumsy and the package was right on time at this price</li>
            <li> It smells nice and light, and it feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> smells great and my face feels great using this and my electric facial cleanser tool</li>
            <li> It seems to really clean my face good.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great face wash--it lathers up really really well with the scrubber!</li>
            <li> The smell is really great too, it&#x27;s mild and fruity, unlike a lot of really strong chemical-y smelling face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a very light exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a dude so this review may not be as informative for the more experienced ladies out there.</li>
            <li> had bought two of them...and i am really very happy with it...keeps face really clean and fresh.i am from a very humid climate so face gets more oily fast.but</li>
            <li> that feel pleasant and gentle, yet effective at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> so i quickly read the label and was relieved that my favorite face wash is good to go.</li>
            <li> I tried this product line and loved it from the first use!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and its cheap!</li>
            <li> Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> This scrub goes on so smooth and creamy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for better results the longer</li>
            <li> The scrublet works great with the Olay Pore Scrub, but all of these products works really well with the Pro-X battery powered skin brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> and i already love it ..</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> On top of that the fragrance is so refreshing and the scrubber is so therapeutic.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, if I use one product for too many days in a row, its like my skin gets too used to it</li>
            <li> But I love that smell.</li>
            <li> And the wash itself is just ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the nifty scrubber, and fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li> It works as well or better than the pricey stuff I used to get from the esthetician.     </li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok product</li>
            <li> I like this product; it smells lovely, and the lil pop out scrubby pad is an innovative idea.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the scrubby has a suction cup on the top</li>
            <li> might try a more exfoliating product when I run out of this; but I am not opposed to buying this again.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with the products.  </li>
            <li> Well, the pad is the magic.</li>
            <li> and I love the rubber scrubber it comes with, great for really exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;ve battled with acne since the day I got my &#x27;friend&#x27; (more like enemy).</li>
            <li> I love the scrubber that comes with it</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this scrub.  </li>
            <li> For the buck, you can&#x27;t get a better product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended in a sub reddit of Reddit as being &amp;#34;the best for one&#x27;s skin&amp;#34;, not leaving microabrasions and such.</li>
            <li> do love the scrublet and tried to find them for sale by themselves.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I had so many break outs and scars on my skin</li>
            <li> so you can probably use this for around 2months :)</li>
            <li> I like it ok.</li>
            <li> This would probably be better for someone with oilier skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, would recommend it without hesitation, and will be buying more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but the scrublet is PERFECT for people with facial piercings (or just any pierced area the want to scrub).</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the soap just not the spongy thing.</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell .</li>
            <li> and it was just from that one try, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3-4 yeas of me using this product and up to this day, I still love how it does its job.</li>
            <li> If you want more of a &amp;#34;chemical peel&amp;#34; type exfoliating gel, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I use this in my shower and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Love this product also works well .</li>
            <li> I received this product at a free or discounted price and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> For the time being I&#x27;m using this to scrub my legs and feet :))</li>
            <li> Me and my boyfriend love this scrub, he loves using the silicone face pad</li>
            <li> &amp; I love using this to help remove stubborn makeup and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I love the scrublet</li>
            <li> breaking many things in the process I am sure...</li>
            <li> none of them worked, this even made me break out even more</li>
            <li> unfortunately many stores are discontinuing the item</li>
            <li> Such a great cleanser!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough about how amazing this scrub is!!!</li>
            <li> Buy this product for many use this twice a week.best price for student.</li>
            <li> I love the Scrublet.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, clearer and much more healthy.</li>
            <li> People tell me my face looks more \\&quot;bronze\\&quot; nowadays.</li>
            <li> But I fell in love with it anyway.</li>
            <li> I really love this scrub ........</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> : I love that this is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Nothing much more.</li>
            <li> Used this to exfoliate my skin on my face and my pores seem to be much more cleansed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m opening my mind to more of a gentle approach with my skin, and this seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great cleanser that really scrubs out all the dirt and makeup without tearing up your skin.  </li>
            <li> lot of people are saying this product isn&#x27;t that great or that the scrub doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU AMAZON. :)</li>
            <li> I feel like it could use a bit more.</li>
            <li> woukd recommend this cleanser but be sure to spot treat if you get bumps.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.</li>
            <li> need to order some more of this</li>
            <li> /&gt;ir is neessary to order some more.</li>
            <li> Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> For the money , you can&#x27;t get a better product than this.  </li>
            <li> love the way it feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the microsrubbers.  </li>
            <li> Go buy it! :)</li>
            <li> did the job it has my face looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is held in the bottle</li>
            <li> For some reason, of all the face-washing products I have tried, this has been the most helpful in minimizing (but never curing)</li>
            <li> Great combination of cleansing and exfoliation- not harsh but effective.</li>
            <li> This leaves my face both feeling and looking more exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> and I sure have a thing for the peach smell.</li>
            <li> If you try and buy a product that is &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for use on the body, you&#x27;ll end up paying $10 or more.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scrub thingy.</li>
            <li> It is conveniently attached to the bottle and gives a better face scrub than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a nice light grapefruit</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Now think about more than just you using it.</li>
            <li> Either way, I enjoy them both!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it when I can choose items from my granddaughter&#x27;s wish list for birthdays and Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This one does everything and more that the top dollar creams and cleansers do, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating scrub brush.</li>
            <li> I like that L&#x27;Oreal gives more.  </li>
            <li> The scrubber is great and really helps you get your face nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and the exfoliating beads really do make your face smell fresh and feel even better!</li>
            <li> The scrubber is very gentle against your face and it does a good job at lathering the scrub, too.</li>
            <li> The idea of the attached scrubber is great that makes cleansing fast and easy.</li>
            <li> and it makes my face feel very clean</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant to give in to all the \\&quot;hoopla\\&quot; surrounding this product, but I needed a good exfoiliator</li>
            <li> Still pretty good product, I use it along with another one and rotate each day</li>
            <li> This is pretty good for getting rid of oil on the face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new face wash and purchased this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice apricot scent and is a mild exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I could even fill the bottle with a cleanser that I like better, although the cleanser works just fine.</li>
            <li> Honestly this cleared up my acne which I&#x27;ve had for over 5 years now and within the first week I noticed a change!</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and healthy feeling since I started using it.</li>
            <li> AND of course the most important of all .....</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Daily use of this product helps my combination skin to look nice, be smooth and follow up with a moisturizer makes a great starter to apply foundation and go on with my day.</li>
            <li> just kidding, i loved it, really</li>
            <li> Very soothing and feels good to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite products for our faces and it&#x27;s super cheap on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The best part is: you get a new one each time you buy a new package of this stuff!</li>
            <li> so it makes the blackheads easy to see.  </li>
            <li> I love the scrublet from my 360 Cleanser and was considering purchasing this version for a deeper clean and another scrublet.</li>
            <li> I used to use the loofah on my face because I liked being to able to really scrub all the grime off, I just couldn&#x27;t do that with my hands or a wash-cloth, and my piercings would always catch on my loofah-</li>
            <li> and I love the clean smell and</li>
            <li> Its easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It made sense to me and this stuff is an easy preventative that is working.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use in the shower and if it gets in your eye</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The face scrub also comes with a pad to clean you face with which is lovely</li>
            <li> The exfoliating pad pops into a hole in the bottle for easy storage.</li>
            <li> We had tried the L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 when it first came out, but never this exfoliating kind.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, it&#x27;s probably a good buy.</li>
            <li> everything is so much easier and refreshing and clean of course!!</li>
            <li> This feels really clean and fresh and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> Best facewash ever, hands down.</li>
            <li> This one works well and has a clean fresh scent that I liked.</li>
            <li> Even among the other Loreal go 360 line products, I&#x27;d give this one the gold medal--give it a try! :D</li>
            <li> At first it made my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I am a black woman and it is the best I have seen my medium brown skin tone.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise it cleans fine</li>
            <li> Finding a product that does not dry out my skin and fights blemishes is a great find in my book.</li>
            <li> The tiny scrub is awesome and this really exfoliates!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I think in buying products that say they heal blackhead or acne, we should look more closely on the inside rather than using a quick fix product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this is a good product to those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The little face cleaner that the soap comes with is the best.</li>
            <li> tell ya that little scrublette is awesome.</li>
            <li> cheap, very effective, helps to avoid break outs, do not dry out skin...</li>
            <li> After using this for about two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my blackheads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge help and makes life easier</li>
            <li> and I have not had a huge breakout</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen huge results.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth, I can&#x27;t get over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
            <li> When I rinse off the face wash, I can immediately tell the texture of my skin is smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will buy again for under $5 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> but it also leaves my face fealing really smooth.</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin smooth for a reason.</li>
            <li> Usually not into cheap brands, but this product is gentle and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> he fact that its ver gentle, I like the kind where I think my skin is coming off.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I like how cheap this product is and comes with a lil scrubber.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li> My blackheads were gone and my skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> it was cheap</li>
            <li> My face felt so silky and smooth after I got out.</li>
            <li> .my face is free of oil. .</li>
            <li> I got this one cheap too, and now the price is up up...</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a cheap exfoliating face wash that I like.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so great that I may even stop using foundation as part of my daily makeup regimen because my skin tone is looking so</li>
            <li> Brighten Up by Vasanti being one of the best I found that efficiently felt like you were removing dead skin but</li>
            <li> I use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System instead.  </li>
            <li> Great product  fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> The scrublet is really nice to use and is a big improvement from having to use your own fingers.</li>
            <li> It could exfoliate better, but its good enough.</li>
            <li> but it does seem to do a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Seems many reviewers really like it, but I find I get a better scrub just using my finger tips.  </li>
            <li> My friends and family tell me how good my face is looking and people ask me and I wearing makeup that is how clear my face has become.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty cool and the wash has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> After testing it to make sure the bottle contained the right product, i tried it.</li>
            <li> Love the way the scrubbing pad fits right into the container.</li>
            <li> My face feels very fresh and moisturized after using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I find something to put on my face that I trust</li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for the perfect makeup remover/cleanser for a few months when I stumbled upon the Go 360 Clean line.  </li>
            <li> It smells GREAT, like you just cut open an apricot, and it feels like your face is really clean after you get done using it.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done really well and leave a nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, I love it.</li>

            <li> Great face wash; you can feel it working as you scrub it in, smells pretty good too and the bottle lasts surprisingly long since you don&#x27;t need much each time</li>
            <li> LOVE AMAZON very much</li>
            <li> the fact that it is also able to stick to the wall made it super useful.</li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> [...]    --    This was absolutely my favorite face wash...until reading the reviews here, I realized that there was just too much plastic involved in this product, aargh!</li>
            <li> I love how it really feel cleans your fave without being too abrasive!</li>
            <li> My acne has significantly improved since switching to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant amount of difference in my face and blackheads, my face is smoother and my blackheads have almost all vanished.</li>
            <li> I have had many comments on how pretty my skin is since I started using this.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I was very, very excited.</li>
            <li> my face feels clean .</li>
            <li> When i usually clean my face if have to scrub and rub my t-zone area to the point where it is on fire when i get out just to get it clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, breathing, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 clean</li>
            <li> I have this thing about brushes and how it builds up dirt even though you clean it after each usage.</li>
            <li> I cook all day and after I get home and use this I feel so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling and looking clean without overdrying.</li>
            <li> Its alright,keeps your face clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel so clean</li>
            <li> Again, that&#x27;s my recommendation as I have found it most effective, but I have no medical training</li>
            <li> Gentle scrubbing action, smells great.</li>
            <li> to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this cleanser leaves me balanced and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought this facewash only for the exfoliating pad that comes with it, but I fell in LOVE with the facewash.</li>
            <li> 360 Clean does both.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean</li>
            <li> Makes my face super smooth.</li>
            <li> And after using it my face feels clean.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you want clean skin, but not exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> Daliy wash need it .price is super cheap .but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to find an exfoliator, but much harder to find one that smells this good!  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail quickly and was pleased when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s gimmicky and I fell for it, but it&#x27;s also a very nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Great exfoliating scrub and the packaging is practical and very clever with the little scrubby having it&#x27;s own home on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells great, feels like a massage when you put it on with the scrubber and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING afterwards, not tight or dry like others.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend anyone using this to invest in a good moisturizer as exfoliating does make the skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean after using it and it smells great, but not strong.</li>
            <li> I love the deep cleaning exfoliating scrub it makes my face feel clean, soft and it feels great.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and leaves my face smooth, dead skin free, and smelling great...</li>
            <li> I also noticed my blackheads were slowly disappearing which I was also very happy with because everything else</li>
            <li> , just wish that i got a full bottle like i paid for.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel clean and refreshed and just super super clean.</li>
            <li> This shipped to my house fast and my acne is noticeably better.</li>
            <li> The product itself is has a nice scent and it scrub is soft for the face.</li>
            <li> You lose so much space for more liquid because there is a hole in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It especially feels good on my face</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash and finally stumped upon this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite time to use this cleanser is in the morning and it gives me a very refreshed, energized feeling.</li>
            <li> I love how well the exfoliating beads work, but they&#x27;re still gentle.</li>
            <li> also it well cleans the skin,your skin feels really cleansed,I love it and do intend to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads are not abrasive - they&#x27;re more on the gentle side.</li>
            <li> The scrubs are perfect consistency - not too rough or big, but not whimpy or too many either.</li>
            <li> Cool bottle design.  </li>
            <li> Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scrublet -</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product so much that I got 2 bottles of it.</li>
            <li> The idea of it is cool</li>
            <li> I do love loreal but this product upset me so much</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this scrub was good and definitely made my face lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, for the scrubber more than the soap itself.</li>
            <li> I honestly purchased this as a mistake but was pleasantly surprised by how it worked.  </li>
            <li> Such a good price</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re not bad to begin with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;d say for $4 this is not a bad deal at all.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad cleanser, I just prefer the scrubby beads from the Proactiv cleanser.</li>
            <li> The scrublet is great not cheap at all and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Mainly just blackheads which honestly this is the first product that worked...</li>
            <li> Feels great and  makes my face feel softer and smoother than any other scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and the smell is great too its not overpowering like some other products</li>
            <li> it is great, this is my first time use exfoliating product, it really help to exfoliate, i love that little tool on it to help clean, i love the smell, everything, thanks alot!</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean</li>
            <li> Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scublet - that makes cleansing fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The scrub feels nice, and it left my skin feeling smooth, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in blackheads/clogged pores.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating is the perfect amount, not too rough and not too soft.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a pretty long time as well and for the amount you pay for, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> give it 3 stars still for cleansing out my face,the cute scrublet, and the low price, but I&#x27;ve seen better exfoliators out there.</li>
            <li> With the facial cleaner and the scrub, this is one of the best deep-cleaning facial cleaners i have found.  </li>
            <li> my face is clearing up from the mild break outs I was having abd</li>
            <li> Super drying</li>
            <li> Sure, it takes away from total bottle oz, but for the novelty... I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li> quick service</li>
            <li> In my mind, there are better exfoliators out there for the same or better price.</li>
            <li> the scrublet works well in cleansing :) highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so something that&#x27;s still on the market that long has got to be good.    </li>
            <li> Hands down a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough, it smells good, and it leaves my face totally clean.</li>
            <li> I am about 3/4 way into my first bottle and will most certainly be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Also love the little beads in it &amp; it always makes my face feel so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Update, my new favorite non-plastic based scrub is the [[ASIN:B001E0W30U</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite scrub.</li>
            <li> I typically use it once a week to exfoliate and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle for relatively inexpensive and it works well.</li>
            <li> The small beads on it make it a perfect tool for washing your face and really getting into your pores.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you will need to use a good mosturizer after you cleanse.</li>
            <li> have found success in Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) wash (Glytone mild gel wash) for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice sofar, received it yesterday, but what an ingenious invention!</li>
            <li> I first started shopping on Amazon to see if I could find the product without the plastic scrubber since I never use it, and then realized that all of the exfoliating scrubby microbeads are also PLASTIC (polyethelene)!  </li>
            <li> Within the first use, the majority of the blackheads on my nose were gone!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li> and it works really well!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Note that I have used strong topical acne products (retin-A, benzaclin) for many years and have no problem using this in combination with those.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> its also very cheap and has natural exfoliating bead things.</li>
            <li> The scrub brush is pretty nice, it really does get into spots your hands or fingers normally couldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well,  didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or anything, and  my face felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve had no breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;Until I found L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing for sensitive skin, nice mild scent.  </li>
            <li> It has the little apricot polishing/exfoliating beads, smells pleasant, and gets the face clean.  </li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t see an improvement but it leaves my skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to remove the excess make up but gentle enough to keep your face good clean and not strip away too much of your natural good oils on your face.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, actually cheap.</li>
            <li> The beads are smooth and not irritating.</li>
            <li> It works great to get off dead skin as well for the morning</li>
            <li> I liked this deep cleaning and brush also.</li>
            <li> It has a yummy fresh grapefruit-y fragrance and granules for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> The Go 360 Clean is gentler and does a nice job of cleansing without leaving you with an overly dry or irritated complexion.  </li>
            <li> I actually find the gimmick of storing the pad in the bottle to be a nice convenience.  </li>
            <li> it was reslly worth it...</li>
            <li> , so this is a nice daily use wash.</li>
            <li> i rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a regular kind of face scrub.</li>
            <li> but I rarely go there</li>
            <li> have the most sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Instead, take le_revolution&#x27;s advice and try out the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]].  </li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling fresh faced.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, would buy again.</li>
            <li> , fresh citrus scent</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually effective with the scrub provided; I have seen noticeable difference with my nose blackheads/pores and the face overall.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it if buying things in a bundle purchase because the shipping price drops to zero.</li>
            <li> product works as well as the HeadBlade stuff, smells better, and costs far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li> my skin is still fresh.</li>
            <li> the exfoliating scrub brush thing is lots of fun to use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Also it is rare that i get acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh, I really like the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> The little scrubby that comes with it is very nice too.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and does a great job and the scrubbing pad is just right for every day use.</li>
            <li> The flavor is awesome as well, I might want to try some other flavors next time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product is any better than many other products.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser, it makes your face feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large pores and I&#x27;ve tried tons of products to help me keep them clean.</li>
            <li> More over, the scent of the facial cleaner is very nice, subtle, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Really exposes fresh clean skin after exfoliation</li>
            <li> Once done, my skin is clean, smooth and amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser has a nice mild scent,  doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and has helped keep my break outs under control.  </li>
            <li> But it is too clean, so I can only use it twice mostly, better once.</li>
            <li> Blackheads are a constant battle you need to make sure you don&#x27;t clog your pores with dirt and always clean your face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean afterwards and not dried out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this facial cleanser, my first through was that the rubber scrubber, while a nice addition, felt like it would fall apart quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it applies just the right amount of pressure to your skin</li>
            <li> The smell is just right.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated my face and then plucked the hair out of my face right afterwards.</li>
            <li> Right now my face is breaking out a lot (I&#x27;m guessing hormones) and</li>
            <li> This product was all right.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just right for applying the scrub.</li>
            <li> I never meant to right a review</li>
            <li> Its just the right consistency to pull blackheads out of my face.</li>
            <li> so i washed it right off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been prone to breakouts and my skin had been pretty clear compared to most of my friends.</li>
            <li> The scent is very refreshing, and the scrubbie brush really makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i do like this product but only gave it four stars because i&#x27;ll need to use it more to form a full opinion of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am modern man ( yup, I do  take care of  my skin ) with mix skin type, and let me tell you that L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean</li>
            <li> I couldnt really tell if it did anything special for me</li>
            <li> The actual product, the exfoliating cleaner, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as well as other brands, although it does leave a very pleasant smell on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I use St- Ives and enjoy the pasty texture of that product.</li>
            <li> , Deep Exfoliating Scrub is the best  on in the market, I just applied it and it  has left my skin  soft ,  </li>
            <li> After just the first use, my face was so much softer and felt extremely clean.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean when I use it, but it also feels that way with pretty much every cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like the bottle of this product, and the little scrublet is a great idea in theory.  </li>
            <li> I love this and love the little scrubber and the way it is attached to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and really gets your face clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I never expected to love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> I totally regret my purchase and will do my best to encourage my friends and acquaintances to avoid these sham products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This exfoliating scrub smells so nice and works very well in deep cleaning your pores.</li>
            <li> Good and can use for half a year.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and after a good month of using it at least once or twice a day, the blackheads have almost gone away and my face is smooth as hell.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and exfoliates gently so you can use it daily without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because the producer could easily swap out the plastic beads for something natural (walnut shells?)</li>
            <li> This product is very reasonably priced for what it does.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it gets my face very clean and takes the dead skin off.  </li>
            <li> The little scrubber makes my pores look so good and this apricot smells</li>
            <li> This product really left my face feeling clean and smooth .</li>
            <li> This face wash keeps my face clear of breakouts while making my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my face feeling fresh, clean and clear of any pimples.</li>
            <li> I have used this since it first came on the market.</li>
            <li> I had lent it to a friend, before I was aware of the beginning of a breakout, when she used it it has caused her to break out immediately.</li>
            <li> first use</li>
            <li> The price is not bad, especially since you don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount.....</li>
            <li> .this is my first time using these cleanser</li>
            <li> I bought this product not even being aware it came with a \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When i first opened the product i figured</li>
            <li> I think this really works!</li>
            <li> ...contain my enthousiasm ;)</li>
            <li> First of all, if you like a &amp;#34;fake chemical apricot&amp;#34; smell, perhaps the smell will be tolerable.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth when I use this as directed.</li>
            <li> --i dont want to end up in my 30s having used nearly everything and making my skin become immune to everything available on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably look for something more exfoliating/abrasive next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> The only downside is if you wear eye make up, be sure not to get it around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Love this face scrub....highly recommend as a daily wash!!</li>
            <li> I no longer have tiny bumps on my forehead, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say in about 4 years.</li>
            <li> Can I first express how bummed I am that Target doesn&#x27;t sell this in store anymore nor online?</li>
            <li> Especially when going on trips or something, it&#x27;s so convenient and cleans so much better than just using your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff really delivers!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to gently cleanse your face and give it a teeny tiny massage at the same time.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I still get an occasional blemish (maybe once every month or so), but not even as many as I got using a cleanser by a brand known for anti-acne products.  </li>
            <li> It does clear up blackheads and leaves your face feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> Would most definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have added it to my subscribe-and-save as a regular item.  </li>
            <li> aware, though, that this PROBABLY won&#x27;t get rid of your blackheads.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try it because it was my first time.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li> think I may be allergic to it because I find that I wake up with more red bumps on my face in the morning</li>
            <li> And it really smells like fresh peaches.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I had used one that had the &#x27;scrubbies&#x27; and after starting the exfoliating process again and not having them, I sure missed them.  </li>
            <li> The scrublet is so useful for cleaning your face really well</li>
            <li> The built in facial scrubber is ingenious.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the extra scrubbie attached.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li> I can finally go more than an hour without oily skin and my pores are always smaller after cleansing than before.</li>
            <li> I went back to my neutrogena exfoliator and put a mask on my skin and moisturizer and my skin is all better now</li>
            <li> This feels more like just a cream facial wash....</li>
            <li> Still on the look out for a better facial scrub.</li>
            <li> That way I know she is getting exactly what she wants!</li>
            <li> The scrubber it comes with is cute but its not necessary.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh smell, and the little beads create just the right amount of exfoliation for me.  </li>
            <li> This comes with a small rubber scrubber built right into the bottle that is really good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says and is a good exfoliant, but not for people with sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is safe, gentle but exfoliates down to fresh clean skin.  </li>
            <li> It do exactly how it describe  skin soft, shiny and clean</li>
            <li> As for the exfoliating cleanser, it is just ok mainly because the scrubbing particles don&#x27;t really exfoliate well, they&#x27;re too suspended in the gel, and it is just a little bit drying, better for using during the summer.</li>
            <li> It works amazing, immediately I can see my pores got smaller and it makes my skin feel soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> After trying Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, and Biore products, I still had not found a product to minimize my pores AND oil production.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Oxy, Biore, and Clean and Clear</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s make you&#x27;r skin soft and clean</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Since I just got this product, I can&#x27;t say how well it works yet at clearing up acne, but I know that after I use it, my face feels amazingly soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face so clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> It deep cleans and leaves my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently tried using that again just to make sure it was really this causing issues and</li>
            <li> You really couldn&#x27;t get a better facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It also comes with its&#x27; own pad right on the bottle, which is rubber with little bumps on it.  </li>
            <li> Although the little scrublet is nice, the apricot beads help give it that extra bit to do a better job in exfoliating.</li>
            <li> within 3 days of using this i see positive results, makes my skin look</li>
            <li> The little beads inside the soap make your face feel refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li> Of course I tried pretty much all the acne reducing products under the sun.</li>
            <li> every time when I use it, I need to wash my face for a long time to make sure i wash it out.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, and I guess it cleans pretty well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure it does good job or not .won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful, is gentle, smoothes and soothes my skin, the scrubber is soft and easily conforms to your face,and a little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very harsh and gives you a sensation of clean skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff is comparable to top dollar cleansers, left my face soft, pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it my blavkheads and pimples were gone, my pores were a lot smaller, and my skin was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face seeing as I&#x27;ve NEVER had completely smooth skin up until now.</li>
            <li> Different products work differently for different skin, and so far this one works best for mine.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It bends extremely easily and isn&#x27;t as fragile as it looks!     </li>
            <li> Skin is left feeling smooth and clean, no residue - like so far.</li>
            <li> Usually I love loreal but after using this I got pimples, bumps on my face, and backed up dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Go 360 Clean line but especially the Deep Exfoliating Scrub version.  </li>
            <li> If you use it wisely it does last long.</li>
            <li> My pores are rather large</li>
            <li> I am age 49 and have large pores and problems with blackheads.</li>
            <li> If you have large pores and blackheads, this is a must buy for you.</li>
            <li> I buy this product purely for the face scrubber that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of large pores.</li>
            <li> I have large pores but it seems to minimize them.  </li>
            <li> It contains large beads that i don&#x27;t feel exfoliates at all.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes far and makes your skin feel nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it would be really bad if I stopped using my face cream (its the best I&#x27;ve tried - super moisturizing without exacerbating my skin issues).  </li>
            <li> It cleans your face gently but the sponge exfoliant is soft enough to not harm your skin and love that it is attached to the bottle which I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I received it.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I seriously did not even need to put any kind of makeup on!  </li>
            <li> so clever!</li>
            <li> As warm weather hits my skin goes a little nuts.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it, even for the pretty girls</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris deep exfoliating scrub is great once every week when I need to exfoliate my dead skin cells on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cleanser which have left my skin feeling greasy and heavy, but this is great.</li>
            <li> It has caused my self esteem to drop in a very drastic rate.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with how this turned out.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> My face looks much clearer and I no longer feel the blackhead &#x27;bumps&#x27; when I touch my nose or the skin around it.</li>
            <li> hahahahaha</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> Really like the brush attached to this bottle.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal really hit a home run with this model, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> but I find myself feeling SO MUCH HAPPIER having waited and using this product.  </li>
            <li> and It looked promising.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really one of those scrubs you don&#x27;t mind getting stuck in your nose.</li>
            <li> It smells like real apricots.</li>
            <li> my pores were really clogged</li>
            <li> But the exfoliating pad and the contents of the loreal product seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> The cap itself is not broken yet inside the cap</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> and it may irritate skin with too much use.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need that much of a cleaning.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Thanks to le_revolution&#x27;s review</li>
            <li> Shopping on Amazon.com makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about it ridding blackheads since I don&#x27;t have much of that.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t see as much exfoliation as it claims</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in breakouts and stuff</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works really well, exfoliates and cleans the face</li>
            <li> This really gets rid of blackheads on your nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Before I used this scrub, I had blackheads, and a face that gets very oily.</li>
            <li> Only rated it three stars because its nothing fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it really exfoliate as well.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and body, it cleans skin very well.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; tingle &amp; gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Gentle and</li>
            <li> I have skin sensitivities, but I use this product in the evening and a gentle cleanser (like Cerave) in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But, it really depends on the skin type you have.</li>
            <li> The scrublet helps to exfoliate, but is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it cleans it really well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for a gentle face scrub.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub.</li>
            <li> the bottle&#x27;s look, the brush (even though I don&#x27;t use it much).</li>
            <li> beads are really exfoliating</li>
            <li> /&gt;It foams up really well</li>
            <li> Thanks to this face wash</li>
            <li> If it hadn&#x27;t bothered mine so much, I would have kept it.</li>
            <li> Also, exfoliation removes tans, so if you want to maintain a tan scrub gently.</li>
            <li> It was gentle and yet it felt like it was exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and smells very fragrant.</li>
            <li> fresh n young...</li>
            <li> Really like put on auto order.</li>
            <li> I really like the scrublet</li>
            <li> It has a detachable applicator that works very well.</li>
            <li> so real</li>
            <li> then \\&quot;dermanew\\&quot; products during whole month...</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the smell is fabulous.</li>
            <li> The beads don&#x27;t really do much on my face.</li>
            <li> but it really works that well.</li>
            <li> this product comes with a plastic rubber scrub which gently exfoliates your face.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It gentle</li>
            <li> As a busy executive, facing numerous people each day in meetings and otherwise, my face has to look as good as it possibly can.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and ex foliating without being too harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that since using this product I have been breaking out a lot more frequently, when I used to only break out during my &#x27;time of the month&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It smells sooo good, and left my skin looking clearer and feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li> Right after I wash, I definitely noticed a difference right away in terms of how clear my face looks, but I would recommend this product more for people with large pore/blackhead/oil issues than to people prone to getting a lot of actual pimples.</li>
            <li> If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right one for you.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild but clean and refreshing, and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It really does clean 360 especially with the help of that sponge</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cleanser, particularly when the weather is warmer and sweat leaves me feeling gross.  </li>
            <li> I think it smells more peachy than citrusy, unlike the other commenters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I have done is use the scrubber with other cleansers- which works better than using my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this only for 3 times (twice a day) and this has significantly improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to scrub my whole face, neck and chest that I find myself scrubbing longer than I normally do.</li>
            <li> You have an extra chore because you have to clean it or else</li>
            <li> such a clean feel</li>
            <li> A nice little prize!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this if you want that gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and not oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li> , this is not natural, organic, free from &amp;#34;harmful&amp;#34; chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true fan, and I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised by how much I like this face cleanser!</li>
            <li> must recommend that, in order to allow the salicylic acid to most effectively slough off dead cells/remove impurities and oil in pores, you wet your face and the scrublet, put a nickel-sized amount of the product on the scrublet, gently massage onto your face in circles, then let the foam sit on your face several seconds to a minute</li>
            <li> When your lips are dry and flaky, use the scrubber--without cleanser--on your lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> and when it is the winter I&#x27;m quite glad because less oil production.</li>
            <li> but it was a lot more drying and way less exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> The scrubber that comes with this cleanser is decent for that.</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back the Deep Exfoliating Scrub and love it.  </li>
            <li> Back in the day, I used to use the St. Yves almond kind, which was basically crushed almond shells.</li>
            <li> It is a very comfortable rubber with little scrublets.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the high priced products do</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This is a great daily face wash that not only cleanses and removes make up but gently exfoliated away dead skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways I highly suggest giving this facewash a try, no matter your skin type.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little exfoliating beads and gives you a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I will just refill the bottle with other face cleansers when it is empty - I don&#x27;t think the solution that matters, but this stuff does smell really good.</li>
            <li> back then, I felt like it stripped the good oils in my face and left my face extremely dry where I would need to pack up on the moisturizer to keep it from breaking my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week when i need to exfoliate my face because any more than that will dry it out too much.</li>
            <li> With other brands, I feel like I&#x27;m just kind of wasting my time or simply washing with soap.</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubby thing that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The little exfoliating scrubber that it comes with is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it and it has a little scrubber comes with it which is also a plus.  </li>
            <li> I wish it has more of the little beads</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a little face washing pad that is always with the wash because it sticks through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubby and</li>
            <li> and i love the little scrub pad it comes with...</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubber that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the little apricot beads.</li>
            <li> I love the little scrub pad that comes with it.</li>
            <li> when I scrubbed I felt like I was getting a little more grit in</li>
            <li> , I had been using Olay&#x27;s Pro-X and the exfoliating face wash that comes with it, Simple Moisturizing Face Wash, and Clean and Clear Advantage</li>
            <li> The scrublet is actually useful and best of all isn&#x27;t hard and tough like you would imagine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now in my skincare routine, and it really helps my skin stay clear.</li>
            <li> My face is clean, ridiculously smooth, much less oily, and my pores are so tiny, they are virtually non existent.</li>
            <li> This cleaner does do everything that L&#x27;Oreal says it will- clean, reduce appearance of pores, and won&#x27;t over dry-</li>
            <li> However, the come-on that it has natural apricot seeds for exfoliating is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an islander and naturally I was born with very oily skin, matched with my tan skin if that has anything to do with it.</li>
            <li> Removes make up very well and it is not harsh on your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Second, the granules are just a bit too small and too sparse to do a good job scrubbing.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t carry my normal cleanser</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with occassional acne break outs.</li>
            <li> For the green colored one I thought the scrublet worked better, but for this one I would rather use my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh exfoliating facial scrub!</li>
            <li> u normally feel in scrubs</li>
            <li> this was a big success.</li>
            <li> The results of this facial exfoliator are neither better nor worse than most products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> things I really like about it:&lt;br /&gt;The little scrub is easy to use</li>
            <li> and the actual product is pretty good too, definitely no complaints, it makes my skin feel clean, a little bit dry, but a slight moisturizer can fix that easily-</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubbing disk, it&#x27;s very soft and glides over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser isn&#x27;t strong enough for me, so I wash with a second cleanser after.</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;normal&#x27; type skin, and I was not having a lot of breakouts, but I needed a new face wash, so I tried this out.</li>
            <li> The facial scrubby pad was a neat gimmick, I can&#x27;t tell if it really worked, but you do notice a clean feeling, especially around the area where your nose meets your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried St. Ives (which only made my skin really soft), Clean and clear (which got rid of the blackheads but gave me a lot of pimples) and then this product.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin smooth not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin that sometimes is very sensitive,</li>
            <li> The little hand-held scrubbing mat that comes with each bottle of face cleaner is a really nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> it really helps clean down in your pores.</li>
            <li> I thought i was supposed to be getting a NEW product??</li>
            <li> it is a new item.</li>
            <li> I have a new found confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin out like many other products do.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else really works well for me, no matter how much it may claim to \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; or \\&quot;unclog pores\\&quot; or \\&quot;kill bacteria.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do it probably 2-3 times a week because my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love the little scrub pad, too!  </li>
            <li> but this tiny sponge really amazed me, even after my very first use of this product showed me bigger result</li>
            <li> The scrubber is a very soft rubber.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> It is a very soft rubber.</li>
            <li> being as I&#x27;m very young and</li>
            <li> But in high school, I developed hard-to-get-rid-of blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first facial exfoliant (I&#x27;m very young but have some blackheads)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m all clear again!</li>
            <li> My face is clear and glowing!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The scrubber seemed flimsy at first but is actually quite sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li> I want a big one for the whole body!</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it on my entire body haha!</li>
            <li> Recently though it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> I was surprised!</li>
            <li> I spotted one at a DAISO for $1.50, exact same thing.</li>
            <li> made facial wash exfoliants which was pretty unreal to read about</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smoother and cleans deep to remove oil and dirt making your pores appear smaller and smaller with every use, the exfoliating cleanser makes your skin appear more youthful and smoother while getting rid of the shine caused from oils.</li>
            <li> Curious who did the cool design.</li>
            <li> It is a little strong for me and drys my skin out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice daily exfoliating scrub - meaning it has little exfoliating beads, but they&#x27;re gentle enough for every day use.</li>
            <li> but when I reach for L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean because not only does it deeply exfoliate</li>
            <li> I have an unearthly oily nose and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to help much at all with that, however it&#x27;s very helpful with other parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> Clean Deep Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin that I purchased, trying to avoid these beads.</li>
            <li> i like this scrub pretty well so far since i have only used it once.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the little brush that comes with it</li>
            <li> Nice product and very delicate.</li>
            <li> I love the idea to have the little scrubber sitting in the middle of the bottle</li>
            <li> I love this scrub and the tiny little exfoliating scrub pad that comes with</li>
            <li> I love the little scrub thingy it comes with!!</li>
            <li> Does it clear blackheads and acne etc?...</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product to make up the minimum purchase for free shipping and had absolutely no expectations of it.  </li>
            <li> It kept my skin clear, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to clear that up</li>
            <li> Also, this has helped clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the search for clear skin continues.   </li>
            <li> For severe cases, this should clear it up a bit, but not 100%.</li>
            <li> Sensitive on skin.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing pad is soft and rubbery, so it doesn&#x27;t seem abrasive to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Soft ...</li>
            <li> so it is extremely ingenious (at least to me) to have the scrubber attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and use this every day while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li> No harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li> You just got rid of dead skin cells, so it does leave the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Will be switching from my old brand.</li>
            <li> and oh so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> Has a soft plastic face scrubber attached to bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely not a waste.</li>
            <li> It makes the process so much easier and you can actually feel it working into your skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer with chronic adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Use a natural, cheaper product, like St. Ives or Mint Julep instead.</li>
            <li> , SCREW YOU, L&#x27;Oreal for using \\&quot;Natural Apricot\\&quot; in your label.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> The mini beads are gentle enough to exfoliate my skin and get rid of the dirt.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction like I sometimes do with face wash (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and i can see the difference...</li>
            <li> But so far they have not noticed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big acne problem, but this really helps with blackheads.</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement in my skin while using this, and for the price I can find something else.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and supple after each wash.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which st ives use to blister</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me several months, making it very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its inexpensive anyway, but when you use it you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> Completely ineffective on blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive  skin but have not had issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than using a wash cloth (those always turn my face red or irritate it a lot)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> but it does not work very well to eliminate my larger bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrubber it comes with is soft for your face</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and it does not cause break outs.  </li>
            <li> My skin color is completely even across my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle enough</li>
            <li> I dont have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li> not so much that you were taking off an entire epidermal layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just too soft with no grit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and actually quite relaxing.</li>
            <li> It makes me really feel like I&#x27;m getting deep into my pores.</li>
            <li> Who wants to by facial scrub every month?!  </li>
            <li> The little pad it comes to scrub your face is SOOO useful!</li>
            <li> This product is unique because it features a little scrubbie pad built into the bottle.</li>
            <li> but this prevented any small blemishes and was easy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin already but now that summers coming</li>
            <li> I generally have very sensitive skin, prone to products causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Even with my very sensitive skin, rosacea, and psoriasis, I have never had any issues with dryness or irritation, though I do generally use a moisturizer after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, and it tends to flake, especially around my nose where I have blackheads.</li>
            <li> My face always comes out feeling soft and clean without being dried</li>
            <li> The fragrance is refreshing, fruity, and subtle.</li>
            <li> I technically wanted to give this product 3 1/2 stars, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial brushes in the past, and I like this scrubber better.</li>
            <li> But this is enough not to ruin my face for when I&#x27;m older.</li>
            <li> I started with the Deep Exfoliating Scrub the for my first time and switched to Deep Cream Cleanser</li>
            <li> I tried this out after thinking it&#x27;s a cool idea to have a little piece of silicon do the work for me.</li>
            <li> When I use this scrub, it leaves absolutely no trace of oil or dirt left on my face, and my skin is left soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> This is great for an everyday cleaner if you don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, but from my experience, it really doesn&#x27;t do much to clear troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this products twice now, but have already felt such a big upgrade from my old cleanser which was the Neautrogena Deep Clean.</li>
            <li> As long as you are gentle while using the scrublet, you should not have any issues associated with over-exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> do use it daily because my skin gets gross pretty fast, but if you are going to do that I would suggest only using a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> : After a full 4 days of using it everyday, my nose started peeling a bit.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the cosmetic industry has taken to using these tiny little plastic beads in their products, claiming they&#x27;re the latest trend in facial scrubbing technology ... what a load of bull.</li>
            <li> , it comes with a rubber pad to wash ur face and it really gives u a deep clean with out tht hard grain pebbles</li>
            <li> It really massages my face and scrubs off the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and was concerned about using a deep cleaning system on my face so early on</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and pores look smaller!</li>
            <li> After my second use my blackheads are completely gone!</li>
            <li> I can use this scrub daily to remove all the dead skin, which is pretty much all I need.  </li>
            <li> So many of the facial scrubs come in such small containers.  </li>
            <li> The beads were a little harsh for my skin as I have very sensitive skin, so I will not purchase again, but if you really need to get in there and get those pores clean this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> :) i&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days now (after using St. Ives apricot scrub daily for several years)</li>
            <li> This product is fun, because you get use of a little scrubber to use.</li>
            <li> I tucked it back into the hole in the bottle and my next thought was \\&quot;how clever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used only this L&#x27;Oreal face wash for 23 days in a row and only had ONE TEENY little bump, which was next to my hair line and can probably be more attributed to not rinsing out my conditioner enough.  </li>
            <li> chose this formula of the three available because it seemed to be the least chemical-ly, and I like the way it makes my skin feel and look so</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like this, but for my skin, I need something to help clear up my skin too.  </li>
            <li> Since I can suction it to the wall higher then they can reach its safe... until they figure out some crazy scheme to get to it</li>
            <li> So I went back to my old face wash</li>
            <li> And as an added bonus, even my husband loves to use the scrubber thing (I&#x27;m on my second bottle and let him have the one from my old bottle).</li>
            <li> so it can be aired out till the next cleaning</li>
            <li> It REALLY cleans without feeling rough at all.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates gently without being too rough</li>
            <li> The scrub in the middle of the bottle pops out, it is really soft rubbery silicone with tiny soft rubber molds of dimples on there</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin from being overly oily resulting in blackhead build up, as well as making my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft exfoliator brush, so you could use daily.</li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or anything it feels fresh</li>
            <li> Comes with a small pop out scrubber that you need to use for true exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent enough if you want a little deeper clean, but I wasn&#x27;t a big enough fan to justify using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I used to have to use only acne-fighting face cleaners, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that my face reacts to without a single problem (outside of any hormonal changes).</li>
            <li> have never been able to find a product that actually works without leading to negative effects, since my skin is so troublesome!</li>
            <li> This formula is a scrub, and I was worried how it would work with the scrub pad, but it&#x27;s not a very rough solution</li>
            <li> I thought it would just end up in the closet where I have whole ranges of other face and skin products.  </li>
            <li> It always feels ineffective and not penetrating enough if I gently scrub with my hand, so I usually put too much force and end up with a red/slightly hurting face.</li>
            <li> The microspheres are so little and soft that I sometimes I cannot teel it is really exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this because it also comes with a little scrub brush which helps get all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> it really hurts and turn my eyes red and swollen for quite awhile, so I have to be careful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really dry.</li>
            <li> Each bottle comes with a clever little &amp;#34;scrublet&amp;#34; (soft flexible brush)</li>
            <li> When I first got this product and the cleansing one (green colored)</li>
            <li> I have big pores on certain parts of my face and tiny white bumps on my face, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on products trying to fix theses issues.</li>
            <li> All in all, I have to give it a thumbs down, but if you have REALLY oily skin</li>
            <li> I have cats, they love to steal little things like the scrubber or small face scrubbers from the tub and run off with them never to be seen again.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few days after I got it and was extremely surprised at how clean my face felt after using it with the little scrubbing thingy.  </li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a lower rating is because I know that part of the problem is my skin: it&#x27;s sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> I know L&#x27;Oreal got a lot of flack for hiring practices, racism, some other &#x27;isms&#x27;, and their \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth it\\&quot; tag line, but I have to give credit where it is due.</li>
            <li> The trick to getting the product to really exfoliate is to use the little rubber &#x27;scrublet&#x27; that is included in this package and run that all over the area you are using the product on.  </li>
            <li> also really like the little scrubber do-dad that comes with this face wash.  </li>
            <li> it feels like a very invigorating scrub and you can feel your face tingle a little bit.</li>
            <li> A gentle little massage.</li>
            <li> as a retiree, so much time and so little to do.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and does not dry it out like some other cleansers.</li>
            <li> This product has a delicate scent, which due to allergies, I can&#x27; t use anything with a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores that are always just dirty, and i&#x27;m hoping the pad will get in there and clean them out so they can close up a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love the little scrubbing beads and the pad that comes with it to battle the residual of a long, hard day</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, I noticed that my face didn&#x27;t appear as oily as it normally does half way through the hectic days at the office.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday, and a little bit goes a long way, it leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it because I have used multiple skincare products in the past that have not worked.</li>
            <li> The microbeads from products like these and this product in particular, are nonbiodegradeable and are destroying aquatic life.</li>
            <li> No rashes, no bumps, had some redness the first use but probably because I used to scrublet a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates very well and all of my dead skin is removed; I have not felt dry flakes since using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time &amp; energy to pack it back up &amp; bring to the post office considering it cost only 4.99, so i&#x27;ll keep it regardless of it being opened &amp; used (apparently)</li>
            <li> This is soapy scrub, but with the pad, you get long lasting scrubbing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing to note, don&#x27;t press very hard and you probably don&#x27;t want to use it more than a few times per week.</li>
            <li> I little scrubber is very soft and works the solution in well.</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubber but this product always makes my faces break out even worse.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the dry flaking, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or feeling damaged.</li>
            <li> The dry scales don&#x27;t show up until the next day, but they are there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Garnier Moisture Rescue SPF 15 Cream, but this scrub didn&#x27;t dry my face out enough to need a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> or so it has become extremely dry to the point where I feel I have to exfoliate almost daily.</li>
            <li> Less expensive and equal or better quality to the St. Ives facial scrub.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and it does help black heads on my nose, but for acne every where else-</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is very dry and it is hard to find a facial cleanser that makes my face feel and look clean without it feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a soft silicone, with little &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It comes with a little exfoliating pad which is soft against your skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Analyzing facial cleanser products, 5 Gyres estimates that a single product can contain over 300,000 of these beads!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time, cleans my pores very well, hardly have break outs.  </li>
            <li> I will not purchase it again, even if only ONE of those reasons were the case, because it ruins the overall effect.</li>
            <li> In colder months, I like the sensitive cleanser, supplemented with this once a week to help any dead skin</li>
            <li> Like the scrubby pad takes a long time to wear out.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t irritate your skin and definitely helped the peeling that the scrub caused, but that can be expected, since it&#x27;s an</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t irritate your skin and definitely helped the peeling that the scrub caused, but that can be expected, since it&#x27;s an EXFOLIATOR.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you&#x27;re going to use this product long term like I have is to give your skin breaks from it.</li>
            <li> It is well priced and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, within those 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve been working extra shifts, stressed out from getting ready for Christmas, and (sorry, if its TMI) been particularly hormonal due to &amp;#34;that time of the month.&amp;#34;  Still no break</li>
            <li> Third, the texture of the product is a little too wet, so it does not provide quite the level of friction needed to remove dead skin really well.</li>
            <li> about half the blackheads on my nose and chin are gone... only the big ones are left but they seem to get visibly smaller and less and less daily...</li>
            <li> I have tried other products hoping to realize the same effects and none came close.</li>
            <li> heads seem to have  gone a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Definitely try this if you have blackheads on your nose, chin, cheeks and other problem areas.</li>
            <li> I had never had such a bad breakout; I went through Accutane three times, the third time on double dosage, and since then breakouts usually come then I&#x27;m good for a few weeks, but this time was unrelenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Granted, I have sensitive skin, but it would feel like my skin had just been rubbed raw after using it.</li>
            <li> and I have dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> but I use it for my arms and legs during the winter when my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> My problem with it is that it leaves my face so dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> all in all I really recommend getting this if you have piercings or plan on getting piercings- seriously LIFE SAVER</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin, but I use a moisturizer afterwards and rotate between this cleanser and Aveeno Ultra Calming Cleanser.</li>
            <li> This cleans your face and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry since I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena products and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my face feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin &amp; on the dry parts it gets so dry that it peels.</li>
            <li> Well since using this face wash my face hasn&#x27;t been so dry that it peels for a while now.</li>
            <li> I have dry, acne-prone skin and have never been happier with a cleansing product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed blood coming out on the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have to put lotion on after washing your face, because your face will feel dry.</li>
            <li> love this product and it works well, but unfortunately it contains plastic microbeads which are basically destroying the oceans.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the scrub long enough to see reduced black heads and pores.</li>
            <li> To those with persistent acne I also recommend never touching acne-prone areas, keeping your hair away from acne-prone areas, and changing your pillowcase frequently.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel very dry after using it and is because I already have a dry face so it does not help.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t loose it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re rubbing your face with tiny plastic beads and flushing them down the drain.</li>
            <li> this has been the only wash that calms down my flaring acne.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate or overly dry out the skin, and they remove even stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner!</li>
            <li> It made my skin very dry</li>
            <li> On the downside the product is a little drying(I have been using it once daily for a week now).</li>
            <li> to get a little extra tool to work with for a deeper cleaning.</li>
            <li> Felt like I paid extra for that little scrubby bit.</li>
            <li> The st. ives scrub is too coarse, but the queen helene is much finer, resulting in a really expensive super-super-fine sandpaper feel.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to over do it though</li>
            <li> so the scrublet can be held in place in the center.</li>
            <li> This is very fluidic, like thin shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I had already been using the GO 360 PINK cleanser and was running out</li>
            <li> I really do not like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few different exfoliates  </li>
            <li> in the last few years  </li>
            <li> I even stopped wearing makeup a few weeks back (been using it about 4 months</li>
            <li> you get the harder</li>
            <li> What I like about this brand is it had &#x27;scrubbies&#x27; which actually help at removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot things, even \\&quot;dermanew\\&quot; products and they did not really work...</li>
            <li> However, my face is not really exfoliated.</li>
            <li> and it scrubbs my skin without being too rough.</li>
            <li> Usually when I use these things my face gets really dry and irritates me just hours after my initial shower.</li>
            <li> The small scrubber that is attached is soft enough for even delicate skin around the eyes and firm enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed less breakouts, less oily skin and smaller pores since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have skin that&#x27;s very sensitive and always seems to be weirdly flaky, even if I&#x27;m not particularly dry.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s WAY cheaper the other products that I have spent 100$+ on that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> you could actually see little black pores all on my nose and cheek bones</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> like I said - a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s very little tiny beads to exfoliate</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li> looking for these other cleanser that i been using for years</li>
            <li> You can even use the brush for applying other products if you want.</li>
            <li> the other container is leaking too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scanning the ingredients and avoiding these things after reading an article about how all these plastic beads from our cleansers and toothpastes and other beauty products are finding their way into our rivers and being eaten by the fish and causing environmental issues we might not even foresee.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li> due tot</li>
            <li> and in fact I pop it out to use with some of my other cleansers as well.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it after reading some of the other written reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to reviews I read from other customers.</li>
            <li> I have even used some of my other cleansers with the tool, and I plan on keeping it even when I am finished with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I was putting my makeup on the other day and all around my nose and under my eye</li>
            <li> it comes with, in fact, I use the scrublet with other cleansers when I feel that my skin needs a break from all the exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of facial products over the past 15 years in which I battled with my skin.</li>
            <li> Although my face feels a little dry afterward.</li>
            <li> After using this scrub with the little applicator that comes with this, my dry skin doesn&#x27;t feel parched.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this was that it dried my face out after a few uses, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Ill go back to my old scrubs.</li>
            <li> was so dry and just dead skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful and is rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have used apricot scrubs in the past for deep cleansing and they can leave your face feeling a little irritated.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li> : I have combination skin - not many zits, but tons of small blackheads in various places and very dry skin all over.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like this product, at least keep the scrublet for your next cleanser!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that they made the lid rounded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li> The soap is average.</li>
            <li> Plastic is notorious for their slow degradation in the environment, especially in the ocean.</li>
            <li> It was most annoying to always have</li>
            <li> Bought it after seeing its high ratings - got a bit disappointed because it didn&#x27;t clear my pores as described by other customers.</li>
            <li> Often times I am worried with these kinds of products purchased online about them being watered down and wasting a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> It makes no sense that you can&#x27;t place the container upside down for when the level gets lower.</li>
            <li> Animals eat the plastic thinking it&#x27;s food, and our water filtration systems can&#x27;t get the plastics out of the water when it washes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I still used my daily moisturizer as usual, but my skin still looked flaky and itched!</li>
            <li> My black heads are gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is already improving after less than using for one week</li>
            <li> That is why it can be used for half a year.</li>
            <li> it is a marker less than 50 cents.</li>
            <li> I have black heads on my nose</li>
            <li> have noticed a decrease in blemishes and blackheads, both of which were previously an issue.  </li>
            <li> I had stubborn black heads for a while, but with using this it become so much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It a must buy if you have issue with black heads like me.</li>
            <li> black heads  </li>
            <li> The pores on my nose have also shrank and much less</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less product than I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting less product.</li>
            <li> It is even getting rid of dark spots that I had on my skin from the few pimples that I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have acne or black heads or any other skin problems, I was usually a mass of oil during the day.  </li>
            <li> It works well on black heads and dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It is almost like a face massage with the little face scrubber that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought the little scrubber was neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a little over 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I&#x27;ve been using Laura Mercier&#x27;s exfoliating rub for the face, and it is a little over $30.00.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little scrubber that is stored rite on the bottle.</li>
            <li> My favor thing however is the little pop out scrubbie.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s an average face wash!</li>
            <li> and it was a little rougher on my face.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a little scrubber as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not excited about it.</li>
            <li> unlike other skin care products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It will work well as a cleanser even without letting it sit, but giving it a little time lets it do its thing.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed  for how little I need to put  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the little pad that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The little scrubby is the coolest thing</li>
            <li> I took the little thing out</li>
            <li> However, when used with the little scrubber it comes with, my face would break out in bumps.</li>
            <li> It dried my face a little bit at the start, but keep with it</li>
            <li> It is silicone and once it is wet and soapy it is too hard to hold onto</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how hard it is to squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed if I run out and miss a few days, my skin is back to its old bad habits.</li>
            <li> it in a way trapped oil in my pores.</li>
            <li> When she had given it back my face as well had broken out.</li>
            <li> Then I come in with this to get all my dead skin off and get into my pores.</li>
            <li> and YIKES it has hit me in the eyes a few times, which stingsssss.</li>
            <li> and I have been eyeing the olay Pro-X and the Clarisonic everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few things to reduce or eliminate the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> it would be a nice change-up from my Mint Julep scrub, except I came to find out that it&#x27;s horrible for the environment.</li>
            <li> The face-scrubber thing is not as harsh as you would imagine.</li>
            <li> I could use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have combination acne prone skin, and not only has this helped with blackheads, but has helped me with preventing other zits as well (like when I accidentally fall asleep with my makeup on and wake up with ugly red things on my face).</li>
            <li> Not strong at all.</li>
            <li> the smell is not particularly strong.</li>
            <li> Although I have managed to tame it to a degree, I know I will always be battling it.  </li>
            <li> Also te little scrub thing that comes with it its sooooo helpful!</li>
            <li> After a few more uses though, I noticed my skin was feeling and looking drier than usual, and itching terribly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not experiencing the same results with my blackheads as other people have noticed, but it takes the dirty and oil out of my pores.</li>
            <li> no residue left behind either!</li>
            <li> When i got this product today i opened it up and saw that it was missing about 1/4 of the product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use the scrubbing pad that it came with, but I have tried it before.</li>
            <li> but I was to lazy to go out and decided to buy it online</li>
            <li> everyday for at least 4 days and my blackhead situation didn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual face wash</li>
            <li> so I bought this from Amazon because I have prime and it would be cheaper than my usual buy</li>
            <li> Its is really small.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would consider this a \\&quot;Deep\\&quot; exfoliating scrub</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually suffer from breakouts</li>
            <li> The small scrubbing tool comes with</li>
            <li> The scrubber is small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, I concluded it was just an ordinary face/body wash, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use it as an everyday cleanser!</li>
            <li> I compare this product to an expensive facial I purchased on a cruiseship about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> Check out my past reviews to locate the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite being in my 40&#x27;s, I still have a small problem with acne.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have acne breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often to use an exfoliant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial scrubs mostly expensive ones</li>
            <li> you have dead skins sitting in it!  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend anyone at least give this product a try before going out and buying one of those expensive &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; exfoliators!  </li>
            <li> Right now its winter and my skin peels something awful whenever I wash it and let it dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> I tried it and as I was opening the bottle I noticed the dumb little scrubby thing.</li>
            <li> fall apart, and i was greatly annoyed that because it \\&quot;popped in\\&quot; the bottle, there was less product</li>
            <li> As young woman you had used this I&#x27;m am in a very difficult position because people are mean and can and do judge me form the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard plastic</li>
            <li> Hard to tell how we&#x27;ll stop this, but we need to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much complaint with it.</li>
            <li> so it hardly sucks in air and releases a blob for you to use.</li>
            <li> and there is a visble difference of at least 50% reduction in the amount of blackheads</li>
            <li> Once you remove the scrubby there is a big hole which makes squeezing the bottle awkward.</li>
            <li> No too watery/too thick problem.</li>
            <li> Some scrubs are so thick it&#x27;s like a paste and</li>
            <li> And I do mean all three.  </li>
            <li> i wanna eat it as well hahah just kidding, but, yes, theres no better sensation to sleep with your skin smelling peach!</li>
            <li> It was brutal on skin, so I gave it up and went to a higher level:  </li>
            <li> I stick with it... which unfortunately a lot of them will randomly change their formulas (Maybelline seems to have done this several times to me</li>
            <li> Whenever my face feels oily and clogged, this is my go-to product because it really gets off the nasty feeling of grime without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> If you want serious sandpaper exfoliating this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate, but I&#x27;m taking off a star for that silly little brush that have attached on the front of it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good to use them every day (like the St.</li>
            <li> I really needed this, I hated using soap to wash my face during showers.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not good to exfoliate EVERY day</li>
            <li> but nope not a good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have VERY large and visible pores and bumpy blackheads that are very annoying.</li>
            <li> Maybe your face won&#x27;t mind it, but mine hated the scrubber, so I just used the produce with my hands alone, which sort of defeats the purpose of buying this particular item.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again in this size, since it is so small and weirdly shaped.  </li>
            <li> My skin may be too tough for it though.</li>
            <li> It is not uncommon for me to buy a face/skin product for $60 an ounce.  </li>
            <li> But inside the cap is broken as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> is broken.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a miracle-worker based on all the reviews, but alas...</li>
            <li> In fact, it may have broken me out a bit</li>
            <li> I feel that I could use this every two days or so without irritating my face.</li>
            <li> it makes it worse.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it, and if you get it with subscribe &amp; save,  you cannot  go wrong !!!</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results are dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have quit a few blackheads and every once in awhile, I will have a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> I have am thirty years old and hate my skin!</li>
            <li> and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I have spent a ridiculous amount of time and money trying to get blackheads out of my nose and chin, and to get rid of disgusting acne on my forehead and let me tell you I&#x27;ve tried it all...</li>
            <li> i write this trying to express what is wrong with said product in hope of improvement will be made or that it will come to the point that they do stop the sale of this.</li>
            <li> I almost cried, it was so weird.</li>
            <li> Boy was i wrong.</li>
            <li> But to me, it is a horrible and quite nauseating smell, unfortunate, especially for a face product.</li>
            <li> (Sadly, another article said that a lot of it is coming off our synthetic fabrics in the washing machine and going into the waterways.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the soap.</li>
            <li> The scrub included is useless and does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> If anybody has really big pores and hate them please buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> objection is that it is difficult to remove and takes a lot of rinsing.</li>
            <li> The scrubber thing is weird...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had an acne problem, but I have a terrible blackhead problem across my nose.</li>
            <li> and duh!!!</li>
            <li> Now my acne is under control after a few years of antibiotics (Accutane PS never got any of those horrible side effects) and no I&#x27;m scare to use birth control after my friend had a scare with a DPT.</li>
            <li> And having it on the bottle keeps it from getting dirty on the counter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a bad acne problem...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bad:</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it around the eyes, it will be extremely painful</li>
            <li> dermatologists, facials, painful scrubs, etc, etc.</li>
            <li> it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Before I was using those stupid Biore Strips that got like two blackheads...</li>
            <li> though hate how its attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-&amp;#34;Scrublet&amp;#34; worthless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is is horrible it made me breakout really badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible to give in to gimmicks and figured that this would be another one I&#x27;d be disappointed with.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always hated it</li>
            <li> I have very bad reactions to benzoyl peroxide products</li>
            <li> but it would make my nose horribly shiny for some reason....)    </li>
            <li> This is the worst cleaner ever, I bought it along with the loreal</li>
            <li> Contains plastic microbeads, terrible for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made me break out even worst</li>
            <li> The itching was terrible.</li>
            <li> it was disgusting.</li>
            <li> It was awful and wouldn&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> my face now has the worst acne that I have had since I was like 13 going through puberty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this! After my second use my blackheads are completely gone! My skin is so smooth, I can&#x27;t get over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying to use this on a scar I have (I heard exfoliating can help reduce the darkness) so I will definitely give an update for that too!</li>
            <li> I have used this since it first came on the market. I like it and would not hesitate to recommend it. It leaves your skin smooth and clean without drying it.</li>
            <li> Really love how this product smells!  It is almost like a face massage with the little face scrubber that comes with it.</li>
            <li> the cleanser is awesome! the scrub brush works great not flumsy and the package was right on time at this price it was a steal!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well,  didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or anything, and  my face felt clean after using it. It also comes with this scrubby brush type thing as an added bonus .</li>
            <li> Very nice face-wash and scrub. Works as expected. Sensitive on skin. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this deep cleaning and brush also. it&#x27;s make you&#x27;r skin soft and clean</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product...the smell is wonderful!  It gets the job done and leaves my face smooth, dead skin free, and smelling great...no residue left behind either!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, and it tends to flake, especially around my nose where I have blackheads. I love this because it also comes with a little scrub brush which helps get all the dead skin off. I also noticed my blackheads were slowly disappearing which I was also very happy with because everything else I tried never worked to get rid of them. I use this everyday, and a little bit goes a long way, it leaves my skin so smooth. I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and its cheap!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better! The little face cleaner that the soap comes with is the best. My face is smooth and healthy feeling since I started using it. I won&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li> When I had used it it caused me to break out. It was a nice soapy thing but it in a way trapped oil in my pores. it was very disappointing. I had lent it to a friend, before I was aware of the beginning of a breakout, when she used it it has caused her to break out immediately. When she had given it back my face as well had broken out. I am now in a problem because the acne it caused will not heal and go away and I fear that this will scar my face. I already have scars upon my shoulders from it not healing correctly. As young woman you had used this I&#x27;m am in a very difficult position because people are mean and can and do judge me form the way my skin looks. It has caused my self esteem to drop in a very drastic rate. I am very unsatisfied with how this turned out. i write this trying to express what is wrong with said product in hope of improvement will be made or that it will come to the point that they do stop the sale of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to find an exfoliator, but much harder to find one that smells this good!  I had to stop myself from wanting to drink the bottle!  Just kidding...but it really does smell that great!</li>
            <li> The BEST! Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scublet - that makes cleansing fast and easy. Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning. LOVE the scrublet!</li>
            <li> This scrub goes on so smooth and creamy!  I love the little scrubbing disk, it&#x27;s very soft and glides over my face and neck.  Feels great and  makes my face feel softer and smoother than any other scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  You got a try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Got this expressly for the scrubby pad. This formula is a scrub, and I was worried how it would work with the scrub pad, but it&#x27;s not a very rough solution so it&#x27;s not going to damage the silicone bumps on it. I will just refill the bottle with other face cleansers when it is empty - I don&#x27;t think the solution that matters, but this stuff does smell really good. The pad isn&#x27;t as scrubby as i had hoped, but after a week of using it, it definitely works. I&#x27;m hoping for better results the longer I use it too. I have huge pores that are always just dirty, and i&#x27;m hoping the pad will get in there and clean them out so they can close up a little bit.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who break out from literally everything... I am allergic to all metals except gold for jewelery (haven&#x27;t tried platinum yet). Once I find make-up that doesn&#x27;t make me break out I stick with it... which unfortunately a lot of them will randomly change their formulas (Maybelline seems to have done this several times to me and I have puffy eyes for a week the last time they changed the mascara on me). So obviously I need a face wash that won&#x27;t cause this... No rashes, no bumps, had some redness the first use but probably because I used to scrublet a bit too hard. I don&#x27;t have a bad acne problem... just a zit here and there... Mainly just blackheads which honestly this is the first product that worked... first use about half the blackheads on my nose and chin are gone... only the big ones are left but they seem to get visibly smaller and less and less daily... DEFINITELY Recommend this... BUT if you are allergic to Salicylic Acid, not a product for you.</li>
            <li> This is is horrible it made me breakout really badly. At first it made my skin nice and smooth and I thought, \\&quot;YES!\\&quot; then the next days and had 2 zits, but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I used it again and the next day I had about five, this continued for and week. So I went back to my old face wash and now I&#x27;m all clear again! Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t try it!</li>
            <li> The actual product, the exfoliating cleaner, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as well as other brands, although it does leave a very pleasant smell on your skin.  The trick to getting the product to really exfoliate is to use the little rubber &#x27;scrublet&#x27; that is included in this package and run that all over the area you are using the product on.  Personally, I would rather use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub for basic exfoliation needs, and the Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel Kit for deep exfoliation (once or twice a week).  The scrublet works great with the Olay Pore Scrub, but all of these products works really well with the Pro-X battery powered skin brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> When i got this product today i opened it up and saw that it was missing about 1/4 of the product! I thought i was supposed to be getting a NEW product?? It&#x27;s not worth the time &amp; energy to pack it back up &amp; bring to the post office considering it cost only 4.99, so i&#x27;ll keep it regardless of it being opened &amp; used (apparently) After testing it to make sure the bottle contained the right product, i tried it. It smells really nice &amp; does a good job exfoliating &amp; cleaning my face. I really like this stuff, just wish that i got a full bottle like i paid for. If i had, i would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now in my skincare routine, and it really helps my skin stay clear. I have combination acne prone skin, and not only has this helped with blackheads, but has helped me with preventing other zits as well (like when I accidentally fall asleep with my makeup on and wake up with ugly red things on my face). Before I use this I like to cleanse my face with some hypoallergenic bar soap just to get all the surface dirt off or any make up I might have on. Then I come in with this to get all my dead skin off and get into my pores. I think that works well for me and prevents any drying that might happen if I were to just use the face wash itself. My face always comes out feeling soft and clean without being dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I do use it daily because my skin gets gross pretty fast, but if you are going to do that I would suggest only using a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s gimmicky and I fell for it, but it&#x27;s also a very nice cleanser.  It has a yummy fresh grapefruit-y fragrance and granules for exfoliating.  The scrubbing pad is soft and rubbery, so it doesn&#x27;t seem abrasive to your skin.  I have used apricot scrubs in the past for deep cleansing and they can leave your face feeling a little irritated.  The Go 360 Clean is gentler and does a nice job of cleansing without leaving you with an overly dry or irritated complexion.  I actually find the gimmick of storing the pad in the bottle to be a nice convenience.  The price is not bad, especially since you don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount.....this size bottle should be long-lasting.  I&#x27;m happy I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and thought...hmm...that sounds good.  I love the little scrubby thing that comes with it.  It really massages my face and scrubs off the dry skin.  The fragrance is very interesting.  It smells kinda fruity with a hint of medicine of some sort.  It works great though.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product on the shelf, I admit... the scrubber thing intrigued me and I had to try it. I never expected to love this stuff so much! I used to have to use only acne-fighting face cleaners, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that my face reacts to without a single problem (outside of any hormonal changes). It makes my face feel fresh and soft. And as an added bonus, even my husband loves to use the scrubber thing (I&#x27;m on my second bottle and let him have the one from my old bottle).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had an acne problem, but I have a terrible blackhead problem across my nose. My pores are rather large so it makes the blackheads easy to see.  I bought this because I thought the little scrubber was neat. I&#x27;m terrible to give in to gimmicks and figured that this would be another one I&#x27;d be disappointed with.  I love the scent, and the scrubber is very gentle so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. After using this for about two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my blackheads.  My face looks much clearer and I no longer feel the blackhead &#x27;bumps&#x27; when I touch my nose or the skin around it. I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> So i went to cvs ...looking for these other cleanser that i been using for years but since they didnt have it on stock.. i decided to give this a try.... .this is my first time using these cleanser and i already love it .. my face feels clean . Soft ... and my pores seem smaller...wooww... it was reslly worth it... i will be buying thse again..</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, works great! Satisfied.</li>
            <li> OMG...I love this!! I love the idea to have the little scrubber sitting in the middle of the bottle so it can be aired out till the next cleaning and so I don&#x27;t lose it. As a mom of five, I would lose my head if it wasn&#x27;t screwed on so it is extremely ingenious (at least to me) to have the scrubber attached to the bottle. On top of that the fragrance is so refreshing and the scrubber is so therapeutic. After spending all day chasing after five kids and handling snotty noses and poopy diapers, I turn to this for a couple of minutes of soothing relief. It makes me feel clean and refreshed and just super super clean. Does it clear blackheads and acne etc?...I don&#x27;t know...I don&#x27;t have the energy to explore my pores at the end of the day. I just like feeling clean and refreshed!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a little over 3 weeks now.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve had no breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;Until I found L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean, I had been using Olay&#x27;s Pro-X and the exfoliating face wash that comes with it, Simple Moisturizing Face Wash, and Clean and Clear Advantage 3-in-1.  And I do mean all three.  For whatever reason, if I use one product for too many days in a row, its like my skin gets too used to it and I start getting blemishes.  I&#x27;ve now used only this L&#x27;Oreal face wash for 23 days in a row and only had ONE TEENY little bump, which was next to my hair line and can probably be more attributed to not rinsing out my conditioner enough.  And let me tell you, within those 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve been working extra shifts, stressed out from getting ready for Christmas, and (sorry, if its TMI) been particularly hormonal due to &amp;#34;that time of the month.&amp;#34;  Still no break outs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the little scrubber do-dad that comes with this face wash.  It&#x27;s made of a soft silicone, with little &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34; that feel great on my skin. When I rinse off the face wash, I can immediately tell the texture of my skin is smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend anyone at least give this product a try before going out and buying one of those expensive &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; exfoliators!  I thnk you will be happy with this face wash!</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant to give in to all the \\&quot;hoopla\\&quot; surrounding this product, but I needed a good exfoiliator so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad that I did! When I use this scrub, it leaves absolutely no trace of oil or dirt left on my face, and my skin is left soft and smooth afterward. I&#x27;m a true fan, and I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This shipped to my house fast and my acne is noticeably better. It smells really good too! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the exfoliating scrublet that comes with the bottle is pretty handy, leaves my skin feeling softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great face wash--it lathers up really really well with the scrubber! Whenever my face feels oily and clogged, this is my go-to product because it really gets off the nasty feeling of grime without being too harsh. Right after I wash, I definitely noticed a difference right away in terms of how clear my face looks, but I would recommend this product more for people with large pore/blackhead/oil issues than to people prone to getting a lot of actual pimples. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect pimples that have already cropped up.  The smell is really great too, it&#x27;s mild and fruity, unlike a lot of really strong chemical-y smelling face washes I&#x27;ve used. Even among the other Loreal go 360 line products, I&#x27;d give this one the gold medal--give it a try! :D</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a product on the market I have not tried.  It is not uncommon for me to buy a face/skin product for $60 an ounce.  I actually purchased this product to make up the minimum purchase for free shipping and had absolutely no expectations of it.  I thought it would just end up in the closet where I have whole ranges of other face and skin products.  Well, it didn&#x27;t.  I tried it a few days after I got it and was extremely surprised at how clean my face felt after using it with the little scrubbing thingy.  After a couple of days, I noticed that my face didn&#x27;t appear as oily as it normally does half way through the hectic days at the office.  After 2 weeks, I seriously did not even need to put any kind of makeup on!  That was the shocker, since you can take away my sandwich, but if you tocuh my makeup, you die!  I am a black woman and it is the best I have seen my medium brown skin tone.  While I don&#x27;t have acne or black heads or any other skin problems, I was usually a mass of oil during the day.  As a busy executive, facing numerous people each day in meetings and otherwise, my face has to look as good as it possibly can.  This simple $5 scrub delivers!!!  My face is clean, ridiculously smooth, much less oily, and my pores are so tiny, they are virtually non existent. I know L&#x27;Oreal got a lot of flack for hiring practices, racism, some other &#x27;isms&#x27;, and their \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth it\\&quot; tag line, but I have to give credit where it is due. $5 is getting me the best skin I have had in years.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it could used for body, for face not that great.But I love that smell. I used this one for body shampoo,pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scrub feels nice, and it left my skin feeling smooth, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in blackheads/clogged pores.</li>
            <li> wow! loved loved loved loved loved! im soooo in love with it! the smell of it is so delicious! i wanna eat it as well hahah just kidding, but, yes, theres no better sensation to sleep with your skin smelling peach! i can have a peach skin! yayy! hahahahaha just kidding, i loved it, really</li>
            <li> I really like the bottle of this product, and the little scrublet is a great idea in theory.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to hold up very well.  And the wash itself is just ok.</li>
            <li> Made my skin burn. Granted, I have sensitive skin, but it would feel like my skin had just been rubbed raw after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the nifty scrubber, and fell in love with the product. I think it smells more peachy than citrusy, unlike the other commenters. It works as well or better than the pricey stuff I used to get from the esthetician.     When your lips are dry and flaky, use the scrubber--without cleanser--on your lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and use this every day while in the shower. (for one year now)  It leaves my face feeling so soft and creamy.  The best facial cleanser ever.  I will NOT be without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok product and I don&#x27;t have much complaint with it.</li>
            <li> We had tried the L&#x27;Oreal Paris 360 when it first came out, but never this exfoliating kind.  We love it-is now our household face cleaner!</li>
            <li> I struggle with blackheads. I&#x27;ve tried everything you can name that&#x27;s a cleanser from gels to masks, you name it. I was so freaking happy though when I used this tonight. about 75% of my blackheads were gone!! I almost cried, it was so weird. I was not expecting it, but it was great. I still had some left, but anything that helps. Before I was using those stupid Biore Strips that got like two blackheads... Yeah.</li>
            <li> I like this product; it smells lovely, and the lil pop out scrubby pad is an innovative idea. I discovered that the scrubby has a suction cup on the top so you needn&#x27;t park it back in the bottle after use, I just stick it to the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try a more exfoliating product when I run out of this; but I am not opposed to buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have VERY large and visible pores and bumpy blackheads that are very annoying. When i usually clean my face if have to scrub and rub my t-zone area to the point where it is on fire when i get out just to get it clean. I bought this product not even being aware it came with a \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;. When i first opened the product i figured this was a gimmick that would not work, fall apart, and i was greatly annoyed that because it \\&quot;popped in\\&quot; the bottle, there was less product then i thought i was getting. Boy was i wrong.It smells beautiful, is gentle, smoothes and soothes my skin, the scrubber is soft and easily conforms to your face,and a little of the product goes a long way. All i have to say is THANK YOU LOREAL!</li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for the perfect makeup remover/cleanser for a few months when I stumbled upon the Go 360 Clean line.  I immediately fell in love with the products.  They don&#x27;t irritate or overly dry out the skin, and they remove even stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I like this scrub. It makes my skin super smooth afterwards. Haven&#x27;t tried the scrub long enough to see reduced black heads and pores. Just wish it came in a bigger size for the price.</li>
            <li> had bought two of them...and i am really very happy with it...keeps face really clean and fresh.i am from a very humid climate so face gets more oily fast.but it helps in getting all the dirt and oil away</li>
            <li> Like the product. Although my face feels a little dry afterward. Will buy again for under $5 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised by how much I like this face cleanser! It is awesome. The exfoliating is the perfect amount, not too rough and not too soft. My face feels so nice after using this.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new face wash and purchased this after reading the great reviews. I got it in the mail quickly and was pleased when I first used it. It&#x27;s a nice daily exfoliating scrub - meaning it has little exfoliating beads, but they&#x27;re gentle enough for every day use. I tend to like exfoliating scrubs but it&#x27;s not good to use them every day (like the St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub), so this is a nice daily use wash. It smells nice and light, and it feels nice on the skin. I don&#x27;t usually use the scrubbing pad that it came with, but I have tried it before. It&#x27;s decent enough if you want a little deeper clean, but I wasn&#x27;t a big enough fan to justify using it regularly. I have already repurchased this product and I probably will again in the future. It&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle for relatively inexpensive and it works well.</li>
            <li> Really like the brush attached to this bottle. The small beads on it make it a perfect tool for washing your face and really getting into your pores. I look and feel cleaner using this product. L&#x27;Oreal really hit a home run with this model, and I will continue to use it. You can even use the brush for applying other products if you want.</li>
            <li> These product could be found in almost any store but I was to lazy to go out and decided to buy it online and I thought it would take forever to get her but it got here in about 3 days so I was very very happy with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product well I don&#x27;t see an improvement but it leaves my skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice sofar, received it yesterday, but what an ingenious invention! The scrubbing pad is a part of the bottle and can be inserted back after using and rinsing it. It is a very comfortable rubber with little scrublets. AND of course the most important of all ..... I think this really works! My skin feels very soft and pores look smaller! Have to be careful not to over do it though...contain my enthousiasm ;)</li>
            <li> I just picked up my package at the post office this morning. The problem is I bought 5 L&#x27;oreal and I just received 4... the other container is leaking too.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and I have dry flaky skin. My face is always a problem. I got this hoping it would help decrease the flakes and it does that but it also leaves my face fealing really smooth. Wasn&#x27;t looking for that but it is a nice side-benefit! One thing to note, don&#x27;t press very hard and you probably don&#x27;t want to use it more than a few times per week.</li>
            <li> So this solves a couple of peeves with scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No too watery/too thick problem. Some scrubs or scrub/cleanser combo are too watery and don&#x27;t really scrub, or disappears after a few wipes. Some scrubs are so thick it&#x27;s like a paste and stuff fall off instead of stay on your face to be scrubbed. This is soapy scrub, but with the pad, you get long lasting scrubbing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No harsh scrubbing. It always feels ineffective and not penetrating enough if I gently scrub with my hand, so I usually put too much force and end up with a red/slightly hurting face. Well, the pad is the magic. Even when you don&#x27;t apply a lot of force, the rubber of the pad help adjust the force so the scrubbing feels gentle but firm. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but it feels penetrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it&#x27;s a bit drying (I have combo skin), so use it along with that moisturizer you like but a bit too oily on you.</li>
            <li> Really exposes fresh clean skin after exfoliation</li>
            <li> makes it manageable for my bf to look upon me in the morning with fondness and tell me i get prettier every day. i highly recommend it, even for the pretty girls</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. But otherwise it cleans fine and I love the rubber scrubber it comes with, great for really exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li> This product has a delicate scent, which due to allergies, I can&#x27; t use anything with a strong odor.  I use this with my Clairsonic.  Once done, my skin is clean, smooth and amazingly soft.  I would recommend and puchase this again.  It works just as well as the high priced products do and I speak from experience, not hear-say!</li>
            <li> Great product  fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> Just in two words: Excellente product ! ! !  It do exactly how it describe  skin soft, shiny and clean</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;ve battled with acne since the day I got my &#x27;friend&#x27; (more like enemy). Of course I tried pretty much all the acne reducing products under the sun. Now my acne is under control after a few years of antibiotics (Accutane PS never got any of those horrible side effects) and no I&#x27;m scare to use birth control after my friend had a scare with a DPT. I have very oily skin and when it is the winter I&#x27;m quite glad because less oil production. The product itself is has a nice scent and it scrub is soft for the face. It does leave the skin smooth for a reason. You just got rid of dead skin cells, so it does leave the skin smooth. It&#x27;s not too bad for the price. I technically wanted to give this product 3 1/2 stars, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I have only used this products twice now, but have already felt such a big upgrade from my old cleanser which was the Neautrogena Deep Clean. The scrublet is really nice to use and is a big improvement from having to use your own fingers. If you don&#x27;t like this product, at least keep the scrublet for your next cleanser! The microbeads are smaller than that of the Neautrogena, but works just as well. It foams a lot when you start massaging your face with the scrublet and YIKES it has hit me in the eyes a few times, which stingsssss. My only complaint is how hard it is to squeeze the bottle. The bottle is hard plastic so it hardly sucks in air and releases a blob for you to use. I guess it was built that way so the scrublet can be held in place in the center. Awesome product. Will be switching from my old brand.</li>
            <li> This feels great. I love the scrubber that comes with it though hate how its attached to the bottle. You lose so much space for more liquid because there is a hole in the bottle. Though thats my only issue with it. I love the way it feels on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful and is rather pleasant. The scrubber doesn&#x27;t hurt to use. It could exfoliate better, but its good enough.</li>
            <li> I love using this scrub.  It especially feels good on my face but I use it for my arms and legs during the winter when my skin is dry.  It really makes your skin feel better and oh so soft after using it.  It smells good too!</li>
            <li> When I first got this facial cleanser, my first through was that the rubber scrubber, while a nice addition, felt like it would fall apart quickly.  To my surprise it didn&#x27;t- it has been going like a champ.  The scrubber is great and really helps you get your face nice and clean.  The cleanser smells nice with a hint of apricot, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It is nice and ex foliating without being too harsh on your skin.  This is great for an everyday cleaner if you don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, but from my experience, it really doesn&#x27;t do much to clear troubled skin.  Overall, I do like this, but for my skin, I need something to help clear up my skin too.  This cleaner does do everything that L&#x27;Oreal says it will- clean, reduce appearance of pores, and won&#x27;t over dry- for that, I have to give it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I have done is use the scrubber with other cleansers- which works better than using my hands.</li>
            <li> I will admit I&#x27;ve been using Laura Mercier&#x27;s exfoliating rub for the face, and it is a little over $30.00. However, I thought I would purchase this to compare it. First of all, if you like a &amp;#34;fake chemical apricot&amp;#34; smell, perhaps the smell will be tolerable. But to me, it is a horrible and quite nauseating smell, unfortunate, especially for a face product. I am really surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews. Second, the granules are just a bit too small and too sparse to do a good job scrubbing. Third, the texture of the product is a little too wet, so it does not provide quite the level of friction needed to remove dead skin really well. I will not purchase it again, even if only ONE of those reasons were the case, because it ruins the overall effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Ulta and loved it. It kept my skin clear, and moisturized. I tried the salicylic acid version from this same line and it made me break instantly! If you want to try the Go 360, definitely go with the exfoliating.</li>
            <li> For the price, this stuff is amazing.  Highly recommend.  My skin is so soft and smooth when I use this as directed.</li>
            <li> me likes!! :) i&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days now (after using St. Ives apricot scrub daily for several years)....I really like this cleanser as an alternative because it&#x27;s much gentler and comes with a great scrubbing tool that fits perfectly in the bottle and on my hand. my skin&#x27;s getter clearer as well. yay!</li>
            <li> For the buck, you can&#x27;t get a better product.  It smells GREAT, like you just cut open an apricot, and it feels like your face is really clean after you get done using it.</li>
            <li> Hands down a great product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel very dry after using it and is because I already have a dry face so it does not help.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended in a sub reddit of Reddit as being &amp;#34;the best for one&#x27;s skin&amp;#34;, not leaving microabrasions and such. Tried it once and didn&#x27;t like it. Normally, I use St- Ives and enjoy the pasty texture of that product. This is very fluidic, like thin shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t cover the face well, like a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind that, sure! It has a great scent, and you do feel clean after using it. The facial scrubby pad was a neat gimmick, I can&#x27;t tell if it really worked, but you do notice a clean feeling, especially around the area where your nose meets your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, your needs are likely different than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is not natural, organic, free from &amp;#34;harmful&amp;#34; chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the scrublet from my 360 Cleanser and was considering purchasing this version for a deeper clean and another scrublet. However, the come-on that it has natural apricot seeds for exfoliating is very misleading. This product also contains plastic. These are the 3 ingredients -- POLYETHYLENE, ACRYLATES, COPOLYMER to avoid if you care about what is going into our rivers and streams. I&#x27;ve been scanning the ingredients and avoiding these things after reading an article about how all these plastic beads from our cleansers and toothpastes and other beauty products are finding their way into our rivers and being eaten by the fish and causing environmental issues we might not even foresee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, darn, I just found that ACRYLATES COPOLYMER are in the Go 360° Clean Deep Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin that I purchased, trying to avoid these beads. The lesson is -- know all your &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; ingredients and read thoroughly, if you care to not contribute to this issue of plastics in our water. (Sadly, another article said that a lot of it is coming off our synthetic fabrics in the washing machine and going into the waterways. Not just from the cosmetics.) Hard to tell how we&#x27;ll stop this, but we need to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the scrublet and tried to find them for sale by themselves. No luck.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> I had so many break outs and scars on my skin and I have been eyeing the olay Pro-X and the Clarisonic everyday. However, I am low on cash and I had already been using the GO 360 PINK cleanser and was running out so I ordered this.  I have used this only for 3 times (twice a day) and this has significantly improved the texture of my skin. Although the little scrublet is nice, the apricot beads help give it that extra bit to do a better job in exfoliating. I might still invest in a Clarisonic when I can afford to splurge on myself but I find myself feeling SO MUCH HAPPIER having waited and using this product.  I&#x27;m in my early 20s and was concerned about using a deep cleaning system on my face so early on so i&#x27;m happy i gave this a try--i dont want to end up in my 30s having used nearly everything and making my skin become immune to everything available on the market.  i rarely write reviews but i just HAD to share this. I also use witch hazel toner after this and then a moisturizer. I would strongly recommend anyone using this to invest in a good moisturizer as exfoliating does make the skin dry.  try it, it works! and a little goes a long way so you can probably use this for around 2months :)</li>
            <li> I like it ok. My problem with it is that it leaves my face so dry after using it. This would probably be better for someone with oilier skin. I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the amazing reviews on Amazon. I have to say, it&#x27;s overrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-Small exfoliating beads&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;-Awesome price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Used everyday for at least 4 days and my blackhead situation didn&#x27;t change. And they&#x27;re not bad to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;-The scrubber is what I describe as a silicone pad with cilia. I don&#x27;t see how it has exfoliating properties. I started using my exfoliating glove instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably look for something more exfoliating/abrasive next time.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual face wash so I bought this from Amazon because I have prime and it would be cheaper than my usual buy and It looked promising.  The scrubber is a very soft rubber. It bends extremely easily and isn&#x27;t as fragile as it looks!     The smell of the scrub is wonderful. It&#x27;s really one of those scrubs you don&#x27;t mind getting stuck in your nose. It smells like real apricots. I don&#x27;t know if I can emphasize how good it smells. I wish they made a perfume or body spray out of the scent! The scrubber is very gentle against your face and it does a good job at lathering the scrub, too. I think it applies just the right amount of pressure to your skin so it doesn&#x27;t end up red and irritated after you wash the scrub off and it doesn&#x27;t leave parts of your face shiny either. (I used to use the neutrogena blackhead eraser but it would make my nose horribly shiny for some reason....)    My face feels clean, breathing, and refreshed. I don&#x27;t have any acne so I won&#x27;t judge on whether or not it helps breakouts, but it smells and feels good during and after use. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel soft and clean. Has a soft plastic face scrubber attached to bottle. Nice apricot scent and is a mild exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> Cleans good but smells like grapefruit. .</li>
            <li> I have tried a few things to reduce or eliminate the blackheads on my nose. I have massive pores so they standout. This stuff works great. The scrubber seemed flimsy at first but is actually quite sturdy and works well. After one use I could tell a difference. After a week now I definitely have cleaner clearer skin.   Also a little seems to go a long way. Often times I am worried with these kinds of products purchased online about them being watered down and wasting a lot of money.  This stuff is definitely not a waste. And even if it didn&#x27;t work that well the smell has to be experienced to be believed. I love this stuff, would recommend it without hesitation, and will be buying more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! my pores were really clogged you could actually see little black pores all on my nose and cheek bones and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to clear that up but this. and it works wonderful! after one use you&#x27;ll start to see results!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I bought this at Publix for two reasons. They didn&#x27;t carry my normal cleanser and this was on sale for 3.99. I&#x27;m sold! My skin feels smooth, it smells amazing and I love the scrubber!  I read that in your forties you need to start exfoliating to renew skin cells so I was in the market for an exfoliating cleanser. I also have acne and this has salycilic acid which was a plus!</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail the other day. Its is really small. But the exfoliating pad and the contents of the loreal product seem to work very well. leaving my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Usually not into cheap brands, but this product is gentle and it smells so good! The little exfoliating scrubber that it comes with is my favorite.</li>
            <li> it is great, this is my first time use exfoliating product, it really help to exfoliate, i love that little tool on it to help clean, i love the smell, everything, thanks alot!</li>
            <li> Got delivery today. Nothing wrong with the soap. But inside the cap is broken as shown in the picture. The cap itself is not broken yet inside the cap is broken. Huh?? (1 star is taken out for that..)</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life? I cant believe I haven&#x27;t started using this earlier. I have quit a few blackheads and every once in awhile, I will have a bad breakout. Since using this, my pores seem so much smaller and my blackheads are GONE. It comes with a little scrubber that is stored rite on the bottle. It makes the process so much easier and you can actually feel it working into your skin. After just the first use, my face was so much softer and felt extremely clean. I have been using this for about a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. My face is clear and glowing! I love it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have multiple facial piercings (nose and lip) and the scrublet was literally a life-saver. I used to use the loofah on my face because I liked being to able to really scrub all the grime off, I just couldn&#x27;t do that with my hands or a wash-cloth, and my piercings would always catch on my loofah- but the scrublet is PERFECT for people with facial piercings (or just any pierced area the want to scrub). and the actual product is pretty good too, definitely no complaints, it makes my skin feel clean, a little bit dry, but a slight moisturizer can fix that easily- all in all I really recommend getting this if you have piercings or plan on getting piercings- seriously LIFE SAVER</li>
            <li> Wonderful product but the bottle was very small,I will for now on check the bottle size. Not sure I would consider this a \\&quot;Deep\\&quot; exfoliating scrub due tot he fact that its ver gentle, I like the kind where I think my skin is coming off. lol</li>
            <li> I suffer with chronic adult acne.  Although I have managed to tame it to a degree, I know I will always be battling it.  I have very bad reactions to benzoyl peroxide products so I am always keen on trying salicylic acid based ones.  This cleanser has a nice mild scent,  doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and has helped keep my break outs under control.  My favor thing however is the little pop out scrubbie.  genius!!  love it love it love it.  I want a big one for the whole body!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating scrub I have ever used.  A small amount goes far and makes your skin feel nice and smooth.  I love it and it has a little scrubber comes with it which is also a plus.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to another brand&#x27;s apricot face scrub.  With that being said, it gets the job done.  Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary.  It has the little apricot polishing/exfoliating beads, smells pleasant, and gets the face clean.  The only downside is if you wear eye make up, be sure not to get it around the eyes.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an average face wash!</li>
            <li> Since buying a scrubber separately costs about the same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this formula of the three available because it seemed to be the least chemical-ly, and I like the way it makes my skin feel and look so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I decide after using the scrub for a while I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ve still got the silicone scrubber, which I adore.  It REALLY cleans without feeling rough at all.  I&#x27;ve used facial brushes in the past, and I like this scrubber better.</li>
            <li> Love the soap just not the spongy thing. Its great for oily skin</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating brush.  It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I just ordered and received this product, and I love it already! The scrubber thing feels so great... I wish I could use it on my entire body haha! The smell of the scrub is apricoty/peachy and very nice! I have normal skin with occassional acne break outs. Since I just got this product, I can&#x27;t say how well it works yet at clearing up acne, but I know that after I use it, my face feels amazingly soft and clean. It&#x27;s like a spa facial at home!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris deep exfoliating scrub is great once every week when I need to exfoliate my dead skin cells on my face. This thing does a wonderful job at doing its thing and my face has never been more clean looking. It lasts me a pretty long time as well and for the amount you pay for, it&#x27;s a great value. 5/5</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub....highly recommend as a daily wash!! Great product for the price!!hawaii born girl;)aloha to all!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Apparently, the cosmetic industry has taken to using these tiny little plastic beads in their products, claiming they&#x27;re the latest trend in facial scrubbing technology ... what a load of bull. I bought this thinking it would be a nice change-up from my Mint Julep scrub, except I came to find out that it&#x27;s horrible for the environment. You&#x27;re rubbing your face with tiny plastic beads and flushing them down the drain. Plastic is notorious for their slow degradation in the environment, especially in the ocean. I totally regret my purchase and will do my best to encourage my friends and acquaintances to avoid these sham products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this. Use a natural, cheaper product, like St. Ives or Mint Julep instead. You&#x27;re getting the same results, and you&#x27;re not killing marine life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, SCREW YOU, L&#x27;Oreal for using \\&quot;Natural Apricot\\&quot; in your label.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a regular kind of face scrub.</li>
            <li> Great for blackheads too</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 clean is awesome! I love the smell . I love the deep cleaning exfoliating scrub it makes my face feel clean, soft and it feels great. I actually look forward to my morning shower 😊</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the results. The scrubber is very effective and make sure to exfoliate with your hands after.  I no longer have tiny bumps on my forehead, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say in about 4 years. Worth trying!</li>
            <li> i like this scrub pretty well so far since i have only used it once. it does soften your skin and makes it shiny also. it feels like a very invigorating scrub and you can feel your face tingle a little bit. i would only recommend to use this once a day because this is a scrub with beads in it and it may irritate skin with too much use. i do like this product but only gave it four stars because i&#x27;ll need to use it more to form a full opinion of it but it does seem to do a good job so far. the smell is nice too, it smells more like peaches than apricot to me but i like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this specific product based on its ratings and reviews. My black heads are gone. Gone. I thought they&#x27;d never go away and I&#x27;ve tried everything. It does dry out my skin, but I use a moisturizer afterwards and rotate between this cleanser and Aveeno Ultra Calming Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Can I first express how bummed I am that Target doesn&#x27;t sell this in store anymore nor online? Haven&#x27;t checked Walmart again but I rarely go there so I didn&#x27;t even try. Thankfully, amazon sells this and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the most sensitive face. After healing with murad line for acne, I needed a good face wash that&#x27;s gentle. My niece was using this at the moment and so I asked if I could try it and it was just from that one try, I fell in love with it. The smell is just right. Not strong at all. The mini beads are gentle enough to exfoliate my skin and get rid of the dirt. I personally don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with. I just use my hands. I have this thing about brushes and how it builds up dirt even though you clean it after each usage. I don&#x27;t need that much of a cleaning. My hands does justice. It&#x27;s been about 3-4 yeas of me using this product and up to this day, I still love how it does its job. This cleans your face and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry since I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena products and back then, I felt like it stripped the good oils in my face and left my face extremely dry where I would need to pack up on the moisturizer to keep it from breaking my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you want that gentle face wash. Strong enough to remove the excess make up but gentle enough to keep your face good clean and not strip away too much of your natural good oils on your face. Hopefully that makes sense haha. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I had used a different brand of apricot scrub for years because it was inexpensive and seemed to do the job. I tried this product line and loved it from the first use! It is gentle on my skin and a great way to start my day! It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective. I am glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Update, my new favorite non-plastic based scrub is the [[ASIN:B001E0W30U Queen Helene Mint Julep Scrub, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. The st. ives scrub is too coarse, but the queen helene is much finer, resulting in a really expensive super-super-fine sandpaper feel. still has chemicals though, so still searching...    Also, 12/2013 nytimes article on plastic microbeads:[...]    --    This was absolutely my favorite face wash...until reading the reviews here, I realized that there was just too much plastic involved in this product, aargh! I first started shopping on Amazon to see if I could find the product without the plastic scrubber since I never use it, and then realized that all of the exfoliating scrubby microbeads are also PLASTIC (polyethelene)!  GAH! and duh!!! Thanks to le_revolution&#x27;s review, I know now how wrong I was...    for more of the research and info: [...]    \\&quot;Analyzing facial cleanser products, 5 Gyres estimates that a single product can contain over 300,000 of these beads! In samples taken from our expedition to The Great Lakes in 2012 we found these beads, in some cases numbering more than 600,000 per square kilometer!\\&quot; ... \\&quot;Micro-plastic particles have been found in fish, marine mammals and reptiles, and in the digestive and circulatory systems of mussels and worms.\\&quot;    I wrote this in a comment but wanted to share with everyone - L&#x27;Oreal is planning on discontinuing this product, but please, based on the above, please don&#x27;t buy this. Instead, take le_revolution&#x27;s advice and try out the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]].  Amazingly, I remembered that my grandma used to use this stuff years ago over 30 years ago, so something that&#x27;s still on the market that long has got to be good.    (yes, eventually, I know I can make my own, but I&#x27;m just not there yet...just hoping to spread the word!)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The small scrubber that is attached is soft enough for even delicate skin around the eyes and firm enough to exfoliate. My face feels very fresh and moisturized after using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I exfoliated my face and then plucked the hair out of my face right afterwards. It made the plucking easier. My skin is already improving after less than using for one week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash and finally stumped upon this one. The little beads inside the soap make your face feel refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I use it not only on my face but on my neck, chest and backs of my hands.  Then I slather on the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream in all these spots.</li>
            <li> As warm weather hits my skin goes a little nuts.  I don&#x27;t usually suffer from breakouts but when I reach for L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean because not only does it deeply exfoliate but it leaves my skin feeling renewed, refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love it. I would recommend it to everyone. Shopping on Amazon.com makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a five star product! It does exfoliate my skin so well and I do not feel hurting or too dry,irritating afterwards at all. The small scrubbing tool comes with it is so impressive. The price is reasonable, actually cheap.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing for sensitive skin, nice mild scent.  Come with a cleansing pad that fits into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Recently though it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in stores so I had to resort to online shopping. The fragrance is refreshing, fruity, and subtle. I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction like I sometimes do with face wash (I have sensitive skin). Right now my face is breaking out a lot (I&#x27;m guessing hormones) and this has been the only wash that calms down my flaring acne. Can&#x27;t say much about it ridding blackheads since I don&#x27;t have much of that. This is an exfoliant so make sure to moisterize afterwards!</li>
            <li> When I first got this product and the cleansing one (green colored) I was super excited to try it. For the green colored one I thought the scrublet worked better, but for this one I would rather use my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not experiencing the same results with my blackheads as other people have noticed, but it takes the dirty and oil out of my pores. I also don&#x27;t see as much exfoliation as it claims it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars still for cleansing out my face,the cute scrublet, and the low price, but I&#x27;ve seen better exfoliators out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the 2nd time and i knew it would do wonders..my skin feels so soft and i can see the difference...the scrublet works well in cleansing :) highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is small and ineffective. After a couple of weeks, I concluded it was just an ordinary face/body wash, in my opinion. At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.. Cleans great and I can&#x27;t go without using it every morning and before bed. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an islander and naturally I was born with very oily skin, matched with my tan skin if that has anything to do with it. Usually when I use these things my face gets really dry and irritates me just hours after my initial shower. This stuff leaves your face smooth, clean and refreshing with a good smell and doesn&#x27;t dry up on you at all. It&#x27;s very rare that I find something to put on my face that I trust but this is something I&#x27;ll keep buying and buying. The scrub brush is pretty nice, it really does get into spots your hands or fingers normally couldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough, it smells good, and it leaves my face totally clean. I love it very much. I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I like how cheap this product is and comes with a lil scrubber. There&#x27;s little exfoliating beads and gives you a fresh clean feeling. This cleanser isn&#x27;t strong enough for me, so I wash with a second cleanser after.</li>
            <li> I got this to exfoliate and I love the clean smell and how my face feels after using it!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh exfoliating facial scrub!</li>
            <li> This exfoliating scrub smells so nice and works very well in deep cleaning your pores. The little scrubby that comes with it is very nice too. It&#x27;s soft and really gets your face clean and smooth.  It&#x27;s a good product that I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a week now.  The smell is wonderful and the beads/ exforliating materials are not harsh.  This is great for day and night washing of your face, without drying your skin.  If you want more of a &amp;#34;chemical peel&amp;#34; type exfoliating gel, this isn&#x27;t for you.  This is a very light exfoliation.  It also comes with its&#x27; own pad right on the bottle, which is rubber with little bumps on it.  A nice little prize!</li>
            <li> This product was all right. I liked the scent, and the addition of the scrub was nice as well. The only problem I had with this was that it dried my face out after a few uses, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This feels really clean and fresh and the smell is nice. I really enjoy using the little brush that comes with it and in fact I pop it out to use with some of my other cleansers as well. It feels very satisfying to use on your skin. My favorite time to use this cleanser is in the morning and it gives me a very refreshed, energized feeling.</li>
            <li> This face wash is nice, it smells sweet and the scrub is fun to use, but I dont know if it is the best thing out there. I couldnt really tell if it did anything special for me like it claims, especially with blackheads. I still prefer Biore products.</li>
            <li> this stuff is comparable to top dollar cleansers, left my face soft, pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy</li>
            <li> every time when I use it, I need to wash my face for a long time to make sure i wash it out.</li>
            <li> I use this in my shower and love it. It leaves my face feeling clean and oil free. I have suffered with acne all my life and I have noticed less breakouts, less oily skin and smaller pores since using this product. It doesnt leave my face feeling dry afterwards. I am about 3/4 way into my first bottle and will most certainly be buying it again. Def recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wish it has more of the little beads and it was a little rougher on my face. Still pretty good product, I use it along with another one and rotate each day</li>
            <li> It made my skin very dry and I ended up with a section of red itchy skin on my face. Never again.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleaner.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft.  It exfoliates gently without being too rough</li>
            <li> I like this product.It deep cleans and leaves my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face washes until I purchased this one from amazon. I love that it comes with a little face washing pad that is always with the wash because it sticks through the bottle. I also have combination skin &amp; on the dry parts it gets so dry that it peels. Well since using this face wash my face hasn&#x27;t been so dry that it peels for a while now. Also love the little beads in it &amp; it always makes my face feel so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub. Makes my skin feel soft and does not dry it out like some other cleansers. Also comes with a little scrubber as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in breakouts and stuff but I like the smell and scrubby and it makes my face feel very clean so I will continue to use it as an everyday cleanser!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for about a month now and I really like it. It lathers well and the scrublet is a nice addition! My skin feels very clean afterwards and not dried out. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product really left my face feeling clean and smooth . It comes with a little exfoliating pad which is soft against your skin.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING AND LEAVES SKIN FEELING REFRESHED!</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite scrub. The little pad it comes to scrub your face is SOOO useful! Especially when going on trips or something, it&#x27;s so convenient and cleans so much better than just using your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Love this product also works well .</li>
            <li> I love how it really feel cleans your fave without being too abrasive!</li>
            <li> not as good as Neutrogena exfoliating face scrubs for acne prone skin. The scrub included is useless and does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever gotten. I tell everyone about it and now even my husband has started to use it. Love the way the scrubbing pad fits right into the container. Your face feels amazing after using. I cook all day and after I get home and use this I feel so refreshed and clean. I received this product at a free or discounted price and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I really do not like the smell of this product. Its just unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face scrub pad was a good gimmick but I&#x27;m not excited about it. Ill go back to my old scrubs.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, and I guess it cleans pretty well. However, I think this product makes me break out. I&#x27;ve noticed that since using this product I have been breaking out a lot more frequently, when I used to only break out during my &#x27;time of the month&#x27;. I have changed anything to my daily routine, still use the same make-up, skin care, etc. So I think it&#x27;s this product. I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face with this, will see if I stop breaking out. For the time being I&#x27;m using this to scrub my legs and feet :))</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Great design with the face scrubbing pad built into the bottle- so clever! Great for men with beards! Wonderful light scent, great lather. Wonderful micro beads (not the chunky kind like in St Ive&#x27;s) that feel pleasant and gentle, yet effective at exfoliating. Me and my boyfriend love this scrub, he loves using the silicone face pad &amp; I love using this to help remove stubborn makeup and sunscreen. We will both be buying this product for years to come!</li>
            <li> Good and can use for half a year. My skin is oil, so this one is very good. But it is too clean, so I can only use it twice mostly, better once. That is why it can be used for half a year.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily face wash that not only cleanses and removes make up but gently exfoliated away dead skin. The beads are smooth and not irritating.</li>
            <li> The little hand-held scrubbing mat that comes with each bottle of face cleaner is a really nice bonus.  With the facial cleaner and the scrub, this is one of the best deep-cleaning facial cleaners i have found.  It works well on black heads and dead skin.  More over, the scent of the facial cleaner is very nice, subtle, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash with my Clarisonic...it gets the job done really well and leave a nice, clean scent. I love how well the exfoliating beads work, but they&#x27;re still gentle.</li>
            <li> So nice on the skin. Leaves you feeling fresh faced. Just make sure you do have some kind of cream on after. Right now its winter and my skin peels something awful whenever I wash it and let it dry. ALWAYS MOISTURIZE!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  Its easy to use.  Seemed like a good bargain.  I sometimes have a reaction to cosmetics but I had no redness from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I got an epilator and they suggested an exfoliant to prevent ingrown hairs.  It made sense to me and this stuff is an easy preventative that is working.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating scrub and the packaging is practical and very clever with the little scrubby having it&#x27;s own home on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is very dry and it is hard to find a facial cleanser that makes my face feel and look clean without it feeling tight and dry. This works extremely well. It leaves my face feeling and looking clean without overdrying. Also has an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Has a great feeling on the face and I love the scrublet (:</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubby and the fact that it is also able to stick to the wall made it super useful. I have cats, they love to steal little things like the scrubber or small face scrubbers from the tub and run off with them never to be seen again. Since I can suction it to the wall higher then they can reach its safe... until they figure out some crazy scheme to get to it breaking many things in the process I am sure... But so far they have not noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash itself smells great, feels great, and does an excellent job of cleaning my face. Don&#x27;t wear makeup so cannot review its ability to remove it but it can remove marker and ink from dummies whom forget the marker or pen is uncapped. Cough.</li>
            <li> This is the worst cleaner ever, I bought it along with the loreal go 360 Anti break out, and none of them worked, this even made me break out even more</li>
            <li> This is, hands-down the best face wash I have ever used. I have dry, acne-prone skin and have never been happier with a cleansing product. It gets rid of all the dry flaking, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or feeling damaged. My acne has significantly improved since switching to this cleanser. I will never go back!</li>
            <li> Works good. Has a good smell as well.</li>
            <li> Works really well, exfoliates and cleans the face</li>
            <li> dont like the chemical citrus scent. it doesnt even say the scent is citrus... at all but it works well on my skin since I have no breakouts</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these to use as a daily facial cleaner.  They work great.  My skin feels very clean after using it and it smells great, but not strong.</li>
            <li> Very good face scrub. This really gets rid of blackheads on your nose. The only complaint I have is that they made the lid rounded. It makes no sense that you can&#x27;t place the container upside down for when the level gets lower.</li>
            <li> This product works great! My skin is sooo soft. It&#x27;s gentle, but gets the job done. Worth the money, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Honestly this cleared up my acne which I&#x27;ve had for over 5 years now and within the first week I noticed a change! My blackheads were gone and my skin felt so smooth. This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry or tight. The scrublet is actually useful and best of all isn&#x27;t hard and tough like you would imagine. I&#x27;ve recommended this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> After using this scrub with the little applicator that comes with this, my dry skin doesn&#x27;t feel parched.  It&#x27;s soft and clean.  My pores look smaller.  This stuff really delivers!</li>
            <li> Use this wash every day and love it! unfortunately many stores are discontinuing the item so I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> Within the first use, the majority of the blackheads on my nose were gone! My skin feels amazing and not oily like it usually does. I don&#x27;t have a big acne problem, but this really helps with blackheads. Such a great cleanser!</li>
            <li> i liked it but it does not work as good as the St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub. would recommend buying that over this.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough about how amazing this scrub is!!! If anybody has really big pores and hate them please buy this!!!! It works amazing, immediately I can see my pores got smaller and it makes my skin feel soft and radiant. I love the little scrub thingy it comes with!! It&#x27;s a huge help and makes life easier</li>
            <li> Buy this product for many use this twice a week.best price for student. it is a marker less than 50 cents. nothing to complain about. it is a new item.</li>
            <li> I prefer a courser scrub and deeper cleanse, the only plus is the scrubber pad. Great idea, but I wish they could add larger beads.</li>
            <li> It really does clean 360 especially with the help of that sponge everything is so much easier and refreshing and clean of course!!</li>
            <li> I have am thirty years old and hate my skin! Finding a product that does not dry out my skin and fights blemishes is a great find in my book. Daily use of this product helps my combination skin to look nice, be smooth and follow up with a moisturizer makes a great starter to apply foundation and go on with my day. Totally recommended</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the micro-orbs (or whatever) have been shown to be a problem for the environment, I still like using exfoliating face products. The scrubber that comes with this cleanser is decent for that. However I didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement in my skin while using this, and for the price I can find something else.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Light, fresh citrus scent&lt;br /&gt;-Mildly abrasive&lt;br /&gt;-Great for Men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Drying (even on my oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;-No change in acne&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;Scrublet&amp;#34; worthless in my opinion.  It is silicone and once it is wet and soapy it is too hard to hold onto</li>
            <li> Caused acne, I think the scrubbing was damaging to pores or the product contained something that caused an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to gently cleanse your face and give it a teeny tiny massage at the same time. Each bottle comes with a clever little &amp;#34;scrublet&amp;#34; (soft flexible brush) that&#x27;s just right for applying the scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great for summertime feet!</li>
            <li> Contains plastic microbeads, terrible for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it works well, but unfortunately it contains plastic microbeads which are basically destroying the oceans.  Animals eat the plastic thinking it&#x27;s food, and our water filtration systems can&#x27;t get the plastics out of the water when it washes down the drain.  Several states are banning products with the sale of microbeads in them, I hope my state does too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because the producer could easily swap out the plastic beads for something natural (walnut shells?) etc that wouldn&#x27;t be so harmful, but they use the plastic microbeads in because it&#x27;s cheaper.  Such a bummer.</li>
            <li> Bought it after seeing its high ratings - got a bit disappointed because it didn&#x27;t clear my pores as described by other customers. The smell is good, though.</li>
            <li> very nice exfoliating scrub. I love the Scrublet. The flavor is awesome as well, I might want to try some other flavors next time!</li>
            <li> Great face wash; you can feel it working as you scrub it in, smells pretty good too and the bottle lasts surprisingly long since you don&#x27;t need much each time</li>
            <li> Great cleansing wash. I noticed visible improvement in days.</li>
            <li> It smells nice! That&#x27;s the best thing about this product. It does exfoliate, but I&#x27;m taking off a star for that silly little brush that have attached on the front of it. It&#x27;s so small/flimsy it&#x27;s pretty worthless. I just use my own face sponge instead!</li>
            <li> This product is very reasonably priced for what it does. It leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth and soft. The smell is nice and it&#x27;s not like your skin smells like an apricot all day. I generally have very sensitive skin, prone to products causing breakouts. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this did not cause me to breakout. I typically use it once a week to exfoliate and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  It exfoliates while it cleans</li>
            <li> excellent the skin is soft as mentioned on the product also it well cleans the skin,your skin feels really cleansed,I love it and do intend to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cleanser which have left my skin feeling greasy and heavy, but this is great. my skin doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or anything it feels fresh and the smell is great too its not overpowering like some other products</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating clean. Only thing i am not too fond of is the scrubbing pad so I use my hands. Skin feels soft and supple after each wash.</li>
            <li> The tiny scrub is awesome and this really exfoliates! Been using this 3 months now and it&#x27;s a great product and incredibly innovative. The scrub in the middle of the bottle pops out, it is really soft rubbery silicone with tiny soft rubber molds of dimples on there and you just splash a bit of the Scrub Gel on it and get scrubbing! I keep this in the shower and it&#x27;s actually effective with the scrub provided; I have seen noticeable difference with my nose blackheads/pores and the face overall. It works great to get off dead skin as well for the morning so you don&#x27;t walk to the office or school with a face like you got slapped with sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells incredible and has a very bright citrus-y scent that helps you wake up in the morning. Definitely recommend this product to everyone! And to males too!</li>
            <li> This is one of my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite products for our faces and it&#x27;s super cheap on Amazon! Totally worth it if buying things in a bundle purchase because the shipping price drops to zero.</li>
            <li> I use this every day to wash my face and neck.  Works great and exfoliates your skin as it cleans it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because I just don&#x27;t have the time. However, I had to make an exception for this product. I decided to purchase it after reading some of the other written reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I am age 49 and have large pores and problems with blackheads. I have been using this product for about 1 week now and there is a visble difference of at least 50% reduction in the amount of blackheads and my pores are visibably smaller. I compare this product to an expensive facial I purchased on a cruiseship about 3 years ago. At the time I could have purchased the facial products used by the cruise salon, but I could not afford it. I have tried other products hoping to realize the same effects and none came close. If you have large pores and blackheads, this is a must buy for you. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results are dramatic. My skin looks brighter, clearer and much more healthy. On the downside the product is a little drying(I have been using it once daily for a week now). If you have dry skin you will need to use a good mosturizer after you cleanse. I use the product before bed time.</li>
            <li> I Like the way it exfoliates. It smells good, but it kind of dries my face out. I only use it once a week when i need to exfoliate my face because any more than that will dry it out too much.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a dude so this review may not be as informative for the more experienced ladies out there. Before I used this scrub, I had blackheads, and a face that gets very oily. I had good, smooth skin, but it had its flaws. I tried this out after thinking it&#x27;s a cool idea to have a little piece of silicon do the work for me. I gave it a try and after a good month of using it at least once or twice a day, the blackheads have almost gone away and my face is smooth as hell. People tell me my face looks more \\&quot;bronze\\&quot; nowadays. No idea if that&#x27;s related to this but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was for blemishes when I bought it &amp; tried it. But I fell in love with it anyway. It leaves my face so clean &amp; soft. What a find.</li>
            <li> Its alright,keeps your face clean without drying it out. Only rated it three stars because its nothing fantastic. I do like the factt hat it was cheap</li>
            <li> I love this!  It cleans your face gently but the sponge exfoliant is soft enough to not harm your skin and love that it is attached to the bottle which I wasn&#x27;t aware of until I received it.  Will get more when this runs out!</li>
            <li> I always like L&#x27;Oreal products, but these are a DISASTER for the environment! The microbeads from products like these and this product in particular, are nonbiodegradeable and are destroying aquatic life. I&#x27;m throwing it out. (Keeping the rubber scrubber) Don&#x27;t let this go into the plumbing system.</li>
            <li> i like it very much !!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, application tool nice...</li>
            <li> My standard face scrub. I use it daily!</li>
            <li> I really love this scrub ........I have sensitive skin which st ives use to blister but this is nice, it comes with a rubber pad to wash ur face and it really gives u a deep clean with out tht hard grain pebbles u normally feel in scrubs definitely I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> This stuff is great my face is clearing up from the mild break outs I was having abd it&#x27;s easy to use in the shower and if it gets in your eye it doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel so clean and it really exfoliate as well. I have black heads on my nose and I&#x27;ve always hated it but the 360 clean helped me with my problem :D unlike other skin care products I&#x27;ve used in the past. Also, this has helped clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy another after I&#x27;m done with my current bottle x3</li>
            <li> My wife said this works good for her.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to reviews I read from other customers. It was a chance I took for everything works differently for people even if you cater to a specific group of people it will not work for everyone. This product did not work for me. I think in buying products that say they heal blackhead or acne, we should look more closely on the inside rather than using a quick fix product.&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because I had to use it or else I lose my money.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell and i love the little scrub pad it comes with...</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and body, it cleans skin very well. Its also great for removing face makeup. Don&#x27;t use it around the eyes, it will be extremely painful</li>
            <li> Perfect for the summer. Great for oily to combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it gets my face very clean and takes the dead skin off.  I wish it did not have microbeads, because of the threat those pose to the environment.  But the smell of the product is very nice, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It has an awesome, but mild &amp;#34;wake you up&amp;#34; tingle &amp; gentle exfoliation. I absolutely love the included scrubby pad!</li>
            <li> I have skin that&#x27;s very sensitive and always seems to be weirdly flaky, even if I&#x27;m not particularly dry.  It can lead to break outs if I don&#x27;t exfoliate enough.  I can use this scrub daily to remove all the dead skin, which is pretty much all I need.  Nothing else really works well for me, no matter how much it may claim to \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; or \\&quot;unclog pores\\&quot; or \\&quot;kill bacteria.\\&quot;  If they ever discontinue it, please believe I&#x27;ll be on every site I can find ordering out the last of the supply.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cleanser, particularly when the weather is warmer and sweat leaves me feeling gross.  Even with my very sensitive skin, rosacea, and psoriasis, I have never had any issues with dryness or irritation, though I do generally use a moisturizer after washing my face.  I love the little scrubber that comes with it.  As long as you are gentle while using the scrublet, you should not have any issues associated with over-exfoliation.  In colder months, I like the sensitive cleanser, supplemented with this once a week to help any dead skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a decrease in blemishes and blackheads, both of which were previously an issue.  I still get an occasional blemish (maybe once every month or so), but not even as many as I got using a cleanser by a brand known for anti-acne products.  One bottle lasts me several months, making it very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must recommend that, in order to allow the salicylic acid to most effectively slough off dead cells/remove impurities and oil in pores, you wet your face and the scrublet, put a nickel-sized amount of the product on the scrublet, gently massage onto your face in circles, then let the foam sit on your face several seconds to a minute (I floss while I wait), then rinse off, using your hands or a washcloth and warm water, again moving in circles to loosen and remove the product.  It will work well as a cleanser even without letting it sit, but giving it a little time lets it do its thing.  Again, that&#x27;s my recommendation as I have found it most effective, but I have no medical training so if a dermatologist suggests otherwise, follow his or her advice.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and feels good to the skin. Will buy again. Gentle scrubbing action, smells great. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product is any better than many other products. It&#x27;s average. It does clear up blackheads and leaves your face feeling cool and fresh. It also has a pleasant smell. The exfoliating beads are not abrasive - they&#x27;re more on the gentle side. The scrub pad...I don&#x27;t know if it really makes a difference. It has a rubber-like texture. This works as well as the St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub but this is more expensive.</li>
            <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time, cleans my pores very well, hardly have break outs.  Wash your face every time you shower!&lt;br /&gt;Black heads seem to have  gone a long time ago!  Removes that mushy stuff in your pours!</li>
            <li> This cleanser made my skin break out. There is another version of this cleaner that isn&#x27;t creamy that is great. Check out my past reviews to locate the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your skin is oily.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even worst</li>
            <li> Cleans blackheads away</li>
            <li> Great for the price and does the job ithink</li>
            <li> Face feels clean when I use it, but it also feels that way with pretty much every cleanser. Like the scrubby pad takes a long time to wear out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this. It seemed like a miracle-worker based on all the reviews, but alas...the search for clear skin continues.   Background: I have combination skin - not many zits, but tons of small blackheads in various places and very dry skin all over. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist and have tried prescriptions, all-natural/organic stuff, and everything in between. The reason I wanted to try this is because a benzoyl peroxide product was breaking me out. Oh, and I&#x27;m 19.   Good: I love that this is so inexpensive. Its inexpensive anyway, but when you use it you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your entire face. The smell is great too - just like apricots (unlike St.Ives)! The scrubs are perfect consistency - not too rough or big, but not whimpy or too many either. The face-scrubber thing is not as harsh as you would imagine. It is a very soft rubber. Suds up very nicely. Gentle and like I said - a little can go a long way. Cool bottle design.  Bad: Completely ineffective on blackheads. In fact, it may have broken me out a bit (I got two zits, but that may have been my face acclimating itself to the product). It is drying. It made my face flaky! The dry scales don&#x27;t show up until the next day, but they are there! I imagine it would be really bad if I stopped using my face cream (its the best I&#x27;ve tried - super moisturizing without exacerbating my skin issues).  Verdict: All in all, I have to give it a thumbs down, but if you have REALLY oily skin I&#x27;d give it a shot. Its only $5!</li>
            <li> Despite being in my 40&#x27;s, I still have a small problem with acne.  I have skin sensitivities, but I use this product in the evening and a gentle cleanser (like Cerave) in the morning.  This regimen has been great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really for me dried my skin out but I did give it to my sister and she loves it!! She swears by it!</li>
            <li> This product smells great and the exfoliating beads really do make your face smell fresh and feel even better! I use this every time I&#x27;m in shower and the scrub that comes with it is BRILLIANT!! My face felt so silky and smooth after I got out. Try it!!</li>
            <li> The is one my favorite exfoliate!  I had stubborn black heads for a while, but with using this it become so much less noticeable. It a must buy if you have issue with black heads like me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect .  .my face is free of oil. . Love it</li>
            <li> I shave my head and like to use [[ASIN:B0015I4LUQ HeadBlade HeadShed Lotion]] before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as well as the HeadBlade stuff, smells better, and costs far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement. But it does have a good smell. Nothing much more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am modern man ( yup, I do  take care of  my skin ) with mix skin type, and let me tell you that L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub is the best  on in the market, I just applied it and it  has left my skin  soft ,  black heads  from my nose are gone  and  It has a nice smell ( not too manly though). I wish L&#x27;oreal  never stop  making it. I am amazed  for how little I need to put  ( drop size for all my face!!) to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, and if you get it with subscribe &amp; save,  you cannot  go wrong !!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cleanser to help with pores and blackheads, and this is working great.  Love the little scrub pad, too!  Would most definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It leaves my skin so smooth and clean. It smells really nice and exfoliates gently so you can use it daily without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s affordable and smells great and does a great job exfoliating my skin!</li>
            <li> Super drying but it takes care of the dead skin thanks to the scrub-let.</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised! Used this to exfoliate my skin on my face and my pores seem to be much more cleansed.  I don&#x27;t usually have acne breakouts but this prevented any small blemishes and was easy on my skin.  Comes with a small pop out scrubber that you need to use for true exfoliating.  4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really needed this, I hated using soap to wash my face during showers. This product leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning for two months. In addition, I also use St. Ives blemish control apricot scrub at night time. I have a combination skin type and my skin sometimes breakout (especially during monthly period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt much better with the St. Ives apricot scrub; to me, it has much effective ingredient for breakout problems than this product. But, it really depends on the skin type you have. If you have combination skin type like mine, I recommend Mint Julep Masque! It really works!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Leaves skin nice.</li>
            <li> Skin is left feeling smooth and clean, no residue - like so far.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub and the tiny little exfoliating scrub pad that comes with it is a lot of fun to use. It feels really good on my skin. A gentle little massage. If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right one for you. I&#x27;m opening my mind to more of a gentle approach with my skin, and this seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have added it to my subscribe-and-save as a regular item.  It has a nice fresh smell, and the little beads create just the right amount of exfoliation for me.  I have sensitive  skin but have not had issues.  I don&#x27;t use the little pad that comes with it.  Seems many reviewers really like it, but I find I get a better scrub just using my finger tips.  Overall it&#x27;s a great cleanser that really scrubs out all the dirt and makeup without tearing up your skin.  Note that I have used strong topical acne products (retin-A, benzaclin) for many years and have no problem using this in combination with those.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  My skin may be too tough for it though.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and I just finished using it. It&#x27;s my first facial exfoliant (I&#x27;m very young but have some blackheads)&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are saying this product isn&#x27;t that great or that the scrub doesn&#x27;t do much. IT DOES HELP. It&#x27;s much easier than using a wash cloth (those always turn my face red or irritate it a lot)&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely FEEL this cleaning your face. It knocked all my dirt and make up off. I&#x27;m not sure how often to use an exfoliant but this is NOT too abrasive, it&#x27;s just the perfect amount! I feel that I could use this every two days or so without irritating my face. Definitely use a moisturizer after. I&#x27;m using Garnier Moisture Rescue SPF 15 Cream, but this scrub didn&#x27;t dry my face out enough to need a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating scrub, I RECOMMEND THIS TIMES A MILLION! It smells AMAZING, cleans SOOO WELL (also has Salicylic acid for BLACKHEADS AND ACNE!) and feels GREAT on your skin. The scrub is also a plus. The best part is: you get a new one each time you buy a new package of this stuff! I&#x27;m in love with my new exfoliating scrub, it&#x27;s perfect for me! I have normal skin that sometimes is very sensitive, being as I&#x27;m very young and my skin is still fresh. But this is enough not to ruin my face for when I&#x27;m older. THANK YOU AMAZON. :)&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, though, that this PROBABLY won&#x27;t get rid of your blackheads. And definitely won&#x27;t get rid of them forever. Blackheads are a constant battle you need to make sure you don&#x27;t clog your pores with dirt and always clean your face. This product definitely seems to be working against them but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for SEVERE cases. For severe cases, this should clear it up a bit, but not 100%. You&#x27;ll need to use something extra on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After a full 4 days of using it everyday, my nose started peeling a bit. I know it&#x27;s not good to exfoliate EVERY day but I wanted to try it because it was my first time. I&#x27;m going to do it probably 2-3 times a week because my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer! I recommend Garnier MoistureRescue SPF 15 Moisturizer. I use it right after, it soaks in IMMEDIATELY, smells amazing and is wonderful for your face. Won&#x27;t irritate your skin and definitely helped the peeling that the scrub caused, but that can be expected, since it&#x27;s an EXFOLIATOR.use my skin is pretty normal, but definitely use a moisturizer!

            <li> I have combination skin and this cleanser leaves me balanced and feeling clean. The scrublet is great not cheap at all and easy to handle. It exfoliates very well and all of my dead skin is removed; I have not felt dry flakes since using this.  The pores on my nose have also shrank and much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this has salycylic acid I feel like it could use a bit more. It appears to keep my pimples at bay and I have not had a huge breakout but it does not work very well to eliminate my larger bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woukd recommend this cleanser but be sure to spot treat if you get bumps.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li> smells great and my face feels great using this and my electric facial cleanser tool</li>
            <li> I use this scrub daily and I am a fan. The scrublet helps to exfoliate, but is gentle on my skin. The scent is mild but clean and refreshing, and a little bit goes a long way so each bottle lasts me over a year.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large pores and I&#x27;ve tried tons of products to help me keep them clean. This one does the best job by far. It keeps my skin from being overly oily resulting in blackhead build up, as well as making my skin extra soft. I use this twice a day, once during my morning shower and once when washing my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed if I run out and miss a few days, my skin is back to its old bad habits. Definitely try this if you have blackheads on your nose, chin, cheeks and other problem areas.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. My face feels so clean after using it. The scrubber it comes with is soft for your face but it cleans it really well. The scent smells so good. This face wash keeps my face clear of breakouts while making my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and I am a very satisfied customer.  The scrubing pad provided works great.  The design is perfect to fit in your hand.  I recommend this product for a gentle face scrub.</li>
            <li> this product is necessary to cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to order some more of this product.&lt;br /&gt;ir is neessary to order some more.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub. It is a little strong for me and drys my skin out so I only use it every 2 or 3 days. The scrubber feels awsome on my skin and it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few different exfoliates  in the last few years  but this product is The BEST! Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scrublet - The idea of the attached scrubber is great that makes cleansing fast and easy. Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning. LOVE the scrublet! For the money , you can&#x27;t get a better product than this.  Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li> love the way it feels when I use it. the bottle&#x27;s look, the brush (even though I don&#x27;t use it much). I use an automatic brush and I love the little apricot beads. I got this one cheap too, and now the price is up up...</li>
            <li> i love this facewash! It dried my face a little bit at the start, but keep with it and it works really well!! i use it at night and in the shower and then put on moisturizer after. amazing product. the exfoliating scrub brush thing is lots of fun to use.</li>
            <li> Liek it, cleans and exfoliates like it should</li>
            <li> I love the microsrubbers.  I also have sensitive skin and it does not cause break outs.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products in the world, it&#x27;s great for any type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I have an unearthly oily nose and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to help much at all with that, however it&#x27;s very helpful with other parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a cheap exfoliating face wash that I like. It&#x27;s not very harsh and gives you a sensation of clean skin. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever. I never meant to right a review but this stuff is just really really good. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial scrubs mostly expensive ones but this one just does the job after using it once I saw a difference! Felt like I should tell the world lol! Genius packaging too and great to get a little extra tool to work with for a deeper cleaning. Go buy it! :)</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;normal&#x27; type skin, and I was not having a lot of breakouts, but I needed a new face wash, so I tried this out. I LOVE this product so much that I got 2 bottles of it. I think the scrubbing tool is key in exfoliating. I have even used some of my other cleansers with the tool, and I plan on keeping it even when I am finished with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Best facewash ever, hands down. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time and money trying to get blackheads out of my nose and chin, and to get rid of disgusting acne on my forehead and let me tell you I&#x27;ve tried it all...dermatologists, facials, painful scrubs, etc, etc. I honestly bought this facewash only for the exfoliating pad that comes with it, but I fell in LOVE with the facewash. It smells great, feels like a massage when you put it on with the scrubber and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING afterwards, not tight or dry like others. After a few days of using it my blavkheads and pimples were gone, my pores were a lot smaller, and my skin was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face seeing as I&#x27;ve NEVER had completely smooth skin up until now. Another thing I noticed was amount a month after using this I had no problems with redness in my face like I used to. My skin color is completely even across my face. I even stopped wearing makeup a few weeks back (been using it about 4 months now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I suggest if you&#x27;re going to use this product long term like I have is to give your skin breaks from it. Every month for a week switch to another face wash, and then go back to this afterwards. Also 1-2 days a week use something else, as you should with any kind of facewash so your skin doesn&#x27;t adapt to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I highly suggest giving this facewash a try, no matter your skin type. It worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to really clean my face good.  I love the little scrub pad that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;Some things I really like about it:&lt;br /&gt;The little scrub is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;The beads are really exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;It foams up really well and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It drys out my skin ( I recommend finishing it off with ponds face cream)&lt;br /&gt;I think I may be allergic to it because I find that I wake up with more red bumps on my face in the morning then if I don&#x27;t use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is a good product to those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it because I have used multiple skincare products in the past that have not worked. I have big pores on certain parts of my face and tiny white bumps on my face, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on products trying to fix theses issues. I must say to my surprise L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub did the job it has my face looking and feeling healthy. My friends and family tell me how good my face is looking and people ask me and I wearing makeup that is how clear my face has become. Thanks to this face wash I have a new found confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S The face scrub also comes with a pad to clean you face with which is lovely it really helps clean down in your pores. And it&#x27;s WAY cheaper the other products that I have spent 100$+ on that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The little scrubby is the coolest thing and I love that it is held in the bottle so I don&#x27;t loose it. This stuff is gentle enough I could use it everyday but I only use it a couple of times a week. I have noticed a significant amount of difference in my face and blackheads, my face is smoother and my blackheads have almost all vanished.</li>
            <li> Probably the best exfoliating face wash I have ever used.  And it really smells like fresh peaches.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is safe, gentle but exfoliates down to fresh clean skin.  The older you get the harder it becomes taking care of hands, skin, etc.  as a retiree, so much time and so little to do.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product has been thought through.  From the bottle that holds the scrubbed to the design of the scrubbed. Has been great for my skin. It is obvious L&#x27;Oreal knows its market</li>
            <li> Love the bottle design! The exfoliating pad pops into a hole in the bottle for easy storage. Sure, it takes away from total bottle oz, but for the novelty... I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I was very, very excited. It smells sooo good, and left my skin looking clearer and feeling extra soft. After a few more uses though, I noticed my skin was feeling and looking drier than usual, and itching terribly. I still used my daily moisturizer as usual, but my skin still looked flaky and itched! The itching was terrible.The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a lower rating is because I know that part of the problem is my skin: it&#x27;s sensitive and dry. The product does what it says and is a good exfoliant, but not for people with sensitive and/or dry skin. If you have normal skin, it&#x27;s probably a good buy. If it hadn&#x27;t bothered mine so much, I would have kept it.</li>
            <li> For some reason, of all the face-washing products I have tried, this has been the most helpful in minimizing (but never curing) my acne problem. Different products work differently for different skin, and so far this one works best for mine. To those with persistent acne I also recommend never touching acne-prone areas, keeping your hair away from acne-prone areas, and changing your pillowcase frequently. Also, exfoliation removes tans, so if you want to maintain a tan scrub gently.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen huge results. Been using once a day for about two weeks. Maybe I&#x27;ll change the review when I go through the bottle</li>
            <li> Great combination of cleansing and exfoliation- not harsh but effective. The scrubber thingy works well! Curious who did the cool design.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store, not Amazon. I wanted a scrubby cleanser, but not one as involved as a microdermabrasion cleanser. I have middle-aged skin and in the last year or so it has become extremely dry to the point where I feel I have to exfoliate almost daily. I also didn&#x27;t want anything targeted towards acne prone skin. I tried it and as I was opening the bottle I noticed the dumb little scrubby thing. I was like, \\&quot;oh, there&#x27;s a hole in the bottle..there&#x27;s less product than I expected,\\&quot; (o.k. I&#x27;m jaded). I took the little thing out and I tried it being totally prepared to toss it in the trash can. I was surprised! It felt good. It was gentle and yet it felt like it was exfoliating. I tucked it back into the hole in the bottle and my next thought was \\&quot;how clever, now I&#x27;m not going to lose it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;For me this was a big success. I liked the gentleness of the cleanser. If you want serious sandpaper exfoliating this isn&#x27;t it. It is gentle enough to use as an everyday cleanser/makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t like to make it public, I like to exfoliate, especially after turning the big 30 during the winter.  I had been using another brand, but it felt like I was just rubbing cream all over my face and rinsing it off.  What I like about this brand is it had &#x27;scrubbies&#x27; which actually help at removing dead skin.  This leaves my face both feeling and looking more exfoliated.  Years ago I had used one that had the &#x27;scrubbies&#x27; and after starting the exfoliating process again and not having them, I sure missed them.  This is definitely worth the purchase.  With other brands, I feel like I&#x27;m just kind of wasting my time or simply washing with soap.</li>
            <li> The scrublet is so useful for cleaning your face really well, I definitely give it a 5 star for it. As for the exfoliating cleanser, it is just ok mainly because the scrubbing particles don&#x27;t really exfoliate well, they&#x27;re too suspended in the gel, and it is just a little bit drying, better for using during the summer. One thing I notice is if I get it in my eyes it really hurts and turn my eyes red and swollen for quite awhile, so I have to be careful. I&#x27;d probably get the regular cleanser version of this next time and not the exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I buy this product purely for the face scrubber that comes with it. Its just the right consistency to pull blackheads out of my face. I could even fill the bottle with a cleanser that I like better, although the cleanser works just fine. Let me emphasize, I do not get the same results using the cleanser alone as with cleanser + scrubbie.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Less expensive and equal or better quality to the St. Ives facial scrub. The built in facial scrubber is ingenious.</li>
            <li> Received the item as described and in timely manner in 2 days. thumbs up. quick service</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the extra scrubbie attached. So fresh and so clean</li>
            <li> It comes with a scrubber on front of bottle. It cleans well and smells very fragrant. Good price. Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li> cheap, very effective, helps to avoid break outs, do not dry out skin...its just perfect, needs no comment :-) recommend to all of you</li>
            <li> within 3 days of using this i see positive results, makes my skin look fresh n young...LOVE AMAZON very much</li>
            <li> Gets rid of large pores. Really like put on auto order.</li>
            <li> I have used it before but lemme tell ya that little scrublette is awesome. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Awesome and divine!!!</li>
            <li> After trying Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, and Biore products, I still had not found a product to minimize my pores AND oil production. Although, they are supposed to go hand in hand. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s go 360 Clean does both. I can finally go more than an hour without oily skin and my pores are always smaller after cleansing than before. Would definitely recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done ,good for the price</li>
            <li> This is a great idea having the scrubbing pad attached to the bottle. Use it everyday and does a great job and the scrubbing pad is just right for every day use.</li>
            <li> Usually I love loreal but after using this I got pimples, bumps on my face, and backed up dry skin. This doesn&#x27;t exfoliate well at all. It dries my skin out. I have pretty dry skin already but now that summers coming it&#x27;s not really dry. Also it is rare that i get acne. I was putting my makeup on the other day and all around my nose and under my eye was so dry and just dead skin it was disgusting. Then I noticed blood coming out on the dry skin. It was awful and wouldn&#x27;t stop. I will never use this again. I went back to my neutrogena exfoliator and put a mask on my skin and moisturizer and my skin is all better now so I know that it was this product that just ruined my skin. The idea of it is cool but nope not a good product in my opinion. I do love loreal but this product upset me so much</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh, I really like the scent of this product. Does not dry my skin out like many other products do.  The exfoliating tool is very nice.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been prone to breakouts and my skin had been pretty clear compared to most of my friends. But in high school, I developed hard-to-get-rid-of blackheads. Nothing I did worked. I tried St. Ives (which only made my skin really soft), Clean and clear (which got rid of the blackheads but gave me a lot of pimples) and then this product. It has been the perfect formula for my skin: no pimples and my blackheads are disappearing. It is even getting rid of dark spots that I had on my skin from the few pimples that I have had over the years. My skin looks so great that I may even stop using foundation as part of my daily makeup regimen because my skin tone is looking so even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even used the product a month and I&#x27;ve noticed an amazing difference! I little scrubber is very soft and works the solution in well. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the little scrubber but this product always makes my faces break out even worse. I have tried everything from Oxy, Biore, and Clean and Clear and this is by far the worst. My face feels soft and it does help black heads on my nose, but for acne every where else- especially my T-zone- it makes it worse. I recently tried using that again just to make sure it was really this causing issues and my face now has the worst acne that I have had since I was like 13 going through puberty. I do not recommend this at all. I live in a dry climate and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> vgood good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li> I love this and love the little scrubber and the way it is attached to the bottle.  It is well priced and lasts a long time.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The results of this facial exfoliator are neither better nor worse than most products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Only objection is that it is difficult to remove and takes a lot of rinsing.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser, it makes your face feel clean and soft. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days but I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in my skin. There&#x27;s no pimples and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> Probably the best face wash out there in terms of price, effectiveness and practicality. An essential hygiene item.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves your face feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my skin softer and smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in my pore size or visibility&lt;br /&gt;- The scrubber thing is weird...I never use it</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
            <li> Great wash for the face, it leaves it really clean and refreshed, but has SLS and my trying to go organic</li>
            <li> Love the little scrubbing beads and the pad that comes with it to battle the residual of a long, hard day</li>
            <li> The face wash itself is nice but not mindblowing. If you want the scrubby pad but not the face wash, hit up any Asian discount store! I spotted one at a DAISO for $1.50, exact same thing. In fact, a tad more sturdy!</li>
            <li> This face wash is great for combination skin. I really like the scrublet it comes with, in fact, I use the scrublet with other cleansers when I feel that my skin needs a break from all the exfoliating. Cleanser lathers well and smells yummy. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my face super smooth. Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Dries my face out a bit...but I like the scrubby bits and I sure have a thing for the peach smell. Why not.</li>
            <li> Using it for sometime now. A very good product that cleanse your skin thoroughly. Would recommend people to try it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It has a detachable applicator that works very well. This makes my face feel wonderful. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel good</li>
            <li> I have back acne, and I needed something that can control it and I found my solution. If you try and buy a product that is &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for use on the body, you&#x27;ll end up paying $10 or more. The price is cheap and it comes with this awesome scrub that is attached to the bottle so you&#x27;ll never misplace it.</li>
            <li> This one works well and has a clean fresh scent that I liked. I did not enough the scrubby part since I felt that&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting less product. Felt like I paid extra for that little scrubby bit. It was most annoying to always have&lt;br /&gt;to replace it back on the bottle. Otherwise this scrub was good and definitely made my face lighter and brighter. It looked&lt;br /&gt;cleaner too and got rid of the blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my face feeling fresh, clean and clear of any pimples. It even comes with a scrubbing pad for your face. So i&#x27;d say for $4 this is not a bad deal at all. If you use it wisely it does last long.</li>
            <li> the price is cheap and good for cleansing.</li>
            <li> The scent is very refreshing, and the scrubbie brush really makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even when used regularly and for about a month, this product did nothing to abate my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found success in Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) wash (Glytone mild gel wash) for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face smoother than a babys butt.</li>
            <li> Love this!  The little scrubber makes my pores look so good and this apricot smells so real I feel like I am cleaning my face with a fuzzy fruit! love it.</li>
            <li> Immediately after putting this product on my face it started to burn so i washed it right off and my face turned red and puffy and i assume it was chemical burn. I dont have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot things, even \\&quot;dermanew\\&quot; products and they did not really work... but this tiny sponge really amazed me, even after my very first use of this product showed me bigger result then \\&quot;dermanew\\&quot; products during whole month...</li>
            <li> Love the scrub thingy.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, for the scrubber more than the soap itself. It is conveniently attached to the bottle and gives a better face scrub than others I&#x27;ve used. Use it every day and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love the Go 360 Clean line but especially the Deep Exfoliating Scrub version.  I started with the Deep Exfoliating Scrub the for my first time and switched to Deep Cream Cleanser but it was a lot more drying and way less exfoliating.  Now I&#x27;m back the Deep Exfoliating Scrub and love it.  I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin smooth not tight and dry.  I love the scrublet and how nice it feels on my skin. A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li> This product is unique because it features a little scrubbie pad built into the bottle. You pop it out and apply the exfoliator on it, then when done you rinse it and put it back. It&#x27;s a soft exfoliator brush, so you could use daily. And having it on the bottle keeps it from getting dirty on the counter. So, kind of neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a nice light grapefruit smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem to give it only 3 stars?  This doesn&#x27;t feel like an exfoliator. I like my exfoliation to hurt! (Just kidding!).  But I do like to feel I&#x27;m scrubby something away.  This feels more like just a cream facial wash....there&#x27;s very little tiny beads to exfoliate and they just aren&#x27;t grainy enough to do the job.  Back in the day, I used to use the St. Yves almond kind, which was basically crushed almond shells. It was brutal on skin, so I gave it up and went to a higher level:  Brighten Up by Vasanti being one of the best I found that efficiently felt like you were removing dead skin but not so much that you were taking off an entire epidermal layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just too soft with no grit.  I took to adding a sugar shaker in my bathroom and sprinkling some sugar on to my hand when I use this, mixing it with this product, so when I scrubbed I felt like I was getting a little more grit in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again unless they pumped up the scruff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of facial products over the past 15 years in which I battled with my skin. This has got to be my favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish it were a TINY bit scrubbier but the rubber scrub pad that comes with this cleanser is amazing. It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to scrub my whole face, neck and chest that I find myself scrubbing longer than I normally do. It&#x27;s gentle and actually quite relaxing. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the smell is fabulous. It&#x27;s perfectly citrus-ey and not at all sugary or chemical. What a way to wake up in the morning!!! Truly, my face is softer than it has ever been by a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> This comes with a small rubber scrubber built right into the bottle that is really good for exfoliating. I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> The soap is average. The scrubby thing that comes on it seems like a good idea but it isn&#x27;t. You have an extra chore because you have to clean it or else you have dead skins sitting in it!  Now think about more than just you using it.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty cool and the wash has a nice scent.  I honestly purchased this as a mistake but was pleasantly surprised by how it worked.  The beads were a little harsh for my skin as I have very sensitive skin, so I will not purchase again, but if you really need to get in there and get those pores clean this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in junction with an activated charcoal Konjac sponge, and now on my third day, my blemishes are almost gone and the pores on my nose (while still there because they&#x27;re a nightmare) have improved ten folds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved way north from Texas, and I think that threw my skin off in a big way. I had never had such a bad breakout; I went through Accutane three times, the third time on double dosage, and since then breakouts usually come then I&#x27;m good for a few weeks, but this time was unrelenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to find a product that actually works without leading to negative effects, since my skin is so troublesome! And I&#x27;ve never been more happy to wash my face twice a day (which has a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m sure!!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s either this, or the sponge, or both of them are doing a great job. Either way, I enjoy them both!</li>
            <li> I only used it once and my skin felt instantly brighter and smoother. Recommend and with that great price don&#x27;t think twice just buy</li>
            <li> This product is fun, because you get use of a little scrubber to use. And after using it my face feels clean. However, my face is not really exfoliated. The beads don&#x27;t really do much on my face. Buy this if you want clean skin, but not exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> love this product! such a clean feel</li>
            <li> Nice hint of grapefruit smell and gotta love what it comes with</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my face feel very smooth and soft.  A little bit goes a long way.  I have large pores but it seems to minimize them.  I use it with my battery powered Olay face scrubber.</li>
            <li> This product works so well with the scrubber that is attached to the bottle. I have had many comments on how pretty my skin is since I started using this. I will continue to use this and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> as a guy, its kind of embarassing recommending this to people but it really works that well. its also very cheap and has natural exfoliating bead things. ive been reading that some of the great lakes are being polluted by man made facial wash exfoliants which was pretty unreal to read about so i quickly read the label and was relieved that my favorite face wash is good to go.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells so good, and it makes my skin feel nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again in this size, since it is so small and weirdly shaped.  Once you remove the scrubby there is a big hole which makes squeezing the bottle awkward.</li>
            <li> this product comes with a plastic rubber scrub which gently exfoliates your face. It works to take off make-up and oil. the cleanser on its own is good but the scrub is what exfoliates. It contains large beads that i don&#x27;t feel exfoliates at all. the smell is not particularly strong. Its not a bad cleanser, I just prefer the scrubby beads from the Proactiv cleanser. Still on the look out for a better facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this scrub, and when used alone, I enjoyed it. However, when used with the little scrubber it comes with, my face would break out in bumps. Maybe your face won&#x27;t mind it, but mine hated the scrubber, so I just used the produce with my hands alone, which sort of defeats the purpose of buying this particular item. In my mind, there are better exfoliators out there for the same or better price.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! After a wash my skin feels great and clean. Also te little scrub thing that comes with it its sooooo helpful! AND the lil scrub thing wont get lost because it has a lil spot for it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Daliy wash need it .price is super cheap .but i&#x27;m not sure it does good job or not .won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Love it when I can choose items from my granddaughter&#x27;s wish list for birthdays and Christmas.  That way I know she is getting exactly what she wants!</li>
            <li> Nice product and very delicate. The microspheres are so little and soft that I sometimes I cannot teel it is really exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do! It makes your skin smoother and cleans deep to remove oil and dirt making your pores appear smaller and smaller with every use, the exfoliating cleanser makes your skin appear more youthful and smoother while getting rid of the shine caused from oils. It  also smells great and has the handy scrubber attached that cleans even deeper. You really couldn&#x27;t get a better facial cleanser. This one does everything and more that the top dollar creams and cleansers do, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good for getting rid of oil on the face. Have to put lotion on after washing your face, because your face will feel dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but it&#x27;s pretty good. I love the exfoliating scrub brush. It makes me really feel like I&#x27;m getting deep into my pores. My only problem is that it dries out my skin a lot but I just put on some face moisturizer and it&#x27;s fine. But my face is a lot smoother than how it was before.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Removes make up very well and it is not harsh on your skin at all. It gentle but it cleans the skin</li>
            <li> Such a good price and it scrubbs my skin without being too rough. The scrubber it comes with is cute but its not necessary.</li>
            <li> So many of the facial scrubs come in such small containers.  I like that L&#x27;Oreal gives more.  Who wants to by facial scrub every month?!  I actually don&#x27;t use the scrublet that comes with it.  I use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System instead.  The combination of the two leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
