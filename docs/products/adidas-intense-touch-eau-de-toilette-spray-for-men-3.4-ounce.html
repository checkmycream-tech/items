            <li>This is my second purchase of an Adidas toilette spray (Intense Touch) and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for a guy wants to smell great.</li>
            <li>Burberry original (strong, somewhat long lasting musky smell, also best for colder weather)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Okay, lets be real here.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much, it stays with me a long time, and has  a nice fresh , clean scent.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised how many ppl&lt;</li>
            <li>Eternity (strong and long lasting masculine smell, best for colder weather)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Adidas intense touch.nice manly perfume with unique and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you go to the gym and then use it just for a little bit.</li>
            <li>My husband and teen sons love all the Adidas cologne.  </li>
            <li>Get ready for compliments!</li>
            <li>Good price for the brand but the smell last low</li>
            <li>Strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, fine daily cologne.</li>
            <li>Am using Adidas for the past 5-6 years and this one in particular not even smells good.</li>
            <li>I really like that cologne</li>
            <li>To be honest, it never really gets old.</li>
            <li>Terre D&#x27;Hermes (this is a very strong cologne which I personally only use on interviews as it gives the sense of maturity and experience and lasts very long even when sweating on your suit haha)</li>
            <li>Smell is OK is but half the bottle had leaked.</li>
            <li>COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>007 Black (this is my casual, relaxed day cologne, usually wear it with comfortable clothes as opposed to stylish, best option for those on a budget as it has a high quality scent)&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product was packed, and was easy enough to open..</li>
            <li>It is alcohol based and will last 2 hours at most if you go outside so don&#x27;t expect this to be a replacement for an actual cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one my favorite, for the active duties or simply hanging out.</li>
            <li>any way So far this year I have gone through 6 bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how inexpensive they are....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be new, but it came open.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it needs to, and that is supplement your other scented products.</li>
            <li>Little problem though, it does not last long but has this nice clean scent at least it last for a couple of hours.</li>

            <li> Not as I expected, not long lasting at all</li>
            <li> Just for the record, don&#x27;t be fooled by the ingredients that say all that fruity stuff, because it smells &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34; It was bigger than I expected so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a giant waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Scent goes on and instantly disappears without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I had the limited edition before this one, the carbon bottle</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast,product is affordable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put it down since; everywhere I go</li>
            <li> are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a serious cologne that will last through the day should not be looking for a cologne at this price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those guys that has like 7 different serious colognes</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit (A bit of a sweeter smell, masculine with touches of feminine undertones which will make girls go crazy, my personal favorite)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Armani Black Code</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late teens</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sporty, but not too serious either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways if you are looking for a serious cologne invest in:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> (A little on the expensive side however)</li>

            <li> I bought this for my brother an he really liked it, he immediately sprayed some. Just for the record, don&#x27;t be fooled by the ingredients that say all that fruity stuff, because it smells &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34; It was bigger than I expected so that was a plus. The price was great for the size. And it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, it stays with me a long time, and has  a nice fresh , clean scent.</li>
            <li> Smell goes away very quick some cheap s***</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast,product is affordable. Gift receiver loved it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite, for the active duties or simply hanging out. You will be surprised how many ppl&lt;br /&gt;assume it is a designer brand lol. I had the limited edition before this one, the carbon bottle but i don&#x27;t if Adidas still makes it. any way So far this year I have gone through 6 bottles.</li>
            <li> Great medium lasting scent!</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this in-store I fell in love with the scent of this cologne. I haven&#x27;t put it down since; everywhere I go I get compliments about the smell from men and women alike. To be honest, it never really gets old. I&#x27;m in my late teens so it&#x27;s the perfect smell for a young guy like me. It&#x27;s not too sporty, but not too serious either. I highly recommend it for a guy wants to smell great. The scent lasts all day - and honestly sometimes days! Not overbearing, not fruity, but not too &amp;#34;alcoholic&amp;#34; in smell either. Just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, buy it for your man - it makes a great gift. And guys, if you want to walk out of the house confident you&#x27;ve got a great smell that will last you all day, then this is the cologne for you! And for this awesome price! Don&#x27;t hesitate, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and smells great!!! 5 stars ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> Very happy with way the product was packed, and was easy enough to open..And the spray is good quality and smelled better then the write up about it..Very happy with product, timely fashion it was delivered...Will do further business..</li>
            <li> Excellent, the product came in as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband and teen sons love all the Adidas cologne.  They all smell great, although this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a giant waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Scent goes on and instantly disappears without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not as I expected, not long lasting at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be new, but it came open. I would not recommend to buy from this seller. And the box was too big for the EDT, with no protection.</li>
            <li> Adidas intense touch.nice manly perfume with unique and fresh smell. Little problem though, it does not last long but has this nice clean scent at least it last for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, fine daily cologne. COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
            <li> Good price for the brand but the smell last low</li>
            <li> Okay, lets be real here. Anyone looking for a serious cologne that will last through the day should not be looking for a cologne at this price.&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly what it needs to, and that is supplement your other scented products. I mostly use this after a shower at night before I go to bed so it gives that feeling of freshness when I wake up. It is alcohol based and will last 2 hours at most if you go outside so don&#x27;t expect this to be a replacement for an actual cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those guys that has like 7 different serious colognes so I would know. If you want something to impress and get compliments for, try investing in either one of these (I use a different one each day of the week and then mix them up on the following to keep people guessing, I get tons of compliments from girls at my Uni and they love how unpredictible my scent is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if you are looking for a serious cologne invest in:&lt;br /&gt;1) cK Eternity (strong and long lasting masculine smell, best for colder weather)&lt;br /&gt;2) Burberry original (strong, somewhat long lasting musky smell, also best for colder weather)&lt;br /&gt;3) Burberry Brit (A bit of a sweeter smell, masculine with touches of feminine undertones which will make girls go crazy, my personal favorite)&lt;br /&gt;4) 007 Black (this is my casual, relaxed day cologne, usually wear it with comfortable clothes as opposed to stylish, best option for those on a budget as it has a high quality scent)&lt;br /&gt;5) Armani Black Code (Need I say more?)&lt;br /&gt;6) Dolce and Gabbana One (Sport) (If you like spicy cologne which sweetens as the day goes buy, it is a must have)&lt;br /&gt;7) cK Man (sweet and somewhat spicy, nice scent for the hotter days)&lt;br /&gt;8) Terre D&#x27;Hermes (this is a very strong cologne which I personally only use on interviews as it gives the sense of maturity and experience and lasts very long even when sweating on your suit haha) (A little on the expensive side however)</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of an Adidas toilette spray (Intense Touch) and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m really surprised at how inexpensive they are....they are a lot better then most of the much higher priced colognes and after shaves for men that are out there! Get ready for compliments!</li>
            <li> I really like that cologne</li>
            <li> Came with a cracked topped.  Smell is OK is but half the bottle had leaked. Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to care for damage e&#x27;er purchases.</li>
            <li> This smells great, but the smell only sticks for a couple hours if that.  It&#x27;s good if you go to the gym and then use it just for a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not even smells like Adidas. Am using Adidas for the past 5-6 years and this one in particular not even smells good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced.</li>
            <li> excelent 100% + + + + +</li>
            <li> Really great perfume!! Strong and lasting.</li>
