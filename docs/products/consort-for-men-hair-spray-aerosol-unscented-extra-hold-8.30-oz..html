    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Finally an excellent hairspray without an obnoxious smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>Great hold, doesn&#x27;t smell, looks good!</li>
            <li>This is great hair spray.</li>
            <li>Great product its not sticky and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Receipt was as advertised and packaging was good.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A great product for someone who wants to keep their hair in its place against the elements.</li>
            <li>Have used the product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Has a light fragrance and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light...</li>
            <li>Colorless, odorless, and full of performance.</li>
            <li>Price is about the same, quality is good.</li>
            <li>It holds really well without creating a football helmet hardness like so many hair sprays and lasts for ever.  </li>
            <li>Cleans out easy with hot running water and a rub but who needs it.</li>
            <li>Wash it out quickly every morning in the shower and reapply without the worries of drying out your hair OR scalp.</li>
            <li>The hold still disappoints and takes 30 seconds of spray before you get a mild hold on your hair, and wind still will whip your hair around with ease.</li>
            <li>I bought this cuz it was pretty cheap and had a high star rating.</li>
            <li>As I was running low, I figured it may have been just because of the low power of the manual spray pump and that the aerosol in this version might give off a better spray that was more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I ordered it online and delivered to my daughter&#x27;s house because too large for clearing airport security.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need a large amount to use so the can lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>Holding hair shape a whole day.</li>
            <li>it does the job better than you can with any other hair spray that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I previously purchased the Consort for Men Hair Spray in the non-aerosol version and was not that satisfied with the hold.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product, holds hair well without being rock hard.</li>
            <li>A definite buy for someone with longer hair who wants to keep groomed.</li>
            <li>This is sold in the men&#x27;s department but, because of lack of scent and light but firm hold, I (the wife) use it daily.  </li>
            <li>no other comment</li>
            <li>Holds my hair down with gel in it doesn&#x27;t get to hard or stiff and no smell works great</li>

            <li> A little stiff for the first 5 minutes, then you won&#x27;t now it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Consort is the only men&#x27;s hair spray that I will use and have been doing so for quite a few years.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, the consort line has not worked for me in any variant I have tried and would advise looking at another brand for your purchase.</li>
            <li> Hey girls you can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair spray for men.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived on timing was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Colorless, odorless, and full of performance. That&#x27;s the unscented, extra hold product called Consort Hair Spray for Men. It holds in a windstorm, survives rain, and is one of the gentlest products on the market. Wash it out quickly every morning in the shower and reapply without the worries of drying out your hair OR scalp. I can ONLY get it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is sold in the men&#x27;s department but, because of lack of scent and light but firm hold, I (the wife) use it daily.  I ordered it online and delivered to my daughter&#x27;s house because too large for clearing airport security. Wish they made a travel size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. Holding hair shape a whole day.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I use a styling wax to shape, then hold it in with this hair spray. Leaves no odor and holds.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair down with gel in it doesn&#x27;t get to hard or stiff and no smell works great</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product, holds hair well without being rock hard. have bought it several times. no other comment</li>
            <li> This is great hair spray. My boyfriend gets this for his hair but I use it as well because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking or feeling greasy or even stiff. Has a light fragrance and is lightweight. I would recommend this to anyone who uses hairspray and hates what the others do to your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product but you have been out of stock so I had to purchase elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for several years and have no complaints at all.  I prefer the unscented spray myself but that&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> It holds without being sticky. A little stiff for the first 5 minutes, then you won&#x27;t now it&#x27;s there.And it does not smell!</li>
            <li> Have used for years but is getting hard to find around here. Price is about the same, quality is good. I like the fact that there is no smell.</li>
            <li> Consort is the only men&#x27;s hair spray that I will use and have been doing so for quite a few years.  It holds really well without creating a football helmet hardness like so many hair sprays and lasts for ever.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Finally an excellent hairspray without an obnoxious smell</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Consort for Men Hair Spray in the non-aerosol version and was not that satisfied with the hold. As I was running low, I figured it may have been just because of the low power of the manual spray pump and that the aerosol in this version might give off a better spray that was more concentrated. I was wrong. The hold still disappoints and takes 30 seconds of spray before you get a mild hold on your hair, and wind still will whip your hair around with ease. I have short hair and all I do is flip it to a side and ask for a product to keep it in place while I am at work. Unfortunately, the consort line has not worked for me in any variant I have tried and would advise looking at another brand for your purchase.</li>
            <li> The only brand I know of for men that is really unscented with a heavy hold.</li>
            <li> a terrific product for a man or woman.  I like the product because it is unscented.</li>
            <li> A great product for someone who wants to keep their hair in its place against the elements. The spray dissolves over a short period of time so it keeps your hair in place without leaking a sticky residue, you don&#x27;t need a large amount to use so the can lasts for a while. A definite buy for someone with longer hair who wants to keep groomed.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for many years.  Receipt was as advertised and packaging was good.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Does the job! I bought this cuz it was pretty cheap and had a high star rating. And i needed hairspray.</li>
            <li> Great hold, doesn&#x27;t smell, looks good!</li>
            <li> Great product its not sticky and has a pleasant smell. Holds well.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 3 months later&lt;br /&gt;Took a star, at about the 2/3 empty point the valve clogs at least mine does. Cleans out easy with hot running water and a rub but who needs it. It happens every other time used now. The spray is still holding my hair in place and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Hey girls you can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair spray for men.  It&#x27;s light... it does the job better than you can with any other hair spray that I have tried.  Give it a try.... you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
