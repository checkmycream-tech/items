            <li>i kind of like this more than the satya baba or whatever brand</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saves money, however from what i&#x27;ve experienced, pay the money for the higher end fight sticks...</li>
            <li>Always a favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been burning incense for many years.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa has always been a favorite.</li>
            <li>They burn great, slow, and of course they smell wonderful, not as pungent as the blues.</li>
            <li>The red is awesome and a must-buy when talking about incense.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>I love it, everyone loves it.</li>
            <li>I have been burning incense since the 1960s and really love this champa.</li>
            <li>This is also an outstanding value as I have seen many champas advertised for a lot more.</li>
            <li>There are many champas</li>
            <li>Love this incense.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of chai:)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many nag champa incense.</li>
            <li>These incense are simply the best smelling nag champa&#x27;s available today.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many combination mixtures throughout the years - this is a fine one.</li>
            <li>Great powerful and intense incense.</li>
            <li>Great initial smell.  </li>
            <li>This generous box means I burn it freely</li>
            <li>if you enjoy the newer nag champa formulas, you will like this.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a traveling DJ performer and learned from another DJ that lighting a stick of this incense on stage before the show really helps set an amazing mood.</li>
            <li>The price and the smell are both addicting and Fantastic. .</li>
            <li>If you want to feel like you are in the 70s, light up one of these.</li>
            <li>Love the red nag champa - it&#x27;s my favorite of all time!</li>
            <li>it burns smoothly and has a clean sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This is a special fragrance.</li>
            <li>The 250 Gram box is a bargain...think I will light some right now.</li>
            <li>I always burn Champa,generally the blue box,but I love this one more.</li>
            <li>This particular brand of nag champs seems like a better quality than the Sai baba.</li>
            <li>it was very challenging to just pull out simple moves in Street Fighter games...</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite incense.  </li>
            <li>I find I need to be in the right mood to really enjoy the red nag champa where as some of the more commercial stuff is good throughout the day for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>More natural.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is fairly rare, so I buy the 20.00 box.</li>
            <li>Two other good choices in my opinion are Satya Ganesha&#x27;s Luck and Goloka Nag Champa,  Shanthimalai Nag Champa has now become one of my favourites also.  </li>
            <li>The box arrived packed full and was very well-prepared by the seller.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>Satya Nag Champa  has also become very cheap in the UK recently</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always glad to purchase the next one.</li>
            <li>It smells the same but with more of a mellow hue.</li>
            <li>Satya Nag Champa had been my favourite for many years but it seems to have lost something in recent times and I was looking for something else.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Blue Nag Champa user for many years.</li>
            <li>too strong and not at all like the blue box scent.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to find the large boxes here.</li>
            <li>i love all of the nag champa range, but blue versus red: love the red for its more sweeter and gentler fragrance,  There is a goloka version, which I just ordered, but for now it is my goto incense for quiet times either mediation or for reading.  </li>
            <li>bought on the abundance of positive reviews, wish i hadn&#x27;t bought so much.  </li>
            <li>, this is much sweeter and floral smelling to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t want to pay more from the other sellers.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it out of curiosity and WOW - if you think blue is amazing, this red will really please you.</li>
            <li>This seller has FRESH red champa in large bulk...</li>
            <li>Read a review that said this Red Nag Champa was more like the Blue Box variety of the olden days.</li>
            <li>always loved the smell of nag champa and thought that the one in the blue box was the only one for me but over the recent years i realized that it didn&#x27;t smell the same as i remembered.</li>
            <li>It used to be the blue box Nag Champa, but then Tom&#x27;s Incense gave me free samples of the Red box</li>
            <li>wow, guess this is highly variable in quality.  </li>
            <li>and I encourage someone who hasn&#x27;t tried it to buy a small box, you probably will be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality, no waste, burns to the end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping the same seller will restock as the price was quite reasonable to the UK</li>
            <li>Usually buy the larger (500 gram) quantity, but this one was okay, too.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit harsh but at the same time light and airy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Shanthimalai before, this time the aroma did not live up to my expectations (maybe old).</li>
            <li>It is subtle, sweet and calming.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great initial smell.  But he scent doesn&#x27;t linger in the room like the black box.  Still a solid nag champa.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit harsh but at the same time light and airy. Its very hard to describe. I find I need to be in the right mood to really enjoy the red nag champa where as some of the more commercial stuff is good throughout the day for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> This incense is a lot fresher than other boxes I&#x27;ve had.  It is truly the best smelling Nag Champa I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s saves money, however from what i&#x27;ve experienced, pay the money for the higher end fight sticks...it was very challenging to just pull out simple moves in Street Fighter games...</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell heavenly, but your $ support a trust that trains women and girls in over 40 villages throughout southern India. This generous box means I burn it freely and I&#x27;m always glad to purchase the next one.</li>
            <li> This seller has FRESH red champa in large bulk...if you enjoy the newer nag champa formulas, you will like this.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that halmaddi/aloeswood musk smell, this is not the optimal product destination.&lt;br /&gt;This incense came plastic wrapped, and the sticks were still chewy!!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was a snap!</li>
            <li> I have been burning incense for many years. Nag Champa has always been a favorite. There is a hint of Sandalwood within the floral dominance. The 250 Gram box is a bargain...think I will light some right now. It is subtle, sweet and calming.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands and so far I keep coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, no waste, burns to the end.</li>
            <li> Got the huge 250G box of Shanthimalai Nag Champa and am very happy with it. This has one of the best aromas of any incense and I encourage someone who hasn&#x27;t tried it to buy a small box, you probably will be pleased with it. The box arrived packed full and was very well-prepared by the seller. Excellent!</li>
            <li> always loved the smell of nag champa and thought that the one in the blue box was the only one for me but over the recent years i realized that it didn&#x27;t smell the same as i remembered. then i got this brand, it&#x27;s legit nag champa the way i remembered it.. this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I always burn Champa,generally the blue box,but I love this one more.It smells the same but with more of a mellow hue. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves champa.</li>
            <li> These incense are simply the best smelling nag champa&#x27;s available today. They burn great, slow, and of course they smell wonderful, not as pungent as the blues. More natural.</li>
            <li> Very nice incense.  Satya Nag Champa had been my favourite for many years but it seems to have lost something in recent times and I was looking for something else.  Satya Nag Champa  has also become very cheap in the UK recently and I think this is reflected in the lower quality.  Two other good choices in my opinion are Satya Ganesha&#x27;s Luck and Goloka Nag Champa,  Shanthimalai Nag Champa has now become one of my favourites also.  I&#x27;m just hoping the same seller will restock as the price was quite reasonable to the UK but I wouldn&#x27;t want to pay more from the other sellers.  Can&#x27;t seem to find the large boxes here.</li>
            <li> The red is awesome and a must-buy when talking about incense.  Keeps the room smelling so nice.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Great powerful and intense incense.</li>
            <li> great smell!  i kind of like this more than the satya baba or whatever brand, this is much sweeter and floral smelling to me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Nag Champa.  It is a little sweeter than the one in the blue box.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the Nag Champa that I am accustom to.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> Item as described. Scent is nice and price was good. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent shipping service</li>
            <li> Read a review that said this Red Nag Champa was more like the Blue Box variety of the olden days. YEECCHH! too strong and not at all like the blue box scent. Hate it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Nag Champa scent for stick incense I have found so far! I love it, everyone loves it. I&#x27;m a traveling DJ performer and learned from another DJ that lighting a stick of this incense on stage before the show really helps set an amazing mood.</li>
            <li> Love the red nag champa - it&#x27;s my favorite of all time! Usually buy the larger (500 gram) quantity, but this one was okay, too.</li>
            <li> This is a special fragrance. I have been burning incense since the 1960s and really love this champa. It is a sweet fragrance but not like a fruit sweetness that you can get tired of. This is also an outstanding value as I have seen many champas advertised for a lot more. Champa in case you do not know is a beautiful fragrant flower that comes from India. There are many champas and I have tried many combination mixtures throughout the years - this is a fine one.</li>
            <li> I have been a Blue Nag Champa user for many years. I&#x27;d never seen or heard of this variety until a few weeks ago. Purchased it out of curiosity and WOW - if you think blue is amazing, this red will really please you. It is simultaneously subtle and bold. And, the scent seems to linger longer than the blue. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! ! The price and the smell are both addicting and Fantastic. .</li>
            <li> wow, guess this is highly variable in quality.  bought on the abundance of positive reviews, wish i hadn&#x27;t bought so much.  smells like burning leaves and goes out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Shanthimalai before, this time the aroma did not live up to my expectations (maybe old). I&#x27;m not exactly happy.</li>
            <li> i love all of the nag champa range, but blue versus red: love the red for its more sweeter and gentler fragrance,  There is a goloka version, which I just ordered, but for now it is my goto incense for quiet times either mediation or for reading.  looove.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite incense.  It used to be the blue box Nag Champa, but then Tom&#x27;s Incense gave me free samples of the Red box and I fell in love all over again! Being  a greedy creature, I kept buying bigger and bigger boxes until I reached the 250gm box. If my apartment wasn&#x27;t so tiny, I would burn 2 or 3 sticks at once, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll set off my fire alarm.  The smell is sultry, floral and a bit woodsy.  If you want to feel like you are in the 70s, light up one of these.</li>
            <li> Love this incense. I&#x27;ve been converted over from blue Nag Champa which I thought would never happen.</li>
            <li> This particular brand of nag champs seems like a better quality than the Sai baba. It is fairly rare, so I buy the 20.00 box. It lasts me about a month. Reminds me of chai:)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many nag champa incense. this is the best one. it burns smoothly and has a clean sweet smell.</li>
