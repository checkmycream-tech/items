            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles this is just a nice sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Konjac sponges are made of some kind of plant and are &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; cleaning products.</li>
            <li>and this sponge works perfectly to exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s mostly color and a gimmick), this is a good konjac sponge</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I love my Konjac sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love this for face washing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE SPONGES FOR MY FACE...</li>
            <li>AND YOU WILL LOVE HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I love that it&#x27;s biodegradable and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>Love this sponge leaves my face so soft and rinses out beautifully.</li>
            <li>so gentle, but effectively cleans my face, and I see a difference in the clarity and brightening of my skin!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this Volcanic one would be good for my sensitive skin, but I love it so</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is also happy that it is natural so it wont damage the skin at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It really is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>â™¦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>but they tear too easily.  </li>
            <li>I adore the smooth clean feel of my skin after using the Konjac sponge!</li>
            <li>sponges feel pleasant and soft.</li>
            <li>sponges feel pleasant and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great -- simple and and easy part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>It also has kept me free of any flaky patches.</li>
            <li>But with this sponge it felt really gentle and nice and after a use or two</li>
            <li>yes not only doI let others know about how great they are but also I give them as gifts.  </li>
            <li>She loves the texture and how smooth it is on the skin.</li>
            <li>Konjac sponges make great physical exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I love my Konjac sponge so much that I already ordered two more.</li>
            <li>And if your face scrub has any kind of beads in it(I use a kind with dissolving natural &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;), they get stuck in the sponge.</li>
            <li>The sponge makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean, smooth and silky...</li>
            <li>No residue, no tightness, no greasiness just smooth, clean skin.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>you wear makeup, make sure you use a face wipe or makeup remover first.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel that your skin is deeply clean and the foam of your cleanser won&#x27;t wash away .waste of money.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face is getting clean yet not damaged.</li>
            <li>With this sponge, the cleanser goes a long way and suds up very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I was very very surprised by how much I liked this sponge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, though, it really nice such a nice job of gently cleansing your skin!</li>
            <li>She loves it so much that she keeps mentioning to all her friends about the goodness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;There are only good things that we can share about this product!</li>
            <li>If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten about 5 of these Konjac sponges so far and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>This sponge is great for life in a humid climate--a typical face cloth will not dry out overnight here, but this will, which makes it much more hygienic and better for the environment than washing face cloths all the time.  </li>
            <li>This brand is my favorite :) I can get 1-2 months from one sponge and simply microwave</li>
            <li>Try Eco cellulite  facial sponges, cheaper and much more better than this.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these sponges for my granddaughters who both have mild to severe acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little sponge.</li>
            <li>This feels great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out.  </li>
            <li>I love exfoliating my face every day and wanted something gentler than a scrub but would still leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun skincare tool.</li>
            <li>my opinion, these sponges are the BEST invention in skin care tools to hit the market in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>after using it, she realized it worth the price.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that her blackhead is gone and she feels fresh after washing her face with the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my skin dry and scaly after using it the first time - so this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>It feel so soft on my skin, my face feel clean and so smooth.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD FOR WHAT THEY DO AND HOW LONG THEY LAST...</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference</li>
            <li>THEY THOROUGHLY CLEAN YOUR FACE AND GENTLY EXFOLIATE AND REMOVE BLACKHEADS...</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive and these are great at keeping my skin soft and smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li>It makes my extremely sensitive skin feel so nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It is more gentle than my Clarisonic (which I have a sensitive brush for).</li>
            <li>I have recommended Konjac Sponge to my friends and families, and so far I only heard good things about it from all of them.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>If you use it with a cleanser, you won&#x27;t get lots of lather since it&#x27;s absorbed by the sponge, but it does give you a gentle exfoliation while it cleans.</li>
            <li>of the time I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply any moisturiser---my skin feels like it was when I was new--maybe ;)</li>
            <li>By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient.</li>
            <li>I find that hot water helps rehydrate it quicker, but you&#x27;ll want to use cooler water to wash your face with it</li>
            <li>so it hurts with hot water.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it, it made my face feel funny</li>
            <li>â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to get excited about cosmetic things, but this has made my skin SO soft and has cleared up all blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this could get positive reviews, and that&#x27;s why I bought it, based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It gently buffs and leaves my skin soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>and now my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is super sensitive and nearly everything agitates it, but this sponge has been fine for far, on that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li>These are lightweight, gentle sponges that work well on your face and body.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have really sturdy skin.</li>
            <li>REALLY DOES</li>
            <li>GENTLE AND THOROUGH...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how I feel about this sponge.</li>
            <li>--it holds the water really well</li>
            <li>otherwise my face will get really irritated.</li>
            <li>Maybe I use them up too fast, before the mildew gets a chance to visit??</li>
            <li>Only use it occasionally, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>They really deep clean the skin.</li>
            <li>The sponge is so soft, yet still provides a very gentle exfoliation, leaving your face feeling squeaky-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face.</li>
            <li>It has a very strange texture and didn&#x27;t enjoy holding it in my hands.  </li>
            <li>The volcanic one is lasting much better than the charcoal bamboo one from the same company.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely be buying it in the future!</li>
            <li>I recoommemd highly</li>
            <li>you first open it and use it, it has an odd gooey sort of texture to it, but it nicely cleans your skin and leaves it feeling really soft, without aggravating anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usr a little brush, but as I get older my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>&amp; it did dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and helps my gel cleansers last longer.</li>
            <li>When you rub it in circles on your skin, it gives you very soft skin.</li>
            <li>I really expected something special.  </li>
            <li>It made me wonder just how clean it really gets your face if it won&#x27;t pick up a little foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using all of the konjac sponges because they cut my nighttime cleansing routine time down so that I look forward to</li>
            <li>It seems to be able to exfoliate very gently without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>You have to keep them moist every day or they do have a tendency to get dried up very quickly.</li>
            <li>but I have to be careful because I easily get reddened facial skin</li>
            <li>Plus, the string attached to it is very useful for hanging it to dry, and smaller ones don&#x27;t always have that.  </li>
            <li>I was wanting a facial sponge that would give me a little more of a scrub feel.</li>
            <li>I also make sure to press them hard between my palms to drain off any excess water.</li>
            <li>The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no problem using it on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>&gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria</li>
            <li>...MAKES MY SKIN SOFT.....</li>
            <li>THEY ARE MADE OF NATURAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a marked difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and reduction of oiliness.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the sponge, but am amazed at how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>teardrop shapes allow you to easily reach the delicate areas of your eyes and the contours of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, which tends to get dry if I wash it too much, but oily in the evening.  </li>
            <li>I did not try and use the sponge for this purpose, so no extra scrubbing, just used lightly against all of my face for maybe a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>boyfriend who has oily skin started using the sponge and my Careve hydrating cleanser, he used to get a pimple or two, nothing major, but after using the sponge/cleanser they have stopped showing up.</li>
            <li>She was first surprised with the price because she only spent around $3-$5 for sponges.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love these sponges and have tried a few different types of these, different colors for different problems.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and I can tell my soap is going to last for a very long time!</li>
            <li>I had previously not been able to scrub this area, as it is so sensitive and hard to get to with a Clarisonic (which would probably be too rough on the eye area anyway).</li>
            <li>The first week did not leave my skin soft and I did in fact break out a little bit</li>
            <li>Additionally, my pores look smaller because my blackheads have just about completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Since you have to toss them out after a few months anyway (sponges retain bacteria and also degrade with use, especially since this is a natural fiber and not something really sturdy), I find this particular sponge bigger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li>guess that&#x27;s better than a bad experience! :)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, dry in the t-zone and normal</li>
            <li>It feels gentle, but works extremely well at exfoliating and removing makeup.</li>
            <li>I only just heard about Konjac sponges last month, when someone mentioned them on a health forum I frequent.  </li>
            <li>The only thing comparable I have found is the Liz Earle Hot Cleansing Cloth, which is slightly rougher.</li>
            <li>I use chemical exfoliation (St. Ives Lactic Acid Pads and Stridex) but my skin can be a little peel-y even when well moisturized, so I occasionally use this to very gently remove the flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much difference between different colors, but the shape does matter, since the thicker/round ones tend to take a long time to dry out, and that means you might get mold inside.</li>
            <li>Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Just very light spots where the thicker spots were.</li>

            <li> Love the Volcanic Scoria sponge.  </li>
            <li> I love this sponge.</li>
            <li> I found that putting soap on my face and then using the sponge works a lot better than putting soap on the sponge.</li>

            <li> /&gt;She is also happy that it is natural so it wont damage the skin at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It really is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> â™¦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> but they tear too easily.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great -- simple and and easy part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> It also has kept me free of any flaky patches.</li>
            <li> But with this sponge it felt really gentle and nice and after a use or two</li>
            <li> yes not only doI let others know about how great they are but also I give them as gifts.  </li>
            <li> She loves the texture and how smooth it is on the skin.</li>
            <li> Konjac sponges make great physical exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I love my Konjac sponge so much that I already ordered two more.</li>
            <li> And if your face scrub has any kind of beads in it(I use a kind with dissolving natural &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;), they get stuck in the sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean, smooth and silky...</li>
            <li> No residue, no tightness, no greasiness just smooth, clean skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> you wear makeup, make sure you use a face wipe or makeup remover first.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel that your skin is deeply clean and the foam of your cleanser won&#x27;t wash away .waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is getting clean yet not damaged.</li>
            <li> With this sponge, the cleanser goes a long way and suds up very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I was very very surprised by how much I liked this sponge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, though, it really nice such a nice job of gently cleansing your skin!</li>
            <li> She loves it so much that she keeps mentioning to all her friends about the goodness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;There are only good things that we can share about this product!</li>
            <li> If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten about 5 of these Konjac sponges so far and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> This sponge is great for life in a humid climate--a typical face cloth will not dry out overnight here, but this will, which makes it much more hygienic and better for the environment than washing face cloths all the time.  </li>
            <li> This brand is my favorite :) I can get 1-2 months from one sponge and simply microwave</li>
            <li> Try Eco cellulite  facial sponges, cheaper and much more better than this.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these sponges for my granddaughters who both have mild to severe acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little sponge.</li>
            <li> This feels great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out.  </li>
            <li> I love exfoliating my face every day and wanted something gentler than a scrub but would still leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun skincare tool.</li>
            <li> my opinion, these sponges are the BEST invention in skin care tools to hit the market in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> after using it, she realized it worth the price.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that her blackhead is gone and she feels fresh after washing her face with the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my skin dry and scaly after using it the first time - so this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It feel so soft on my skin, my face feel clean and so smooth.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD FOR WHAT THEY DO AND HOW LONG THEY LAST...</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference</li>
            <li> THEY THOROUGHLY CLEAN YOUR FACE AND GENTLY EXFOLIATE AND REMOVE BLACKHEADS...</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive and these are great at keeping my skin soft and smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> It makes my extremely sensitive skin feel so nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It is more gentle than my Clarisonic (which I have a sensitive brush for).</li>
            <li> I have recommended Konjac Sponge to my friends and families, and so far I only heard good things about it from all of them.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> If you use it with a cleanser, you won&#x27;t get lots of lather since it&#x27;s absorbed by the sponge, but it does give you a gentle exfoliation while it cleans.</li>
            <li> of the time I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply any moisturiser---my skin feels like it was when I was new--maybe ;)</li>
            <li> By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient.</li>
            <li> I find that hot water helps rehydrate it quicker, but you&#x27;ll want to use cooler water to wash your face with it</li>
            <li> so it hurts with hot water.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it made my face feel funny</li>
            <li> â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to get excited about cosmetic things, but this has made my skin SO soft and has cleared up all blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this could get positive reviews, and that&#x27;s why I bought it, based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It gently buffs and leaves my skin soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> and now my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is super sensitive and nearly everything agitates it, but this sponge has been fine for far, on that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are lightweight, gentle sponges that work well on your face and body.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have really sturdy skin.</li>
            <li> REALLY DOES</li>
            <li> GENTLE AND THOROUGH...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how I feel about this sponge.</li>
            <li> --it holds the water really well</li>
            <li> otherwise my face will get really irritated.</li>
            <li> Maybe I use them up too fast, before the mildew gets a chance to visit??</li>
            <li> Only use it occasionally, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> They really deep clean the skin.</li>
            <li> The sponge is so soft, yet still provides a very gentle exfoliation, leaving your face feeling squeaky-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It has a very strange texture and didn&#x27;t enjoy holding it in my hands.  </li>
            <li> The volcanic one is lasting much better than the charcoal bamboo one from the same company.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely be buying it in the future!</li>
            <li> I recoommemd highly</li>
            <li> you first open it and use it, it has an odd gooey sort of texture to it, but it nicely cleans your skin and leaves it feeling really soft, without aggravating anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usr a little brush, but as I get older my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> &amp; it did dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and helps my gel cleansers last longer.</li>
            <li> When you rub it in circles on your skin, it gives you very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I really expected something special.  </li>
            <li> It made me wonder just how clean it really gets your face if it won&#x27;t pick up a little foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using all of the konjac sponges because they cut my nighttime cleansing routine time down so that I look forward to</li>
            <li> It seems to be able to exfoliate very gently without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> You have to keep them moist every day or they do have a tendency to get dried up very quickly.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful because I easily get reddened facial skin</li>
            <li> Plus, the string attached to it is very useful for hanging it to dry, and smaller ones don&#x27;t always have that.  </li>
            <li> I was wanting a facial sponge that would give me a little more of a scrub feel.</li>
            <li> I also make sure to press them hard between my palms to drain off any excess water.</li>
            <li> The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no problem using it on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> &gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria</li>
            <li> ...MAKES MY SKIN SOFT.....</li>
            <li> THEY ARE MADE OF NATURAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a marked difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and reduction of oiliness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the sponge, but am amazed at how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> teardrop shapes allow you to easily reach the delicate areas of your eyes and the contours of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which tends to get dry if I wash it too much, but oily in the evening.  </li>
            <li> I did not try and use the sponge for this purpose, so no extra scrubbing, just used lightly against all of my face for maybe a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> boyfriend who has oily skin started using the sponge and my Careve hydrating cleanser, he used to get a pimple or two, nothing major, but after using the sponge/cleanser they have stopped showing up.</li>
            <li> She was first surprised with the price because she only spent around $3-$5 for sponges.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love these sponges and have tried a few different types of these, different colors for different problems.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and I can tell my soap is going to last for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I had previously not been able to scrub this area, as it is so sensitive and hard to get to with a Clarisonic (which would probably be too rough on the eye area anyway).</li>
            <li> The first week did not leave my skin soft and I did in fact break out a little bit</li>
            <li> Additionally, my pores look smaller because my blackheads have just about completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Since you have to toss them out after a few months anyway (sponges retain bacteria and also degrade with use, especially since this is a natural fiber and not something really sturdy), I find this particular sponge bigger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> guess that&#x27;s better than a bad experience! :)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry in the t-zone and normal</li>
            <li> It feels gentle, but works extremely well at exfoliating and removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I only just heard about Konjac sponges last month, when someone mentioned them on a health forum I frequent.  </li>
            <li> The only thing comparable I have found is the Liz Earle Hot Cleansing Cloth, which is slightly rougher.</li>
            <li> I use chemical exfoliation (St. Ives Lactic Acid Pads and Stridex) but my skin can be a little peel-y even when well moisturized, so I occasionally use this to very gently remove the flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much difference between different colors, but the shape does matter, since the thicker/round ones tend to take a long time to dry out, and that means you might get mold inside.</li>
            <li> Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span.</li>
            <li> I noticed the areas that usually are a little flakey were smooth.</li>
            <li> Contrary to a negative post, it does exfoliate, but very gently.</li>
            <li> Really long lasting.</li>
            <li> They are having less breakouts and even old are scars are fading.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little on the sensitive side, as well, and this was so gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size fits comfortably in the hand but is thin enough to dry out in half day or so.</li>
            <li> Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried using wash cloths in the past, only to experience redness from the irritation.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see for the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes quite a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other.</li>
            <li> I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience.</li>
            <li> Just hang to dry</li>
            <li> I just cut it off and use a grooved soap dish to dry it instead.</li>
            <li> Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides.</li>
            <li> I hang it on a suction hook in my shower to dry after every use.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t keen on using physical exfloliation vs chemical, but if i could continue actively using them, I would.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exfoliate as often as I&#x27;d like, and makeup will cling to dry patches, but since I started using this sponge I haven&#x27;t had any dry patches!</li>
            <li> When I first got this sponge, I had a thin layer of powder foundation on</li>
            <li> Just an odd little odor that I smelled directly after opening it</li>
            <li> only difference was my face a little softer after usage.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t usually try anything for long before going back to fingertips.</li>
            <li> â™¦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling.</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling.</li>
            <li> You wet the sponge and wait for it to absorb the water and expand fully.</li>
            <li> I was using just my hands and cleanser and didn&#x27;t feel like that was enough, yet I didn&#x27;t want anything harsh.</li>
            <li> It gets a bit tattered after a few months but no big.</li>
            <li> YOU USE THESE SPONGES WET</li>
            <li> Did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, no real difference noticed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love finding unusual accessories for skin care, but this was awful.</li>
            <li> Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month with either plain water and with my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think I have started a lifelong habit!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Soft, squishy, but tough.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the long term benefits will be yet, I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a game changer or anything, it&#x27;s just weird.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s non irritating with my sensitive, rosacea skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than a month</li>
            <li> It has a little cord on it, and I&#x27;ve jerry-rigged a little hanger for it with a jaw hair clip so that it can hang in my tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of holding raw meat.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t use this for a few days, it dries out and is hard to re-hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the sponge is thoroughly saturated with water, squeeze out the excess and apply a small amount of your skin cleanser to the sponge.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed is some brown spots I had on my face, not sure if they call them age spots, started sloughing off after repeated use.</li>
            <li> My face felt somewhat smoother, but I didn&#x27;t have any dramatic results like in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was credited for the returns, at least there is that.</li>
            <li> The difference is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard.</li>
            <li> My sisters both have very delicate skin.</li>
            <li> No miracles, but my skin does feel smoother, clearer, and without any irritating after effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried random face scrubber/brushes</li>
            <li> I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated).</li>
            <li> I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated).</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s nearly impossible to wash your soap out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I as actually really disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My forehead and between my eyebrows were always a bit flakey even when I try to keep it moisturized, it wasn&#x27;t too annoying unless I dared to put make up on it, which made it look horrible and even my boyfriend would notice the flakes at that point.</li>

            <li> The sponge makes my face feel smooth and clean. Only use it occasionally, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Such a great product. Love it on my face</li>
            <li> fast delivery-excellent company-will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to get excited about cosmetic things, but this has made my skin SO soft and has cleared up all blemishes.  I keep making people touch my face!  It&#x27;s great -- simple and and easy part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten about 5 of these Konjac sponges so far and they are amazing. They truly do exfoliate gently and when used with a cleanser, it deep cleans your face without being harsh. This brand is my favorite :) I can get 1-2 months from one sponge and simply microwave when/if it smells like mildew. I&#x27;ve never seen mold or mildew growth however. Just hang to dry and you&#x27;re set! Love it, will order more!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have oily, problem skin and found an article about how amazing it was. I as actually really disappointed after using it. It left my skin dry and scaly after using it the first time - so this wasn&#x27;t the best product for me.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it felt great while using it &amp; it did dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li> My face felt somewhat smoother, but I didn&#x27;t have any dramatic results like in other reviews. I used it for a month with either plain water and with my facial cleanser. I doubt that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results. I used them as a youth in Japan and suffered no teenage acne.</li>
            <li> It has now been two weeks I&#x27;ve been using this sponge and I love it. My skin is smoother and clearer using it twice a day most days. Contrary to a negative post, it does exfoliate, but very gently. You&#x27;ll see results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teardrop shapes allow you to easily reach the delicate areas of your eyes and the contours of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the perfect sponge to exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> Very nice sponge.  This feels great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it . it&#x27;s so slippery on the skin.you don&#x27;t feel that your skin is deeply clean and the foam of your cleanser won&#x27;t wash away .waste of money. Try Eco cellulite  facial sponges, cheaper and much more better than this. They really deep clean the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! It is very gentle and I can tell my soap is going to last for a very long time! I plan to buy the body bath sponge next.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin.  Got the charcoal one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I really expected something special.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin in the month I used the sponge.  It has a very strange texture and didn&#x27;t enjoy holding it in my hands.  Reminded me of holding raw meat.  I tried different face washes and still didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and it&#x27;s non irritating with my sensitive, rosacea skin. It also has kept me free of any flaky patches. I can&#x27;t exfoliate as often as I&#x27;d like, and makeup will cling to dry patches, but since I started using this sponge I haven&#x27;t had any dry patches! It seems to be able to exfoliate very gently without irritating my skin. It&#x27;s a great little sponge. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the Volcanic Scoria sponge.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the string.  It eventually cuts through the sponge.  I just cut it off and use a grooved soap dish to dry it instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge for a couple of months now and am very happy with it.  It makes my skin feel clean, smooth and silky...and there&#x27;s no problem using it on my sensitive skin.  I think I have started a lifelong habit!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. I love exfoliating my face every day and wanted something gentler than a scrub but would still leave my skin soft. The first week did not leave my skin soft and I did in fact break out a little bit but I stuck with it and now my skin is super soft. Additionally, my pores look smaller because my blackheads have just about completely disappeared. I found that putting soap on my face and then using the sponge works a lot better than putting soap on the sponge. I love this product and will definitely be buying it in the future!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much difference between different colors, but the shape does matter, since the thicker/round ones tend to take a long time to dry out, and that means you might get mold inside. The size fits comfortably in the hand but is thin enough to dry out in half day or so. If you use it with a cleanser, you won&#x27;t get lots of lather since it&#x27;s absorbed by the sponge, but it does give you a gentle exfoliation while it cleans. It&#x27;s a fun skincare tool.</li>
            <li> These konjac sponges are WONDERFUL for my skin care regimen. I have sensitive skin and have tried using wash cloths in the past, only to experience redness from the irritation. I eventually stopped using them and for years have been washing my face with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, these sponges are the BEST invention in skin care tools to hit the market in a long, long time. Once the sponge is thoroughly saturated with water, squeeze out the excess and apply a small amount of your skin cleanser to the sponge. With this sponge, the cleanser goes a long way and suds up very nicely.  The sponge is so soft, yet still provides a very gentle exfoliation, leaving your face feeling squeaky-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> I like it but they tear too easily.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s very gentle. Not sure what the long term benefits will be yet, I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
            <li> I only just heard about Konjac sponges last month, when someone mentioned them on a health forum I frequent.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this Volcanic one would be good for my sensitive skin, but I love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first open it and use it, it has an odd gooey sort of texture to it, but it nicely cleans your skin and leaves it feeling really soft, without aggravating anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to rinse this after each use and hang it to try.  It has a little cord on it, and I&#x27;ve jerry-rigged a little hanger for it with a jaw hair clip so that it can hang in my tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use this for a few days, it dries out and is hard to re-hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, it really nice such a nice job of gently cleansing your skin! I use this on alternate days with my Clarisonic Mia, and doing so leaves my pores noticeably smaller and my skin brighter.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate? NO it DID NOT! I order two different ones (This and Dr. SpongeTM Facial Cleansing Sponge - Pearl Powder).&lt;br /&gt;Neither did what it claimed to do, although they both had rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;~~I think the reviews are BOGUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both were returned. I was credited for the returns, at least there is that.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  It feels slimy and when it dries out, hardens.  It can be re-wet. I was wanting a facial sponge that would give me a little more of a scrub feel.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference</li>
            <li> These are lightweight, gentle sponges that work well on your face and body. No miracles, but my skin does feel smoother, clearer, and without any irritating after effects. Good bye loofah!</li>
            <li> I was very very surprised by how much I liked this sponge. I&#x27;ve tried random face scrubber/brushes but I have to be careful because I easily get reddened facial skin so don&#x27;t usually try anything for long before going back to fingertips. But with this sponge it felt really gentle and nice and after a use or two (didn&#x27;t even realize it was happening) I noticed the areas that usually are a little flakey were smooth. My forehead and between my eyebrows were always a bit flakey even when I try to keep it moisturized, it wasn&#x27;t too annoying unless I dared to put make up on it, which made it look horrible and even my boyfriend would notice the flakes at that point. I did not try and use the sponge for this purpose, so no extra scrubbing, just used lightly against all of my face for maybe a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend who has oily skin started using the sponge and my Careve hydrating cleanser, he used to get a pimple or two, nothing major, but after using the sponge/cleanser they have stopped showing up. It&#x27;s been less than a month so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see for the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this sponge for just about anyone, I&#x27;ve been thinking about gifting it to friends and family just to see if they might like it because it&#x27;s working so well for us.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using all of the konjac sponges because they cut my nighttime cleansing routine time down so that I look forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply any moisturiser---my skin feels like it was when I was new--maybe ;)&lt;br /&gt;and yes not only doI let others know about how great they are but also I give them as gifts.  Thanks</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17TAKCJ06I8YT]]I like using sponges to wash my face as well as my body. The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp). Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient. I included a photo of the Konjac sponge next to the cellulose sponge in my video, you can see the difference just by looking at them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry. It absorbs quite a lot of water. It suds up fairly well. It takes quite a long time to dry. Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry. Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides. Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span. Based on what I read I expect to get 3 months out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other. I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience. I was happy to see that none of them had a scent. The difference in color comes from what the sponges were injected with, but none of them bleed any colors. The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria supposedly is good for purifying skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Red Clay Sponge improves elasticity and texture of the skin. Size: 4.5\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two sponges on regular basis for about 2 weeks now. I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel pleasant and soft. I like how my face feels after using them. If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively. Does it reduce the appearance of the pores? I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation. If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling. It is very gentle and soft. I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated). Don&#x27;t expect miracles this is just a nice sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are provided by Konjac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewge is good for dehydrated skin.

            <li> I really loved this sponge.  It makes my extremely sensitive skin feel so nice and soft.  I am not one to wash my face every night but with this sponge I look forward to it. Great service, thanks.</li>
            <li> The best sponge that is in my opinion as the Clarisonic to clean my face. so gentle, but effectively cleans my face, and I see a difference in the clarity and brightening of my skin! I recoommemd highly</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> I love my Konjac sponge so much that I already ordered two more. It feel so soft on my skin, my face feel clean and so smooth. Very happy I tried this sponge!!!</li>
            <li> Great way to wash my face!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom since she always uses sponge to wash her face; synthetic sponge. She was first surprised with the price because she only spent around $3-$5 for sponges.&lt;br /&gt;But after using it, she realized it worth the price. She loves the texture and how smooth it is on the skin. She mentioned that her blackhead is gone and she feels fresh after washing her face with the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;She is also happy that it is natural so it wont damage the skin at all. She loves it so much that she keeps mentioning to all her friends about the goodness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;There are only good things that we can share about this product! love it!</li>
            <li> Lasted forever. Works like a dream.</li>
            <li> This is my second Konjac sponge and I absolutely love them! My skin is dry and sensitive and these are great at keeping my skin soft and smooth without irritation. I was using a Clarisonic brush before, but even that irritated my skin. This is the perfect alternative!</li>
            <li> This sponge is meant to be used alone or with face wash. It aids in exfoliating your skin when washing, and helps to remove makeup. You wet the sponge and wait for it to absorb the water and expand fully. It feels gentle, but works extremely well at exfoliating and removing makeup. It is more gentle than my Clarisonic (which I have a sensitive brush for). When you rub it in circles on your skin, it gives you very soft skin. The pointed end works well to get into the eyelid area and remove all of your eye makeup. I had previously not been able to scrub this area, as it is so sensitive and hard to get to with a Clarisonic (which would probably be too rough on the eye area anyway). The only thing comparable I have found is the Liz Earle Hot Cleansing Cloth, which is slightly rougher. The Konjac sponges are made of some kind of plant and are &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; cleaning products. For the price, this is the best exfoliating product I have found to pair with face wash, and it makes a world of difference when removing makeup and keeping skin clear.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this sponge.  I have used it for over a year now.  I started getting acne problems, especially around that time of the month.  But after using the sponge, the problem goes away.  My acne does not flare up anymore.  I have combination skin, which tends to get dry if I wash it too much, but oily in the evening.  After using the sponge, I have noticed that my skin feels a lot smoother and moisturized.  I have recommended Konjac Sponge to my friends and families, and so far I only heard good things about it from all of them.  Other than that, I think it is a good deal compared to the price of skincare products today.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these sponges for my granddaughters who both have mild to severe acne. The difference is unbelievable!  They use the sponge with their acne treatment and the results have been great. They are having less breakouts and even old are scars are fading.  The sponge is what is making a difference, because they were not having these results with just their acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge for just over a week. I love it. I have really sturdy skin. I usr a little brush, but as I get older my skin is more sensitive. This cleans without being abrasive. My sisters both have very delicate skin. I had them try it. I am purchasing 2 more. One for each of us.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT...I HAVE A CLEANSING BRUSH...AND I DO USE IT, BUT AFTER I USE THIS SPONGE...REALLY DOES A GOOD JOB...MAKES MY SKIN SOFT.....GREAT FOR CLEANING BEFORE BEDTIME...</li>
            <li> Great product, price and service</li>
            <li> I tend to scrub things until they hurt.  Can&#x27;t over do it with this sponge.  It gently buffs and leaves my skin soft and clean feeling.  Also purchased the body sponge and like that also.</li>
            <li> I love my Konjac sponge.  I think this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this for face washing. I was using just my hands and cleanser and didn&#x27;t feel like that was enough, yet I didn&#x27;t want anything harsh. This is perfect for me! I feel like my face is getting clean yet not damaged. I hang it on a suction hook in my shower to dry after every use. Have order this three times. It gets a bit tattered after a few months but no big.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it, the feel of it made me queasy.  Like slime.  I don&#x27;t understand how this could get positive reviews, and that&#x27;s why I bought it, based on the reviews.  I love finding unusual accessories for skin care, but this was awful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SPONGES FOR MY FACE... THEY THOROUGHLY CLEAN YOUR FACE AND GENTLY EXFOLIATE AND REMOVE BLACKHEADS... YOU USE THESE SPONGES WET AND YOU CAN USE CLEANSERS OR JUST USE THEM WITHOUT CLEANSER...THEY CAN BE USED DAILY AND YOU WILL LOVE HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS AND FEELS.... I GOT SOME FOR MY SONS AND THEIR GIRLFRIENDS AND MY HUSBAND AS WELL.... THEY ARE MADE OF NATURAL PRODUCTS... THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD FOR WHAT THEY DO AND HOW LONG THEY LAST...GENTLE AND THOROUGH...</li>
            <li> Konjac sponges make great physical exfoliators. You have to keep them moist every day or they do have a tendency to get dried up very quickly. My skin wasn&#x27;t keen on using physical exfloliation vs chemical, but if i could continue actively using them, I would.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have combination skin, dry in the t-zone and normal everywhere else and this sponge works perfectly to exfoliate gently. My skin is a little on the sensitive side, as well, and this was so gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and in perfect condition, as promised by the seller. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Did not perform as expected. Disappointed. Would return if I could!!!</li>
            <li> I adore the smooth clean feel of my skin after using the Konjac sponge! No residue, no tightness, no greasiness just smooth, clean skin. I have sensitive, combination skin and I have noticed a marked difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and reduction of oiliness.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, no real difference noticed.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s better than a bad experience! :)</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in my skin after 1 use.  I use the sponge with CeraVe foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how I feel about this sponge. I really want to like it, but there are a few things keeping me from achieving that. So here&#x27;s just a list of things I like and dislike about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you wear makeup, make sure you use a face wipe or makeup remover first. When I first got this sponge, I had a thin layer of powder foundation on and I just decided to wash over it. When I was done, the make up hadn&#x27;t budged from my face. It made me wonder just how clean it really gets your face if it won&#x27;t pick up a little foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s nearly impossible to wash your soap out of the sponge. And if your face scrub has any kind of beads in it(I use a kind with dissolving natural &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;), they get stuck in the sponge. No amount of rinsing and squeezing will get the soup out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I find it kind of awkward to hold/use. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and I can&#x27;t quite get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It really is great for sensitive skin. The skin on my face is super sensitive and nearly everything agitates it, but this sponge has been fine for far, on that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I love that it&#x27;s biodegradable and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has a funky smell. Just an odd little odor that I smelled directly after opening it and it hasn&#x27;t went away. It&#x27;s not a game changer or anything, it&#x27;s just weird.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think the addition of extra ingredients makes a difference (it&#x27;s mostly color and a gimmick), this is a good konjac sponge and I am now a believer in konjac sponges. I use chemical exfoliation (St. Ives Lactic Acid Pads and Stridex) but my skin can be a little peel-y even when well moisturized, so I occasionally use this to very gently remove the flaky skin. It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face. I find that hot water helps rehydrate it quicker, but you&#x27;ll want to use cooler water to wash your face with it--it holds the water really well so it hurts with hot water. Since you have to toss them out after a few months anyway (sponges retain bacteria and also degrade with use, especially since this is a natural fiber and not something really sturdy), I find this particular sponge bigger than it needs to be. I have gone on to buy smaller sponges (and will continue to do so), but this was a good-quality sponge and the size might be to your liking! Plus, the string attached to it is very useful for hanging it to dry, and smaller ones don&#x27;t always have that.  Edit: It&#x27;s been a year or two since I wrote this review, I believe. I just wanted to add that I&#x27;ve tried smaller and cheaper konjacs and found them rougher than this, which has consistency somewhere between a sponge and gelatin, and I think I&#x27;m going back to this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge leaves my face so soft and rinses out beautifully.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it made my face feel funny and I can&#x27;t explain it.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;s very hard. It soaks up water almost immediately and the sponge has an almost gelatin-like texture. Soft, squishy, but tough. Don&#x27;t wring it or it will lose shape. Non-abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference was my face a little softer after usage. I use it maybe once a week otherwise my face will get really irritated. I know when to use it again because my face will start peeling A LOT.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges and have tried a few different types of these, different colors for different problems. One thing I noticed is some brown spots I had on my face, not sure if they call them age spots, started sloughing off after repeated use. I was thrilled. I had assumed I would need to have them removed surgically, or thru a dermatologist, but they are no longer there. Just very light spots where the thicker spots were. I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these to wash my face with. I have one hanging in my shoulder off the rack, and one on my sink. I have not had any problem with them mildewing as some reviewers have posted. Maybe I use them up too fast, before the mildew gets a chance to visit?? I also make sure to press them hard between my palms to drain off any excess water.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the sponge, but am amazed at how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> A really good quality sponge which can be used for months! and it&#x27;s worth the money! Really long lasting. It works and it does as what it says; really good quality sponge for exfoliating skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is nothing fancy.</li>
    </ol>
