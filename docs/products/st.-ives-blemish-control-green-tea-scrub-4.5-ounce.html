            <li>this is a great face wash for me.</li>
            <li>the St. Ives Apricot Scrub with great results.</li>
            <li>--it is great.</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t remain and it&#x27;s doing a great job</li>
            <li>On time and great product.</li>
            <li>This face wash is the best kind of exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell too.</li>
            <li>but both products are great choices.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>This product is great cleans face well without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li>Great for Blemish as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>great scrub for price.  </li>
            <li>and I know this probably isn&#x27;t my best choice if I want to avoid all the controversial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This scrub has been doing amazing things for me!</li>
            <li>I wish there was a 4.5 stars because I love this stuff, but it&#x27;s not quite perfect because I do have to wash twice to get all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li>any more really awesome cleaner with tea tree oil for cleaning</li>
            <li>It feels good on the face and the smell is pleasant, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good for my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s a good product for this price, but</li>
            <li>and it did a good job.</li>
            <li>good product, and</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>But then, when I rinsed it, my skin felt really good.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this scrub</li>
            <li>My purchase came on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I used to use St. Ives scrubs all the time and loved them.</li>
            <li>Still, a good product.</li>
            <li>Works great and no problems :)</li>
            <li>even I scrubbed my face with it for five minutes, and the process is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scrub, love the finer particles than their apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>scrub is just right--polishes but doesn&#x27;t abrade, nice smell &amp; lather, diminishes reddish skin--all at a fair price.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it feels so good on your skin and cleanses well and clears up redness which is a plus for me and fights acne</li>
            <li>I am a die-hard St. Ives fan, and this is top of my list!</li>
            <li>Now I just wish Amazon would add a Subscribe &amp; Save option because I often run out before I remember to buy more!</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better since before using this product!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This scrub has micro-beads which feel amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Good purchase:)</li>
            <li>This stuff works well, and smells so nice.</li>
            <li>I find this effective,  plan on continuing to use.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice scent..</li>

            <li>Nice scrub that makes my skin nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>I like the original Apricot scrub much better, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still iffy on St. Ives products, but so far this is the cheapest and best exfoliating scrub I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>skin is much better now, but I can&#x27;t honestly say it&#x27;s because of this product alone</li>
            <li>Love the nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and to be able to get it so easily!</li>
            <li>Beads are very fine</li>
            <li>This one was very fine.</li>
            <li>This scrub is really really good, it makes you feel so clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>I have very many St. Ives products and I am glad to add this to my fabulous collection.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo good, you will fall in love with it the first time you use it I promise!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: LOVE</li>
            <li>I consider myself as a \\&quot;skin care product junkie\\&quot; because I LOVE to take care of my skin and do whatever it takes to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love to show it off because it makes me feel more confident about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for  slightly more than a week</li>

            <li>Ehh, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>but I can think of a couple products I like more.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this face cleanser.</li>
            <li>this works wonders for me, gets rid of oil without over drying, smells great without being overpowering, cleans all the makeup off my face, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job</li>
            <li>I use it more for exfolient/polishing properties and the tea extract is benefical.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s the most invigorating cleanser</li>
            <li>In the heat and humidity of the tropics - I found this to be a refreshing post-sun-and-wind cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Possibly able to find cheaper in store</li>
            <li>It works way better than the apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for others</li>
            <li>Better than the harsher apricot version.  </li>
            <li>and you get more.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant is a lot finer than the Apricot Scrub, so I use this one more often.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Love at.</li>
            <li>It probably works wonders for people who can handle the salicilic acid. :)</li>
            <li>I love the way this scrub makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love its smell and it is not too drying.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates and deep cleans perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what i love about this</li>
            <li>this works great and not harsh on my face!!!</li>
            <li>The product has a nice rich consistency and feels refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Is non-drying and leaves you with very clean face.</li>
            <li>I been using this product for a long time and being helping my face to be smooth,clean and look great!!</li>
            <li>Product is very smooth and fine grain exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scrub and it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It works for all the skin types in our house, very mild and non-drying which is important to us!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice fine grain scrub and my face feels clean after using</li>
            <li>The scrub is very micro and does a great job of getting the face clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great smelling and fine exfoliating texture is amazing and this is the only product I prefer to use</li>
            <li>That being said, I love the smell, the feel, the light exfoliation, and the fact that it does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>It agrees with me more than the apricot scrub, keeping my face smooth and minimizing my acne</li>
            <li>to know it&#x27;s still available, love the smell and the use.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After the first use, the pores on my nose and on the two sides of my nose are very smooth and clean!!</li>
            <li>It has an almost fine texture to it (think Gojo, but finer) and so far it has done a great job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t repurchase and the original apricot scrub is probably a better bet.</li>
            <li>Easy to tell, though.</li>
            <li>I switched to this one about 5 years ago and have loved it ever since, especially the fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive yet so effective.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t love it as much but smells good and makes my skins super smooth</li>
            <li>It has fine grit in it that is not abrasive and leaves my face feeling o-so-clean.</li>
            <li>The grit is fine, not like some scrubs that feel like it has rocks in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do their job soo well, that it really is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t have blackheads or have ever had them, this product does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean, fresh, and red free!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this product because so many people have had a positive experience using it</li>
            <li>It not only smells really really great</li>
            <li>but it makes your face really bright and clear because it removes all the dirt or even make up from your face.</li>
            <li>While it smells nice, it&#x27;s just too gentle to make any difference for my oily porous skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, the smell isn&#x27;t too important.</li>
            <li>Its a Nice gentle scrub for people</li>
            <li>It came on time with the test of my order completely filled and sealed.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions or comments feel free to ask away.</li>
            <li>The green tea scrub is great for the redness on my cheaks and acne around chin, eliminates both!</li>
            <li>Great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>and they all rave about how gentle it is on the skin and how nice your face looks after using it.</li>
            <li>Great for daily or weekly use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of this product (which is important.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite items and part of my daily routine love love love.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m comfortable recommending it here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s something you just have to deal with to get such a great product.</li>
            <li>The only thing though, you gotta be sure to rinse it off good</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is a gentle exfoliator, and a gentle but good cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used to treat my acne, since using it around 2 years ago, my acne has been under control.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very clean, fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>i first used this as a sample that came with another St. Ives product and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Im so excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>it left my face feeling nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li>This specific product is a very good cleanser, but does not do much in the moisturizing department.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It clears up breakouts as well as blackheads and leaves my face feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>they say about it tearing your face microscopically MAY be true, but it&#x27;s honestly pretty soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and definitely a great alternative for the overpriced facial scurbs.</li>
            <li>It makes your face clean.</li>
            <li>just feel so clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and cheap price.</li>
            <li>Not sure about blemish fighting, but it&#x27;s great for having a clean, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; recommend to anyone who wants to improve their skin to a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I really really really like (love) it.</li>
            <li>is suppose to scrub my face?\\&quot;, but when I actually applied it to my face it felt really good, not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and loved it so bought the bigger size.  </li>
            <li>but it is a good suppliment to my regular blemish routine (Clinique).</li>
            <li>Has a really pleasant smell and really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a mini bottle of this from the store (the small kind made for people who travel a lot) and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, and used consistently, works very well against acne.</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love their classic apricot scrub, for instance, but cannot stand the olive oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>Note that it has salicylic acid in it so consult your doctor before using if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li>Twice a day keeps breakouts to a minimum and my face feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>I have loved this product for a long time but could never find it in stores.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the way it exfoliates and leaves my face super soft, and as a bonus, it also clears up any acne!</li>
            <li>Amazing, leaves my face super smooth but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>It really works well on my face and  washes away easily, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the Alba Botanica Pore cleanser first to get it semi better, but recently I switched to Neutrogena cleanser to get rid of make up and dirt, along with this product and my face is absolutely looking better!</li>
            <li>Can a facial product get any better?!?</li>
            <li>I bought this on clearance at my local drug store and was immediately in love!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>and overall i love this product!</li>
            <li>but that was fixed easily with some light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really liked the first bottle I bought, so I bought four more, and after all my experience with this product, here&#x27;s what I would like to tell other acne-obsessed teens/pre-adults concerned with their face:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s meant to be used once in a while for exfoliation, but I used it everyday,, it removes make up, etc, and I have oily skin it worked great,</li>
            <li>The green tea is great for moisturizing and reducing redness.</li>
            <li>St. Ives Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is awesome.  </li>
            <li>tried a sample of this at a friend&#x27;s house (left in the shower) and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It does the job though until I can find a more natural replacement that works for me.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin but effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>Did make skin soft but was looking for more exfoliation</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of this product honestly..</li>
            <li>like I said before, if the beads were any bigger, I don&#x27;t know if the scrub would be as effective, so</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have been blessed with a normal healthy skin which fortunately have never caused any major skin problems for me, esp.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I saw other people&#x27;s recommendation on another website and it was definitely a good decision to buy.</li>
            <li>The other scrub might be just as good and is cheaper</li>
            <li>Even right before that time of the month.</li>
            <li>The scrub is just right, does not irritate face at all.</li>
            <li>have tried soooo many face washes and this is my favorite hands down.  </li>
            <li>it may smell like green tea, I&#x27;m not too sure myself, I&#x27;m more of a water drinker, but it&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>When I usually wear makeup, they become almost non-existant which I&#x27;m happy with</li>
            <li>Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is an excellent product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about green tea, so i&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a product that uses it in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li>Initially I loved this cleanser because even though my skin is oily and acne-prone, it is actually quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>ever since I last used it so now I use the apricot scrub which is also just as good too but doesn&#x27;t clear up redness</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of my skin after this product, and I love everything green tea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin looking clean and brand new.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it says it does it cleared my face of brakeouts in under a week</li>
            <li>give up on it if u don&#x27;t see results the first couple of weeks....</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and free of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is at Target, and Amazon.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I just cannot wait to write a review for it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like a bunch of gritty things in it.</li>
            <li>Most of the scrubs I&#x27;ve used actually make my skin breakout, but not this.</li>
            <li>I bought this first at Walmart as a travel size scrub, but when Walmart stopped selling them, I found it here on Amazon and immediately purchased 2 of these medium-sized tubes.</li>
            <li>I order 2 at a time ;)</li>
            <li>will order more because I can only find this product on amazon</li>
            <li>Overall an OK product.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin sooo much!</li>
            <li>good for exfoliating my face as well as treating my acne not in a harsh way.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size and lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other more expensive scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also, just to let you know the other product I love besides this one is \\&quot;ponds luminous clean cream cleanser\\&quot;, if someone wants to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (Murad, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Clarisonic, St. Ives apricot scrub, ancient mayan clay masks, facials, antibiotics, etc).  </li>
            <li>I like it because the grains are very small and consistent, more like a paste than most face scrubs.</li>
            <li>And this cleanser scrubbing properties was very gentle but exfoliated my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, once this started, I had already used about 60% of the scrub so none has leaked (so far) but its still pretty inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scrub, although it doesn&#x27;t have as much exfoliating \\&quot;power\\&quot; as the original apricot scrubs, I have a facial buffer that I use with it to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve notice it not only helps with acne, but also calm my mild case of rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this in a trial size at my local Walmart and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>Nice little exfoliating factor too.</li>
            <li>Ives has a similar product that has no scrubber in it that is great to use when you do not want to scrub harshly</li>
            <li>Great facial cleaner but not available in my area stores</li>
            <li>I really like this face scrub.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not one of those people who likes to wear a lot of make up every day or cover their face with too much chemicals...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it...</li>
            <li>Fantastic blemish control facial scrub with tea oil.  </li>
            <li>Much gentler on the face then</li>
            <li>I didn’t expect this much from a low-cost formula like this.</li>
            <li>This really cleans out the pores and clears up the skin with the salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost afraid to review this for fear of jinxing how great it has worked for me!  </li>
            <li>It really calms my skin to prevent acne too.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li>I got my whole family to start using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;i only wish it was available as a &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Batter price and got it fast.</li>
            <li>This feels more like someone pureed an almond or apricot pit so that it is smooth, but still rough enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>We all love this green tea scrub in our household, It&#x27;s worth the price, it lasts awhile because you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>and I have never had this much acne on my face at one time as I do now.</li>
            <li>I like this scrub its gentle on my face and cleances well</li>
            <li>The seller definitely was thoughtful with packaging to ensure nothing explodes during transport.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and any bit of dirt will give me a breakout, I have mostly oily skin, especially the tzone.</li>
            <li>I had cystic acne around the same time last year, and I&#x27;ve tried every product out there trying to find some kind of remedy.</li>
            <li>It is gently enough that I am not missing my top layer of epidermis.  </li>
            <li>It cleans exceptionally well and does not dry out my skin as some other products do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve used other products from St. Ives before and was pleased, but they were pricey items.</li>
            <li>Small seeds are gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little scrub!</li>
            <li>And honestly, even though the product contains green tea, (which is suppose to be really good for your skin), it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin, if anything it may have made it worse.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and you only need a small amount to clean your face.</li>
            <li>have to rinse a lot to make sure they&#x27;re gone, but a few always manage to get into my eyes (which I just dust off, but still an annoyance) or in my hairline next to my ears, making it look like I have mild dandruff!</li>
            <li>I must say I was pretty surprised at my results with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>At first, the smell was a little weird, but now it kind of smells good.</li>
            <li>I only use it  3 or 4 times a week but leave my face clean and is not hard on my face.</li>
            <li>This, the green tea scrub, is way more gentle and still gets the job done</li>
            <li>and I mainly use this product for cleaning blackheads.</li>
            <li>If you experience occasional blotchyness, it&#x27;s quickly cleared away.</li>
            <li>The product came at decent time and packaged well</li>
            <li>This comes highly recommended from a skin specialist and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Two arrived to me in a box with DVDs I ordered.</li>
            <li>..this green tea scrub is one of the two products that I absolutely love and adore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of facial products with perfume, it&#x27;s a facial scrub, it doesn&#x27;t need to smell that great!</li>
            <li>I am a fan of St Ives and green tea seems healthy</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this green tea cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have combination (normal skin type/</li>
            <li>, to get rid of these scars/spots, I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every single popular skin care product you can think of over the past 5-6 years...</li>
            <li>Now the Green Tea Scrub is a new favorite.</li>
            <li>I prefer having less or no make up on because I love my natural skin</li>
            <li>cuz right now the only place to buy is via amazon.</li>
            <li>Green tea works and this green tea scrub works great as an exfoliator and for blemish control.</li>
            <li>so not sure if its second hand stuff, but still like it, makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>i loved how it left my skin super soft and reduced the redness of my random acne</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t clear your breakouts but it does reduce them!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a 28 year old woman!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;who have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I read reviews before buying and at first I thought people&#x27;s dislike of the scrubbing beads were a personal matter, or maybe they&#x27;re not used to scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this green tea scrub!</li>
            <li>I usually prefer to use exfoliators in the shower, to make sure I get the little granules all rinsed off, but I must say that this product rinses off quite easily and leaves no film.</li>
            <li>morning, after work, and before bed) but enough where I feel clean enough to not use toner afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, the consistency of toothpaste and a cool green color.</li>
            <li>and it is mild enough to use with some of our topical skin medications</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with Pevonia&#x27;s Enzyme mask (once a week for the enzyme mask and the other days of the week use this cleanser on my face) and love that combination as part of my long term, ongoing, skin care regiment.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel truly clean and it calms down my breakouts tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find so when I do I buy as many as I can.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have to take birth control for a clear face, not while using this product.</li>
            <li>I keeps my face clear without the redness.</li>
            <li>I might just be reacting to something in it, but I have fairly clear skin</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped me combat the acne.</li>
            <li>The beads are very tiny, so it is gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>I have even tried all the homemade remedies and the natural clays/face-packs they sell on the internet...</li>
            <li>This product would have been HG if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to a lot of acne products but not this one.  </li>
            <li>only real problem I have with this scrub is the bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination sensitive and prone to redness.</li>
            <li>so I cannot tell if it would irritate people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sensitive and</li>
            <li>Not only is this reasonably priced, but it has been a godsend for my skin.</li>
            <li>This scrub isn&#x27;t like others in that the exfoliation feels gentle enough to use twice a day (I use it three times a day...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It works well on my sensitive and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to ingredients lately though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to be used every night.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but it is getting harder to find at various stores in my area such as Walgreens, WalMart, etc.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a scrub but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>It seems that no matter how much I rinse, those beads remain stuck in my lashes where they inevitably fall out and into my eyes where they cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the consistency though it&#x27;s more like a puffy thick foam</li>
            <li>I found this product in mini travel size bottles at my local walmart but could not find a normal size bottle anywhere but amazon!</li>
            <li>This cleanser has just enough granules to make my skin feel really clean, but it&#x27;s not so rough that it irritates my existing breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and helps with blackheads, dead skin, deep cleaning of makeup residue and small blemishes.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell you how it&#x27;s worked on my acne yet (which is moderate), but I will update this review with anything new!</li>
            <li>The main point to a cleansers such as this is to eliminate dirt and oil from the face, not to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have had acne problems since high school (now graduating college) and this is LITERALLY the only thing that has helped my skin.</li>
            <li>do not use it every day (rather, I alternate this and an exfoliating brush and normal face wash)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i ordered and expected, it&#x27;s a softer scrub face wash</li>
            <li>Cant really say if its good or bad.</li>
            <li>Great scrub...takes care of ALL dead skin without irritating your skin..#timeless</li>
            <li>and I have not had any major breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li>not sharp apricot pits to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I bought a little sample size of this to take with me to the tropics this past month - and dare I say, I&#x27;m already in love with the product!</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve used no other scrub(s) since we tried it.</li>
            <li>I think after a few more weeks I can go with just a little light powder instead of my usual make-up.</li>
            <li>so when i put them directly to my face, i know its cleaning the deep pores of mine without being too abbrassive.</li>
            <li>It suddenly has stopped being sold in stores near me</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, white skin and</li>
            <li>I can be very picky about the texture of facial scrubs, but I find this product &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  Not too harsh, not too gentle.  </li>
            <li>We have never gone back to our old face scrub since.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for me, simply because I have stupidly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is not per say &#x27;gentle&#x27; as some other scrubs, but I need a true scrub due to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This was a good value for me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the only negative thing to mention about this item is that the amount you receive is rather small.</li>
            <li>my skin is quiet sensitive, especially T zone.</li>
            <li>But when you put it on your face, I think it smells kind of weird and different.</li>
            <li>You have to do many other things like drinking [lemon] water, never touching your face with your big, meaty claws, etc., but exfoliation does help and should be routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Blemish Control Green Tea Scrub seems to improve the look of your skin from the first use.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t mess your skin up as much as it uses silica and</li>
            <li>This has helped a little, but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This scrub has been doing amazing things for me!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a 4.5 stars because I love this stuff, but it&#x27;s not quite perfect because I do have to wash twice to get all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li> any more really awesome cleaner with tea tree oil for cleaning</li>

            <li> But then, when I rinsed it, my skin felt really good.</li>
            <li> And it smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scrub</li>
            <li> My purchase came on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I used to use St. Ives scrubs all the time and loved them.</li>
            <li> Still, a good product.</li>
            <li> Works great and no problems :)</li>
            <li> even I scrubbed my face with it for five minutes, and the process is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scrub, love the finer particles than their apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> scrub is just right--polishes but doesn&#x27;t abrade, nice smell &amp; lather, diminishes reddish skin--all at a fair price.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it feels so good on your skin and cleanses well and clears up redness which is a plus for me and fights acne</li>
            <li> I am a die-hard St. Ives fan, and this is top of my list!</li>
            <li> Now I just wish Amazon would add a Subscribe &amp; Save option because I often run out before I remember to buy more!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better since before using this product!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> i love this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This scrub has micro-beads which feel amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Good purchase:)</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, and smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I find this effective,  plan on continuing to use.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice scent..</li>

            <li> and I can see parts of my nose is clean!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scrub so much I can go on n on forever talking about how wonderful this product is!!</li>
            <li> Nice scrub that makes my skin nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> I like the original Apricot scrub much better, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still iffy on St. Ives products, but so far this is the cheapest and best exfoliating scrub I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> skin is much better now, but I can&#x27;t honestly say it&#x27;s because of this product alone</li>
            <li> Love the nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and to be able to get it so easily!</li>
            <li> Beads are very fine</li>
            <li> This one was very fine.</li>
            <li> This scrub is really really good, it makes you feel so clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very many St. Ives products and I am glad to add this to my fabulous collection.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo good, you will fall in love with it the first time you use it I promise!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line: LOVE</li>
            <li> I consider myself as a \\&quot;skin care product junkie\\&quot; because I LOVE to take care of my skin and do whatever it takes to keep it healthy.</li>

            <li> okay?</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for  slightly more than a week</li>
            <li> but I wish there were more.</li>
            <li> I like St. Ives apricot blemish control a lot better.</li>

            <li> Ehh, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> but I can think of a couple products I like more.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this face cleanser.</li>
            <li> this works wonders for me, gets rid of oil without over drying, smells great without being overpowering, cleans all the makeup off my face, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job</li>
            <li> I use it more for exfolient/polishing properties and the tea extract is benefical.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s the most invigorating cleanser</li>
            <li> In the heat and humidity of the tropics - I found this to be a refreshing post-sun-and-wind cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Possibly able to find cheaper in store</li>
            <li> It works way better than the apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for others</li>
            <li> Better than the harsher apricot version.  </li>
            <li> and you get more.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant is a lot finer than the Apricot Scrub, so I use this one more often.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Love at.</li>
            <li> It probably works wonders for people who can handle the salicilic acid. :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this scrub makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love its smell and it is not too drying.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates and deep cleans perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what i love about this</li>
            <li> this works great and not harsh on my face!!!</li>
            <li> The product has a nice rich consistency and feels refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Is non-drying and leaves you with very clean face.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a long time and being helping my face to be smooth,clean and look great!!</li>
            <li> Product is very smooth and fine grain exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub and it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It works for all the skin types in our house, very mild and non-drying which is important to us!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice fine grain scrub and my face feels clean after using</li>
            <li> The scrub is very micro and does a great job of getting the face clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great smelling and fine exfoliating texture is amazing and this is the only product I prefer to use</li>
            <li> That being said, I love the smell, the feel, the light exfoliation, and the fact that it does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li> It agrees with me more than the apricot scrub, keeping my face smooth and minimizing my acne</li>
            <li> to know it&#x27;s still available, love the smell and the use.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After the first use, the pores on my nose and on the two sides of my nose are very smooth and clean!!</li>
            <li> It has an almost fine texture to it (think Gojo, but finer) and so far it has done a great job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repurchase and the original apricot scrub is probably a better bet.</li>
            <li> Easy to tell, though.</li>
            <li> I switched to this one about 5 years ago and have loved it ever since, especially the fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive yet so effective.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t love it as much but smells good and makes my skins super smooth</li>
            <li> It has fine grit in it that is not abrasive and leaves my face feeling o-so-clean.</li>
            <li> The grit is fine, not like some scrubs that feel like it has rocks in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do their job soo well, that it really is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have blackheads or have ever had them, this product does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean, fresh, and red free!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this product because so many people have had a positive experience using it</li>
            <li> It not only smells really really great</li>
            <li> but it makes your face really bright and clear because it removes all the dirt or even make up from your face.</li>
            <li> While it smells nice, it&#x27;s just too gentle to make any difference for my oily porous skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, the smell isn&#x27;t too important.</li>
            <li> Its a Nice gentle scrub for people</li>
            <li> It came on time with the test of my order completely filled and sealed.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions or comments feel free to ask away.</li>
            <li> The green tea scrub is great for the redness on my cheaks and acne around chin, eliminates both!</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub.</li>
            <li> and they all rave about how gentle it is on the skin and how nice your face looks after using it.</li>
            <li> Great for daily or weekly use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this product (which is important.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite items and part of my daily routine love love love.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m comfortable recommending it here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s something you just have to deal with to get such a great product.</li>
            <li> The only thing though, you gotta be sure to rinse it off good</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is a gentle exfoliator, and a gentle but good cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used to treat my acne, since using it around 2 years ago, my acne has been under control.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very clean, fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> i first used this as a sample that came with another St. Ives product and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Im so excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> it left my face feeling nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li> This specific product is a very good cleanser, but does not do much in the moisturizing department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clears up breakouts as well as blackheads and leaves my face feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> they say about it tearing your face microscopically MAY be true, but it&#x27;s honestly pretty soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and definitely a great alternative for the overpriced facial scurbs.</li>
            <li> It makes your face clean.</li>
            <li> just feel so clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and cheap price.</li>
            <li> Not sure about blemish fighting, but it&#x27;s great for having a clean, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; recommend to anyone who wants to improve their skin to a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I really really really like (love) it.</li>
            <li> is suppose to scrub my face?\\&quot;, but when I actually applied it to my face it felt really good, not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and loved it so bought the bigger size.  </li>
            <li> but it is a good suppliment to my regular blemish routine (Clinique).</li>
            <li> Has a really pleasant smell and really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a mini bottle of this from the store (the small kind made for people who travel a lot) and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, and used consistently, works very well against acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love their classic apricot scrub, for instance, but cannot stand the olive oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> Note that it has salicylic acid in it so consult your doctor before using if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li> Twice a day keeps breakouts to a minimum and my face feeling pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for a long time but could never find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the way it exfoliates and leaves my face super soft, and as a bonus, it also clears up any acne!</li>
            <li> Amazing, leaves my face super smooth but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> It really works well on my face and  washes away easily, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use the Alba Botanica Pore cleanser first to get it semi better, but recently I switched to Neutrogena cleanser to get rid of make up and dirt, along with this product and my face is absolutely looking better!</li>
            <li> Can a facial product get any better?!?</li>
            <li> I bought this on clearance at my local drug store and was immediately in love!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> and overall i love this product!</li>
            <li> but that was fixed easily with some light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really liked the first bottle I bought, so I bought four more, and after all my experience with this product, here&#x27;s what I would like to tell other acne-obsessed teens/pre-adults concerned with their face:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s meant to be used once in a while for exfoliation, but I used it everyday,, it removes make up, etc, and I have oily skin it worked great,</li>
            <li> The green tea is great for moisturizing and reducing redness.</li>
            <li> St. Ives Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is awesome.  </li>
            <li> tried a sample of this at a friend&#x27;s house (left in the shower) and really liked it.</li>
            <li> It does the job though until I can find a more natural replacement that works for me.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin but effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> Did make skin soft but was looking for more exfoliation</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this product honestly..</li>
            <li> like I said before, if the beads were any bigger, I don&#x27;t know if the scrub would be as effective, so</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have been blessed with a normal healthy skin which fortunately have never caused any major skin problems for me, esp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw other people&#x27;s recommendation on another website and it was definitely a good decision to buy.</li>
            <li> The other scrub might be just as good and is cheaper</li>
            <li> Even right before that time of the month.</li>
            <li> The scrub is just right, does not irritate face at all.</li>
            <li> have tried soooo many face washes and this is my favorite hands down.  </li>
            <li> it may smell like green tea, I&#x27;m not too sure myself, I&#x27;m more of a water drinker, but it&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> When I usually wear makeup, they become almost non-existant which I&#x27;m happy with</li>
            <li> Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is an excellent product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about green tea, so i&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a product that uses it in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved this cleanser because even though my skin is oily and acne-prone, it is actually quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> ever since I last used it so now I use the apricot scrub which is also just as good too but doesn&#x27;t clear up redness</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of my skin after this product, and I love everything green tea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin looking clean and brand new.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it does it cleared my face of brakeouts in under a week</li>
            <li> give up on it if u don&#x27;t see results the first couple of weeks....</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear and free of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is at Target, and Amazon.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I just cannot wait to write a review for it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more like a bunch of gritty things in it.</li>
            <li> Most of the scrubs I&#x27;ve used actually make my skin breakout, but not this.</li>
            <li> I bought this first at Walmart as a travel size scrub, but when Walmart stopped selling them, I found it here on Amazon and immediately purchased 2 of these medium-sized tubes.</li>
            <li> I order 2 at a time ;)</li>
            <li> will order more because I can only find this product on amazon</li>
            <li> Overall an OK product.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin sooo much!</li>
            <li> good for exfoliating my face as well as treating my acne not in a harsh way.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size and lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other more expensive scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Also, just to let you know the other product I love besides this one is \\&quot;ponds luminous clean cream cleanser\\&quot;, if someone wants to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (Murad, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Clarisonic, St. Ives apricot scrub, ancient mayan clay masks, facials, antibiotics, etc).  </li>
            <li> I like it because the grains are very small and consistent, more like a paste than most face scrubs.</li>
            <li> And this cleanser scrubbing properties was very gentle but exfoliated my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, once this started, I had already used about 60% of the scrub so none has leaked (so far) but its still pretty inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, although it doesn&#x27;t have as much exfoliating \\&quot;power\\&quot; as the original apricot scrubs, I have a facial buffer that I use with it to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice it not only helps with acne, but also calm my mild case of rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this in a trial size at my local Walmart and fell in love!  </li>
            <li> Nice little exfoliating factor too.</li>
            <li> Ives has a similar product that has no scrubber in it that is great to use when you do not want to scrub harshly</li>
            <li> Great facial cleaner but not available in my area stores</li>
            <li> I really like this face scrub.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not one of those people who likes to wear a lot of make up every day or cover their face with too much chemicals...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe it...</li>
            <li> Fantastic blemish control facial scrub with tea oil.  </li>
            <li> Much gentler on the face then</li>
            <li> I didn’t expect this much from a low-cost formula like this.</li>
            <li> This really cleans out the pores and clears up the skin with the salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to review this for fear of jinxing how great it has worked for me!  </li>
            <li> It really calms my skin to prevent acne too.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li> I got my whole family to start using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;i only wish it was available as a &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Batter price and got it fast.</li>
            <li> This feels more like someone pureed an almond or apricot pit so that it is smooth, but still rough enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> We all love this green tea scrub in our household, It&#x27;s worth the price, it lasts awhile because you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> and I have never had this much acne on my face at one time as I do now.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub its gentle on my face and cleances well</li>
            <li> The seller definitely was thoughtful with packaging to ensure nothing explodes during transport.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and any bit of dirt will give me a breakout, I have mostly oily skin, especially the tzone.</li>
            <li> I had cystic acne around the same time last year, and I&#x27;ve tried every product out there trying to find some kind of remedy.</li>
            <li> It is gently enough that I am not missing my top layer of epidermis.  </li>
            <li> It cleans exceptionally well and does not dry out my skin as some other products do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used other products from St. Ives before and was pleased, but they were pricey items.</li>
            <li> Small seeds are gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little scrub!</li>
            <li> And honestly, even though the product contains green tea, (which is suppose to be really good for your skin), it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin, if anything it may have made it worse.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and you only need a small amount to clean your face.</li>
            <li> have to rinse a lot to make sure they&#x27;re gone, but a few always manage to get into my eyes (which I just dust off, but still an annoyance) or in my hairline next to my ears, making it look like I have mild dandruff!</li>
            <li> I must say I was pretty surprised at my results with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> At first, the smell was a little weird, but now it kind of smells good.</li>
            <li> I only use it  3 or 4 times a week but leave my face clean and is not hard on my face.</li>
            <li> This, the green tea scrub, is way more gentle and still gets the job done</li>
            <li> and I mainly use this product for cleaning blackheads.</li>
            <li> If you experience occasional blotchyness, it&#x27;s quickly cleared away.</li>
            <li> The product came at decent time and packaged well</li>
            <li> This comes highly recommended from a skin specialist and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Two arrived to me in a box with DVDs I ordered.</li>
            <li> ..this green tea scrub is one of the two products that I absolutely love and adore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of facial products with perfume, it&#x27;s a facial scrub, it doesn&#x27;t need to smell that great!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of St Ives and green tea seems healthy</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this green tea cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have combination (normal skin type/</li>
            <li> , to get rid of these scars/spots, I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every single popular skin care product you can think of over the past 5-6 years...</li>
            <li> Now the Green Tea Scrub is a new favorite.</li>
            <li> I prefer having less or no make up on because I love my natural skin</li>
            <li> cuz right now the only place to buy is via amazon.</li>
            <li> Green tea works and this green tea scrub works great as an exfoliator and for blemish control.</li>
            <li> so not sure if its second hand stuff, but still like it, makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> i loved how it left my skin super soft and reduced the redness of my random acne</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t clear your breakouts but it does reduce them!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a 28 year old woman!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;who have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying and at first I thought people&#x27;s dislike of the scrubbing beads were a personal matter, or maybe they&#x27;re not used to scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this green tea scrub!</li>
            <li> I usually prefer to use exfoliators in the shower, to make sure I get the little granules all rinsed off, but I must say that this product rinses off quite easily and leaves no film.</li>
            <li> morning, after work, and before bed) but enough where I feel clean enough to not use toner afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, the consistency of toothpaste and a cool green color.</li>
            <li> and it is mild enough to use with some of our topical skin medications</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Pevonia&#x27;s Enzyme mask (once a week for the enzyme mask and the other days of the week use this cleanser on my face) and love that combination as part of my long term, ongoing, skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel truly clean and it calms down my breakouts tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find so when I do I buy as many as I can.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have to take birth control for a clear face, not while using this product.</li>
            <li> I keeps my face clear without the redness.</li>
            <li> I might just be reacting to something in it, but I have fairly clear skin</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped me combat the acne.</li>
            <li> The beads are very tiny, so it is gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> I have even tried all the homemade remedies and the natural clays/face-packs they sell on the internet...</li>
            <li> This product would have been HG if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to a lot of acne products but not this one.  </li>
            <li> only real problem I have with this scrub is the bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination sensitive and prone to redness.</li>
            <li> so I cannot tell if it would irritate people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sensitive and</li>
            <li> Not only is this reasonably priced, but it has been a godsend for my skin.</li>
            <li> This scrub isn&#x27;t like others in that the exfoliation feels gentle enough to use twice a day (I use it three times a day...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It works well on my sensitive and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to ingredients lately though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to be used every night.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but it is getting harder to find at various stores in my area such as Walgreens, WalMart, etc.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scrub but not harsh.  </li>
            <li> It seems that no matter how much I rinse, those beads remain stuck in my lashes where they inevitably fall out and into my eyes where they cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the consistency though it&#x27;s more like a puffy thick foam</li>
            <li> I found this product in mini travel size bottles at my local walmart but could not find a normal size bottle anywhere but amazon!</li>
            <li> This cleanser has just enough granules to make my skin feel really clean, but it&#x27;s not so rough that it irritates my existing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and helps with blackheads, dead skin, deep cleaning of makeup residue and small blemishes.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how it&#x27;s worked on my acne yet (which is moderate), but I will update this review with anything new!</li>
            <li> The main point to a cleansers such as this is to eliminate dirt and oil from the face, not to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have had acne problems since high school (now graduating college) and this is LITERALLY the only thing that has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> do not use it every day (rather, I alternate this and an exfoliating brush and normal face wash)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i ordered and expected, it&#x27;s a softer scrub face wash</li>
            <li> Cant really say if its good or bad.</li>
            <li> Great scrub...takes care of ALL dead skin without irritating your skin..#timeless</li>
            <li> and I have not had any major breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li> not sharp apricot pits to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I bought a little sample size of this to take with me to the tropics this past month - and dare I say, I&#x27;m already in love with the product!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve used no other scrub(s) since we tried it.</li>
            <li> I think after a few more weeks I can go with just a little light powder instead of my usual make-up.</li>
            <li> so when i put them directly to my face, i know its cleaning the deep pores of mine without being too abbrassive.</li>
            <li> It suddenly has stopped being sold in stores near me</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, white skin and</li>
            <li> I can be very picky about the texture of facial scrubs, but I find this product &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  Not too harsh, not too gentle.  </li>
            <li> We have never gone back to our old face scrub since.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, simply because I have stupidly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is not per say &#x27;gentle&#x27; as some other scrubs, but I need a true scrub due to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was a good value for me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the only negative thing to mention about this item is that the amount you receive is rather small.</li>
            <li> my skin is quiet sensitive, especially T zone.</li>
            <li> But when you put it on your face, I think it smells kind of weird and different.</li>
            <li> You have to do many other things like drinking [lemon] water, never touching your face with your big, meaty claws, etc., but exfoliation does help and should be routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Blemish Control Green Tea Scrub seems to improve the look of your skin from the first use.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t mess your skin up as much as it uses silica and</li>
            <li> This has helped a little, but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, it feels like a fine grain sand in a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, hey, at least you didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and have tried seemingly every face wash ever made since I was about 14 and started breaking out, running the gamut from very cheap to very expensive and even homemade.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not your average 50 year old woman who would find this facial scrub too drying - for some reason I am blessed (??)</li>
            <li> This scrub is very gentle and you can actually massage your face with it for a long time, my skin is delicate and this product does not make my face turn red</li>
            <li> would recommend that you use a moisturizing cream after you wash your face with this because it does make your skin a little dry, which is not at all unusual for cleansers like these.</li>
            <li> But the beads do stick to you after washing, sometimes it gets mixed with my hairline and when I dry my face and apply lotion, minutes later I can see that I have scrubbing beads on my face.</li>
            <li> Did not clear the acne on my back as I hoped, wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> Definitely should try this if you have dry skin or  blemish problems.</li>
            <li> It did dry my normal skin out a little</li>
            <li> It is a very gritty scrub, but the granules are smaller than any other exfoliating scrub I have used before.</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re so small, yes they do a better job as a scrub than other products, but they&#x27;re also so hard to fully rinse</li>
            <li> I feel it works well, though I do find it does burn my skin just a little (but I do have fairly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This green tea scrub smells exactly like St. Ives green tea gel cleanser.</li>
            <li> The beads are an annoying factor, the cleanser itself seems good.</li>
            <li> When i use it the number of my zits go down and any zits i do have left aren&#x27;t red!</li>
            <li> A little pimple here and there, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I had been buying only the sample size of this scrub at my local retailer, but was never able to find a bigger size.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin, so after using this I have to moisturize quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It does dry up existing blemishes and appears to help reduce redness.</li>
            <li> While this is a decent exfoliant for the price, it&#x27;s not absolutely effective.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon has solved the issue, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying</li>
            <li> I would say it definitely helps calm down zits that are sort of forming so that they usually dont fully &#x27;blossom&#x27;, and after a few uses can rub down and \\&quot;kill\\&quot; existing zits.  </li>
            <li> about 3 days later they were flat and less irritated!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not come in the large round tubs like some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I have had less break outs especially with what triggers my breaks.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried expensive products all the way down to the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now along with Zapzyt afterwards and it not only clears up my oily skin, but keeps my blemishes down and exfoliates the dead skin.</li>
            <li> But, before I do that let me briefly tell you little bit about myself and my skin.</li>
            <li> I had 3 little red bumps on my face before I started using this then</li>
            <li> I also have those little zits like to stay under the skin and cause a big bump.</li>
            <li> It also does not over dry your skin like other products.</li>
            <li> I have to go through the trouble of sending back a tiny little sample.</li>
            <li> Not as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like it when I put it on my fingers, it felt like wet sand, I was like \\&quot;THIS</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like green tea, it smells like a generic acne scrub.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re there, in plenty, but not as rough as the apricot shell ones.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re really serious, get a more expensive exfoliator with finer exfoliants or chemicals, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my face raw or left a film like the Apricot scrub from St. Ives.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many stupid method to clean the black head but failed.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this out as i tried other st ives scrub that was too abrasive for me.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a scrub and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other scrubs do.</li>
            <li> than I thought compared to other St. Ives scrubs.</li>
            <li> I ran out for a while and tried a series of other products but none worked as well for me as this.</li>
            <li> This green tea scrub, when I first used it, I felt it was a little too weak.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and do not find this product irritating or overly drying despite using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I swear ever since I&#x27;ve discovered that cleanser, I have stopped using make up remover or even all the other products I previously owned...</li>
            <li> BUT it broke half of my face out and the other side has risen bumps on it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it in my local Walgreens, Walmart and CVS</li>
            <li> I love this product, and hate that it is so hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I saw this on sale at Walgreens and decided to give it a try since it used green tea and didn&#x27;t have a lot of the junk other cleansers had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate my face, but not in the harsh way that some of the other scrubs do--you know, where it feels like someone put sand in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Slightly?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used (for years)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to have wrinkles and acne at the same time, but this definitely keeps my skin clearer.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks I do notice smoother skin and less blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I squeezed a little of the face wash and put it  on my pimiple</li>
            <li> The little scrubbing balls have since been out lawed because it&#x27;s said they go into the ocean and fish eat them</li>
            <li> The product comes out green and has little sandy grains in it to help exfoliate yours skin in a way that does not feel like sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I knew it was a little harsh for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I think it dried my skin out a little bit..</li>
            <li> had been using St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Scrub for years until I discovered this Green Tea Scrub.</li>
            <li> I use the St. Ives green tea cleanser at night, and then just the scrub in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use everyday, sometime twice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday like I did for a week because I wanted to see results.</li>
            <li> Smells like green apples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out in one spot, skin cracking and peeling elsewhere, and just all around uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> The texture is so fine/gritty not as harsh on our skin...</li>
            <li> This green tea one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells like green tea and feels like a massage</li>
            <li> I am not pleased to lose half my product, but I did try some from the bottle while washing it off</li>
            <li> It is less expensive at my local supermarket, but it is always out of stock.</li>
            <li> However, I do have few very annoying pimple scars that I&#x27;ve gained over the years by continuously popping little zits and pimples on my face whenever I get them [usually 3-4 zits or pimples around my monthly days] which have left me with some very noticeable spots/scars.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 5 at a time.</li>
            <li> feels like an expensive facial every time</li>
            <li> Like green tea of course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad they discontinued it because it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I don&#x27;t usually leave any review because of time, but I felt like leaving for this one.</li>
            <li> Its ok with the exfoliating, but it smells awful, and it lingers on your skin after too.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find it in my small town, so</li>
            <li> It is a small size, so</li>
            <li> This also leaves my face soft and NOT dry, but I always apply a moisturizer anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a while of using this, the sand particles have been getting stuck in my pores and breaking me out in a very bad way.</li>
            <li> My skin was breaking out terribly (worse than usual, which is usually bad...its oily and VERY acne prone) and I was desperate</li>
            <li> I never had much trouble with acne until a few years ago and it has gotten worse over the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but I do wear a little bit of camouflage concealer, which is very hard to get off with any face wash (I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li> its not that hard keeping it out of your eyes just wash throughly with water before opening your eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find this product in stores</li>
            <li> so have a hard time finding an exfoliating product that also helps to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li> At least for me it is.</li>
            <li> with ridiculously oily skin even at my age.</li>
            <li> I thought this scrub would do wonders since it is by St. Ives, however, I personally found that the product had a bad scent to it and some what of a scratchy feel when you use it.</li>
            <li> acne which is very common in teenagers/young adults.</li>
            <li> this product hasn&#x27;t given me any weird rashes or anything like that.</li>
            <li> But I also tend to react poorly to a lot of cleansers and I do not seem to with this one!</li>
            <li> I am currently overseas in Afghanistan, and it&#x27;s either the environment or the nasty water we have to shower with...</li>
            <li> This beats out an expensive $30 scrub I have used before.</li>
            <li> Sad that autoship stopped, though I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> That means you’re paying approximately 1$ per ounce, which isn’t bad</li>
            <li> The product does smell, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> why, I don&#x27;t squeeze it on its sides, but its very weird to me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got bad acne, I would recommend giving this product a try</li>
            <li> Painful acne was the theme with my face.  </li>
            <li> I was, however, disappointed with the price.  </li>
            <li> We both suffer from acne and his is worst than mines.</li>
            <li> scrub away all the dirt and nasty stuff that builds up</li>
            <li> but when i do it&#x27;s awful!</li>

            <li> I was hesitant to try this out as i tried other st ives scrub that was too abrasive for me. But i went ahead and bought it and loved it! I am not too fond of the smell but it doesnt linger around your face so it doesnt bother me at all. I like the grainy texture so when i put them directly to my face, i know its cleaning the deep pores of mine without being too abbrassive. So far, it has helped me combat the acne.</li>
            <li> Every time I go into my local Walgreens or CVS, they are sold out of this...or they don&#x27;t carry it at all. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and to be able to get it so easily! I love the smell, the way it exfoliates and leaves my face super soft, and as a bonus, it also clears up any acne! Can a facial product get any better?!? I am a die-hard St. Ives fan, and this is top of my list!</li>
            <li> I really like this face scrub. The beads are very tiny, so it is gentle on your face. It also does not over dry your skin like other products. It smells nice and you only need a small amount to clean your face. I have been using it for a couple of months and I have not had any major breakouts on my skin. A little pimple here and there, but nothing major. Good purchase:)</li>
            <li> This face wash is awesome. It clears up breakouts as well as blackheads and leaves my face feeling clean and not oily. The product comes out green and has little sandy grains in it to help exfoliate yours skin in a way that does not feel like sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: LOVE IT...but wish I could find it in stores!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scrub so much I can go on n on forever talking about how wonderful this product is!! But, before I do that let me briefly tell you little bit about myself and my skin. I consider myself as a \\&quot;skin care product junkie\\&quot; because I LOVE to take care of my skin and do whatever it takes to keep it healthy. Luckily, I have been blessed with a normal healthy skin which fortunately have never caused any major skin problems for me, esp. acne which is very common in teenagers/young adults. However, I do have few very annoying pimple scars that I&#x27;ve gained over the years by continuously popping little zits and pimples on my face whenever I get them [usually 3-4 zits or pimples around my monthly days] which have left me with some very noticeable spots/scars. When I usually wear makeup, they become almost non-existant which I&#x27;m happy with but I&#x27;m not one of those people who likes to wear a lot of make up every day or cover their face with too much chemicals...I prefer having less or no make up on because I love my natural skin and I love to show it off because it makes me feel more confident about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to get rid of these scars/spots, I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every single popular skin care product you can think of over the past 5-6 years...I have even tried all the homemade remedies and the natural clays/face-packs they sell on the internet...so you can trust me 100% when I say this..this green tea scrub is one of the two products that I absolutely love and adore. It not only clears your face but exfoliates your skin so well getting rid of blemishes and blackheads!! Yess, by the second time I had used this product, I noticed all my blackheads were gone and the redness caused by the blemish were lessen if not \\&quot;almost\\&quot; disappeared. This scrub is really really good, it makes you feel so clean and refreshed after using it. It hasn&#x27;t even been a week yet since I started using this product and I&#x27;ve already noticed a great change in my skin. It&#x27;s gotten verysmooth, it looks a lot more healthy. It reduced the blemish on my face and the appearance of my scars/spots. I use this scrub daily, esp. in the morning when I wake up. Also, just to let you know the other product I love besides this one is \\&quot;ponds luminous clean cream cleanser\\&quot;, if someone wants to try it. That cleanser is one of the best cleansers out there...it&#x27;s sooo good, you will fall in love with it the first time you use it I promise! It not only smells really really great but it makes your face really bright and clear because it removes all the dirt or even make up from your face. I swear ever since I&#x27;ve discovered that cleanser, I have stopped using make up remover or even all the other products I previously owned...every night or every evening when I return home, I wash my face with it and it takes all the make up off. I just LOVE it...I&#x27;m gonna use it all my life [both that cleanser and this scrub]. So based on my experience, these are the two products I would \\&quot;highly\\&quot; recommend to anyone who wants to improve their skin to a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. I started off using the apricot scrub, but it was way too abrasive and harmful to the skin. This, the green tea scrub, is way more gentle and still gets the job done and my skin looks and feels great. I&#x27;m still iffy on St. Ives products, but so far this is the cheapest and best exfoliating scrub I&#x27;ve found. Like other reviewers have said, it feels like a fine grain sand in a thick consistency. The product does smell, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering or unpleasant. Everyone&#x27;s nose is different, though, so don&#x27;t take my word on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I say give it a try. If you don&#x27;t like it, hey, at least you didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money, right?</li>
            <li> I actually would like to use one product from St. Ives that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in terms of breaking out.  Just one product is all I ask.  Initially I loved this cleanser because even though my skin is oily and acne-prone, it is actually quite sensitive.  And this cleanser scrubbing properties was very gentle but exfoliated my skin very well.  It didn&#x27;t leave my face raw or left a film like the Apricot scrub from St. Ives.  Once the honeymoon phases was over, my face went berserk.  Painful acne was the theme with my face.  To say I was heartbroken was an understatement.  I purchased three tubes of this stuff so my pockets are now lighter (bought them on sale and threw away the receipt).  I donated the unopened bottles to a woman&#x27;s shelter. This product would have been HG if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve EVER used. I&#x27;ve had acne for 15 years. Nothing has ever worked this well for me. It suddenly has stopped being sold in stores near me so I&#x27;m now left to order off Amazon. I also have sensitive skin and any bit of dirt will give me a breakout, I have mostly oily skin, especially the tzone. I encourage anyone with persistent acne to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a 4.5 stars because I love this stuff, but it&#x27;s not quite perfect because I do have to wash twice to get all the makeup off.  That being said, I love the smell, the feel, the light exfoliation, and the fact that it does not make me break out.  I&#x27;m 34 years old and have tried seemingly every face wash ever made since I was about 14 and started breaking out, running the gamut from very cheap to very expensive and even homemade.  I switched to this one about 5 years ago and have loved it ever since, especially the fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive yet so effective.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but I do wear a little bit of camouflage concealer, which is very hard to get off with any face wash (I&#x27;ve tried).  Now I just wish Amazon would add a Subscribe &amp; Save option because I often run out before I remember to buy more!</li>
            <li> While it smells nice, it&#x27;s just too gentle to make any difference for my oily porous skin. I like the original Apricot scrub much better, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li> Works great and no problems :)</li>
            <li> Not as i expected it to be. Apricot scrub is better than this one</li>
            <li> I have ance and I&#x27;m a 28 year old woman!  This product has been the only things that keeps it at bay.  And I&#x27;ve tried expensive products all the way down to the cheap stuff.  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed with this scrub!</li>
            <li> Has a really pleasant smell and really helps clear up my skin. I like that it is a scrub and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other scrubs do.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to a lot of acne products but not this one.  It&#x27;s great smelling and fine exfoliating texture is amazing and this is the only product I prefer to use</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, although it doesn&#x27;t have as much exfoliating \\&quot;power\\&quot; as the original apricot scrubs, I have a facial buffer that I use with it to get the same effect. The product has a nice rich consistency and feels refreshing on my face. Will definitely try to purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> This face wash has the most excellent scent and wonderful micro-beads for exfoliating your skin. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product feels great but I don&#x27;t care for the smell at all. It&#x27;s a nice fine grain scrub and my face feels clean after using but I can&#x27;t handle the smell. I do love their apricot scrub though.</li>
            <li> i first used this as a sample that came with another St. Ives product and fell in love with it. Had to order it and now it is my favorite scrub</li>
            <li> I thought this scrub would do wonders since it is by St. Ives, however, I personally found that the product had a bad scent to it and some what of a scratchy feel when you use it. And honestly, even though the product contains green tea, (which is suppose to be really good for your skin), it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin, if anything it may have made it worse. I personally prefer the apricot scrub from St. Ives. I think the apricot one works better and smells better. So give that product a try! I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it does it cleared my face of brakeouts in under a week I will definitively buy this product again</li>
            <li> Great product. Good for my skin</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. Love it. Simply love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There. I said it. It&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Scrub for years until I discovered this Green Tea Scrub. My skin was breaking out terribly (worse than usual, which is usually bad...its oily and VERY acne prone) and I was desperate so I bought a bottle of this. I really really really like (love) it. At first, the smell was a little weird, but now it kind of smells good. I can&#x27;t really describe it...it may smell like green tea, I&#x27;m not too sure myself, I&#x27;m more of a water drinker, but it&#x27;s pretty sweet. Maybe like apples? Slightly? I don&#x27;t know, the smell isn&#x27;t too important. The importance lies with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this stuff twice a day, before applying and after removing my makeup, I saw a noticeable difference in the overall appearance in my skin. It makes my skin feel truly clean and it calms down my breakouts tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real problem I have with this scrub is the bottle. It has started to crack on the sides. I have absolutely no idea why, I don&#x27;t squeeze it on its sides, but its very weird to me. Luckily, once this started, I had already used about 60% of the scrub so none has leaked (so far) but its still pretty inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, there is nothing I would change about this product. It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Its a Nice gentle scrub for people&lt;br /&gt;who have sensitive skin! It probably won&#x27;t clear your breakouts but it does reduce them! Buy it and try it out!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Note\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up on it if u don&#x27;t see results the first couple of weeks....it takes some time! Sometimes months</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the recommendation from DEALMOON. I just found out this is the scrub my skin okay with. my skin is quiet sensitive, especially T zone. I tried so many stupid method to clean the black head but failed. This scrub does a great job on this! I used it last night and I can see parts of my nose is clean!!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination sensitive and prone to redness. I started using this scrub about two months ago. I use the St. Ives green tea cleanser at night, and then just the scrub in the morning. Breakouts and redness have reduced dramatically. The scrub exfoliates without causing irritation. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Fantastic blemish control facial scrub with tea oil.  St. Ives Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is an excellent product at a reasonable price.  Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~J</li>
            <li> Someone didn&#x27;t think that one through. Busted all over the inside of the bag as you can imagine. I am not pleased to lose half my product, but I did try some from the bottle while washing it off and my skin was not as irritated as I was.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little scrub! I didn&#x27;t think I would like it when I put it on my fingers, it felt like wet sand, I was like \\&quot;THIS is suppose to scrub my face?\\&quot;, but when I actually applied it to my face it felt really good, not abrasive at all. It&#x27;s nice and thick, the consistency of toothpaste and a cool green color. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell. I&#x27;m tired of facial products with perfume, it&#x27;s a facial scrub, it doesn&#x27;t need to smell that great! It smells nothing like green tea, it smells like a generic acne scrub. I have extremely sensitive, white skin and this product hasn&#x27;t given me any weird rashes or anything like that. I have only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t tell you how it&#x27;s worked on my acne yet (which is moderate), but I will update this review with anything new! I also like how sand is used as the scrubbies, I won&#x27;t be as worried about getting it into my eyes on accident like if it were walnut shells or big blue beads like in the Clearasil I was using. This also leaves my face soft and NOT dry, but I always apply a moisturizer anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a while of using this, the sand particles have been getting stuck in my pores and breaking me out in a very bad way.</li>
            <li> Love St. Ives and this scrub I use everyday, sometime twice. I have partly oily skin. The scrub is very micro and does a great job of getting the face clean. I still use stringent after. But after a few weeks I do notice smoother skin and less blemishes.</li>
            <li> St. Ives Naturally Clear Green Tea Oil-free Scrub is awesome.  It keeps my skin clear and free of blemishes.  Most stores do not carry this which is really sad because it is a product that delivers.  Thank you Amazon for offering this product.  This comes highly recommended from a skin specialist and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I bought this on clearance at my local drug store and was immediately in love! The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is at Target, and Amazon. Much gentler on the face then the St.Ives apricot. Still has an abrasive for scrubbing dead skin off, but much finer. Great smell too. I usually buy 5 at a time. My skin has never looked or felt better since before using this product!</li>
            <li> I had cystic acne around the same time last year, and I&#x27;ve tried every product out there trying to find some kind of remedy. I use the Alba Botanica Pore cleanser first to get it semi better, but recently I switched to Neutrogena cleanser to get rid of make up and dirt, along with this product and my face is absolutely looking better! Im so excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Standard product for me, always some in the shower.  It is a great product and helps with blackheads, dead skin, deep cleaning of makeup residue and small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and loved it so bought the bigger size.  Came unsealed... so not sure if its second hand stuff, but still like it, makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> have tried soooo many face washes and this is my favorite hands down.  feels like an expensive facial every time</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a mini bottle of this from the store (the small kind made for people who travel a lot) and fell in love with it! It is a very gritty scrub, but the granules are smaller than any other exfoliating scrub I have used before. It really works well on my face and  washes away easily, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it every day (rather, I alternate this and an exfoliating brush and normal face wash) so I cannot tell if it would irritate people with sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, however. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin, so after using this I have to moisturize quite a bit. But I also tend to react poorly to a lot of cleansers and I do not seem to with this one!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not your average 50 year old woman who would find this facial scrub too drying - for some reason I am blessed (??) with ridiculously oily skin even at my age. This scrub is perfect. Twice a day keeps breakouts to a minimum and my face feeling pretty smooth. I also use chemical peeling stuff (glycolic acid) occasionally. I could buy this stuff my the case (oh, and my teenager like it too)</li>
            <li> I initially bought this in a trial size at my local Walmart and fell in love!  My skin feels so smooth now!</li>
            <li> I really liked the first bottle I bought, so I bought four more, and after all my experience with this product, here&#x27;s what I would like to tell other acne-obsessed teens/pre-adults concerned with their face:&lt;br /&gt;-What they say about it tearing your face microscopically MAY be true, but it&#x27;s honestly pretty soothing and refreshing. Just make sure you moisturize after using it and you&#x27;ll feel perty darn gud afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;-Use it in moderation. Don&#x27;t use it everyday like I did for a week because I wanted to see results. Stick to using it whenever your face feels like it&#x27;s compounding skin.&lt;br /&gt;-This isn&#x27;t going to make acne go away by itself. You have to do many other things like drinking [lemon] water, never touching your face with your big, meaty claws, etc., but exfoliation does help and should be routine.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a good product for this price, but if you&#x27;re really serious, get a more expensive exfoliator with finer exfoliants or chemicals, you won&#x27;t regret it. This product takes quite a while to use up....&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is much better now, but I can&#x27;t honestly say it&#x27;s because of this product alone, it&#x27;s all the lifestyle choices. I&#x27;m content with having bought it, but not ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re awesome and amazing and beautiful and you don&#x27;t need an exfoliator to prove it to you &amp; never forget that okay?</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for a long time but could never find it in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon!!! It agrees with me more than the apricot scrub, keeping my face smooth and minimizing my acne</li>
            <li> The Green Tea Scrub works very well.  I was, however, disappointed with the price.  It is less expensive at my local supermarket, but it is always out of stock.</li>
            <li> Great face wash. Nice little exfoliating factor too. I can get oily skin and it&#x27;s sensitive and this is a great face wash for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this product because so many people have had a positive experience using it but I am not one of them and neither was my son. We both suffer from acne and his is worst than mines. He tried it and nothing happened and I tried it and nothing happened. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It came on time with the test of my order completely filled and sealed. I had 3 little red bumps on my face before I started using this then about 3 days later they were flat and less irritated! This stuff works well, and smells so nice. Like green tea of course!</li>
            <li> After the first use, I just cannot wait to write a review for it. This is the best scrub ever!! At least for me it is. I have combined oily, acne prone skin and I mainly use this product for cleaning blackheads. This scrub is very gentle and you can actually massage your face with it for a long time, my skin is delicate and this product does not make my face turn red even I scrubbed my face with it for five minutes, and the process is very enjoyable. I love the smell of this scrub and it is easy to wash off. After the first use, the pores on my nose and on the two sides of my nose are very smooth and clean!! I bought this product because I saw other people&#x27;s recommendation on another website and it was definitely a good decision to buy. I would suggest this scrub everyone around me who have the similar skin problems and I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> No way around it, this is excellent stuff!! I adore St. Ives products, they are all top-of-the line. This Blemish Control Green Tea Scrub seems to improve the look of your skin from the first use. I usually prefer to use exfoliators in the shower, to make sure I get the little granules all rinsed off, but I must say that this product rinses off quite easily and leaves no film. If you experience occasional blotchyness, it&#x27;s quickly cleared away. Also, the redness seems to fade. You can&#x27;t ask for more! I&#x27;ve previously used (for years) the St. Ives Apricot Scrub with great results. Now the Green Tea Scrub is a new favorite. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I must say I was pretty surprised at my results with this cleanser. I didn’t expect this much from a low-cost formula like this. This works well if you use as directed. I used it twice a day for  slightly more than a week and it did a good job. It feels good on the face and the smell is pleasant, too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you use a moisturizing cream after you wash your face with this because it does make your skin a little dry, which is not at all unusual for cleansers like these. The main point to a cleansers such as this is to eliminate dirt and oil from the face, not to moisturize. This specific product is a very good cleanser, but does not do much in the moisturizing department.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used other products from St. Ives before and was pleased, but they were pricey items. Not like this one. This was a good value for me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the only negative thing to mention about this item is that the amount you receive is rather small. The tube indicates 4.5 oz. That means you’re paying approximately 1$ per ounce, which isn’t bad but I wish there were more. Perhaps St. Ives will produce a larger tube for this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading. If you have any questions or comments feel free to ask away.</li>
            <li> I have very many St. Ives products and I am glad to add this to my fabulous collection. This green tea scrub smells exactly like St. Ives green tea gel cleanser. But when you put it on your face, I think it smells kind of weird and different. The scrub microbeads are A LOT SMALLER than I thought compared to other St. Ives scrubs. I like St. Ives apricot blemish control a lot better.</li>
            <li> tried a sample of this at a friend&#x27;s house (left in the shower) and really liked it. went looking in the local stores for it but couldn&#x27;t find any; ended up ordering online--wonder if this product has been discontinued? don&#x27;t see why--it is great. scrub is just right--polishes but doesn&#x27;t abrade, nice smell &amp; lather, diminishes reddish skin--all at a fair price. would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash. It is the only facewash that works on my skin; it controls the oiliness without drying my skin out, and prevents breakouts before they occur. I love the texture and the smell. It&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, makes my skin feel soft and clean. I&#x27;ve heard great things about green tea, so i&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a product that uses it in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I had been buying only the sample size of this scrub at my local retailer, but was never able to find a bigger size.  I love the way it works and I wanted a bigger size.  When I saw the price on the larger size, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try.  This really cleans out the pores and clears up the skin with the salicylic acid.  This is one of the best scrubs I&#x27;ve found for acne, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot over the years.  It&#x27;s sad to have wrinkles and acne at the same time, but this definitely keeps my skin clearer.  I highly recommend it, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> good product, and I like this smell better than others. It can be used daily, and it doesn&#x27;t make any damage to my skin,</li>
            <li> I have used everything out there including products in the 100s. The green tea scrub is great for the redness on my cheaks and acne around chin, eliminates both! Even right before that time of the month. I used to have to take birth control for a clear face, not while using this product. Anyone who is giving this a low score I&#x27;m puzzled...its not that hard keeping it out of your eyes just wash throughly with water before opening your eyes. I even wash over my eyes and have no issues if I rinse well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find this product in stores so I&#x27;m really happy to see it on Amazon!  Definitely should try this if you have dry skin or  blemish problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to review this for fear of jinxing how great it has worked for me!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about the past 3 weeks and it has been fantastic!  I never had much trouble with acne until a few years ago and it has gotten worse over the past 2 years.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (Murad, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Clarisonic, St. Ives apricot scrub, ancient mayan clay masks, facials, antibiotics, etc).  I saw this on sale at Walgreens and decided to give it a try since it used green tea and didn&#x27;t have a lot of the junk other cleansers had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful I did!  Not only is this reasonably priced, but it has been a godsend for my skin. This scrub isn&#x27;t like others in that the exfoliation feels gentle enough to use twice a day (I use it three times a day...morning, after work, and before bed) but enough where I feel clean enough to not use toner afterwards. This scrub has been doing amazing things for me! I think after a few more weeks I can go with just a little light powder instead of my usual make-up. I just bought several bottles of this miracle stuff because I never want to be without it..  Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scrub. Beads are very fine so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are using sand. Leaves skin soft and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a long time and being helping my face to be smooth,clean and look great!!</li>
            <li> I have had acne problems since high school (now graduating college) and this is LITERALLY the only thing that has helped my skin. I use every night before bed and wake up with beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad they discontinued it because it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It works well on my sensitive and oily skin.  The only thing though, you gotta be sure to rinse it off good or it feels like sand on your face.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub that makes my skin nice and smooth! I use it daily and have no irritation. Love this!</li>
            <li> I like the stuff.  It has an almost fine texture to it (think Gojo, but finer) and so far it has done a great job cleaning my face. However, it kinda smells.  It doesn&#x27;t stink per se, but i guess it smells &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.  Smell doesn&#x27;t remain and it&#x27;s doing a great job so I don&#x27;t mind it.  My wife hates the smell though.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product in stores and found ones that were similar but not this specific one.  Good to know it&#x27;s still available, love the smell and the use.  On time and great product.</li>
            <li> I find this effective,  plan on continuing to use.  Smells like green apples.&lt;br /&gt;St Ives has a similar product that has no scrubber in it that is great to use when you do not want to scrub harshly</li>
            <li> It is just really good and leave my face feeling just delicious. I love to take care of my body.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my Face. St. Ives is the Best.  Defenetly recommend as a scrub for face. Love it</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.  Love the smell.  I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to ingredients lately though and I know this probably isn&#x27;t my best choice if I want to avoid all the controversial ingredients.  It does the job though until I can find a more natural replacement that works for me.</li>
            <li> Green tea works and this green tea scrub works great as an exfoliator and for blemish control. It&#x27;s hard to find so when I do I buy as many as I can.</li>
            <li> I used to use Wal-Mart brand (Equate?) of St. Ives Medicated scrub.  I know it&#x27;s meant to be used once in a while for exfoliation, but I used it everyday,, it removes make up, etc, and I have oily skin it worked great, but I knew it was a little harsh for the skin.  This green tea scrub, when I first used it, I felt it was a little too weak.  But then, when I rinsed it, my skin felt really good. It&#x27;s gentle enough to be used every night.  Removes make up.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t usually leave any review because of time, but I felt like leaving for this one.</li>
            <li> i love this! it has the perfect amount of exfoliates for my face. it left my face feeling nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li> If you use this product in the shower then you will have no worries. It is a pain to get the scrub off your face when you just wash your face in the sink.</li>
            <li> Its ok with the exfoliating, but it smells awful, and it lingers on your skin after too. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing, leaves my face super smooth but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. And it smells good.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best kind of exfoliating scrub. The consistency is very similar to Mary Kay&#x27;s \\&quot;Timewise\\&quot; microdermabrasion step 1 and Proactiv&#x27;s face wash. It&#x27;s so much better than any greasy apricot wash at an affordable price. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, and used consistently, works very well against acne. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Two arrived to me in a box with DVDs I ordered. No packing material or baggies for the washes to ship in, but everything arrived safely in perfect condition. I will be ordering more soon. My local stores are no longer selling this.</li>
            <li> Love the nice fragrance.  The particles are very tiny so as not to tear your skin.  Leaves it feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scrub but I can&#x27;t find it in my small town, so I have to buy it online. The green tea is great for moisturizing and reducing redness. It really calms my skin to prevent acne too.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub. Gentle on sensitive skin but effective. We also Iove the smell. My purchase came on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Its better than the Apricot scrub and it doesn&#x27;t mess your skin up as much as it uses silica and not sharp apricot pits to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> it has a nice scent.. i loved how it left my skin super soft and reduced the redness of my random acne</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is getting harder to find at various stores in my area such as Walgreens, WalMart, etc. I have sensitive skin so have a hard time finding an exfoliating product that also helps to prevent break outs. I use this almost every day and have never had a problem. I ran out for a while and tried a series of other products but none worked as well for me as this. I love the smell, it is a gentle exfoliator, and a gentle but good cleanser. I use this in conjunction with Pevonia&#x27;s Enzyme mask (once a week for the enzyme mask and the other days of the week use this cleanser on my face) and love that combination as part of my long term, ongoing, skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> Did not clear the acne on my back as I hoped, wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I keeps my face clear without the redness.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the scent.  I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Small seeds are gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Well, if the caption didn&#x27;t say enough. Love this stuff. I am currently overseas in Afghanistan, and it&#x27;s either the environment or the nasty water we have to shower with... my face was going through hell! I was breaking out in one spot, skin cracking and peeling elsewhere, and just all around uneven skin tone. I use this every day almost, and my skin tone is evening out, and my breakouts are almost gone.</li>
            <li> This face wash works perfectly for me. It has fine grit in it that is not abrasive and leaves my face feeling o-so-clean. I will continue to use this product for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> Ehh, it&#x27;s just okay. I think it dried my skin out a little bit..it doesn&#x27;t help with redness either. I was surprised by the consistency though it&#x27;s more like a puffy thick foam and it doesn&#x27;t have scrubber beads, it&#x27;s more like a bunch of gritty things in it. I don&#x27;t dislike it but I can think of a couple products I like more. I really like the way it smells but I&#x27;d rather like the way it works. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I got my whole family to start using it and they all rave about how gentle it is on the skin and how nice your face looks after using it. Worth every penny and definitely a great alternative for the overpriced facial scurbs.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this face cleanser. this works wonders for me, gets rid of oil without over drying, smells great without being overpowering, cleans all the makeup off my face, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only wish it was available as a &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; item!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this exclusively for blemish control but it is a good suppliment to my regular blemish routine (Clinique). I use it more for exfolient/polishing properties and the tea extract is benefical. It does dry up existing blemishes and appears to help reduce redness. I have purchased this product several times and plan on continued use.</li>
            <li> I started using this facial scrub about 4 months ago and I have to say it&#x27;s the most invigorating cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  I had a hard time finding it in my local Walgreens, Walmart and CVS so I ordered it online at Amazon. Batter price and got it fast.</li>
            <li> I bought a little sample size of this to take with me to the tropics this past month - and dare I say, I&#x27;m already in love with the product! I find St. Ives to be a hit-or-miss product line. I love their classic apricot scrub, for instance, but cannot stand the olive oil cleanser. This scrub has micro-beads which feel amazing on the skin. They&#x27;re there, in plenty, but not as rough as the apricot shell ones. In the heat and humidity of the tropics - I found this to be a refreshing post-sun-and-wind cleanser. It did dry my normal skin out a little but that was fixed easily with some light moisturizer. Has a great smell too. This is one of my personal fav products of 2013. Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> does what it says. good for exfoliating my face as well as treating my acne not in a harsh way.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has just enough granules to make my skin feel really clean, but it&#x27;s not so rough that it irritates my existing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Most of the scrubs I&#x27;ve used actually make my skin breakout, but not this. It does exfoliate my face, but not in the harsh way that some of the other scrubs do--you know, where it feels like someone put sand in the bottle. This feels more like someone pureed an almond or apricot pit so that it is smooth, but still rough enough to exfoliate. I bought this first at Walmart as a travel size scrub, but when Walmart stopped selling them, I found it here on Amazon and immediately purchased 2 of these medium-sized tubes. This scrub, and only this scrub, now has my loyalty.</li>
            <li> The product itself is WONDERFUL! I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel. This beats out an expensive $30 scrub I have used before. However, I ordered this and receives a 1oz trial size in the mail. This is the only reason I took 2 stars away. Luckily Amazon has solved the issue, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying I have to go through the trouble of sending back a tiny little sample. Oh well!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it feels so good on your skin and cleanses well and clears up redness which is a plus for me and fights acne but I just can&#x27;t seem to find this stuff anywhere in my town anymore, my walmart used to have it but I haven&#x27;t spotted it yet ever since I last used it so now I use the apricot scrub which is also just as good too but doesn&#x27;t clear up redness and I wish it did but both products are great choices. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It cleans exceptionally well and does not dry out my skin as some other products do.  Have tried many other more expensive scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! The texture is so fine/gritty not as harsh on our skin...oh and it smells divine! We all love this green tea scrub in our household, It&#x27;s worth the price, it lasts awhile because you don&#x27;t need to use much. It has worked for our skin  we&#x27;ve been using this scrub for 4+ months and it is mild enough to use with some of our topical skin medications we sometimes use...we&#x27;ve used no other scrub(s) since we tried it.</li>
            <li> Great for daily or weekly use. I use it in the shower and put lotion on afterwards. It makes your face clean.</li>
            <li> Left me a scar on my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;I got a swollen big pimple on my shoulder and I squeezed a little of the face wash and put it  on my pimiple overnight.&lt;br /&gt;After a night, it seemed smaller but left a red scar there. nothing I can do to make it go away.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job.  Note that it has salicylic acid in it so consult your doctor before using if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li> This makes my face burn</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great product for the price. Possibly able to find cheaper in store but my target and cvs dont&#x27; carry anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to use St. Ives scrubs all the time and loved them. The little scrubbing balls have since been out lawed because it&#x27;s said they go into the ocean and fish eat them and then we eat them and it&#x27;s now hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only cleansers that i do not have an allergic reaction to.  It does not clog pores like the apricot scrub.  Only problem is it is always sold out in stores and i have to buy online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best products that I have ever used before. You&#x27;re scin just feel so clean afterward. Not sure about blemish fighting, but it&#x27;s great for having a clean, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now along with Zapzyt afterwards and it not only clears up my oily skin, but keeps my blemishes down and exfoliates the dead skin. I love the feeling of my skin after this product, and I love everything green tea.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning.  It helps to exfoliate and control blemishes.  It works way better than the apricot scrub.  That never did anything for me.</li>
            <li> I can be very picky about the texture of facial scrubs, but I find this product &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  Not too harsh, not too gentle.  I have very sensitive skin and do not find this product irritating or overly drying despite using it every other day.  As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best scrub for the money. The grit is fine, not like some scrubs that feel like it has rocks in it.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin looking clean and brand new. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face wash. My only complaint is that it does not come in the large round tubs like some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this product (which is important. I don&#x27;t want to gag while I&#x27;m cleaning my face). I feel it works well, though I do find it does burn my skin just a little (but I do have fairly sensitive skin). It can potentially leave a residue if you are not thorough in rinsing your face. Easy to tell, though. Run your fingers over your skin and if you feel any grit, you did not get it all off. Still, a good product. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Quick shipping and cheap price.</li>
            <li> While this is a decent exfoliant for the price, it&#x27;s not absolutely effective. Given the St. Ives reputation, I was hoping to be wowed. But I still have blemish control issues. This has helped a little, but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I prefer the apricot scrub. This one was very fine. Felt almost like a mud mask. Did make skin soft but was looking for more exfoliation</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this product honestly.. Although my face does feel softer after I use this product, it does nothing for my acne or blackheads. Maybe it works better for others but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Better than the harsher apricot version.  Very clean feeling.  Sad that autoship stopped, though I don&#x27;t know why. Hope it&#x27;s not being canceled by the manufacturer.  Pricing at Target is over $5 for this bottle, which is smaller in size than the Apricot formula. Use it sparingly per wash and it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of St Ives and green tea seems healthy so I thought I would give this a go. Product is very smooth and fine grain exfoliate. Cant really say if its good or bad. I like using it tho. The other scrub might be just as good and is cheaper and you get more.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying and at first I thought people&#x27;s dislike of the scrubbing beads were a personal matter, or maybe they&#x27;re not used to scrubs.  The beads are an annoying factor, the cleanser itself seems good. Haven&#x27;t broke out and it has helped my skin. But the beads do stick to you after washing, sometimes it gets mixed with my hairline and when I dry my face and apply lotion, minutes later I can see that I have scrubbing beads on my face. I won&#x27;t repurchase and the original apricot scrub is probably a better bet.</li>
            <li> If I could only use one product to wash my face for the rest of my life, I&#x27;d use this one. The exfoliant is a lot finer than the Apricot Scrub, so I use this one more often. My face feels so soft afterwards. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It does help with my breakouts if I use it regularly. I also like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This product is great cleans face well without drying out my face.  This has become one of my favorite items and part of my daily routine love love love. I have sensitive skin and this works great and not harsh on my face!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this green tea cleanser.  It&#x27;s a scrub but not harsh.  Great for sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve notice it not only helps with acne, but also calm my mild case of rosacea.  The bottle is a good size and lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li> wonderful product ease of use and ease of removing from your face. works wonderful day and night you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Great for Blemish as it claims to be. I have combination (normal skin type/oily T-Zone) After first use felt my skin refreshed and cleaner than usual and some of the blemishes i had on my chin began to heal.</li>
            <li> great scrub for price.  My personal fave for grocery/drug store quality.  It is a small size, so I order 2 at a time ;)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for the last two years. We have never gone back to our old face scrub since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scrub, love the finer particles than their apricot scrub. BUT it broke half of my face out and the other side has risen bumps on it. I might just be reacting to something in it, but I have fairly clear skin and I have never had this much acne on my face at one time as I do now. Love at. Ives just not this product</li>
            <li> I like this scrub its gentle on my face and cleances well will order more because I can only find this product on amazon</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, simply because I have stupidly sensitive skin. It probably works wonders for people who can handle the salicilic acid. :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this scrub makes my skin feel. The smell is heavenly as well. I have a big problem though. I always seem to get the silica beads stuck in my eyelashes. It seems that no matter how much I rinse, those beads remain stuck in my lashes where they inevitably fall out and into my eyes where they cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i ordered and expected, it&#x27;s a softer scrub face wash so i don&#x27;t love it as much but smells good and makes my skins super smooth</li>
            <li> Great scrub...takes care of ALL dead skin without irritating your skin..#timeless</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this green tea scrub! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and adore the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s lightweight and not overdrying (I use a daily moisturizer anyway). Helps me to feel like I&amp;#34;m getting the dirt and sweat off my skin without being too abrasive with the microscrubbing exfoliation.</li>
            <li> best face scrub i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and works best for acne prone skin. It dries out the skin. Sometimes it cause burning sensation as it contains SA. Overall an OK product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very clean, fresh and smooth. I love its smell and it is not too drying. The scrub is just right, does not irritate face at all. Would re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates and deep cleans perfectly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and hate that it is so hard to find locally. Hence why i came to amazon to buy it. This works like the apricot scrub used to work years ago. It is not per say &#x27;gentle&#x27; as some other scrubs, but I need a true scrub due to my dry skin. I like feeling the scrub working. It is gently enough that I am not missing my top layer of epidermis.  Will be buying a bunch and stock piling it, cuz right now the only place to buy is via amazon.</li>
            <li> I only use it  3 or 4 times a week but leave my face clean and is not hard on my face.</li>
            <li> scrub away all the dirt and nasty stuff that builds up</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this scrub in the store anymore but have been using it for a while.  I like it because the grains are very small and consistent, more like a paste than most face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this in the store so I get it here on Amazon.  It works for all the skin types in our house, very mild and non-drying which is important to us!  I recommend this to all my friends so I&#x27;m comfortable recommending it here.</li>
            <li> This green tea one takes the cake. I have had less break outs especially with what triggers my breaks. The seller definitely was thoughtful with packaging to ensure nothing explodes during transport.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have blackheads or have ever had them, this product does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean, fresh, and red free!!! Plus it smells like green tea and feels like a massage</li>
            <li> Great facial cleaner but not available in my area stores any more really awesome cleaner with tea tree oil for cleaning</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li> I adore this! I don&#x27;t have a ton of break outs often but when i do it&#x27;s awful! I also have those little zits like to stay under the skin and cause a big bump. I found this product in mini travel size bottles at my local walmart but could not find a normal size bottle anywhere but amazon! The product came at decent time and packaged well and overall i love this product! It helps my skin sooo much! When i use it the number of my zits go down and any zits i do have left aren&#x27;t red! That&#x27;s what i love about this is that it takes away the redness. A must have for any stressed out college student.</li>
            <li> I would say it definitely helps calm down zits that are sort of forming so that they usually dont fully &#x27;blossom&#x27;, and after a few uses can rub down and \\&quot;kill\\&quot; existing zits.  Can be used in shower or just on damp face (I would advise lotioning up afterwards though!)</li>
            <li> the microbeads!! ahhh! They do their job soo well, that it really is too good to be true. Because they&#x27;re so small, yes they do a better job as a scrub than other products, but they&#x27;re also so hard to fully rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;I have to rinse a lot to make sure they&#x27;re gone, but a few always manage to get into my eyes (which I just dust off, but still an annoyance) or in my hairline next to my ears, making it look like I have mild dandruff! Dang!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said before, if the beads were any bigger, I don&#x27;t know if the scrub would be as effective, so it&#x27;s something you just have to deal with to get such a great product. So I won&#x27;t knock off a star, because it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive but gets the job done. Very pleasant smell. Is non-drying and leaves you with very clean face.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used to treat my acne, since using it around 2 years ago, my acne has been under control. If you&#x27;ve got bad acne, I would recommend giving this product a try</li>
    </ol>
