    <ol>
            <li>Great product - just as described!!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is very good.</li>
            <li>Now using Neutrogena rapid eye cream which is much better!!</li>
            <li>Price and delivery was good.  </li>
            <li>Olay or L&#x27;Oreal products are just as good.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good anyway</li>
            <li>I have tried just about everything on the market when I heard good reviews about this</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good eye moisturizer to apply at night, I can recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to you all.</li>
            <li>Feels good going on.</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing Results....</li>
            <li>but the result was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and moisturizers the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It would help to advertise &amp;#34;Most effective for women under 50,, etc.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>As most women I&#x27;ve used almost everything,but nothing as good as this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not to be honest.  </li>
            <li>I love it, light cream, works great for me</li>
            <li>this is the best product by far for under eye bags and circles you get a much more youthful look, I would recommend this to any one who wants to eliminate this problem, I wish they had a face cream!!!!!</li>
            <li>, far cry from the best..</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.</li>
            <li>However, if, like me, you are looking for something to erase fine lines and wrinkles around your eyes, try something else!</li>
            <li>I have more puffiness than darkness</li>
            <li>like it ok.  </li>
            <li>This was just ok, would not recommend nor buy again.  </li>
            <li>Better products out there</li>
            <li>I think it will take a week or more to see more results.  </li>
            <li>I Love Amazon</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>You can buy better products in 1oz jars</li>
            <li>(I guess the name is fitting).</li>
            <li>OK - thumbs up for that.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>This product is OK, not anything I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>It works okay</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>; - I find Neutrogena does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I must have more.</li>
            <li>I shall be going in for more soon.</li>
            <li>This is .25 of product, most eye creams are .50</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>With each use it began to look somewhat better .</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and I will be ordering more for myself.</li>
            <li>It works better than any thing I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I very rarely write a review, so I must really love this product.....</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, and I have been using this product every day for one month now.  </li>
            <li>Cream has smooth texture, glides on easy, tightens and lifts.</li>
            <li>Has made a difference with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It helped smooth our my fine line.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my wife because a friend told her to try it, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Good Product for low cost would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I suppose it just take time to get the full benefit of what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but an inexpensive eye cream if that interests you.  </li>
            <li>I truthfully didn&#x27;t think this was any better than any of the generic eye creams out there.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any visible clearing, but, am willing continue using!</li>
            <li>It is instantly absorbed into my skin and is not oily.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with results, had a chance to compare with other products, I even put it on one eye initially to see a difference, it was noticeable.</li>
            <li>no improvement at all with wrinkles on the right.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but the tube was almost empty.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream I have ever used for under eye bags and dark circles, People have asked what I am using to get such a youthful look!!</li>
            <li>I love the the 7 second eye lift cream!</li>
            <li>you will be amazed at how much higher the brow is on that side compared to the untreated eye!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I looked in the mirror first thing (something I don&#x27;t quite look forward to BTW)</li>
            <li>i use this daily &amp; love it ...</li>
            <li>I noticed it the first day and the second day confirmed it!</li>
            <li>I have seen physical changes on my face and am pleased.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first products I have used that really does what it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see a change.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>The real surprise came this morning.</li>
            <li>For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t order again- no visible difference for me, even after using the whole tube.</li>
            <li>i feel like it&#x27;s really helped the hooded eye lids</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This eye cream is a miracle I wish I could afford to slather my whole face with it.  </li>
            <li>Effects were fast and visible.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really doing much to erase my under-eye circles</li>
            <li>Okay, would not really recommend.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It produces no results in 7 seconds&lt;br /&gt;There are several more complete and affordable eyecreams out there, Babyface, Nevonia</li>
            <li>cream is gentle on your eye area; you need very little for daily use; price was great ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other under eye creams that I thought had better results.  </li>
            <li>Price a bit high for the amount you get, and it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and recommend you at least try this product.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, my eyes are very sensitive and it makes me a little itchy</li>
            <li>I will only use this product and no other, I love 7 Second Eye Lift!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for mature skin</li>
            <li>you take a small amount of it and start under your eye then swoop up and around while lifting at the brow for 7 or more seconds...</li>
            <li>My eyes looked WAY better than usual.</li>
            <li>The first time using the 7 second Eye Lift</li>
            <li>I am still in the early part of trial on this cream but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it will last longer than some eye creams.</li>
            <li>So far it is working for me.</li>
            <li>I see some results and hope to see a complete change in time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get rid of them completely</li>
            <li>My wrinkles around my eyes are almost completely gone after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>We as consumers should really do our home work on such items before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li>, what have you got to lose but old wrinkled, sagging eyes.  </li>
            <li>Even so I used up one tube to be fair - still scary.  </li>
            <li>lucky i am that dark circles was not an issue for me, but general puffy skin beneath eye is ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unusual to have something appear to work for at first but after repeated use you find it isn&#x27;t quite living up to expectations.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a different in how my eyes normally looked. .</li>
            <li>but I only used it a couple of weeks so far and could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Young, now my eyes look younger.  </li>
            <li>I think I notice less wrinkles the first time I use it in the morning</li>
            <li>I dont think it does much for my loose upper eyelid area.  </li>
            <li>I love the 7 Second Eye Lift - Under Eye Cream but the tube is small and doesn&#x27;t last long for the price .</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t my first time on this merry go round.</li>
            <li>I would have like to seen better instructions other than what is printed on the tube, which is very small.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product was tightening my skin the first few times I used it, especially on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were looking pretty frightful: late nights, early morning, long work hours in front of a computer.</li>

            <li> Not sure where all these positive reviews came from, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  </li>
            <li> not a major noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on creams as they are usually all alike.  </li>
            <li> No big difference than other eye creams</li>
            <li> does not last and is a little weak and does not seem worth the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it again because I&#x27;m trying to find a single product that will handle all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That makes this expensive for not having anything special in it</li>
            <li> I am continuing to use this product at night to moisturize the skin around my eyes, but I have stopped using it in the morning, as the oils in it caused my mascara to collect on the skin beneath my eyes, so I was having to deal with removing the black mascara several times a day.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are TOO SMALL and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times and it was all gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different eye cream&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> product arrived empty.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of days so far and have not experienced any benefits yet..</li>
            <li> I used the whole jar of the expensive one as I was advised by the beauty consultant and noticed next to nothing other than moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very little improvement on fading away the wrinkles  on the left eye....</li>
            <li> I do not have this problem with any of the other eye or face products I use...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with other products but won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product did make an improvement in tightness around eyes but did nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The best.for dark circle, lines and puffiness</li>
            <li> No diminished lines or improvement in dark circles.</li>
            <li> After trying eye creams at drug stores and finally breaking down and buying an expensive eye cream at Macy&#x27;s, this product is the only one that has given visible results and in the shortest time!  </li>
            <li> However my eye lines do appear less noticeable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to tell, there was such a small amount for the price, so</li>
            <li> it may take a little longer.</li>
            <li> I am really past due on my Botox and thought I&#x27;d try this.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday, 2xs&#x27; but improvement.</li>
            <li> So if your only issue is puffy, tired and/or bags under the eyes then this product will take care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> to have found it - Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Been using this for few days now</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it for  few weeks</li>
            <li> waste your time hassle and money, its a gimmick</li>
            <li> Did nothing for lifting my eyes and very little product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i would recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in this</li>
            <li> I have used really expensive eye creams and they have never done what the 7 Second Eye Lift Cream does.  </li>
            <li> Why is it so small.</li>
            <li> But the bottle is really small.</li>
            <li> And the tube is extremely small.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me - it actually makes my eyes look scary and hag-like in the morning .  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> No more droopy eyelids for him either.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with undereye bags but not very much and was a little expensive!  </li>
            <li> The tub is also very small for the price.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Did not like the sticky hard and fake feel it gave.</li>
            <li> Not great for contac lens wearers.</li>
            <li> My friends want to know my secret.</li>
            <li> Just not great for me, I have issues.</li>
            <li> but they haven&#x27;t gotten any worse</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything dramatic like you see in</li>
            <li> Sorry have to tell the truth.............</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for no results.  </li>
            <li> but....it dries my eyes out crazy!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I could tell no difference in my eyes after using this cream.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can visibly see a difference when I use this....but....it dries my eyes out crazy!  I am constantly using drops.  I definitely notice my eyes are drier when I use this product before I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of days so far and have not experienced any benefits yet..it may take a little longer. I do like the feel of the cream and it does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i would recomend this to anyone. Didn&#x27;t notice anything at all. I&#x27;ve been applying it for a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye cream for about a week and I don&#x27;t really notice a difference. I have more puffiness than darkness and I don&#x27;t really see a change.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to use this along with an anti wrinkle cream (Oxytokin) in her daily regimen. Her sagging upper eye is tightening and the wrinkles under her eyes are almost non existent.  I think one of the biggest benefits we&#x27;ve seen is that the crows feet around her eyes are diminishing.</li>
            <li> Price a bit high for the amount you get, and it did absolutely nothing , far cry from the best..Sorry have to tell the truth.............</li>
            <li> have not seen a noticeable change??? been 3 weeks.. will continue on but planning on going back to what I was using</li>
            <li> I dont think it does much for my loose upper eyelid area.  Will continue my hunt for a product that works before considering a blepharoplasty</li>
            <li> Only started using this product a couple of days ago, but so far&lt;br /&gt;I like it ok.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything dramatic like you see in&lt;br /&gt;products like lip plumpers, but it does leave my skin looking smoother.</li>
            <li> Helpful, to get an open-eye look</li>
            <li> This product did make an improvement in tightness around eyes but did nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> This was just ok, would not recommend nor buy again.  Does not lift or plump skin.  Shipping was fast.  Better products out there</li>
            <li> No 7Second results for me</li>
            <li> Amazing Results....I&#x27;m not sure what is in this but the result was amazing.  I am really past due on my Botox and thought I&#x27;d try this.  Now I&#x27;m not going for Botox anytime soon.  What a savings!  A tiny dab is all you need and I am definitely using it in the AM and PM and it is working.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on creams as they are usually all alike.  I have used really expensive eye creams and they have never done what the 7 Second Eye Lift Cream does.  I will purchase this again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am still in the early part of trial on this cream but so far I like it. It feels nice and moisturizers the skin around my eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t take much so it will last longer than some eye creams.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried but can&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but the tube was almost empty. I only used it a few times and it was all gone.</li>
            <li> Only have been using it f or a couple of days and seems to be reducing the puffiness under my eyes. I think it will take a week or more to see more results.  Price and delivery was good.  I would have like to seen better instructions other than what is printed on the tube, which is very small.</li>
            <li> So far it is working for me. I see some results and hope to see a complete change in time.</li>
            <li> I only used one tube, so I cannot tell if work.</li>
            <li> Very little improvement on fading away the wrinkles  on the left eye....no improvement at all with wrinkles on the right.</li>
            <li> Get rid of the bags immediately!!  I love the the 7 second eye lift cream!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with this cream just like some of the others. I used it everyday, 2xs&#x27; but improvement.</li>
            <li> Order came thru like a charm.  I Love Amazon, it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping go to place.</li>
            <li> all it did was tighten my skin creating lines that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Obviously doesn&#x27;t work overnight. Not great for contac lens wearers.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products I have used that really does what it says!&lt;br /&gt;If you take a small amount of it and start under your eye then swoop up and around while lifting at the brow for 7 or more seconds...you will be amazed at how much higher the brow is on that side compared to the untreated eye!&lt;br /&gt;I love it...it&#x27;s like have an eye lift without the cost or operation!</li>
            <li> 0.25 oz no. Why is it so small. Did nothing for lifting my eyes and very little product. You can buy better products in 1oz jars</li>
            <li> Update to my earlier review:&lt;br /&gt;Great for puffiness and bags. Does nothing for dark circles. I haven&#x27;t bought it again because I&#x27;m trying to find a single product that will handle all. So if your only issue is puffy, tired and/or bags under the eyes then this product will take care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this yesterday so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to try it until the evening. My eyes were looking pretty frightful: late nights, early morning, long work hours in front of a computer. I had to run some errands so I thought I&#x27;d dab a bit on and see what, if anything, would happen. I couldn&#x27;t believe it but I actually saw a difference within seconds (I guess the name is fitting). OK - thumbs up for that. But this isn&#x27;t my first time on this merry go round. It&#x27;s not unusual to have something appear to work for at first but after repeated use you find it isn&#x27;t quite living up to expectations. The real surprise came this morning. When I looked in the mirror first thing (something I don&#x27;t quite look forward to BTW) I was pleasantly surprised. Looks like this is the gift that keeps on giving. My eyes looked WAY better than usual. That&#x27;s why only 4 stars for now. I&#x27;m looking forward to the coming days and weeks. If this trend keeps up you&#x27;ll get all 5 stars..</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! THANK YOU... *****&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have found it - Use it everyday.  Will be buying more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> The tubes are TOO SMALL and don&#x27;t last long. A jar or larger tube would be better.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good.</li>
            <li> I truthfully didn&#x27;t think this was any better than any of the generic eye creams out there. For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t order again- no visible difference for me, even after using the whole tube.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work as advertised.  Or maybe I don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with undereye bags but not very much and was a little expensive!  I WOULD NOT purchase this product again and try something else.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for the bags under my eyes.  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I could tell no difference in my eyes after using this cream. Perhaps it is only designed for younger women?  It would help to advertise &amp;#34;Most effective for women under 50,, etc.</li>
            <li> I love it, light cream, works great for me</li>
            <li> This product is OK, not anything I would buy again.  Olay or L&#x27;Oreal products are just as good.  I can see no noticeable difference in my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the cream. It is instantly absorbed into my skin and is not oily. 7 Second Eye Lift can be used under or over makeup. I gave the rating of 4 stars because I have used this eye cream only three days. However my eye lines do appear less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife because a friend told her to try it, so far so good.  She seems to like the results.</li>
            <li> i feel like it&#x27;s really helped the hooded eye lids, i would definitely try it--I don&#x27;t know if i will reorder just because of the value</li>
            <li> Did not like the sticky hard and fake feel it gave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any visible clearing, but, am willing continue using! Thanks</li>
            <li> The best.for dark circle, lines and puffiness</li>
            <li> It works okay it does cake just a bit but it&#x27;s good anyway</li>
            <li> Bought it but sent it back.</li>
            <li> didnlt notice ANY change in minimizing puffiness</li>
            <li> It did not do what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> cream is gentle on your eye area; you need very little for daily use; price was great ... lucky i am that dark circles was not an issue for me, but general puffy skin beneath eye is ... i use this daily &amp; love it ... tiny wrinkles are waving goodbye!</li>
            <li> this is the best product by far for under eye bags and circles you get a much more youthful look, I would recommend this to any one who wants to eliminate this problem, I wish they had a face cream!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever used for under eye bags and dark circles, People have asked what I am using to get such a youthful look!! I wish I could use it all over my face.</li>
            <li> No big difference than other eye creams</li>
            <li> i saw an immediate difference with each use.</li>
            <li> Great product - just as described!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It helped smooth our my fine line. It didn&#x27;t get rid of them completely but I only used it a couple of weeks so far and could tell a difference. But the bottle is really small.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different eye cream&#x27;s and 7 Second Eye Lift is the only one that I notice a difference, I know this product works!!.  I will only use this product and no other, I love 7 Second Eye Lift!!</li>
            <li> I didnt see any changes under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After trying eye creams at drug stores and finally breaking down and buying an expensive eye cream at Macy&#x27;s, this product is the only one that has given visible results and in the shortest time!  I used the whole jar of the expensive one as I was advised by the beauty consultant and noticed next to nothing other than moisturizing. No diminished lines or improvement in dark circles. After two days of the 7 second eye lift my eyes are brighter and smoother and younger looking. I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. I noticed it the first day and the second day confirmed it! I am 45 and a mother of 4 and I believe that stress has an effect on my appearance when it comes to signs of aging. I am very pleased and recommend you at least try this product. It is inexpensive and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one week and see no difference.  Don&#x27;t plan on purchasing this again, this is so NOT the &amp;#34;Best Eye Cream&amp;#34; - I find Neutrogena does a much better job.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a miracle I wish I could afford to slather my whole face with it.  I have tried just about everything on the market when I heard good reviews about this I thought why not.  I have never regretted that decision.  My wrinkles around my eyes are almost completely gone after just two weeks.  I must have more.</li>
            <li> does not last and is a little weak and does not seem worth the money. And the tube is extremely small.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. Effects were fast and visible.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> product arrived empty.  must have been a return from a customer that somehow mistakenly was sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;cannot rate this product  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would do what it says. Boy was I surprised. Been using this for few days now and I see no result. I actually bought mine from the actual company, They said on their site call if you have any questions, I did ,,got no answer.&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions, nothing but my receipt. Very disappointed in the whole thing. We as consumers should really do our home work on such items before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product was tightening my skin the first few times I used it, especially on my eyelids.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, and I have been using this product every day for one month now.  I am continuing to use this product at night to moisturize the skin around my eyes, but I have stopped using it in the morning, as the oils in it caused my mascara to collect on the skin beneath my eyes, so I was having to deal with removing the black mascara several times a day.  I do not have this problem with any of the other eye or face products I use...  If you are looking for a good eye moisturizer to apply at night, I can recommend it.  However, if, like me, you are looking for something to erase fine lines and wrinkles around your eyes, try something else!</li>
            <li> I did not experience the results as listed.  I&#x27;m using it with other products but won&#x27;t purchase it again. It&#x27;s not a bad product but an inexpensive eye cream if that interests you.  That was one of the reasons I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I have seen physical changes on my face and am pleased. I shall be going in for more soon. My friends want to know my secret.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me - it actually makes my eyes look scary and hag-like in the morning .  Even so I used up one tube to be fair - still scary.  I had to use a different eye cream in order to leave the house.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money for me. I used as directed and I saw no change. Products should not be sold knowing that&lt;br /&gt;it will not work for everone. Customers should be told that it may not work. Instead a guaranteed was place on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very sorry. Good luck to you all. I applied for a refund.</li>
            <li> I tried it for  few weeks and I am very happy with results, had a chance to compare with other products, I even put it on one eye initially to see a difference, it was noticeable. Highly recommend for mature skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month now and I don&#x27;t see any results. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not work! Now using Neutrogena rapid eye cream which is much better!! Definitely do not recommend this product. A waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is .25 of product, most eye creams are .50&lt;br /&gt;That makes this expensive for not having anything special in it&lt;br /&gt;It produces no results in 7 seconds&lt;br /&gt;There are several more complete and affordable eyecreams out there, Babyface, Nevonia&lt;br /&gt;This is not even moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time hassle and money, its a gimmick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;ve used other under eye creams that I thought had better results.  Not bad, but not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Cream has smooth texture, glides on easy, tightens and lifts. No fragrance. Good Product for low cost would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first time using the 7 second Eye Lift I didn&#x27;t notice a different in how my eyes normally looked. . With each use it began to look somewhat better . I suppose it just take time to get the full benefit of what it is suppose to do. I don&#x27;t use eye cream every day so that may have something to do with it.</li>
            <li> I love the 7 Second Eye Lift - Under Eye Cream but the tube is small and doesn&#x27;t last long for the price .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks. Has made a difference with fine lines around my eyes. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my eyes are very sensitive and it makes me a little itchy but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the products fault. Just not great for me, I have issues.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the slightest results. Feels good going on. But just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing anything. Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used the 7 Second Eye Lift cream now for one month and have noticed a reduction in the crows feet around my eyes. I recommend this product and I will be ordering more for myself.</li>
            <li> Makes eyes look well rested.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale and I keep seeing promos about it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really doing much to erase my under-eye circles but they haven&#x27;t gotten any worse so I guess that&#x27;s good.  Don&#x27;t plan to buy it again though!</li>
            <li> As most women I&#x27;ve used almost everything,but nothing as good as this.  This is my second day using this product.  I am 61 yrs. Young, now my eyes look younger.  I am amazed at the difference, the sagging upper eye is tightening already.  The wrinkles under my eyes is almost non existent, the crows feet are diminishing.  I just ordered another so I don&#x27;t run out.  And you don&#x27;t use a lot of product.  Give it a try, what have you got to lose but old wrinkled, sagging eyes.  I very rarely write a review, so I must really love this product.....&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and the results improve with use. I&#x27;m sold on it and will continue using it, even have my husband on board. No more droopy eyelids for him either.</li>
            <li> The product did not meed my expectations. I used the product for 3 weeks and saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase in the future or recommend to anyone. The tub is also very small for the price.</li>
            <li> It works better than any thing I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not to be honest.  I think I notice less wrinkles the first time I use it in the morning, it&#x27;s hard to tell, there was such a small amount for the price, so no I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for over 2 months now and have seen no improvement in the lines around my eyes. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.</li>
            <li> not a major noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> Okay, would not really recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure where all these positive reviews came from, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  It&#x27;s expensive for no results.  Will not buy again.</li>
