            <li>The Clear line by Image is great!</li>

            <li>Fast shipping, great service, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I started using this product with my Clarisonic and the Image Total Skin Lightening Serum and Bio Peptide Cream, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne off and on for many years (even now I&#x27;m 44)</li>

            <li>I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the most abrasive scrub</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive and definitely does a great job!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Buy this and buy &amp;#34;The Magic Pads&amp;#34;(glycolic acid and aloe),also available on amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks good luck</li>
            <li>the seasalt is pretty sparse but feels nice.</li>
            <li>Good product for really getting that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feel fresh, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle, yet super effective - leaves my skin feeling smoother than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>This helped clean up my skin significantly.</li>
            <li>It does dry out your skin so have some great moisturizer to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this product, 3 times a week is good, then work yourself up to daily.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day after I wash my face with a mild cleanser...</li>
            <li>I never had acne until I became pregnant with my daughter in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of success with these products,</li>
            <li>Even after four years of use (always in conjunction with their Daily Matte Moisturizer and sometimes with the Clear Cell Toner when I can remember to be a particularly responsible adult), I continue to be impressed with how this product has improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 20s and have very mild acne.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant so it is one of the few products available that I can safely use.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Image Clear Cell products.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this from my esthetician.</li>
            <li>This Acne Scrub contains 3% Benzoyl Peroxide - which is more than enough to work!</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this item was from the spa where I get my facials.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.The only face wash that clears my acne.</li>
            <li>Love the entire line of Image skin care.</li>
            <li>sure to use a white wash cloth, towel, pillowcase, and anything else.</li>
            <li>Do the trial size options first if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much $$ up front.</li>
            <li>An esthetician recommended Image Clear Cell to me in 2011 and I saw (and FELT) results quickly.</li>
            <li>What a difference!My confidence has skyrocketed thanks to these two products</li>
            <li>and it really helps to refresh my skin and unclog my pores without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>Works very well on oily skin.</li>
            <li>I was very worried this might irritate my acne prone skin</li>
            <li>it felt like I was pouring acid on my face; the burning was so intense before I even had a chance to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have moderate acne, mostly on my jawline.</li>
            <li>To clean deeply the dirt of the whole day.</li>
            <li>After washing with this, I use a very gentle and natural toner and moisturizer (the Earth Science Naturals line).</li>
            <li>I rotate this medicated gentle scrub with a more abrasive all natural oatmeal based scrub every  other day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and acne-prone, and this has improved it so much.</li>
            <li>The benzoyl peroxide gets the extra dirt and oil right out of your skin.</li>
            <li>Image is a great skincare line but some of their products are harsh so start slow if it&#x27;s your first time using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried proactive and other expensive skin care products but the Image Clear Cell and Vital C line is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I found this product in conjunction with Image Clear Cell</li>
            <li>; If you have skin issues, please consider giving Image Clear Cell a try.</li>
            <li>but since using this product acne is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and nothing works.</li>
            <li>The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li>Its working wonders so far.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash, it&#x27;s expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Recently, I got a facial (my first one) and the esthetician reccomended this to me.</li>
            <li>It does dry out skin quite a bit if you use too much.</li>
            <li>it does not dry out my 50+ year old skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very gritty, so would not recommend it if you have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>this actually helped a lot to keep my skin clear!</li>
            <li>I oftentimes think that it&#x27;s STILL improving - skin tone evening out, general complexion glowing, etc.</li>
            <li>I only use Image Clear Cell products and have never had a problem before</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is extra sensitive but as soon as I used this</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin and it has helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m still waiting on it to remove a few of the cystic pimples I had when i first started using it.</li>
            <li>no more small break outs, still getting larger ones but Image Clear cell clears the blemish within a couple days. :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the other products I listed in my regiment.</li>
            <li>I spent a decade looking for something that would clear up my skin.</li>

            <li> at first my skin was a little dry</li>
            <li> After trying the Gel Cleanser, Lotion, and Toner, I was curious to try the facial scrub as well.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day, just to avoid irritating my skin with too much medication.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a single breakout.</li>
            <li> After using the product from amazon, there was something different about the consistency and the smell seemed less medicated.  </li>
            <li> During application, I like to wet my face, rub it in and let it sit for 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know who I will buy this from the next go round.</li>
            <li> I use just a little daily or every other day before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting other products as well.</li>
            <li> I though my hormones would settle down and the acne would go away.</li>
            <li> but this lasted me about a month and a half to two months - and it works</li>
            <li> It is a very active product, so it my take a little while for you to adjust to it</li>
            <li> Been using for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and my acne is almost all gone.</li>
            <li> Zits DRAMATICALLY less noticeable overnight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin and have used everything dermatologists have given me for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> and it loses its potency or what?  </li>
            <li> so maybe it was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and acne-prone, and this has improved it so much. Haven&#x27;t had a single breakout. I only use it once a day, just to avoid irritating my skin with too much medication. The scrub is gentle, yet super effective - leaves my skin feeling smoother than it has ever been. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. After washing with this, I use a very gentle and natural toner and moisturizer (the Earth Science Naturals line).</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, EVERYDAY. I first purchased this from my esthetician. If you are looking for a cleanser that you can &#x27;feel&#x27; working this is it. The benzoyl peroxide gets the extra dirt and oil right out of your skin. During application, I like to wet my face, rub it in and let it sit for 15-20 seconds. It feels great! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to use as an exfoliant - the seasalt is pretty sparse but feels nice. For those who have acne prone skin and need something to fight breakouts - get it! I know it&#x27;s pricey but this lasted me about a month and a half to two months - and it works so it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*BTW* This Acne Scrub contains 3% Benzoyl Peroxide - which is more than enough to work! Also keep in mind this can lighten fabrics.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 20s and have very mild acne.  I started using this product with my Clarisonic and the Image Total Skin Lightening Serum and Bio Peptide Cream, and my skin looks great! I highly recommend this product and the other products I listed in my regiment.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I had a facial several weeks ago and she recommend this product line. I have struggled with acne off and on for many years (even now I&#x27;m 44) but since using this product acne is almost completely gone. It does dry out skin quite a bit if you use too much. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this item was from the spa where I get my facials.  After using the product from amazon, there was something different about the consistency and the smell seemed less medicated.  I don&#x27;t know if that is because it is stored on a shelf somewhere and it loses its potency or what?  No adverse effects so maybe I am just overthinking it.  Don&#x27;t know who I will buy this from the next go round.</li>
            <li> Awesome and strong acne product if you struggle with severe breakouts.  This product does tingle but you can feel it killing the bacteria!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.The only face wash that clears my acne.You will not be dissapointed in this one!Smells great as well.Believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.Buy this and buy &amp;#34;The Magic Pads&amp;#34;(glycolic acid and aloe),also available on amazon.What a difference!My confidence has skyrocketed thanks to these two products :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> Buy, use it. Your face will look better. That is all I have to say about that.  Thanks good luck</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have moderate acne, mostly on my jawline. Recently, I got a facial (my first one) and the esthetician reccomended this to me. I have been using it for about 2 months now and i love it! I use it twice a day after I wash my face with a mild cleanser... at first my skin was a little dry but after about a week it got used to it. The reason I gave this facewash 4 stars rather than 5 is because it IS preventing breakouts but i&#x27;m still waiting on it to remove a few of the cystic pimples I had when i first started using it. I would reccomend this to anyone struggling with acne!</li>
            <li> I bought this in error thinking was the face wash which I had used before. I decided to stay with it and love it. I use just a little daily or every other day before going to bed. To clean deeply the dirt of the whole day. Been using for a little over a month a I see such of posive improvement. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does not dry my skin and it has helped with my acne. I am pregnant so it is one of the few products available that I can safely use.</li>
            <li> I like to use this as a facial scrub even though it says it is for acne.  it does not dry out my 50+ year old skin.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect spot treatment. Zits DRAMATICALLY less noticeable overnight!</li>
            <li> Works great and makes your skin feel great and clean. You will not be disappointed. I recommend getting other products as well.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant. I use it every couple of days and it really helps to refresh my skin and unclog my pores without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Works very well on oily skin. Breaks up oil, dirt, and make up. Dries out blemishes. Removes dead skin. Skin glows afterwards.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product to me. I have adult acne and nothing works. this actually helped a lot to keep my skin clear!</li>
            <li> I like that this cleanser is exfoliating and has the acne-buster BP (benzyl peroxide) in it. I think this stuff has really helped keep my acne at bay since my esthetician recommended it to me a few months ago. Sometimes I combine it with Image&#x27;s Salicylic gel cleanser to harness the benefits of both ingredients. Image is a great skincare line but some of their products are harsh so start slow if it&#x27;s your first time using them. For this product, 3 times a week is good, then work yourself up to daily.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised.  Love the entire line of Image skin care.</li>
            <li> I never had acne until I became pregnant with my daughter in my 30&#x27;s. After her birth I though my hormones would settle down and the acne would go away. It didn&#x27;t. I found this product in conjunction with Image Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser has cleared up my face. It is a very active product, so it my take a little while for you to adjust to it but it works.</li>
            <li> The Clear line by Image is great! Just what I needed and at such a good price. This helped clean up my skin significantly. It does dry out your skin so have some great moisturizer to use.&lt;br /&gt;**Make sure to use a white wash cloth, towel, pillowcase, and anything else. The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, it&#x27;s expensive but worth the money. The only thing is that is used to come in a bigger bottle and doesn&#x27;t come anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now it is so nice for it to come to me. I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the most abrasive scrub but when i use it i can feel it is making a difference. I have been using it for a few weeks now and my acne is almost all gone. I rotate this medicated gentle scrub with a more abrasive all natural oatmeal based scrub every  other day. Its working wonders so far.</li>
            <li> I spent a decade looking for something that would clear up my skin. I tried EVERYTHING from over-the-counter products to Proactiv to tea tree oil to blah blah blah. An esthetician recommended Image Clear Cell to me in 2011 and I saw (and FELT) results quickly. It felt like a miracle. Even after four years of use (always in conjunction with their Daily Matte Moisturizer and sometimes with the Clear Cell Toner when I can remember to be a particularly responsible adult), I continue to be impressed with how this product has improved my skin. I oftentimes think that it&#x27;s STILL improving - skin tone evening out, general complexion glowing, etc. I sometimes forget whether I&#x27;m wearing make up or not. &amp;#34;...Did I sleep in make up last ni- Oh, wait, nope. That&#x27;s just my AMAZING SKIN this morning. Wooooow~~~&amp;#34; If you have skin issues, please consider giving Image Clear Cell a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! It leaves your skin feel fresh, clean and healthy. It&#x27;s almost like brushing your teeth but for your skin. I was very worried this might irritate my acne prone skin but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve tried proactive and other expensive skin care products but the Image Clear Cell and Vital C line is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is extra sensitive but as soon as I used this it felt like I was pouring acid on my face; the burning was so intense before I even had a chance to rub it in. I only use Image Clear Cell products and have never had a problem before so maybe it was a bad batch? Definitely sticking to the gel cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
            <li> Good product for really getting that clean feeling.  It is very gritty, so would not recommend it if you have very sensitive skin.  Great for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Fast shipping, great service, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Image Clear Cell products. After trying the Gel Cleanser, Lotion, and Toner, I was curious to try the facial scrub as well. So far so good! Love this scrub! Not too abrasive and definitely does a great job! I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin and have used everything dermatologists have given me for the past 10 years. Now at 24, I need something to work! If your up for a change, go with this product. Do the trial size options first if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much $$ up front. I&#x27;m having a lot of success with these products, no more small break outs, still getting larger ones but Image Clear cell clears the blemish within a couple days. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product I used it all the time.</li>
