            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I wish they packaged better, but I found that you just have to be smarter than the bottle!</li>
            <li>I can feel how primer creates nice layer</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not something I&#x27;d use every day because it&#x27;s kind of gunky.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has done a good job making a primer that goes on smoothly and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with  pink undertones, and this one is the best match.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it</li>
            <li>most is that my eyeliner no longer smudges.  </li>
            <li>I love eyeliner, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Works OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>Again, a 1/3 the price of the one I had been wearing for many years.  </li>
            <li>However, that said, I love this.</li>
            <li>Much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I have already recommended this to a lot of friends :)</li>
            <li>It a safe buy.</li>
            <li>This is the best primer that I have found, and I&#x27;ve tried several (Smashbox, Revlon, etc.)  </li>
            <li>I have bought eyelid primers from Sephora, which were well over $25.00, but I found that this one worked much better.</li>
            <li>Eye make up looks soft, smudge free, perfect all day.</li>
            <li>does the job ok.</li>
            <li>If you wanna buy it, make sure the color works for you.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids and had great expectations about this one</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>I tried this based on mostly favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>so now i don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it and not being able to find it.  </li>
            <li>- it keeps eye shadows set and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>the shadow is easy to apply on top of it.</li>
            <li>I think this is more to keep powdered shadows in place than it is to cover and smooth crepe-y eyelid skin.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and it is better than going without any primer at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, smooth, and makes my makeup look so much better.</li>
            <li>This applies easily.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered two because saddly these are very size but believe me that this eye primer is really good despite its cheap price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and keeps my eyeshadow crease free for about 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>On the good side, it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor and didn&#x27;t run into my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and think it is great.  </li>
            <li>Too Faced eye primers which are fantastic</li>
            <li>This is a must have cheap eye-primer.</li>
            <li>Not as great as I expected,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Think i&#x27;ll have to go on high end and try the famous Nars eye primer.</li>
            <li>Only need a very light coating and no creases all day!</li>
            <li>in the long run I save on eye shadow and eye liner so it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a high-end brand when many reviewers stated that this product was as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>Great little primer.  </li>
            <li>it is a rare find.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to FINALLY have something that prevents my eye shadow from creasing.</li>
            <li>So for me it is totally worth it and</li>
            <li>It slips on easily and dries quickly to a  finish that is not heavy.  </li>
            <li>product goes right in the trash.</li>
            <li>The best thing for me is that it isn&#x27;t too dark or too yellow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only lose a few dollars if it didn&#x27;t work, but it worked great!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and no problems from it, another huge plus.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a primer</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more, but now the price has gone up....</li>
            <li>There are so many different varieties of primer on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an eye-primer, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>Elf eye primer is 10 times better and is only $1</li>
            <li>Not as good as the higher priced one I usually use.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products that were not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep certain mascaras from transferring to my browbone (I do have oily skin).</li>
            <li>This product has a good color, though it dries so fast that it&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
            <li>it stays on the whole day and or night.</li>
            <li>That really holds  even eye liner on.  </li>
            <li>but this works just as well and is much cheaper</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do any powders because they really bother my sinuses and make messes.</li>
            <li>It truly does allow your eye shadow to glide on, and it stays on so much longer.</li>
            <li>Get too much and end up wiping much of it off.</li>
            <li>and I did enjoy the personal note that was included in my order.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again..</li>
            <li>I really like this primer</li>
            <li>Dries fast</li>
            <li>It really holds your eyemake up and there is NO CREASE!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product worked really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Looks gross, old and toxic.., nothing like the one I get at the drug store which is smooth and creamy!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too thick which is good and</li>
            <li>but I have found many other eyelid primers that have a silkier feel.  </li>
            <li>I worried it may be to dark for my skin tone since I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones</li>
            <li>My eye shadow went on smoothly and stayed on all day with no creasing and nearly no fading.</li>
            <li>You have to smooth it on and let it dry before you put on your eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I purchased this so that my foundation wouldn&#x27;t crease in my main eye crease and under the eye.  </li>
            <li>I have older skin, so need heavier moisturizers which can wreak havoc with eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>May be good for Younger skin, but this seriously dried out my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; eyelids.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All other L&#x27;Oreal products I have used are fabulous.</li>
            <li>so was concerned about trying this new product.  </li>
            <li>When the product is new, it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry up so quick inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>I work long hours in a hospital where I often get hot and sweaty and my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t move!</li>
            <li>And I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>and I no longer have to deal with makeup collecting in my lid even when its hot outside.</li>
            <li>: I work in a hot environment with no AC and constantly sweating.</li>
            <li>I purchased this first of all because it was only $2.00 at the time, so I thought why not?</li>
            <li>The only other one I found that is better is a department store brand</li>
            <li>It feels as if I&#x27;ve tried every single one without success . . .</li>
            <li>As far as creases - doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I was scraping at the sides after only a week, which makes me wonder how much is really in there.  </li>
            <li>It was smoother and the consistency was not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness</li>
            <li>I use a smooth crayon eye shadow, Mally, it&#x27;s creamy, but when it dries during the day, my eyelids get stiff.</li>
            <li>It is the same colour as my skin and keeps my eye shadow looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Target, but they haven&#x27;t carried it for a long time - thanks Amazon for being the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it is more expensive (much) and a hassle to buy.  </li>
            <li>A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I worked it to much and it sort of became a dry powder mess that flaked off.</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;m not much of a make-up maven (generally don&#x27;t use much)</li>
            <li>Once the primer is on, it is barely seen.</li>
            <li>Simply great product - and so much less expensive than the well known fancy brand name product I had been wearing for years.  </li>
            <li>The lid with this product seemed to help my shadow last about 30 minutes longer than normal; I guess that is something, but perhaps not enough to merit a second time purchase.</li>
            <li>Also, when you get about halfway thru the bottle and you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore out, tightly close it and then put it in a sink of hot water for five minutes.</li>
            <li>I could barely get enough on the applicator to apply it.</li>
            <li>This primer was a huge disappointment considering all the positive reviews I read.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t do any powders because they really bother my sinuses and make messes.</li>
            <li> It truly does allow your eye shadow to glide on, and it stays on so much longer.</li>
            <li> Get too much and end up wiping much of it off.</li>
            <li> and I did enjoy the personal note that was included in my order.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again..</li>
            <li> I really like this primer</li>
            <li> Dries fast</li>
            <li> It really holds your eyemake up and there is NO CREASE!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product worked really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Looks gross, old and toxic.., nothing like the one I get at the drug store which is smooth and creamy!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thick which is good and</li>
            <li> but I have found many other eyelid primers that have a silkier feel.  </li>
            <li> I worried it may be to dark for my skin tone since I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones</li>
            <li> My eye shadow went on smoothly and stayed on all day with no creasing and nearly no fading.</li>
            <li> You have to smooth it on and let it dry before you put on your eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that my foundation wouldn&#x27;t crease in my main eye crease and under the eye.  </li>
            <li> I have older skin, so need heavier moisturizers which can wreak havoc with eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> May be good for Younger skin, but this seriously dried out my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; eyelids.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All other L&#x27;Oreal products I have used are fabulous.</li>
            <li> so was concerned about trying this new product.  </li>
            <li> When the product is new, it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry up so quick inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I work long hours in a hospital where I often get hot and sweaty and my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t move!</li>
            <li> And I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> and I no longer have to deal with makeup collecting in my lid even when its hot outside.</li>
            <li> : I work in a hot environment with no AC and constantly sweating.</li>
            <li> I purchased this first of all because it was only $2.00 at the time, so I thought why not?</li>
            <li> The only other one I found that is better is a department store brand</li>
            <li> It feels as if I&#x27;ve tried every single one without success . . .</li>
            <li> As far as creases - doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I was scraping at the sides after only a week, which makes me wonder how much is really in there.  </li>
            <li> It was smoother and the consistency was not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness</li>
            <li> I use a smooth crayon eye shadow, Mally, it&#x27;s creamy, but when it dries during the day, my eyelids get stiff.</li>
            <li> It is the same colour as my skin and keeps my eye shadow looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at Target, but they haven&#x27;t carried it for a long time - thanks Amazon for being the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it is more expensive (much) and a hassle to buy.  </li>
            <li> A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I worked it to much and it sort of became a dry powder mess that flaked off.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m not much of a make-up maven (generally don&#x27;t use much)</li>
            <li> Once the primer is on, it is barely seen.</li>
            <li> Simply great product - and so much less expensive than the well known fancy brand name product I had been wearing for years.  </li>
            <li> The lid with this product seemed to help my shadow last about 30 minutes longer than normal; I guess that is something, but perhaps not enough to merit a second time purchase.</li>
            <li> Also, when you get about halfway thru the bottle and you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore out, tightly close it and then put it in a sink of hot water for five minutes.</li>
            <li> I could barely get enough on the applicator to apply it.</li>
            <li> This primer was a huge disappointment considering all the positive reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is difficult to get every last drop of primer out of the tube, but I will take out the little plastic &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; and that allows me to move the wand around better to get it all!</li>
            <li> Alas, the only part of my entire body that is oily are my eyelids and most eye shadows and liner pencils would disappear after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not sure about the whole &amp;#34;suits</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> A few tips, though......be sure not to skimp and put on too thin of a layer.</li>
            <li> This is something I will continue to buy for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit strange, and it leaves a residue if I don&#x27;t rub it in all the way.</li>
            <li> and it was thick and often left lines on the edges of my eyes if I didn&#x27;t blend it in fast enough before it dried.  </li>
            <li> The next day I applied this product to one lid but not the other, just to compare.</li>
            <li> this definitely sticks out like badly matched concealer (it doesn&#x27;t matter as much when I anyway use foundation and concealer, but it can make the concealer I apply over it look much lighter).</li>
            <li> After opening the package, the liquid was completely caked up around the rim and the liquid was extremely dried out!</li>
            <li> In addition, if you have any loose tags of skin (sometimes my eyelids flake in the winter)</li>
            <li> Will last forever since so little is needed.</li>
            <li> Shade is as expected.</li>
            <li> Drying time is minimal.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely what I was looking for, it&#x27;s less messy than another product I had tried</li>
            <li> It worked just as I expected it to!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products.</li>
            <li> and I have creases on my lids due to my age, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference in preventing the smudging around my eyelid crease.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is I paid for, but I didn&#x27;t enough to put on my face.</li>
            <li> Just wish that they made it in a tube instead, it&#x27;s really hard to scrape the last chunk</li>
            <li> So not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big make-up wearer and while my Urban Decay (and other expensive brands)</li>
            <li> Will leave cakey splotches if you continue to mess with it after it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I hate eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t last and look like it did when you first applied it.</li>
            <li> in the little jar.  </li>
            <li> Also makes eye makeup removal easier, just a little baby oil.</li>
            <li> It left weird flakey patches on my finger and eyelids and made my eyelids feel dry.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on cakey, not smooth.</li>
            <li> The package may be small, but a tube typically lasts me 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It is really dried out and not easily applied.</li>
            <li> I get all day wear from my eye shadow with no more creasing, nor fading.</li>
            <li> This product did not extend the life of my eyeshadow past four hours.  </li>
            <li> One note, this is small container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s for my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and the base worked fine for me, so don&#x27;t be afraid to wear it if you have darker skin.  </li>
            <li> This comes out in clumps, which makes it hard to spread.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles, but I was hoping for at least 4 hour coverage.</li>
            <li> This primer sucks.</li>
            <li> With this stuff underneath, no more stiffness!</li>
            <li> But within weeks it will dry out and become chunky, making it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I hate to have a crease after a few hours</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with any L&#x27;Oreal Paris product.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work as i wish it had.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try this primer.</li>
            <li> this snags terribly and highlights that bit of the skin, instead of the opposite, which I</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> it was almost impossible to apply and blend.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my eyeshadow last even through my worst 12 hour shifts and even through my worst work outs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It keeps my eyeshadow on even overnight.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Once you put this on and the your eye make up...it stays on the whole day and or night.</li>
            <li> Works great, good price.</li>
            <li> This primer is the bomb.com.  What I love about it most is that my eyeliner no longer smudges.  I love eyeliner, but if I don&#x27;t use primer, I end up looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  I wore Elf eye shadow with this primer and it stayed on for hours.  I have dark skin and the base worked fine for me, so don&#x27;t be afraid to wear it if you have darker skin.  This is something I will continue to buy for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not as good as Avon Eye Primer in the little jar.  That really holds  even eye liner on.  All other L&#x27;Oreal products I have used are fabulous.</li>
            <li> After opening the package, the liquid was completely caked up around the rim and the liquid was extremely dried out! Looks gross, old and toxic.., nothing like the one I get at the drug store which is smooth and creamy!</li>
            <li> This product has a good color, though it dries so fast that it&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Great little primer.  Had been using urban decay for years but this works just as well and is much cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not something I&#x27;d use every day because it&#x27;s kind of gunky. Then again, I&#x27;m not much of a make-up maven (generally don&#x27;t use much) so it may be that I&#x27;m just not accustomed to feeling something coating my eyelids like this does. As far as creases - doesn&#x27;t work. I think this is more to keep powdered shadows in place than it is to cover and smooth crepe-y eyelid skin.</li>
            <li> Works OK.  I doubt I&#x27;d buy it again, however.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that my foundation wouldn&#x27;t crease in my main eye crease and under the eye.  This is perfect for that.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow.  I don&#x27;t do any powders because they really bother my sinuses and make messes. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> I hate eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t last and look like it did when you first applied it. This is the best &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found and it&#x27;s the cheapest too - can&#x27;t beat that!! I&#x27;ve used it with regular shadow, crayons and &amp;#34;pot&amp;#34; type shadows and this works well with all of them. Highly recommend it. I used to buy it at Target, but they haven&#x27;t carried it for a long time - thanks Amazon for being the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; place!!</li>
            <li> This works well. I worried it may be to dark for my skin tone since I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones but it blends in perfectly. I have oily skin and wear l&#x27;oreal Infallible 24hr eyeshadow and it does seem to help it stay put and last longer.</li>
            <li> Simply great product - and so much less expensive than the well known fancy brand name product I had been wearing for years.  And I have very sensitive eyes so was concerned about trying this new product.  It&#x27;s just great.  Again, a 1/3 the price of the one I had been wearing for many years.  It truly does allow your eye shadow to glide on, and it stays on so much longer.</li>
            <li> It dried so fast it was almost impossible to apply and blend.  It left weird flakey patches on my finger and eyelids and made my eyelids feel dry.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my eye shadow creasing or lasting, but I bought into the hype that I needed to apply a primer.  What a waste of my money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes right in the trash.</li>
            <li> When the product is new, it works like a dream. But within weeks it will dry out and become chunky, making it impossible to use. There are no cracks in the container or lid, so how it&#x27;s drying out is beyond me.</li>
            <li> This comes out in clumps, which makes it hard to spread. Get too much and end up wiping much of it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big make-up wearer and while my Urban Decay (and other expensive brands) make-up wearing friends cringed when I told them that I&#x27;d used the de-crease (purchasing it based on reviews and price) I like it.  It worked just as I expected it to!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive eyeshadow primers.  I hate to have a crease after a few hours and this solves my problem.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a primer so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products. However, that said, I love this. My eye shadow went on smoothly and stayed on all day with no creasing and nearly no fading.</li>
            <li> I loved this eye primer it seems to last and keep my eye makeup on all day.  I definately would buy this product again and i will recommend this to others..  The package arrived on time and was not damaged and I did enjoy the personal note that was included in my order.  Thanks again..</li>
            <li> It is really dried out and not easily applied. So not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I get all day wear from my eye shadow with no more creasing, nor fading. Keeps it looking perfect for 8 plus hours. This will be a staple for me now. I have older skin, so need heavier moisturizers which can wreak havoc with eye shadows. Not a problem anymore, even in humidity. I have sensitive skin, and no problems from it, another huge plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer with hopes that make up does not crease around my lids as well as retain my makeup on my eyes. I still have problem with make up fading away by end of work day but definitely do not have problem with makeup being stuck in crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply primer before applying my Estee Lauder eye shadow. I can feel how primer creates nice layer and I no longer have to deal with makeup collecting in my lid even when its hot outside. I really like this primer but now I have to find something that prevents eye shadow from disappearing throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2 months later: I work in a hot environment with no AC and constantly sweating. I wear this primer almost daily and there is still product in the bottle. No issues at all with make up collecting in my eye lid. Dries fast so I don&#x27;t have to wait to apply my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This primer was a huge disappointment considering all the positive reviews I read.  It is cheap, and it is better than going without any primer at all, I&#x27;ll give it that... but I found that it got clumpy after opening and I was scraping at the sides after only a week, which makes me wonder how much is really in there.  I don&#x27;t like the application brush at all, it just adds to the clumpiness, which means you have to blend a lot with your fingers and it was thick and often left lines on the edges of my eyes if I didn&#x27;t blend it in fast enough before it dried.  After giving it a solid try, I&#x27;m switching back to Milani Eyeshadow Primer, which is only 5 bucks at Walmart.  A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  Much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It really holds your eyemake up and there is NO CREASE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they sold this in ALL stores. it is a rare find. I have medium tan skin and this does NOT look pastey white on my lids.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; seller!</li>
            <li> Only need a very light coating and no creases all day! I work long hours in a hospital where I often get hot and sweaty and my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t move! Will last forever since so little is needed.</li>
            <li> The product does not prevent creasing as stated.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Not as good as the higher priced one I usually use.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well.  eye shadow stayed on all day and I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it because I have never used anything like this. I really liked it. It goes on very nicely and if you don&#x27;t disturb it until it dries, it works perfectly. The first time I tried it, I worked it to much and it sort of became a dry powder mess that flaked off. You have to smooth it on and let it dry before you put on your eye makeup. It works great to put on under your eye before you put on you highlighter too. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely what I was looking for, it&#x27;s less messy than another product I had tried and it makes my eyeshadow last even through my worst 12 hour shifts and even through my worst work outs. I have already recommended this to a lot of friends :)</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with any L&#x27;Oreal Paris product. It does exactly what it says. It a safe buy.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Does what it says. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its a great eyelid primer, but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry up so quick inside the bottle. There is no way to scoop out the rest of the product that gets stuck un the upper region of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to FINALLY have something that prevents my eye shadow from creasing. This is now a staple item in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, i&#x27;ve been using it for years. Just wish that they made it in a tube instead, it&#x27;s really hard to scrape the last chunk so there&#x27;s always around 1/6th of the bottle that remains before I have to toss it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and think it is great.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and keeps my eyeshadow crease free for about 12 hours.  It isn&#x27;t too thick which is good and the shadow is easy to apply on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It is the same colour as my skin and keeps my eye shadow looking fresh all day long. It also helps to keep certain mascaras from transferring to my browbone (I do have oily skin). I will continue to repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> Its alright but I have found many other eyelid primers that have a silkier feel.  I will use it until its gone, but I wont get it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer that I have found, and I&#x27;ve tried several (Smashbox, Revlon, etc.)  It slips on easily and dries quickly to a  finish that is not heavy.  The best thing for me is that it isn&#x27;t too dark or too yellow.  I have fair skin with  pink undertones, and this one is the best match.  Doesn&#x27;t change the color of my eyeshadow. I have used more expensive products that were not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> A Great Product!  I purchased this first of all because it was only $2.00 at the time, so I thought why not? I&#x27;d only lose a few dollars if it didn&#x27;t work, but it worked great!  I have bought eyelid primers from Sephora, which were well over $25.00, but I found that this one worked much better. It was smoother and the consistency was not heavy at all. Lasts all day, even when I work out and get all sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am close to 63 years and I have creases on my lids due to my age, but this works.  I will definitely buy more, but now the price has gone up....but I&#x27;m still buying it...</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use a smooth crayon eye shadow, Mally, it&#x27;s creamy, but when it dries during the day, my eyelids get stiff. With this stuff underneath, no more stiffness! Also makes eye makeup removal easier, just a little baby oil. Eye make up looks soft, smudge free, perfect all day. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  does the job ok.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  i was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness</li>
            <li> This product did not extend the life of my eyeshadow past four hours.  Goes on cakey, not smooth.</li>
            <li> It was too bright for me, I couldn&#x27;t return it. If you wanna buy it, make sure the color works for you.</li>
            <li> Shade is as expected.</li>
            <li> Provides a great base for eyeshadows</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids and had great expectations about this one but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work as i wish it had. Think i&#x27;ll have to go on high end and try the famous Nars eye primer.</li>
            <li> May be good for Younger skin, but this seriously dried out my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; eyelids. I&#x27;m 48. Gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two because saddly these are very size but believe me that this eye primer is really good despite its cheap price. I have had samples of UrbanDecay and Too Faced eye primers which are fantastic but these days I had low budget and decided to give it a try. I was not dissapointed thank God. This is a must have cheap eye-primer.</li>
            <li> There are so many different varieties of primer on the market. It feels as if I&#x27;ve tried every single one without success . . . until this one! L&#x27;Oreal has done a good job making a primer that goes on smoothly and stays on all day. The color seems to match well with all skin types. Once the primer is on, it is barely seen. Drying time is minimal. My eye shadows have never creased once since using this primer; even after an hour workout outdoors in 85% humidity! The package may be small, but a tube typically lasts me 3-4 months. Sometimes it is difficult to get every last drop of primer out of the tube, but I will take out the little plastic &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; and that allows me to move the wand around better to get it all! I recommend this one to all my friends. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try this primer.</li>
            <li> This will keep your eyeshadow on your eyelids!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and perfect! It&#x27;s easy to apply, smooth, and makes my makeup look so much better. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I tried this based on mostly favorable reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a high-end brand when many reviewers stated that this product was as good, if not better. I applied per directions and 2 hours later, my eyeshadow had creased into my lids. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles, but I was hoping for at least 4 hour coverage. The next day I applied this product to one lid but not the other, just to compare. The lid with this product seemed to help my shadow last about 30 minutes longer than normal; I guess that is something, but perhaps not enough to merit a second time purchase. On the good side, it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor and didn&#x27;t run into my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will. Will leave cakey splotches if you continue to mess with it after it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I expected, but it&#x27;s not bad. The texture is a bit strange, and it leaves a residue if I don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference in preventing the smudging around my eyelid crease. I guess it&#x27;s the thought that counts.</li>
            <li> Alas, the only part of my entire body that is oily are my eyelids and most eye shadows and liner pencils would disappear after a few hours.  This applies easily.  One note, this is small container so it doesn&#x27;t last long...But It Works.  So for me it is totally worth it and in the long run I save on eye shadow and eye liner so it&#x27;s a good deal. I can&#x27;t always find it at the drug store so I have it regularly shipped with Amazon Subscribe and Save so now i don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it and not being able to find it.  The only other one I found that is better is a department store brand and it is more expensive (much) and a hassle to buy.  Please Loreal...don&#x27;t discontinue!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Last all day! Great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I could never keep my eye shadow from creasing without it. A few tips, though......be sure not to skimp and put on too thin of a layer. Also, when you get about halfway thru the bottle and you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore out, tightly close it and then put it in a sink of hot water for five minutes. Take it out and shake it to the bottom...... All that was on the sides will melt to the bottom. When that doesn&#x27;t work anymore use a bent  q-tip to get some out. I wish they packaged better, but I found that you just have to be smarter than the bottle!</li>
            <li> works great!! No oiliness, no creasing</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an eye-primer, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to - it keeps eye shadows set and lasts most of the day. However I&#x27;m not sure about the whole &amp;#34;suits every skintone&amp;#34; pitch, as I&#x27;m Indian and have medium brown skin and this definitely sticks out like badly matched concealer (it doesn&#x27;t matter as much when I anyway use foundation and concealer, but it can make the concealer I apply over it look much lighter). In addition, if you have any loose tags of skin (sometimes my eyelids flake in the winter) this snags terribly and highlights that bit of the skin, instead of the opposite, which I quite disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the eyeshadow lasts. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s for my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> I could barely get enough on the applicator to apply it. Not sure what it is I paid for, but I didn&#x27;t enough to put on my face. Sad!</li>
            <li> This primer sucks. Elf eye primer is 10 times better and is only $1</li>
