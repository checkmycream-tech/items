            <li>but this backpack is so handy!</li>
            <li>Strong, heavy-duty, quality material and the perfect size to carry all of my hair tools ad supplies.</li>
            <li>Very easy to carry!</li>
            <li>Come on Zuca, you have a good idea, use quality material and stop expecting to get something from nothing.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I can pack most of stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have the zuca artist flyer (the bag that rolls) and is amazing but not for subway travel when I have to walk up steps.</li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>If the fabric were more durable, I could overlook the price somewhat and give it another star or 2 but in good conscience I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love love love this bag!</li>
            <li>so what I carry my tools in is very important.</li>
            <li>but over all, I love the item</li>
            <li>I love this bag.</li>
            <li>All the pockets are really large and the side where hot tools can go is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is also a great bag to start out with if your a new freelancer and looking for a bag to transport!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything fits so easy and organized my makeup better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to get things out.</li>
            <li>Overall a really great purchase</li>
            <li>You can also condense your makeup kit and fit all of your essentials for hair and makeup in this one bag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>back support that&#x27;s built in is amazing!</li>
            <li>Worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This bag is amazing I live in la and ride my bike so as a freelance hairstylist this is soo helpful getting from job to job.</li>
            <li>The large center pocket can hold lots of my tools (more than you would think) and it comes with 2 of the removable pouches which are great.</li>
            <li>Too big for me and too heavy and jet-pack like for me but has great spaces for blowdryers, curling irons, etc and includes some great zip bags that I use in my rolling zuca.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size bag; enough for the artist who carries all his or her tools and it wears comfortably as a backpack (although it is rather large for the shoulders).</li>
            <li>It can easily fit two smaller/thin hot tools.</li>
            <li>The two insert bags included are large enough to hold palettes and the zip compartments fit smaller accessories wonderfully.</li>
            <li>but this one is so organized it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought three other clear cases from the drugstore that fit in great, so I can really organize my stuff, then it&#x27;s just plug &amp; play for each gig.</li>
            <li>The bag itself is made really well and looks very clean and professional.</li>
            <li>and i can place most all my skin and eye prep products in this back pack</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Works for exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>I only do hair occasionally, so the hair pocket is great for paper towels, cleaning solvents, sponges &amp; cotton pads when not using hair tools - or I do like to bring an extra tote anyway, and this keeps my hands free to do</li>
            <li>Most of Zuca inserts and bags have a limited 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li>i have 10 large pouches</li>
            <li>and I really want the large Zuca roller bag</li>
            <li>And I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a truly versatile product.</li>
            <li>I got two more small bags and it is just right.</li>
            <li>If you are a freelancer I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bag.</li>
            <li>This backpack goes right on my back and the Saturday straps and</li>
            <li>The straps are actually really comfortable and it fits nicely on my back, which is not always the case as I have a short torso.</li>
            <li>bag is so professional and sleek!</li>
            <li>Holds more than any other bag of the same size.  </li>
            <li>It holds just about as much as my ZÃ¼ca Sport with out being to heavy, It has ample storage and organizing built in, and it has a thermal pocket for my hot tools and a pocket right next to it for cord storage.</li>
            <li>and I still have a little more room for extra things!</li>
            <li>The back is also constructed very well</li>
            <li>I chose this one because I can put all my hairstyling products and tools in one bag , so I don&#x27;t really have to carry different bags for different items.</li>
            <li>only the small pouches fit in ti ...</li>

            <li> Yes  the way its is designed is very ideal even for the non makeup artist, but don&#x27;t over pack it. It won&#x27;t last past the warranty. Most of Zuca inserts and bags have a limited 1 year warranty. for the price without shipping, Invest in a Tumi or someother bag. If the fabric were more durable, I could overlook the price somewhat and give it another star or 2 but in good conscience I can&#x27;t. Come on Zuca, you have a good idea, use quality material and stop expecting to get something from nothing.</li>

            <li> This bag is absolutely amazing! I am a freelance makeup artist and hairstylist so what I carry my tools in is very important. This bag is great if your a hair stylist because of the compartments. You can also condense your makeup kit and fit all of your essentials for hair and makeup in this one bag.&lt;br /&gt;I am also an artist that works in NYC so when I don&#x27;t feel like driving and want to hop on the subway this is the bag I reach for! I have the zuca artist flyer (the bag that rolls) and is amazing but not for subway travel when I have to walk up steps. This backpack goes right on my back and the Saturday straps and back support that&#x27;s built in is amazing! The back is also constructed very well so it keeps everything in place so the bag doesn&#x27;t pull on your back. If you are a freelancer I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bag. If your a makeup and hair fanatic and travel a lot with your Kit this is great too as a carry on! This is also a great bag to start out with if your a new freelancer and looking for a bag to transport!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is so professional and sleek! Any where you go with a zuca when working as a freelancer it turns heads and impresses people. Zuca is THE go to back for artists and hair stylists!</li>
            <li> I wish it came with wheels bc my back kills me carrying a backpack but this one is so organized it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Holds more than any other bag of the same size.  Worth the money. I got two more small bags and it is just right.</li>
