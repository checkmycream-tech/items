            <li>I love, love it.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than a pumice.</li>
            <li>I am able to feel the file to distinguish between the two grits; but for a non nail tech the grit numbers should be written on the specified sides of the file.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to keep my feet as smooth at home as well!</li>
            <li>I am buying the replacement heads now to make sure I keep this file at hand.</li>

            <li>It really works while you are in the shower and leaves your feet nice and smoothe.</li>
            <li>If you wear sandals or flip flops this file will get your heels and feet smooth.</li>
            <li>It has two sides - one with courser sandpapers and one with light sandpaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to using a Ped Egg or a similar type of product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years and find it to be the best in it&#x27;s class.  </li>
            <li>Bigger size, good quality and better handle.  </li>

            <li>I always use the most course side first and smooth it off with the finer grit paper.  </li>
            <li>QUick and easy.</li>
            <li>quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>It is pretty and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not any kind of special file, you&#x27;d be better off buying a cheaper one.  </li>
            <li>This file needs to be  replaced too often to get that quick removal.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and really sleek and clean.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>Handle is comfortable and it really does the job</li>
            <li>I love soft feet</li>
            <li>I use it right before I get out of the shower...</li>
            <li>This is far superior to similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>It is two sided tool, one  side more course, the other fine.</li>
            <li>First time I saw Opi Foot file was at a spa, used during the pedicure.</li>
            <li>I used so many different kinds for my dry/cracked feet</li>
            <li>and it was pretty pricey -</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about purchasing this at first, because how often can you find a product that perfectly mimics a pedicure?!</li>
            <li>Has  fingers indentation for an easier grip and leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So glad to find the same one that is used in the salon for pedicures.</li>
            <li>The OPI Professional Pedicure Foot File is amazing and subsequently I have not needed to pay for a pedicure since I started using it.</li>
            <li>think it would work even better if the files were concave to conform to the heel rather than convex, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the files are not rough enough to cause pain or irritation like other files or pumas stones, but definitely do an amazing job at getting smooth feet.</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite foot file because it leaves your feet silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause more calluses to erupt as a result of the typical abrasion that results from your everyday foot file.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off all the dead skin of your feet, fine side gives it a smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to move around</li>
            <li>I really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Note that I do not keep the file in the shower - when I get ready to take my shower</li>
            <li>I recommend it for those who have pedicure very often</li>
            <li>This compliments the cream callus softener very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the OPI foot file...</li>
            <li>After just a few uses my feet are now very smooth, not a callous in sight.  </li>
            <li>Much improved over the old one I had.  </li>
            <li>Works better as a tune up but takes forever to remove dead skin</li>
            <li>I have always taken good care of my feet, but could not rid my heels of small, deep cracks; ONE use of the OPI file eliminated them completely.  </li>
            <li>After using I give it a quick rinse and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li>This is big enough and so comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this foot file at the spa - I couldn&#x27;t believe how much gross was coming off....</li>
            <li>I used it dry instead of soaking the skin first because I wanted to feel where the rough skin was and can hear it work by the sound, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it cleans your feet and really smooth the skin in a very long lasting way.</li>
            <li>I even used right after a pedicure to keep my feet smooth, but was not successful.  </li>
            <li>To the point where I couldn&#x27;t wear sandals in the summer without having a professional pedicure done.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well this tool worked  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product twice so far.</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it regularly at home after I soak my feet.</li>
            <li>- I am a professional dancer on my toes for 6+ hours a day...</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t bend them as far as the norm, this file is big enough that it hits all the right spots on my feet.</li>
            <li>and it is so worth the cost over the other supposedly foot miracle products!</li>
            <li>Updated after trying a new metal file that takes the skin off 10x easier and left my foot feeling smoother.  </li>
            <li>About 15 minutes later when I&#x27;m through with my shower, I grab the file and do a quick rub down of the heels and sides of the ball of my feet where calluses tend to grow.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle but works second only to the dry foot microplane I use now.</li>
            <li>This works so well and is less harsh on one&#x27;s skin than many foot tools.  </li>
            <li>has two sides a high grit and lower to get those rough calluses off your feet.</li>
            <li>rough feet, they both said it felt like they were given new ones.</li>

            <li> I am able to feel the file to distinguish between the two grits; but for a non nail tech the grit numbers should be written on the specified sides of the file.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to keep my feet as smooth at home as well!</li>
            <li> I am buying the replacement heads now to make sure I keep this file at hand.</li>
            <li> I love how this works.</li>
            <li> Love it .....</li>
            <li> LOVE this file.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love my OPI pedicure foot file.</li>
            <li> A coarse side and a fine side are provided for a perfect result.</li>
            <li> The foot file has a large surface area and feels good in one&#x27;s hand</li>
            <li> Not like those cheap things they use in most salons.  </li>
            <li> this worked awesome to get rid of the rough patches on my heels.</li>
            <li> This file is very easy to use use with quick results.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Can be easily used in the shower or the bath tub.</li>
            <li> I put the file on the bath mat where I can easily reach it.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold / use.</li>
            <li> Easily cleans, just rinse off.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove the handle for a spare file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you are able to buy refills instead of having to buy the whole thing over again.</li>
            <li> This is a well made sturdy easy to use file.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Strong and spa like quality to it.</li>
            <li> The fine side is used like polisher.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I have used many different foot files and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Bottom of my feet is completely smooth after a couple of use.</li>
            <li> It really works while you are in the shower and leaves your feet nice and smoothe.</li>
            <li> If you wear sandals or flip flops this file will get your heels and feet smooth.</li>
            <li> It has two sides - one with courser sandpapers and one with light sandpaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to using a Ped Egg or a similar type of product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and find it to be the best in it&#x27;s class.  </li>
            <li> Bigger size, good quality and better handle.  </li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel as good at they do after a professional pedicure</li>
            <li> I always use the most course side first and smooth it off with the finer grit paper.  </li>
            <li> QUick and easy.</li>
            <li> quick and easy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is pretty and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not any kind of special file, you&#x27;d be better off buying a cheaper one.  </li>
            <li> This file needs to be  replaced too often to get that quick removal.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and really sleek and clean.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> Handle is comfortable and it really does the job</li>
            <li> I love soft feet</li>
            <li> I use it right before I get out of the shower...</li>
            <li> This is far superior to similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> It is two sided tool, one  side more course, the other fine.</li>
            <li> First time I saw Opi Foot file was at a spa, used during the pedicure.</li>
            <li> I used so many different kinds for my dry/cracked feet</li>
            <li> and it was pretty pricey -</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this at first, because how often can you find a product that perfectly mimics a pedicure?!</li>
            <li> Has  fingers indentation for an easier grip and leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So glad to find the same one that is used in the salon for pedicures.</li>
            <li> The OPI Professional Pedicure Foot File is amazing and subsequently I have not needed to pay for a pedicure since I started using it.</li>
            <li> think it would work even better if the files were concave to conform to the heel rather than convex, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the files are not rough enough to cause pain or irritation like other files or pumas stones, but definitely do an amazing job at getting smooth feet.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite foot file because it leaves your feet silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause more calluses to erupt as a result of the typical abrasion that results from your everyday foot file.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off all the dead skin of your feet, fine side gives it a smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes it much easier to move around</li>
            <li> I really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Note that I do not keep the file in the shower - when I get ready to take my shower</li>
            <li> I recommend it for those who have pedicure very often</li>
            <li> This compliments the cream callus softener very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the OPI foot file...</li>
            <li> After just a few uses my feet are now very smooth, not a callous in sight.  </li>
            <li> Much improved over the old one I had.  </li>
            <li> Works better as a tune up but takes forever to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> I have always taken good care of my feet, but could not rid my heels of small, deep cracks; ONE use of the OPI file eliminated them completely.  </li>
            <li> After using I give it a quick rinse and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This is big enough and so comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this foot file at the spa - I couldn&#x27;t believe how much gross was coming off....</li>
            <li> I used it dry instead of soaking the skin first because I wanted to feel where the rough skin was and can hear it work by the sound, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it cleans your feet and really smooth the skin in a very long lasting way.</li>
            <li> I even used right after a pedicure to keep my feet smooth, but was not successful.  </li>
            <li> To the point where I couldn&#x27;t wear sandals in the summer without having a professional pedicure done.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this tool worked  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice so far.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it regularly at home after I soak my feet.</li>
            <li> - I am a professional dancer on my toes for 6+ hours a day...</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t bend them as far as the norm, this file is big enough that it hits all the right spots on my feet.</li>
            <li> and it is so worth the cost over the other supposedly foot miracle products!</li>
            <li> Updated after trying a new metal file that takes the skin off 10x easier and left my foot feeling smoother.  </li>
            <li> About 15 minutes later when I&#x27;m through with my shower, I grab the file and do a quick rub down of the heels and sides of the ball of my feet where calluses tend to grow.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle but works second only to the dry foot microplane I use now.</li>
            <li> This works so well and is less harsh on one&#x27;s skin than many foot tools.  </li>
            <li> has two sides a high grit and lower to get those rough calluses off your feet.</li>
            <li> rough feet, they both said it felt like they were given new ones.</li>
            <li> I suggest you soak your foot first, dry and then use this and then rub in heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> The pads are replaceable, but last a long time.  </li>
            <li> but i like to use it outside on dry heels.  </li>
            <li> Has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I started off with extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li> My heels get dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> It only takes less than a minute to file, even without soaking, and you get the results just like done in the salon.</li>
            <li> Use it with the Healthy Hoof product to control dry painful skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> I had quite bad callous&#x27; on my feet and after one use they were ninety percent better.  </li>
            <li> Not much to it.</li>
            <li> it reminds you the nail file or sandpaper concept, but thankfully nothing that rough.</li>
            <li> I use the rough side to remove all the dirt/callus from the bottom and the sides of my heels/toes.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This file smooths out the rough spots!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no fun and not relaxing at ALL, but I never want to have to worry about a fungus again.</li>
            <li> This has two sides: one for taking the callus way down and one for smoothing the skin.</li>
            <li> Works amazing on my terrible feet.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday and still looks and work like when I bought it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less expensive pedicure files that I used in the past that didn&#x27;t do nearly as well as this gem.</li>
            <li> you are always wearing open shoes, and not pampering your feet daily, get callus / corn from bad shoes or neglect...</li>
            <li> It will not snap in half when you need to apply pressure for thick callouses.</li>
            <li> Took all dead skin off with one treatment!</li>
            <li> I was seriously spending a ridiculous amount of money getting a pedicure every weekend just to keep my heels in presentable shape until i bought this little gem.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that for the price it would come with at least on replacement head</li>
            <li> Gets icky after one use.</li>
            <li> and finally taking prescription oral medication (dangerous to your liver!)</li>
            <li> This is too expensive for them to buy for their salons.</li>
            <li> This is useless on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer embarrassed to wear sandals because my heels aren&#x27;t dry and terribly cracked.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST problem with dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I wasted tons of money on worthless diamoncell files, electric files, dangerous callus cutters etc.  </li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s so expensive but haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> This OPI File stays in the shower making it convenient to use and keep those ugly cracks and calluses from forming.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> This has always been my favorite foot file because it leaves your feet silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause more calluses to erupt as a result of the typical abrasion that results from your everyday foot file. This has two sides: one for taking the callus way down and one for smoothing the skin. Haven&#x27;t found one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do as well as this one does. I hate that it&#x27;s so expensive but haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> Not much to it. If you can work on your own feet, this is the tool for you.</li>
            <li> The perfect tool to keep heels soft in the summertime. Easy to use, easy to keep clean. OPI makes a great product!</li>
            <li> You need the handle to be able to use this product by yourself.  It makes it much easier to move around your foot.&lt;br /&gt;This gets all of the callous off.  Not like those cheap things they use in most salons.  This is too expensive for them to buy for their salons.</li>
            <li> This is the essential callous tool...awesome!</li>
            <li> This is useless on my feet.  I even used right after a pedicure to keep my feet smooth, but was not successful.  I was expecting much more.  Went to Sally&#x27;s &amp; got something much better.</li>
            <li> easy to use. Like the grip. This file takes off all the skin just like you would expect from a salon.  Updated after trying a new metal file that takes the skin off 10x easier and left my foot feeling smoother.  This file needs to be  replaced too often to get that quick removal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this file after a pedicure and haven&#x27;t had a need for anything else.    I started off with extremely dry feet.  To the point where I couldn&#x27;t wear sandals in the summer without having a professional pedicure done.  After I started regular use of this product, I saw results by the end of week 1.  Now I use it from 1 - 2 times a week and my feet don&#x27;t look like they used to.  I am no longer embarrassed to wear sandals because my heels aren&#x27;t dry and terribly cracked.</li>
            <li> My nail tech uses this tool during my pedis.  This is a great product and great value; lasts FOREVER...easy to use and has a large handle so you can go to town scrubbing in the shower!</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This foot file is a wonderful and easy way to keep your feet baby soft. Can be easily used in the shower or the bath tub. Use once or twice a week to keep your feet in great condition. Also separately listed elsewhere on the site is a softening AHA foot cream that works in conjunction with the file.</li>
            <li> Took all dead skin off with one treatment!</li>
            <li> I have used many different foot files and this one is by far the best.  Bigger size, good quality and better handle.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot file.  I tried to get rid of calluses on my feet for years and within three days my feet looked great.</li>
            <li> This file is amazing and I use it all the time. I have purchased two of them. My feet have never looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;Also a great transaction. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> My pedicurist uses these and had to get one.</li>
            <li> After having contracted a toenail fungus from a pedicure at a local nail &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; and going through laser treatments (didn&#x27;t work!) and finally taking prescription oral medication (dangerous to your liver!) I now do my own pedicures. It&#x27;s no fun and not relaxing at ALL, but I never want to have to worry about a fungus again. I am so glad that I found this pedicure foot file! It&#x27;s a great tool. I run some warm water into the tub, then stand in it while I shower. About 15 minutes later when I&#x27;m through with my shower, I grab the file and do a quick rub down of the heels and sides of the ball of my feet where calluses tend to grow. I&#x27;ve had less expensive pedicure files that I used in the past that didn&#x27;t do nearly as well as this gem. Note that I do not keep the file in the shower - when I get ready to take my shower I put the file on the bath mat where I can easily reach it. After using I give it a quick rinse and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well reducing calluses. Bottom of my feet is completely smooth after a couple of use. I used it dry instead of soaking the skin first because I wanted to feel where the rough skin was and can hear it work by the sound, too.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work even better if the files were concave to conform to the heel rather than convex, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> Nice for home pedicure</li>
            <li> First time I saw Opi Foot file was at a spa, used during the pedicure. I came home and looked on Amazon, found it, immediately ordered a couple, one as gift for a friend, and one for myself..&lt;br /&gt;If you are always wearing open shoes, and not pampering your feet daily, get callus / corn from bad shoes or neglect... this is really good tool for you. it reminds you the nail file or sandpaper concept, but thankfully nothing that rough. It is two sided tool, one  side more course, the other fine. During the shower/bath, or as your feet nicely soaked in water, is the best time to use it. I use the rough side to remove all the dirt/callus from the bottom and the sides of my heels/toes. The fine side is used like polisher. After rinsing off all the dead skin of your feet, fine side gives it a smooth feeling. Easy to hold / use. Easily cleans, just rinse off. You can order a refill. Good product, recommend to those who wear a lot of sandals.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this Foot File and I have purchased it for myself, my mom, sister and mother-in-law. It really works while you are in the shower and leaves your feet nice and smoothe.</li>
            <li> This foot file is a must have for summer feet. If you wear sandals or flip flops this file will get your heels and feet smooth. Strong and spa like quality to it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Living in Hawaii, flip flops are the norm so feet are on display for most of the year.  This file smooths out the rough spots!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used so many different kinds for my dry/cracked feet and this is the best one so far. It only takes less than a minute to file, even without soaking, and you get the results just like done in the salon. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Strong and very effective product. I use it for my feet and like to use this after the shower but you can actually use it any time. Good to use lotion afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> Works better as a tune up but takes forever to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this tool worked  I am very happy with it. I do wish that for the price it would come with at least on replacement head</li>
            <li> The OPI file is perfect for callus removal. A coarse side and a fine side are provided for a perfect result. It is easy to remove the handle for a spare file.</li>
            <li> This is magical.  The best food scrub.  It makes my feet feel as good at they do after a professional pedicure</li>
            <li> This is just great and worth the money.  I even bought one of those plug in types - like a rotary sander for your feet and it was pretty pricey - but that thing scares me and I like this much, much better.</li>
            <li> The best tool for smooth feet ever made.  Use it with the Healthy Hoof product to control dry painful skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> Ok - this is TMI.  I have the WORST problem with dry cracked heels.  I where open heeled and open toed shoes a lot in the summer and i think it dries my feet out.  I was seriously spending a ridiculous amount of money getting a pedicure every weekend just to keep my heels in presentable shape until i bought this little gem.  Again, TMI - but i like to use it outside on dry heels.  I sit on my outside steps and go to town with this thing.  Its instant results and therefore instant gratification. It has two sides - one with courser sandpapers and one with light sandpaper. I always use the most course side first and smooth it off with the finer grit paper.  Then I smother my feet in lotion and Voila - beautiful heels.  i seriously LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Much improved over the old one I had.  Handle is comfortable and it really does the job well.  I love soft feet</li>
            <li> Excellent product!, it cleans your feet and really smooth the skin in a very long lasting way.</li>
            <li> this worked awesome to get rid of the rough patches on my heels. QUick and easy. has two sides a high grit and lower to get those rough calluses off your feet.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice so far. I love, love it. I will be buying it again. It is so much better than a pumice.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this in the tub and I use one too. It works best while foot is under hot water and just sand away. Its very gentle but works second only to the dry foot microplane I use now. Both are awesome !</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I would recommend it, the product just didn&#x27;t fulfill my needs. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but it may work for you. I didn&#x27;t get the desired outcome. Also being a nailtech I am able to feel the file to distinguish between the two grits; but for a non nail tech the grit numbers should be written on the specified sides of the file.Try it out for yourself..</li>
            <li> Works amazing on my terrible feet. Recommended by the technician I go to for my pedicures and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s nice that you are able to buy refills instead of having to buy the whole thing over again.</li>
            <li> My heels get dry and cracked. I experienced this scrubber when I had a pedicure. I really like it and use it regularly at home after I soak my feet.</li>
            <li> This is a well made sturdy easy to use file. It will not snap in half when you need to apply pressure for thick callouses.</li>
            <li> Love this file! It was always used when I got pedicures and I wanted to keep my feet as smooth at home as well! Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> This file is effective, however the 2nd time I went to use it, the rough paper came sliding off, rendering it useless.  It&#x27;s really not any kind of special file, you&#x27;d be better off buying a cheaper one.  Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to store it in the shower, as the moisture might contribute to the adhesion problem.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, good price and product. Easy to use. I use it right before I get out of the shower...quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This file worked wonders on my brothers rough feet, they both said it felt like they were given new ones. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is the most effective and most comfortable product for your feet bar none!  I wasted tons of money on worthless diamoncell files, electric files, dangerous callus cutters etc.  This is big enough and so comfortable to hold I do not find myself scraping my knuckles while positioning my feet.  It is pretty and easy to clean.  I am buying the replacement heads now to make sure I keep this file at hand.</li>
            <li> I had a pedicure and the salon used this file, and I just had to order one&lt;br /&gt;to use at home.  One for my husband and daughter as well.</li>
            <li> This works so well and is less harsh on one&#x27;s skin than many foot tools.  It leaves a very smooth skin surface that lasts.  I suggest you soak your foot first, dry and then use this and then rub in heavy cream.  The pads are replaceable, but last a long time.  The foot file has a large surface area and feels good in one&#x27;s hand</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this at first, because how often can you find a product that perfectly mimics a pedicure?! The OPI Professional Pedicure Foot File is amazing and subsequently I have not needed to pay for a pedicure since I started using it. It is easy to use and the files are not rough enough to cause pain or irritation like other files or pumas stones, but definitely do an amazing job at getting smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best file.&lt;br /&gt;My spa person uses this file and I am well pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to enjoy a pedicure at home with great results.</li>
            <li> i discovered this years ago, and have ordered them over and over again.  i have on in my shower at all times!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and she likes it!</li>
            <li> The best tool for smooth feet!</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use. Has  fingers indentation for an easier grip and leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Better than that cheese grater they use at the salon!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the OPI foot file on the recommendation of my best friend, and I am SO glad I did!  I have always taken good care of my feet, but could not rid my heels of small, deep cracks; ONE use of the OPI file eliminated them completely.  My feet haven&#x27;t looked or felt this good since I started wearing heels 15 years ago.  I highly recommend the OPI foot file...you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for the pedicure, very good price, timely delivering. I recommend it for those who have pedicure very often</li>
            <li> This compliments the cream callus softener very well. So easy to use and really sleek and clean. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great tool to help with exfoliation. This will be good for home pedicure or easing time between visit to get a pedicure done.</li>
            <li> I love how this works. It&#x27;s a great alternative to using a Ped Egg or a similar type of product.</li>
            <li> This file is the best I have ever found. I have 2 knees replaced so I can&#x27;t bend them as far as the norm, this file is big enough that it hits all the right spots on my feet. It does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> The best thing on the market and it is so worth the cost over the other supposedly foot miracle products!</li>
            <li> Love it ..... My feet feel like baby s bottom .... Will recommend it to all !!! Wish I didt have change the gritt but I use it everyday and still looks and work like when I bought it</li>
            <li> Works well. Has lasted a long time. I don&#x27;t store it in the shower. That may help.</li>
            <li> This are excellent for keeping the bottom of your feet in good shape.  I have used them for several years and can&#x27;t do without one!</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my feet. Gets icky after one use.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file you will ever need. Both sides work and your done in no time. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is very, very effective, and does not leave raggedy skin as some foot files do.</li>
            <li> LOVE this file. So glad to find the same one that is used in the salon for pedicures. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and find it to be the best in it&#x27;s class.  This OPI File stays in the shower making it convenient to use and keep those ugly cracks and calluses from forming.  Also, this file is good for over 2 years and you can order replacements that fit on the handle.</li>
            <li> Good quality file. I purchased the calluse remover too.  They make a good pair.  It worked well by itself.  Good for in between salon treatment.  Used with the calluse remover is like going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this foot file at the spa - I couldn&#x27;t believe how much gross was coming off.... had to have one for myself - I am a professional dancer on my toes for 6+ hours a day... this file is great! I keep it in the shower, and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing your heels after microplaning them.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love this.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST foot file I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> This file is very easy to use use with quick results.  I had quite bad callous&#x27; on my feet and after one use they were ninety percent better.  After just a few uses my feet are now very smooth, not a callous in sight.  A definite must have!</li>
            <li> Item just like pictured. Immediate shipping! Great transaction. Will come back!</li>
            <li> This is just what you need for those at-home pedicures.  I use mine about once per week and it&#x27;s amazing!  Get&#x27;s the job done quickly.  This is far superior to similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> Love my OPI pedicure foot file. Would not have anything else.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything like this file.  It works so good I think I am going to order one for the special ladies in my life so they can experience this amazing file too!</li>
