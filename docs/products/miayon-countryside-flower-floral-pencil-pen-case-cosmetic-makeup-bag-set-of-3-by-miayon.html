            <li>But overall and amazing product!</li>
            <li>Many women were interested in my review of this product.</li>
            <li>These were pretty cute.</li>
            <li>But not falling apart right away, so fine.  </li>
            <li>I did enjoy the laugh though.</li>
            <li>The material is good, not luxury material, but that is obvious for the price point.</li>
            <li>They are super cute but obviously made from very cheap material.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i would cute nice pencil cases for different functions in college.</li>
            <li>Overall, great quality, lots of room, but small enough to fit into a packed backpack, beautiful designs and detail, and super durable.</li>
            <li>There is a tag sewn on the outside with a nice quote.  </li>
            <li>ti wasn&#x27;t worth the time and price.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the bags are super cute, and I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I am in many social groups/clubs where we focus on make up and beauty items.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty roomy.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t really complane because the prize tells it all !</li>
            <li>The label on the front has typos on it, which is funny to me</li>
            <li>&quot; instead of \\&quot;Lifestyle\\&quot; like I first read it as....</li>
            <li>The print on each bag is really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>too.they look exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Cute and versatile obviously</li>
            <li>34;What sunshine to is flowers Smiles to are humanity.&amp;#34; Gave me a nice chuckle, and left me wondering if that is really the spelling of the name of the company, but make sure you read carefully before you buy!</li>
            <li>Great Quality and arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li>Came bigger than I expected which is great in my case</li>
            <li>The only cheap part about it is the leather pull on the zipper, but for this price it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>but honestly I wouldnt expecg anything less for the price.</li>
            <li>Fine for the price...low price, low quality.  </li>
            <li>Well if you click, and look real close, you can see the writing underneath of &amp;#34;lifesYtle&amp;#34; reads &amp;#</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>i received then really fast.</li>
            <li>They look nice and hold the usual pen and highlighter that you need for class but wooden pencils don’t fit.</li>
            <li>I personally love these little bags.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and cute but I don’t think they will last too long.</li>
            <li>They are really cute and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>You can hold pencils or small cosmetics. :)</li>
            <li>The quote is funny, next time</li>
            <li>great size - plus use the other bags to different trinkets usually lost in my purse.</li>
            <li>Sure it was cheap but mine arrived looking a bit dirty..</li>
            <li>unless youvwanna wait several months for some cheaply made bags go ahead but its not worth it.</li>
            <li>These are cute, but I expected them to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li>The inside lining is like a hot pink with white polka dots.</li>
            <li>The zippers are little stiff when opening ans closing, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I was hoping (I&#x27;m horrible with measurements) but super cute and really inexpensive!</li>

            <li> Cute and not as poorly constructed as I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I finally got it loose with some wiggling and pulling, but FYI.</li>
            <li> They are little exactly what I needed to keep just a little makeup in my gym bag, work bag and diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Took long time to ship.</li>
            <li> For the long ass time it took to arrive</li>
            <li> Just a little head ups, though, because they are definitely smaller than they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very durable.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the zipper</li>
            <li> They can be used for makeup and other things as well.</li>
            <li> and small items such as hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did take a little longer than usual to receive, but not a major long time.</li>
            <li> The English on the front of them was wrong though, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li> The English translation was a little confused on one bag.  </li>
            <li> Poor English....</li>
            <li> There are quite a few loose stitches which are actually pretty annoying and</li>
            <li> used inside my purse to keep small objects from rolling around and getting lost.</li>
            <li> and they are kinda small</li>
            <li> They are really small and all the words are miss spelled!</li>
            <li> I like these bags a lot, but they are very small!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impress I was a little scare to get a bad product</li>
            <li> Label are written wrong.</li>
            <li> The tags have an unfortunate word jumble.</li>
            <li> they had some random brown spots even though they were packaged.</li>

            <li> Very cute - the insides are a nice touch! The only cheap part about it is the leather pull on the zipper, but for this price it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Love them. Great Quality and arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Looks cheapish but still cute. The inside lining is like a hot pink with white polka dots. Awesome for the price</li>
            <li> Ordered these cases, and they were nice. Design was nice. Notice how the images don&#x27;t let you zoom in? Well if you click, and look real close, you can see the writing underneath of &amp;#34;lifesYtle&amp;#34; reads &amp;#34;What sunshine to is flowers Smiles to are humanity.&amp;#34; Gave me a nice chuckle, and left me wondering if that is really the spelling of the name of the company, but make sure you read carefully before you buy!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Came 6 days before the expected delievery, which surprised me. The zippers are little stiff when opening ans closing, but that&#x27;s okay. There are quite a few loose stitches which are actually pretty annoying and the grammar on the label is incorrect but honestly I wouldnt expecg anything less for the price. Just a little head ups, though, because they are definitely smaller than they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a oretty good deal. :)</li>
            <li> Thought these would be bigger</li>
            <li> I ordered this because all i could find at the stores where really huge pencil bags. I found these and i liked the price.  They are really cute n inexpensive.  Would order again!  Oh  n i received then really fast.</li>
            <li> So cute and such a great bargain! I gave two away and kept one. We&#x27;re all happy with them. They can be used for makeup and other things as well. All three colors are really cute! They&#x27;re pretty roomy. They arrived ahead of time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i would cute nice pencil cases for different functions in college. they also sent me a extra one 😊</li>
            <li> Label are written wrong.Poor English.... Spell check ?</li>
            <li> The bags don&#x27;t look like that they are very tiny ! But I can&#x27;t really complane because the prize tells it all !</li>
            <li> They are super cute but obviously made from very cheap material. They look nice and hold the usual pen and highlighter that you need for class but wooden pencils don’t fit. It helps to keep my stuff organized and I love the print on the front. I am glad I brought them. They are inexpensive and cute but I don’t think they will last too long. At 4 dollars aprox a piece I am not complaining!</li>
            <li> They were smaller then I hoped and there is a typo. But you get what you pay for, it was $2.77. They are really cute and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Fine for the price...low price, low quality.  But not falling apart right away, so fine.  The label on the front has typos on it, which is funny to me but you should know.  \\&quot;Lifesytle\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Lifestyle\\&quot; like I first read it as....\\&quot;What sunshine to is flowers smiles to are humanity\\&quot;  should be \\&quot;What sunshine is to flowers smiles are to humanity\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- one of the three bags had the lining stuck in the zipper.  I finally got it loose with some wiggling and pulling, but FYI.</li>
            <li> They do the job! They&#x27;re cute. You can hold pencils or small cosmetics. :)</li>
            <li> zipper broke soon after having it</li>
            <li> Very cute! The quote is funny, next time they should check their grammar though! But overall and amazing product!</li>
            <li> Re-ordered these. Good for travel, purses. and small items such as hair&lt;br /&gt;combs, device chargers, med vials, etc.</li>
            <li> Handy, but one of them had a zipper that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The print on each bag is really pretty.  There is a tag sewn on the outside with a nice quote.  The English translation was a little confused on one bag.  I did enjoy the laugh though.</li>
            <li> Love these use for coupons and extras in purse love them</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected. Was just perfect to fit all my items. Came bigger than I expected which is great in my case (I&#x27;m an art students and I have a lot of pens,pencils, etc) so no room to complain there. Overall, great quality, lots of room, but small enough to fit into a packed backpack, beautiful designs and detail, and super durable. Will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impress I was a little scare to get a bad product but no there are ok . I like them and they are exactly as the picture really nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. What I was looking for.  Only problem is the text typo.</li>
            <li> I personally love these little bags. I think they are cute and hold what I need just fine. I am in many social groups/clubs where we focus on make up and beauty items. Many women were interested in my review of this product. They did take a little longer than usual to receive, but not a major long time. For the price point, it is fair to say that you would consider that they are probably manufactured overseas, and that is something I considered. Overall, I think the bags are super cute, and I would buy again. The material is good, not luxury material, but that is obvious for the price point. It was an informed decision to buy these and I would do it again. This was not a purchase in which I received a discount, this is my own honest opinion of said product.</li>
            <li> They  are ok.  Not very durable.  Took long time to ship.</li>
            <li> Cute and not as poorly constructed as I expected for the price. The tags have an unfortunate word jumble.</li>
            <li> These were pretty cute. The English on the front of them was wrong though, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li> Totally cute, well made, great price, lot&#x27;s of uses.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, however for the price if you just want to keep a couple lipsticks separate they are ok</li>
            <li> I placed my order of Feb 19th and its now April 3rd it was supposed to be here yesterday. Nothing... My advice unless youvwanna wait several months for some cheaply made bags go ahead but its not worth it.</li>
            <li> all my make-up pencils fit along with mascara - nice colors great size - plus use the other bags to different trinkets usually lost in my purse.</li>
            <li> Cute and great price! Handy for de-clutter of my handbag too.they look exactly as pictured. I got a second set.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I used these as one of the things in my bridesmaids gifts and i put a bracelet inside of them. They were great and my bridesmaids loveed them</li>
            <li> used inside my purse to keep small objects from rolling around and getting lost. they are simple and do their intended job.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the zipper and they are kinda small</li>
            <li> Cute and versatile obviously but the zipper breaks really easily. You get what you pay for, of course.</li>
            <li> These are cute, but I expected them to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> They are really small and all the words are miss spelled! Who did the QA for this product? The cloth pattern is cute though.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I was hoping (I&#x27;m horrible with measurements) but super cute and really inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I like these bags a lot, but they are very small!</li>
            <li> The text on the front of these is in chinglish. Gave me a good laugh.</li>
            <li> very cute and well made.</li>
            <li> Very adorable. They are little exactly what I needed to keep just a little makeup in my gym bag, work bag and diaper bag.</li>
            <li> For the long ass time it took to arrive ti wasn&#x27;t worth the time and price. Sure it was cheap but mine arrived looking a bit dirty.. they had some random brown spots even though they were packaged.</li>
            <li> Great giveaway gift!... I bought these to give away as a favor in my bridal shower. The colors are cute and the bags themselves are very cute too. The quality could be better but I think it is ok for the price. The size is perfect for carrying any sort of stuff from pencils to make up or whatever. I think these will be very useful to my girlfriends. Happy with my purchase!</li>
