            <li>/&gt;Found this one - reviews were good</li>
            <li>It works as well as the Carmen and at a good price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It has a on and off switch which is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect new condition.  </li>
            <li>Heats up nicely and works but VERY cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it makes my lashes look better overall.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is okay.</li>
            <li>Took more time that I like in the morning</li>
            <li>Love this and am ordering some for my mom and another friend ...</li>
            <li>I love this thing and am so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>It curls the lashes better than anything else that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>If you hold the curler by the top part it just falls off as does the silver band</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It seems like it is much better quality than the others too.  </li>
            <li>This curler has solid construction and has excellent heat.  </li>
            <li>Originally purchased in Japan and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the US.  </li>
            <li>The curl is amazing and really lasts!  </li>
            <li>Easily switch on to wait for it heat up (which is quick!).  </li>
            <li>I like the light that illuminates the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Immediately upon putting the batteries in the first time, the top cylinder would not stay on.  </li>
            <li>I have curled it the right before bed and have woken up to them still curled!</li>
            <li>but this curler is wonderful, don&#x27;t let the heat scare you and don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t resorted back to my good ole Shu Uemura and blow dryer.</li>
            <li>They also go through batteries super fast, as the heat has to be high for them to be effective.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant because I have not used a heated eyelash curler before, but it is so well made there is almost no way to hurt yourself with it!  </li>
            <li>I would like the curl to be more gradual and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Gets much warmer and much faster- very good thing - than other cheaper versions.  </li>
            <li>I keep going thru batteries because you have to leave it on soooo long until it gets warm</li>
            <li>I have worked as a professional makeup artist and strongly advise against this product.</li>
            <li>I have one just like it that has worked great for several years but the heating element can&#x27;t last forever!!!  </li>
            <li>The heat on this is very intense and there is a learning curve to using it.  </li>
            <li>but I guess now that I think about it, that could happen to any hot curler.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 3 years.</li>
            <li>At first I kept getting it to close to my eyelid</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating this review from 3 stars to 5 stars because I have used this almost daily for more than a year now</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts because I really like it!</li>
            <li>Curls lashes ok but the curl doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It curls very well of my very straight and stubborn eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>THIS HEATED EYELASH CURLER REALLY WORKS AND GETS HOT</li>
            <li>have bought many heated curlers over many years, and it is frustrating that none work just right.  </li>
            <li>You may be able to play around with it to lightly make small bends throughout the lash to make a curve.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>After much hesitation of spending money again on another heated eyelash curler, I decided to get it</li>
            <li>The problem is that the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; it produces is abrupt with the effect being more like an &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; than  a &amp;#34;(&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too difficult to figure it out on your own, but it would have been nice to have some basic instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stand holding them for more than a few seconds...</li>
            <li>Most just have a place for one battery which doesn&#x27;t last very long and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s aggravating for something new to fall apart as soon as you get it.  </li>
            <li>and it still works like new</li>
            <li>The curl for me was a not a curl - more like a very sharp vee - a total  crimp in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I received this and it works on my 46 year old sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it very long - a few weeks, and it is working fine so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried various heated lash curlers but none heated hot enough or the design worked well enough.</li>

            <li> I have tried various heated lash curlers but none heated hot enough or the design worked well enough.</li>
            <li> I tried to very gently file the sharp plastic angle down to where it is not so sharp, and that has helped some, and I will have to practice where and how much pressure to put on my lashes to get a softer curve instead of a sharp crimp.</li>
            <li> Much too small for an American or European eye.  </li>
            <li> It gets quite hot very quickly, and I am a bit disappointed that others have commented on the batteries not lasting for very long.</li>
            <li> No longer available except in the UK but unable to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> This is made for someone w/huge eye sockets and long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> the ones I purchased form &amp;#34;Sally&amp;#34; get loose over a period of time.  </li>
            <li> I think one would also have to be careful with the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> SO BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful when curling your lashes but all in all</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because people&#x27;s complaints about other products seem to be that you have to keep holding it for the heat to be on, whereas this product has an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all those other curlers that pinch and hurt and do not work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this curler other</li>
            <li> If you throw the curler in a makeup bag, the switch may be turned on bumping against other objects in the bag -</li>
            <li> then the other battery operated ones</li>
            <li> I am still playing with it and combining it with other heated curlers to try to soften the effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Flimsy and not worth the price paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot, a little awkward trying to curl...</li>
            <li> Batteries run down and it does not curl lashes which is the thing it is supposed to do well.</li>
            <li> It is similar to one that I had many years ago &amp; had been unable to find a replacement until now!  YAY!!</li>
            <li> this product broke after less than a month of using it.</li>
            <li> I have now been using rechargeable batteries which makes me feels less wasteful.</li>
            <li> I gave this  4 stars instead of 5 stars which the reason why it does not fit over the eye as well as it should.  </li>
            <li> but after a few try&#x27;s I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> a little surprised and disappointed, the packaging and instructions were all in Japanese.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $40+ dollars!</li>
            <li> Sadly it is one of those gadgets that just sits in my bathroom drawer and stares back at me unused...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually leave reviews</li>
            <li> I have been using heated eyelash curlers for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Another small negative is that to place the bend at the very base, the flat part of the curler has to be pushed up against my cheek.</li>
            <li> I have used heated eye lash items before and I am replacing a broken one.  </li>
            <li> So it feels weird.  </li>
            <li> then it goes through batteries like crazy!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are stubborn and HATE to curl.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have packaging to return it, worst purchase I made online.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product wish they still made in US but still good quality</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I think Shu Uremura lashcurler is the best!</li>
            <li> love it works great!!! but everything is in Japanese  so know how to us it!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;It warm up so quick!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because people&#x27;s complaints about other products seem to be that you have to keep holding it for the heat to be on, whereas this product has an on/off switch.  Easily switch on to wait for it heat up (which is quick!).  I agree with another reviewer that the contact point is \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; not curved, so it creates a bend.  I personally like it because my lashes all point downwards, so I create a great bend at the base so now all the lashes point upwards.  You may be able to play around with it to lightly make small bends throughout the lash to make a curve.  Another small negative is that to place the bend at the very base, the flat part of the curler has to be pushed up against my cheek.</li>
            <li> I received this and it works on my 46 year old sparse lashes.  I have tried all those other curlers that pinch and hurt and do not work!&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are in chinese but figured it out!!!  Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this curler other then it goes through batteries like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is made for someone w/huge eye sockets and long eye lashes. I can&#x27;t even get it around my eyelid. What a waste of $40+ dollars! Sadly it is one of those gadgets that just sits in my bathroom drawer and stares back at me unused...</li>
            <li> Heats and curls great!</li>
            <li> Much too small for an American or European eye.  It burnt my eye and did not curl my eyelashes.  It is shipped from Japan and took weeks to receive.  Do not waste your money.  I have worked as a professional makeup artist and strongly advise against this product.</li>
            <li> It has a on and off switch which is a nice feature.  You do not have to hold while heating which is very nice.  I gave this  4 stars instead of 5 stars which the reason why it does not fit over the eye as well as it should.  So it feels weird.  I have used heated eye lash items before and I am replacing a broken one.  It curls very well of my very straight and stubborn eye lashes.  However the instructions and warranty is all in Japanese.  If they are going to sell this product over seas they should have instructions in English too.  since English is the international language.  I already know how to use a heated eye lash curler since I have already owned one and bought this to replace it.  But however their are consumers that buy products that do not know how it works.  That is how owner manuals and instructions help.</li>
            <li> Love it, curls my eyelashes perfectly</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot, a little awkward trying to curl...but it makes my lashes look better overall.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little surprised and disappointed, the packaging and instructions were all in Japanese. It&#x27;s not too difficult to figure it out on your own, but it would have been nice to have some basic instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/12/15 update...this product broke after less than a month of using it. I don&#x27;t have packaging to return it, worst purchase I made online.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 months</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is okay. I haven&#x27;t used it very long - a few weeks, and it is working fine so far. It gets quite hot very quickly, and I am a bit disappointed that others have commented on the batteries not lasting for very long. The curl for me was a not a curl - more like a very sharp vee - a total  crimp in my eyelashes. Yikes! I hope I didn&#x27;t damage them!  I tried to very gently file the sharp plastic angle down to where it is not so sharp, and that has helped some, and I will have to practice where and how much pressure to put on my lashes to get a softer curve instead of a sharp crimp. I think one would also have to be careful with the on/off switch. If you throw the curler in a makeup bag, the switch may be turned on bumping against other objects in the bag - but I guess now that I think about it, that could happen to any hot curler.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash curler.  I had another brand but I had to push up on a slide switch to heat it up.  Took more time that I like in the morning when I&#x27;m rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this one - reviews were good so I took a chance.  LOVE IT!  Just remember to turn it off after each use, or you will drain the batteries by the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Originally purchased in Japan and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the US.  Arrived in perfect new condition.  Works great.  Very happy w the product thank-you</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s my second one. The first one lasted me 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using heated eyelash curlers for at least 20 years.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.  The heat on this is very intense and there is a learning curve to using it.  At first I kept getting it to close to my eyelid but after a few try&#x27;s I got the hang of it.  The curl is amazing and really lasts!  Love this and am ordering some for my mom and another friend ... Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clone of the Carmen Heated Eyelash Curler, I&#x27;ve been trying to get one for years. It works as well as the Carmen and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  I have one just like it that has worked great for several years but the heating element can&#x27;t last forever!!!  I am so happy to have found a replacement because I thought that heated eyelash curlers might be a passing fad . . . here today, gone tomorrow!!!  Fad or not, I have mine!!</li>
            <li> THIS HEATED EYELASH CURLER REALLY WORKS AND GETS HOT SO BE CAREFUL BUT IT WORKS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this curler!!!! Don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but this curler is wonderful, don&#x27;t let the heat scare you and don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews. Try it for yourself!!!!</li>
            <li> AH-MAZZING!  My eyelashes are stubborn and HATE to curl.  The only way they would stay curled is if I heated my eyelash curler with my blow dryer, immediately curled them and put on waterproof mascara righhhhtt after. I have tried various heated lash curlers but none heated hot enough or the design worked well enough. After much hesitation of spending money again on another heated eyelash curler, I decided to get it and I haven&#x27;t resorted back to my good ole Shu Uemura and blow dryer. I love this thing and am so glad I found it.  I have curled it the right before bed and have woken up to them still curled! I wish I would post a picture!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this. At first, I was hesitant because I have not used a heated eyelash curler before, but it is so well made there is almost no way to hurt yourself with it!  It curls the lashes better than anything else that I have ever tried.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Flimsy and not worth the price paid for it. Batteries run down and it does not curl lashes which is the thing it is supposed to do well.</li>
            <li> This heated eyelash curler is wonderful!  It is similar to one that I had many years ago &amp; had been unable to find a replacement until now!  YAY!!</li>
            <li> Finally found some eyelash curlers like my discontinued carmen curlers... Heat up faster and hotter than carmen, very happy with them, no need stand holding them for more than a few seconds... Job done...Brilliant buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a well made product.  It arrived in the alloted time frame.  The directions were in Japanese, not English since it was a Japanese product.  I sent an e-mail to the company and the promptly responded on heat up time and when best it use it on the eyelashes and time frame of batteries.  Most just have a place for one battery which doesn&#x27;t last very long and the ones I purchased form &amp;#34;Sally&amp;#34; get loose over a period of time.  I like the light that illuminates the lashes.  Time will tell how it holds up.</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely and works but VERY cheaply made.  The handle has two slip on cylinders to cover the batteries.  Immediately upon putting the batteries in the first time, the top cylinder would not stay on.  If you hold the curler by the top part it just falls off as does the silver band so I just leave it off.  Like I said, it works well but it&#x27;s aggravating for something new to fall apart as soon as you get it.  UPDATE:  I&#x27;m updating this review from 3 stars to 5 stars because I have used this almost daily for more than a year now and it still works like new and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I had bought this eyelash curler about 12 years + ago from QVC and it lasted 10 years.  No longer available except in the UK but unable to purchase it.  When I checked out Amazon and found this, I just clicked on it and am now using this.  Absolutely love it.  The only thing is it gets warmer then the other battery operated ones so you have to be careful when curling your lashes but all in all, I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Gets much warmer and much faster- very good thing - than other cheaper versions.  It seems like it is much better quality than the others too.  I hope it lasts because I really like it!</li>
            <li> This curler has solid construction and has excellent heat.  The problem is that the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; it produces is abrupt with the effect being more like an &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; than  a &amp;#34;(&amp;#34;.  I would like the curl to be more gradual and natural looking. I am still playing with it and combining it with other heated curlers to try to soften the effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many heated curlers over many years, and it is frustrating that none work just right.  They also go through batteries super fast, as the heat has to be high for them to be effective.  I have now been using rechargeable batteries which makes me feels less wasteful.</li>
            <li> Curls lashes ok but the curl doesn&#x27;t last. After mascara is applied, lashes droop. Instructions are in japanese.Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already done this.  It does not work.  Does not heat up enough to curl lashes.  I keep going thru batteries because you have to leave it on soooo long until it gets warm</li>
