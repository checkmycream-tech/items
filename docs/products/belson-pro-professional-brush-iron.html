            <li>It is the perfect size for my hair, and it heats  very fast.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use...</li>
            <li>I love the iron, but the teeth break VERY easily....</li>
            <li>I do think that an automatic off switch would be nice, as well as the fact that the brushes seem to slide off awfully easy.</li>
            <li>But, for the price, I guess that it is OK.</li>
            <li>it is safe to use.</li>
            <li>Not bulky so easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Curling iron gets hot quickly, handle is easy to hold, brushes move thru hair easily, leaves you with a nice curl.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>For short hair it is great.</li>

            <li>The Belson Pro Brush Iron is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Belson!  </li>
            <li>Was very happy with this difficult to find electric iron.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot and stays hot; it also has choice of a high temp or lower temp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sometime the whole line of teeth fall out of the barrel..</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>had a different kind, in which the rows of bristles broke, caught my hair and was totally unsstisfactory</li>
            <li>This hot brush wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do anything for my hair and I returned it.</li>
            <li>Never heated up quite right... finally just died altogether.</li>
            <li>I can even put my bare hand around the barrel and not get burned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing it now because so many of the teeth have broken off.</li>
            <li>Love the size for my somewhat thin &amp; shorter hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather replace this product every 3-4 years then pay four times as much for a product that might last only a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The Belson Pro Brush Iron arrived a bit later than my text said when notified which caused a little issue, but it did arrive on the same day and about the same time they said it would.</li>

            <li> Apparently too late to return or exchange, so I&#x27;m out of luck..  </li>

            <li> No worth it hair tangles</li>
            <li> I have used Belson for a long time,and for the money you can not beat it, I have thin hair and short hair</li>
            <li> Big waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> The barrel of the curling iron was too small.</li>
            <li> HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed you cannot remove the plastic tips for cleaning but not a huge problem.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Apparently too late to return or exchange, so I&#x27;m out of luck..  I&#x27;ll see if I can find a Vidal Sassoon brush iron.</li>
            <li> I love the iron, but the teeth break VERY easily....sometime the whole line of teeth fall out of the barrel..</li>
            <li> I purchased a Belson Pro curling iron (model BP 2327) a couple of years ago for about $10. I&#x27;m replacing it now because so many of the teeth have broken off. My opinion is that despite this drawback, this is a good product. It gets hot and stays hot; it also has choice of a high temp or lower temp.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like that the machine does not have an automatic-off feature. I&#x27;d rather replace this product every 3-4 years then pay four times as much for a product that might last only a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> No worth it hair tangles</li>
            <li> The barrel of the curling iron was too small. It does not have automatic shut off.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Curling iron gets hot quickly, handle is easy to hold, brushes move thru hair easily, leaves you with a nice curl.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Does not catch my hair in the bristles.  Easy to clean.  Not bulky so easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a different kind, in which the rows of bristles broke, caught my hair and was totally unsstisfactory</li>
            <li> The Belson Pro Brush Iron is exactly what I wanted.  I have a tendency to burn myself with a regular curling iron, especially when I am in a hurry.  That is not a problem with the brush iron.  It is the perfect size for my hair, and it heats  very fast.  It is easy to use  and works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I had ordered the Belson Pro Bush Iron 3/4&amp;#34; with the blower (don&#x27;t know if that what you call it)  Maybe air brush?&lt;br /&gt;I wanted the one with the heated air brush. Do you have them?</li>
            <li> This hot brush wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do anything for my hair and I returned it. Was so disappointed because I really need a new hot brush.</li>
            <li> HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!  Doesn&#x27;t even get hot!!  Big waste of money!!  I can even put my bare hand around the barrel and not get burned. Thanks Belson!  Like I can afford this!!!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that the plastic spokes sometimes fall out.  Other than that, it performs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I do think that an automatic off switch would be nice, as well as the fact that the brushes seem to slide off awfully easy. But, for the price, I guess that it is OK. Very easy to use...</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works well. I was disappointed you cannot remove the plastic tips for cleaning but not a huge problem. Reasonable price. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Gripped hair well, but it does not heat up enough to curl hsitt. Quite disappointed. . Would have sent back but no longer have the package.</li>
            <li> The Belson Pro Brush Iron arrived a bit later than my text said when notified which caused a little issue, but it did arrive on the same day and about the same time they said it would. Just not when the text said and notified me that it had arrived.  This little brush iron is perfect for me because I have short and very fine hair.  This lets me put a little curl and body into my hair without making creases in it that a regular curling iron will do.</li>
            <li> Love the size for my somewhat thin &amp; shorter hairstyle.  Would buy another if this one wears out.  On button sometimes turns off while using it.</li>
            <li> Belson&#x27;s Pro Brush, 3/4 inch, works well on short hair.  When it comes to longer hair, be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I had to resort to scissors to clip my hair in order to untangle it.  Also, I assumed that that it worked like a curling iron.  It does not in that it does not blow air.  For short hair it is great.</li>
            <li> Never heated up quite right... finally just died altogether.</li>
            <li> I have used Belson for a long time,and for the money you can not beat it, I have thin hair and short hair it never burns my hair it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this difficult to find electric iron.  Perfect size and excellent price for this quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived within two days.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased. I wish I had ordered 2 because I would not have had to pay for shipping.</li>
