            <li>read the reviews--in general the reviews for Veet were slightly better than Nair--and hoped that the sensitive skin formulation might be okay.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for 9 minutes and all the hair wipes right off.  </li>
            <li>one day wait seems to buffer the chemical makeup and still do the job.i live in a very hot place and have to keep smooth and pretty allllll the time</li>

            <li> As someone who has sensitive skin and has had bad reactions to other products which are too harsh, I am happy with Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream sensitive formula that it works well without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nair sensitive formula for this area but the bottle is so small.  </li>
            <li> And my skin there felt extra irritated, like a slight sunburn.  </li>
            <li> First I put some thick moisturizing lotion on that area and rubbed it all in, waited a few minutes, and then applied the Veet.  </li>
            <li> It might be fine for other people with less sensitive skin, and granted, yes, it stinks, but it is that chemical that does the work of breaking down your hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I even tried leaving the gel on for a little over ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I go the pink veet bottle.</li>
            <li> I do not care as it is for my husband and pink is for</li>
            <li> I have been too nervous about a worse reaction to let the Veet sit for longer or to apply to a larger area or a sensitive area at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As my skin ages, it has become very sensitive and shaving was giving me serious razor burn.</li>
            <li> This may work well for he women, but men...use extreme caution</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the buy.</li>
            <li> There are few other products like this that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything stronger because I don&#x27;t like putting harsh chemicals on my pores.</li>
            <li> It misses a few spots but it does well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have suffered my whole life from horrible razor rash no matter what I&#x27;d tried when shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li> Totally the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I did follow the directions and tested a small area on my leg.  </li>
            <li> To late.</li>
            <li> I am hairless for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Took at least 24 hours to go away.  </li>
            <li> I tired it on a spot on my neck.</li>
            <li> made it worse</li>
            <li> So frustrating.</li>
            <li> When the soap hit where I used it, it started burning BAD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, for the stink and the chance of a bad reaction, I am not going to try this again.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product performance.  </li>
            <li> This works well to remove hair but the smell is awful.  </li>
            <li> Smells AWFUL!!!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Never will I use this product again. I was thinking great I can use this and not have to shave as much. GUYS...this is a warning for all of you. This may work well for he women, but men...use extreme caution o don&#x27;t use at all. I tired it on a spot on my neck. No problem. The I decided to use it on my on and around my private area. No problem at first. Wiped it off within 5 minutes as suggested on the bottle. It took of about 70% of it. then I took a shower. When the soap hit where I used it, it started burning BAD. At one point it felt that someone had cut me there with a knife. I have tried everything to sooth it. Antibiotic cream, cortisone, lotion... nothing helped. It made it burn worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made it worse I occasionally have a an allergic reaction to nickel on my stomach. Undoubtedly I have been having a reaction and didn&#x27;t know it. Some of the veet touched it so I wiped it off immediately. To late. Now that is also inflamed. I can&#x27;t find anything to stop the burning of that either. Never will I try this again. Now I wandering if I can return it. hmmmmm I&#x27;ll think more about that if I ever stop hurting.</li>
            <li> have used veet for years,allergic to bladed razors,hint for users_i see complaints about irritation,i wait a day after a good exfoliating scrub to legs and than veet. fresh washed skin is easy to irritate&amp;#62; pores are open&amp;#62; top layer of dead cells are gone,,a one day wait seems to buffer the chemical makeup and still do the job.i live in a very hot place and have to keep smooth and pretty allllll the time</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.  As someone who has sensitive skin and has had bad reactions to other products which are too harsh, I am happy with Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream sensitive formula that it works well without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This works well to remove hair but the smell is awful.  Only used once so far because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Totally the wrong product. I ordered the sensitive formula (light blue bottle pictured above). I go the pink veet bottle. Regular not sensitive. So frustrating. Not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have suffered my whole life from horrible razor rash no matter what I&#x27;d tried when shaving my legs.  I knew about hair removal creams, but was hesitant because I figured they would probably irritate my skin.  I finally decided to try some of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews--in general the reviews for Veet were slightly better than Nair--and hoped that the sensitive skin formulation might be okay.  I did follow the directions and tested a small area on my leg.  First I put some thick moisturizing lotion on that area and rubbed it all in, waited a few minutes, and then applied the Veet.  I let it sit for the minimum time before washing off.  It was not painful, but I did feel something going on.  However, only some of the hair came off, and some of it was not even at the skin, but well above the skin.  And my skin there felt extra irritated, like a slight sunburn.  I have been too nervous about a worse reaction to let the Veet sit for longer or to apply to a larger area or a sensitive area at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this sensitive formula definitely has a skunky smell.  (The main ingredient in this, as well as other hair removal products, is the chemical equivalent of skunk spray.)  I do not know what the regular formulation smells like, but several reviews note that it smells &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; (whatever that means).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for the stink and the chance of a bad reaction, I am not going to try this again.  Too bad.  It might be fine for other people with less sensitive skin, and granted, yes, it stinks, but it is that chemical that does the work of breaking down your hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to apply and it works great in very short time. It is good to have this Gel !</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product regularly.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as effective as it used to be. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything stronger because I don&#x27;t like putting harsh chemicals on my pores.</li>
            <li> The effect is not obvious!</li>
            <li> There are few other products like this that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Unfortunately like most great products this one has become discontinued in stores, so I will have to order it online. No big deal.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty good after using the cream, however it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the root of hair. Waxing probably stays longer.</li>
            <li> Do not buy any of the veet fast acting removers, way to harsh on the skin. I used it and broke out within 10 seconds of applying it and weeks later I&#x27;m breaking out and skin is bleeding. Those chemicals will damage your skin, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with patches of hair! I have fine, thin leg hair. Not thick at all. I even tried leaving the gel on for a little over ten minutes. Definitely not worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; aka the V-j-j and it is the best!  I leave it on for 9 minutes and all the hair wipes right off.  I used to use Nair sensitive formula for this area but the bottle is so small.  After trying this one because of the size difference I was actually happier with the formula.  If you leave it on for a second or two longer it does not burn you like the Nair one tends to do.  I am hairless for at least 2 weeks, this stuff is great, I don&#x27;t ever consider getting waxed again.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin red hot and look like I had a sunburn.  Took at least 24 hours to go away.  I would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good morning, buy this product and sent me pink, pink I do not care as it is for my husband and pink is for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
            <li> This does work in removing hair but the hair grows back quick, just like shaving. It does have a smell when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work but it did for me. It misses a few spots but it does well.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product performance.  Did not remove hair!!!!! Smells AWFUL!!!!!  Would not purchase again or recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> As my skin ages, it has become very sensitive and shaving was giving me serious razor burn. I tried Nair hair removal and it still gave me some burn. This one with Aloe does the job and it&#x27;s gently on my skin. This will be the one I&#x27;ll be buying from now on.</li>
            <li> Skin was red and tender after using.  Not all hair was removed. Remaining hair had a damaged look to it, I had to remove them with a raiser.</li>
