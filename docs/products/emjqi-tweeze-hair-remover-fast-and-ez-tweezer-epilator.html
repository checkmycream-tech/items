            <li>Feels good to have a smooth face!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent size,color and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The good part, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot and it gets stubborn unwanted hair on your face.</li>
            <li>work good for her</li>
            <li>Had one before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Works good on hair you can see and those you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Good products -- met my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I have a fairly hairy lip, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for the price.</li>
            <li>but over all I still say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I had bought the Tweeze about 7 years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good product should have got two</li>
            <li>Works good but after some use it no longer gets rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give one star because the product it self looks working and good for the price.</li>
            <li>not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Good wau to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to have good eyesight to get rid of the chin hairs.  </li>
            <li>Had a co-worker that let me use the tweezer and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I figure that for the price, I got four years of use--a really good deal.</li>
            <li>If you have problems holding tweezers, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and I have had mine for over 10 years and wanted to buy one for a gift and have another on hand for myself, if the first one met its demise!  </li>
            <li>I purchased one about a year ago and it died, so I was happy to be able to replace it.  </li>
            <li>My mother was very glad to get this item replaced.</li>
            <li>she is very pleased</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased!  </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>the results however are amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used to own one</li>
            <li>I own a Tweeze and wanted a back-up.  </li>
            <li>I tried hers and liked it so ordered my own.  </li>
            <li>I also bought one for my daughter and she is thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It does work alright but not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice not to have to worry about hairs on my chin for almost a week.</li>
            <li>This was not as good as the one that I had bought from Bed Bath and Beyond many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is not quite the quality as my original, even though it works great</li>
            <li>Great product.. keeps my face clean..</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says and at a very good price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it and going to buy 2  more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very good and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing tweezer ever.</li>
            <li>The best product I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It kind of hurts though and is better at grabbing longer hair.</li>
            <li>Received item very quickly!</li>
            <li>I have very fine mustache hair and the chemical doesn&#x27;t work well on very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This one works but does not do nearly as good as my original.  </li>
            <li>bought two of these one for myself and one for my daughter, does not work like the first one I bought from a TV commercial,that I paid $30.00 for that one was great.</li>
            <li>No pain and gets fine hairs as well!</li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic and</li>
            <li>No redness ,leaves skin very smooth...</li>
            <li>It works best with a fresh pair of batteries because then the motor runs very fast.</li>
            <li>We like it much better.  </li>
            <li>It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>way better than pulling out one hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be most beneficial in that it does meet expectations for the end result.  </li>
            <li>I will become more skilled with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>definitely safe thing to use on face...</li>
            <li>The perfect resolution to unwanted hair, even for the tender upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>She seems to love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Tweeze for over 5 years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and then it won&#x27;t hurt so much (more hair to tweeze&#x3D; more tingles of hair being</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores anymore</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it pulls out most of the hair.</li>
            <li>I love this EmjQi Tweeze.</li>
            <li>for smaller areas, yes, I was very happy with my purchase. :-)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Had a Tweeze for several years and always bragged that it was the best \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faster and does a much better job.</li>
            <li>It probably would be better to buy something with more tweezing blades in it</li>
            <li>love this product it works</li>
            <li>Not the best way to go when it comes to getting rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li>I love this because through the years I have been getting more mustache hairs.  </li>
            <li>great for people that don&#x27;t have a lot of time or don&#x27;t see very well.</li>
            <li>I have to do it again and again to make sure that is going to cut all hair from my face.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I can to have spares.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Worked better than the chemical hair remover I had been using.</li>
            <li>i love this.  </li>
            <li>love this&lt;br /&gt;Whe</li>
            <li>just love the Tweeze</li>
            <li>save your money for something better</li>
            <li>Not the best epilator out there, but it works well enough.  </li>
            <li>works better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>the best way to remove facial hair I have come accross in all my years of tweezing!</li>
            <li>and I love using it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was confident that this product would work, My mother wanted one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>my friend and her mother bought one too and they love em too</li>
            <li>I love having my wiskers plucked out by this machine.</li>
            <li>So glad amason had them...</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t really get to try it out all that great.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>then 2 uses at most</li>
            <li>when it was on t.v., it seems perhaps it had more grips or heads?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>And while it does it well, it is advertised as doing much more.</li>
            <li>no problem Just make sure you have batteries</li>
            <li>(you will need to replace them every 3 or so months if you use it more than once a week)</li>
            <li>I dropped it and one of the plastic tabs broke that hold the cover on, but I was able to continue using it for another year or so.</li>
            <li>It  does a wonderful job with next to no pain!  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It still works ok</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Makes the grooming process faster &amp; relatively more efficient but no epilator should cost over $10.00 in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but it does the job as long as you have the time, if it had more pully things it would be the best.</li>
            <li>However, it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it does a pretty darn good job</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Handy for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>fine ,but not on more course hair on legs or armpit</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to find it available for purchase.  </li>
            <li>but this one seems to be more cheaply made.</li>
            <li>But for a cheap price it works :)</li>
            <li>Free shipping would have made the purchase even better</li>
            <li>Pieces broke out of it, loved it so much that I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on good reviews so thanks for the review process, it helps buying things sight unseen.</li>
            <li>I was most pleased at your rapid response to my request and how quickly they arrived.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy hair removal that I use on my face!  </li>
            <li>The price was lower than I paid in the stores, and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is lubricated with oil and the oil will get on your face, but easily wipes off.</li>
            <li>This epilator works great, not amazing, but great.</li>
            <li>I love it to clean up my eyebrows and take care of my mustache</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using this product for easy removal of hair.</li>
            <li>but now it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>make sure skin is clean and just keep it taught.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it is easy.</li>
            <li>strong unit, wont break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how successful it was.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the original, more like cheap knockoffs that do not do the job.</li>
            <li>I, purchased a Tweeze when they new on the market, Loved it wanted to replace since it is wearing out.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is not for a man to use on his beard, it works on fine hairs.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and then was about 1/8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It removed some of the fine hairs but skipped a lot of them</li>
            <li>That being said, it works quickly and is sorta of like pulling tape off your face!</li>
            <li>Super duper!</li>
            <li>It is corded and more powerful.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over two years and will always have one available.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>hair lasts longer to grow and skin is realy smooth</li>
            <li>cheap price and a cheap product dont waist your time or money on this garbage.</li>
            <li>and I went on line to see if the product was still available.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughters and they love them and in the store they are so much more and these  are the same as in the store at a much better price love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately they are no longer available in retail.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I would have liked it or not since it never worked.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten a Tweeze from wal-mart a few years ago,And has been the best thing I had ever used.</li>
            <li>I am going ask for replacement only because this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever experienced this problem w/a tweeze.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a similar brand and it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4) easy to clean</li>
            <li>These are a cheap knock off and they don&#x27;t even remove the hair like the tweeze should.</li>
            <li>This works great for unwanted facial hair!!</li>
            <li>much cheaper than the &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; and probably just as effective.  </li>
            <li>found Emjoi Tweeze for dirt cheap and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>If you can pick up a Tweeze for cheap, give a go.</li>
            <li>you can use it anywhere on your body, but if it&#x27;s your first time trying it, try maybe your arm as there is a bit of pain, kind of like a quick needle poke, but you get use to it</li>
            <li>We fell in love with it right away.</li>
            <li>Good-bye to facial waxing, and hello to more money in my pocket !!</li>
            <li>It is very effective on all my excess facial hair.</li>
            <li>but I love this product very much.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is great for catching the long hairs that older women get on their chins.</li>
            <li>Love this this hair remover, had to replace the first one that I bought.</li>
            <li>It did sting at first, but not any more than plucking hairs one by one.  </li>
            <li>The Tweeze is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I need to use it 2 to 3 times longer than the original and still need to tweeze and/or shave the hairs</li>
            <li>Just gotta keep fresh batteries in it!</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>These were not sturdy or well made, like the original.</li>
            <li>My wife was excited to use it</li>
            <li>I thought the blade wheel was not quite as effective as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>You can feel it pulling \\&quot;tweezing34;, yet I wish it became as clean as waxing</li>
            <li>The price is right, it works, is easy to use.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27; t work as well as the older one and is made more cheaply.</li>
            <li>this product had such good reviews and i was so hoping it would work</li>
            <li>It really is  not as painful as some people make it out to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
            <li>My daughter is growing to love it as much as her mom.</li>
            <li>you really have to go over it many times.</li>
            <li>It is not painful</li>
            <li>This has been a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>For such an inexpensive item, its surprising how well them work.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I really expected the tweezing to hurt more, but I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>it goes through the batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>, it is a quick way to do lip if no time to wax.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have little dainty fine blond hairs, I have straight up whiskers.</li>
            <li>Thank you very, very much!</li>
            <li>It has always done a good job and the battery life is long.</li>
            <li>Lol didn&#x27;t know I had to push the button upwards not press it down.</li>
            <li>My original one I bought when they first came out lasted me 4 years</li>
            <li>Removes fine blond hair really well.</li>
            <li>great little compact devise.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  </li>
            <li>Overall,the product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>A useful tool if nothing else works.</li>
            <li>Beauty is worth it.</li>
            <li>But, then I tried to hold the skin taut and it was far better.</li>
            <li>All of the sudden it started on its own</li>
            <li>And I definitely know how to use an epilator since I already own one.</li>
            <li>I already have had several Tweezy Epilators and I liked them.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes there is a difference in performance even though I bought the same product at different times, but all of them are fairly efficient and remove all but the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this one works best and last longer.</li>
            <li>One thing: you&#x27;ll go through batteries pretty quickly on it.</li>
            <li>This little gadget does exactly what it says and I&#x27;m truly happy that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Other than that I would say this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>But these do not work right</li>
            <li>I read someone else&#x27;s review and they was right</li>
            <li>I keep mine right by the computer and do it all the time..</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts at first, but you kind of get used to it especially when there are fewer hairs to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very painful and works well for me.</li>
            <li>She said she loved the old one and that this is the same one she had.</li>
            <li>I have had an electric tweezer previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean too, and the battery last quite a while.</li>
            <li>The cap was already broken off and it didn&#x27;t work to good because I wasn&#x27;t able to get the cap to stay on.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>Like this very much.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one and I&#x27; m excited about this new version.</li>
            <li>I love being able to get rid of the hair on my upper lip and chin without having to pay the high price of professional waxing.  </li>
            <li>At first we had to learn how to use an epilator -</li>
            <li>Was pretty funny to go to baggage and</li>
            <li>I tried so many for upper lip and sideburns</li>
            <li>it took forever to figure out how to get it to work in the first place</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I had no issues with learning how to use it ( it is my first epilator ).</li>
            <li>Does not seem like the exact model I had before.  </li>
            <li>Does not work like the exact model I had before.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, it worked..</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered directly from the comppany has a smooth on/off switch.</li>
            <li>, I use it at least 2 times a week with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used this item, the screws started falling out and it didn&#x27;t even tweeze the hair....</li>
            <li>I tried many things on my facial hair</li>
            <li>The first one sent did not work at all.</li>
            <li>It works well and allows the user to be confident in not having those embarrassing stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li>At first item will not turn on eventually got it to work.</li>
            <li>second one in 10 year, just love it</li>
            <li>Using this is hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;First things first.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of chin and neck hairs that I would rather not think about, but this thing takes &#x27;em out pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Better than using regular tweezers.</li>
            <li>First one died after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to use it twice, from my experience</li>
            <li>I wore out the first one.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my legs first</li>
            <li>Perhaps the next step up is better?</li>
            <li>I had another product from same brand and was very satisfied until it developed rechargeable battery issues</li>
            <li>This was my first epi</li>
            <li>The price is so incredibly reasonable!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd one, I love it, it removes the hair from the root and it is faster than just tweezing.  </li>
            <li>it will remove those fast too!</li>
            <li>she wasn&#x27;t able to take our only Tweeze with her.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know how to turn it on.</li>
            <li>I had the first one for 4-5 years.</li>
            <li>I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>I am very unsattisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I had my first Tweezy for 4 years.</li>
            <li>Did not send back because it cost more to do that than throw item away.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive so, in fact, I just threw it out!  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Occasionally it will grab a stubborn or thicker hair with a bit of \\&quot;thunk\\&quot; making me flinch a bit more out of surprise than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  </li>
            <li>and you really cant pinpoint the hair you just have to go over and over where the hair is until you get the right angle</li>
            <li>Plus  if you do it right and make circular moves it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li>Works good on thin fine hair but for trying to do thicker hair</li>
            <li>I have never used a better product for tweezing large areas, such as neck and face.  </li>
            <li>What I received wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the quality as my original Tweeze.  </li>
            <li>With the vibration of the unit against my skin, I can barely feel the fine hair plucking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for removing the facial hair, just wish it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin so much</li>
            <li>Wish I could  order more of the clear plastic top, the little snaps break off.</li>
            <li>- this is my second one - they work great at getting rid of facial hair quick - only use about once a week</li>
            <li>It took too long (more than one month)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and would highly recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is not too dry or irritated before using the Tweeze or you could make yourself sore</li>
            <li>It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  </li>
            <li>Bought the first one when it was a hot new item.</li>
            <li>I would pass the epilator over some areas several times and the fine hairs would still be there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions suggested, I started by attempting to remove the fine hairs on the back of my hand/wrist area to get an idea of how the device felt.  </li>
            <li>The short fine ones remained in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get these little hairs that grow out along my ears, so this plucks them out nicely.</li>
            <li>However, I have not rated it very high, because that is really all it does.</li>
            <li>These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li>I really like it and want another one.  </li>
            <li>I do not know about the automatic tweeze&#x27;s, but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>IT VERY UPSET WITH THIS</li>
            <li>but because i have very course hair all it does is pull my hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>this is awsome product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>So much easier than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>So much easier than waxing without the pain.</li>
            <li>This was a joke really.</li>
            <li>but I would need to go over and over and over the same area to get things smooth.</li>
            <li>it is very noisy but works well getting all those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast way to remove hair.</li>
            <li>really works well.</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay,</li>
            <li>Shipped fastly</li>
            <li>It is fast and convenient and saves time and money.  </li>
            <li>It does not appear to be durable and although the package states that 2 AAA baterries are included, they are not (manufacturer&#x27;s fault and not so much the seller).</li>
            <li>Not expecting much for the money.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast though</li>
            <li>I so much appreciate the fact that you found them for me.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased one about 5 years ago and the motor on it was much stronger</li>
            <li>this tweezer really hanks at your hair</li>
            <li>got it for a birthday gift and the woman just loves it thanks</li>
            <li>I am satisfied that I got what I expected for the price though</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really pull any hair but it does pull a lot of your skin</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have gone thru so much stress regarding hair removal.</li>
            <li>like like I did - takes much to much time.  </li>
            <li>really fast,really clean..Does not pinch or pull.</li>
            <li>It works really well and really doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really get the hairs that I needed it too.</li>
            <li>This one product made me very leary about ordering anything else</li>
            <li>How much it will hurt really depends on the person.</li>
            <li>love this, takes the little hairs right off</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is my second one purchased-wore the first one out !!</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be a good purchase as a first epilator, I didn&#x27;t realize how little hair it would actually remove at a time.</li>
            <li>Not the same quality as the ones originally sold in stores.</li>
            <li>Good for very small areas</li>
            <li>I just ordered a new one because I kept dropping the old one (klutz I know) which eventually broke the clear cover, although I was able to use the product without the clear cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and</li>
            <li>I used it twice before it died, its not like i have a beard, i have fine hair but long around my lips an jaw line.</li>
            <li>So was very effective but definitely for smaller areas such as the upper lip, maybe part of the bikini line...if you are like me and are looking for something for underarms and legs, this is not the product for mostly because of the time it would take to cover those larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this very much for those wild hairs</li>
            <li>Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  </li>
            <li>and it is small and handy for travel.</li>
            <li>And the more you keep up on it, the less the you have to do it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and isn&#x27;t any more painful</li>
            <li>I had a older version of this model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, if suffer from the same condition as myself, you&#x27;re better off just getting laser treatment done because, not even an epilator can get rid of the embarrassment of facial hair.</li>
            <li>Who knew aging means more facial hair for women as their female hormones decrease?  </li>
            <li>Great little tool to get those stray hairs we women are subject to after we reach a certain age.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found if I use it right after I get out of the shower and my pores are open it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>That is highly convenient.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Very easy to use with very little cost.  </li>
            <li>I love this little guy.  </li>
            <li>Evenually one of the little tabs holding the top on broke off but that was just normal wear.  </li>
            <li>my age I get those hard long hairs on my lip and chin and this product works great</li>
            <li>Sure it may have gotten a few hairs</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that the item will probably not perform at initial level for a long time but am satisfied for now.</li>
            <li>have to have it at the right angle and go over and over an area to get individual hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom, and we were trying to make it pull out at least 1 hair, but really, I should have paid a little bit more and purchase a better one..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any female that struggles with light facial hair issues.</li>
            <li>I like the new On/Off button which doesn&#x27;t bump on so easily and run the battery down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to using the product so maybe with time</li>
            <li>Would not advise anyone to purchase this new version.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>But I can live with that.</li>
            <li>But I tried in 3 sets of brand new batteris.</li>
            <li>I thought I would buy new one before they discontinued them.</li>
            <li>I bought this for facial hair because I was tired of tweezing and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Very loud.</li>
            <li>i bought one for my friend recently for a funny gift exchange.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money and does alright as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting anything like shaving legs etc with it.</li>
            <li>I did manage to mostly remove a small circle of hair -- the longer, coarser hairs, that is.  </li>
            <li>It was nothing like my old one!  </li>
            <li>Purchased new one for lots less money, does same great job as previous.</li>
            <li>I had an original EmjQi and it was wonderful, this one is painful and harsh.</li>
            <li>This new Tweeze does not remove hair like the old one.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic item, I previously owned one and lost it.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have trouble getting the fine hairs though.</li>
            <li>actually works!&lt;br /&gt;3) pulls even the tiny fine white hairs on the surface of your face</li>
            <li>I need it to clear.</li>
            <li>So far though I&#x27;ve had a bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every day, and it really controls the facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair was be trimmed first if too long.</li>
            <li>Saves money on professional waxing.</li>
            <li>It is completely unusable, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive way to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my old worn out one.</li>
            <li>It met my expect ions completely.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s loud and sounds like an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Might hurt the first time, but minor.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li>It seems that I&#x27;m having to pluck nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I am surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second costing a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets more dead skin than actual hair..</li>
            <li>Perfect for annoying hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li>Slick, works quickly and I&#x27;m ready for work in no time at all.</li>
            <li>It works as described, I only whish it had at least two tweezer heads rotating, the one is okay</li>
            <li>But since I started using Tweeze my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little at times but worth it.</li>
            <li>Not worth returning it as it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li>I proabably will stick to shaving large areas like my long legs, &amp; I won&#x27;t use this on my upper lip or bikini area.</li>
            <li>it will work for general areas like the arm, armpit, cheek, chin.</li>
            <li>Grabs skin frequently even when held as taught as possible.</li>
            <li>This one barely pulls the eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>Pulls those little hairs out right now.  </li>
            <li>The previous versions of this product work a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>It can cause slight bleeding because the hairs are getting ripped out very fast.</li>
            <li>and it solved my mustache, beard, and face fuzz issues completely without the high cost of other methods that didn&#x27;t perform the results EZ Tweezer does.  </li>
            <li>Fast and minimal pain!</li>
            <li>comparison&#x27;s sake (for this review), I tried the device on my big toe, where the hair is still only about 1/8&amp;#34; long but much coarser.  </li>
            <li>Too bad it was a really compact and nice looking device</li>
            <li>but apparently they are made different now.</li>
            <li>At first I had to tweeze everyday.  </li>
            <li>I usually wax, but my facial hair grows really fast, by the next day after waxing I would see new hair growing in,</li>
            <li>So, I bought it for her, she tried it and it did not Tweeze a single hair, It would make loud noise, and it would smell like burnt rubber.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other cheap face epilators in the past and I&#x27;ve never had one that is new that works maybe 1 out of 3 tries.  </li>
            <li>Recently, due to serious arthritis wrist and hand issues, I gifted my hair stylist with one to use in exfoliating my invisible to me white facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget really works.</li>

            <li> I find this product very effective.  </li>
            <li> it is very nice to have</li>
            <li> hazardous in every way!</li>
            <li> Most excellent for us .</li>
            <li> Feels good to have a smooth face!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent size,color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The good part, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot and it gets stubborn unwanted hair on your face.</li>
            <li> work good for her</li>
            <li> Had one before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Works good on hair you can see and those you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Good products -- met my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I have a fairly hairy lip, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price.</li>
            <li> but over all I still say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I had bought the Tweeze about 7 years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good product should have got two</li>
            <li> Works good but after some use it no longer gets rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give one star because the product it self looks working and good for the price.</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Good wau to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have good eyesight to get rid of the chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> Had a co-worker that let me use the tweezer and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I figure that for the price, I got four years of use--a really good deal.</li>
            <li> If you have problems holding tweezers, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product and I have had mine for over 10 years and wanted to buy one for a gift and have another on hand for myself, if the first one met its demise!  </li>
            <li> I purchased one about a year ago and it died, so I was happy to be able to replace it.  </li>
            <li> My mother was very glad to get this item replaced.</li>
            <li> she is very pleased</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality and functionality.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased!  </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> the results however are amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used to own one</li>
            <li> I own a Tweeze and wanted a back-up.  </li>
            <li> I tried hers and liked it so ordered my own.  </li>
            <li> I also bought one for my daughter and she is thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It does work alright but not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice not to have to worry about hairs on my chin for almost a week.</li>
            <li> This was not as good as the one that I had bought from Bed Bath and Beyond many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I feel it is not quite the quality as my original, even though it works great</li>
            <li> Great product.. keeps my face clean..</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it and going to buy 2  more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing tweezer ever.</li>
            <li> The best product I have used so far.</li>
            <li> It kind of hurts though and is better at grabbing longer hair.</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly!</li>
            <li> I have very fine mustache hair and the chemical doesn&#x27;t work well on very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This one works but does not do nearly as good as my original.  </li>
            <li> bought two of these one for myself and one for my daughter, does not work like the first one I bought from a TV commercial,that I paid $30.00 for that one was great.</li>
            <li> No pain and gets fine hairs as well!</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic and</li>
            <li> No redness ,leaves skin very smooth...</li>
            <li> It works best with a fresh pair of batteries because then the motor runs very fast.</li>
            <li> We like it much better.  </li>
            <li> It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> way better than pulling out one hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be most beneficial in that it does meet expectations for the end result.  </li>
            <li> I will become more skilled with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> definitely safe thing to use on face...</li>
            <li> The perfect resolution to unwanted hair, even for the tender upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> She seems to love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Tweeze for over 5 years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and then it won&#x27;t hurt so much (more hair to tweeze&#x3D; more tingles of hair being</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it pulls out most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this EmjQi Tweeze.</li>
            <li> for smaller areas, yes, I was very happy with my purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Had a Tweeze for several years and always bragged that it was the best \\&quot;As</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> It probably would be better to buy something with more tweezing blades in it</li>
            <li> love this product it works</li>
            <li> Not the best way to go when it comes to getting rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I love this because through the years I have been getting more mustache hairs.  </li>
            <li> great for people that don&#x27;t have a lot of time or don&#x27;t see very well.</li>
            <li> I have to do it again and again to make sure that is going to cut all hair from my face.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I can to have spares.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Worked better than the chemical hair remover I had been using.</li>
            <li> i love this.  </li>
            <li> love this&lt;br /&gt;Whe</li>
            <li> just love the Tweeze</li>
            <li> save your money for something better</li>
            <li> Not the best epilator out there, but it works well enough.  </li>
            <li> works better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> the best way to remove facial hair I have come accross in all my years of tweezing!</li>
            <li> and I love using it.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was confident that this product would work, My mother wanted one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> my friend and her mother bought one too and they love em too</li>
            <li> I love having my wiskers plucked out by this machine.</li>
            <li> So glad amason had them...</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t really get to try it out all that great.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> then 2 uses at most</li>
            <li> when it was on t.v., it seems perhaps it had more grips or heads?</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> And while it does it well, it is advertised as doing much more.</li>
            <li> no problem Just make sure you have batteries</li>
            <li> (you will need to replace them every 3 or so months if you use it more than once a week)</li>
            <li> I dropped it and one of the plastic tabs broke that hold the cover on, but I was able to continue using it for another year or so.</li>
            <li> It  does a wonderful job with next to no pain!  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It still works ok</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> Makes the grooming process faster &amp; relatively more efficient but no epilator should cost over $10.00 in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but it does the job as long as you have the time, if it had more pully things it would be the best.</li>
            <li> However, it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it does a pretty darn good job</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Handy for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> fine ,but not on more course hair on legs or armpit</li>
            <li> and I was so glad to find it available for purchase.  </li>
            <li> but this one seems to be more cheaply made.</li>
            <li> But for a cheap price it works :)</li>
            <li> Free shipping would have made the purchase even better</li>
            <li> Pieces broke out of it, loved it so much that I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on good reviews so thanks for the review process, it helps buying things sight unseen.</li>
            <li> I was most pleased at your rapid response to my request and how quickly they arrived.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy hair removal that I use on my face!  </li>
            <li> The price was lower than I paid in the stores, and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is lubricated with oil and the oil will get on your face, but easily wipes off.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great, not amazing, but great.</li>
            <li> I love it to clean up my eyebrows and take care of my mustache</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using this product for easy removal of hair.</li>
            <li> but now it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> make sure skin is clean and just keep it taught.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it is easy.</li>
            <li> strong unit, wont break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how successful it was.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the original, more like cheap knockoffs that do not do the job.</li>
            <li> I, purchased a Tweeze when they new on the market, Loved it wanted to replace since it is wearing out.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is not for a man to use on his beard, it works on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and then was about 1/8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It removed some of the fine hairs but skipped a lot of them</li>
            <li> That being said, it works quickly and is sorta of like pulling tape off your face!</li>
            <li> Super duper!</li>
            <li> It is corded and more powerful.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years and will always have one available.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> hair lasts longer to grow and skin is realy smooth</li>
            <li> cheap price and a cheap product dont waist your time or money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> and I went on line to see if the product was still available.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters and they love them and in the store they are so much more and these  are the same as in the store at a much better price love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately they are no longer available in retail.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I would have liked it or not since it never worked.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten a Tweeze from wal-mart a few years ago,And has been the best thing I had ever used.</li>
            <li> I am going ask for replacement only because this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever experienced this problem w/a tweeze.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a similar brand and it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) easy to clean</li>
            <li> These are a cheap knock off and they don&#x27;t even remove the hair like the tweeze should.</li>
            <li> This works great for unwanted facial hair!!</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; and probably just as effective.  </li>
            <li> found Emjoi Tweeze for dirt cheap and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you can pick up a Tweeze for cheap, give a go.</li>
            <li> you can use it anywhere on your body, but if it&#x27;s your first time trying it, try maybe your arm as there is a bit of pain, kind of like a quick needle poke, but you get use to it</li>
            <li> We fell in love with it right away.</li>
            <li> Good-bye to facial waxing, and hello to more money in my pocket !!</li>
            <li> It is very effective on all my excess facial hair.</li>
            <li> but I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is great for catching the long hairs that older women get on their chins.</li>
            <li> Love this this hair remover, had to replace the first one that I bought.</li>
            <li> It did sting at first, but not any more than plucking hairs one by one.  </li>
            <li> The Tweeze is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I need to use it 2 to 3 times longer than the original and still need to tweeze and/or shave the hairs</li>
            <li> Just gotta keep fresh batteries in it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> These were not sturdy or well made, like the original.</li>
            <li> My wife was excited to use it</li>
            <li> I thought the blade wheel was not quite as effective as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> You can feel it pulling \\&quot;tweezing34;, yet I wish it became as clean as waxing</li>
            <li> The price is right, it works, is easy to use.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27; t work as well as the older one and is made more cheaply.</li>
            <li> this product had such good reviews and i was so hoping it would work</li>
            <li> It really is  not as painful as some people make it out to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
            <li> My daughter is growing to love it as much as her mom.</li>
            <li> you really have to go over it many times.</li>
            <li> It is not painful</li>
            <li> This has been a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> For such an inexpensive item, its surprising how well them work.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I really expected the tweezing to hurt more, but I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> it goes through the batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> , it is a quick way to do lip if no time to wax.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have little dainty fine blond hairs, I have straight up whiskers.</li>
            <li> Thank you very, very much!</li>
            <li> It has always done a good job and the battery life is long.</li>
            <li> Lol didn&#x27;t know I had to push the button upwards not press it down.</li>
            <li> My original one I bought when they first came out lasted me 4 years</li>
            <li> Removes fine blond hair really well.</li>
            <li> great little compact devise.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  </li>
            <li> Overall,the product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> A useful tool if nothing else works.</li>
            <li> Beauty is worth it.</li>
            <li> But, then I tried to hold the skin taut and it was far better.</li>
            <li> All of the sudden it started on its own</li>
            <li> And I definitely know how to use an epilator since I already own one.</li>
            <li> I already have had several Tweezy Epilators and I liked them.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes there is a difference in performance even though I bought the same product at different times, but all of them are fairly efficient and remove all but the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this one works best and last longer.</li>
            <li> One thing: you&#x27;ll go through batteries pretty quickly on it.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does exactly what it says and I&#x27;m truly happy that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would say this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> But these do not work right</li>
            <li> I read someone else&#x27;s review and they was right</li>
            <li> I keep mine right by the computer and do it all the time..</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts at first, but you kind of get used to it especially when there are fewer hairs to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very painful and works well for me.</li>
            <li> She said she loved the old one and that this is the same one she had.</li>
            <li> I have had an electric tweezer previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean too, and the battery last quite a while.</li>
            <li> The cap was already broken off and it didn&#x27;t work to good because I wasn&#x27;t able to get the cap to stay on.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Like this very much.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one and I&#x27; m excited about this new version.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get rid of the hair on my upper lip and chin without having to pay the high price of professional waxing.  </li>
            <li> At first we had to learn how to use an epilator -</li>
            <li> Was pretty funny to go to baggage and</li>
            <li> I tried so many for upper lip and sideburns</li>
            <li> it took forever to figure out how to get it to work in the first place</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I had no issues with learning how to use it ( it is my first epilator ).</li>
            <li> Does not seem like the exact model I had before.  </li>
            <li> Does not work like the exact model I had before.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it worked..</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered directly from the comppany has a smooth on/off switch.</li>
            <li> , I use it at least 2 times a week with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this item, the screws started falling out and it didn&#x27;t even tweeze the hair....</li>
            <li> I tried many things on my facial hair</li>
            <li> The first one sent did not work at all.</li>
            <li> It works well and allows the user to be confident in not having those embarrassing stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li> At first item will not turn on eventually got it to work.</li>
            <li> second one in 10 year, just love it</li>
            <li> Using this is hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;First things first.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of chin and neck hairs that I would rather not think about, but this thing takes &#x27;em out pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Better than using regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> First one died after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to use it twice, from my experience</li>
            <li> I wore out the first one.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my legs first</li>
            <li> Perhaps the next step up is better?</li>
            <li> I had another product from same brand and was very satisfied until it developed rechargeable battery issues</li>
            <li> This was my first epi</li>
            <li> The price is so incredibly reasonable!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one, I love it, it removes the hair from the root and it is faster than just tweezing.  </li>
            <li> it will remove those fast too!</li>
            <li> she wasn&#x27;t able to take our only Tweeze with her.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to turn it on.</li>
            <li> I had the first one for 4-5 years.</li>
            <li> I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> I am very unsattisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I had my first Tweezy for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Did not send back because it cost more to do that than throw item away.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive so, in fact, I just threw it out!  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Occasionally it will grab a stubborn or thicker hair with a bit of \\&quot;thunk\\&quot; making me flinch a bit more out of surprise than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  </li>
            <li> and you really cant pinpoint the hair you just have to go over and over where the hair is until you get the right angle</li>
            <li> Plus  if you do it right and make circular moves it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li> Works good on thin fine hair but for trying to do thicker hair</li>
            <li> I have never used a better product for tweezing large areas, such as neck and face.  </li>
            <li> What I received wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the quality as my original Tweeze.  </li>
            <li> With the vibration of the unit against my skin, I can barely feel the fine hair plucking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for removing the facial hair, just wish it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin so much</li>
            <li> Wish I could  order more of the clear plastic top, the little snaps break off.</li>
            <li> - this is my second one - they work great at getting rid of facial hair quick - only use about once a week</li>
            <li> It took too long (more than one month)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and would highly recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is not too dry or irritated before using the Tweeze or you could make yourself sore</li>
            <li> It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  </li>
            <li> Bought the first one when it was a hot new item.</li>
            <li> I would pass the epilator over some areas several times and the fine hairs would still be there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions suggested, I started by attempting to remove the fine hairs on the back of my hand/wrist area to get an idea of how the device felt.  </li>
            <li> The short fine ones remained in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get these little hairs that grow out along my ears, so this plucks them out nicely.</li>
            <li> However, I have not rated it very high, because that is really all it does.</li>
            <li> These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li> I really like it and want another one.  </li>
            <li> I do not know about the automatic tweeze&#x27;s, but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> IT VERY UPSET WITH THIS</li>
            <li> but because i have very course hair all it does is pull my hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> this is awsome product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> So much easier than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> So much easier than waxing without the pain.</li>
            <li> This was a joke really.</li>
            <li> but I would need to go over and over and over the same area to get things smooth.</li>
            <li> it is very noisy but works well getting all those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> really works well.</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay,</li>
            <li> Shipped fastly</li>
            <li> It is fast and convenient and saves time and money.  </li>
            <li> It does not appear to be durable and although the package states that 2 AAA baterries are included, they are not (manufacturer&#x27;s fault and not so much the seller).</li>
            <li> Not expecting much for the money.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast though</li>
            <li> I so much appreciate the fact that you found them for me.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased one about 5 years ago and the motor on it was much stronger</li>
            <li> this tweezer really hanks at your hair</li>
            <li> got it for a birthday gift and the woman just loves it thanks</li>
            <li> I am satisfied that I got what I expected for the price though</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really pull any hair but it does pull a lot of your skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have gone thru so much stress regarding hair removal.</li>
            <li> like like I did - takes much to much time.  </li>
            <li> really fast,really clean..Does not pinch or pull.</li>
            <li> It works really well and really doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really get the hairs that I needed it too.</li>
            <li> This one product made me very leary about ordering anything else</li>
            <li> How much it will hurt really depends on the person.</li>
            <li> love this, takes the little hairs right off</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second one purchased-wore the first one out !!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a good purchase as a first epilator, I didn&#x27;t realize how little hair it would actually remove at a time.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the ones originally sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Good for very small areas</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new one because I kept dropping the old one (klutz I know) which eventually broke the clear cover, although I was able to use the product without the clear cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and</li>
            <li> I used it twice before it died, its not like i have a beard, i have fine hair but long around my lips an jaw line.</li>
            <li> So was very effective but definitely for smaller areas such as the upper lip, maybe part of the bikini line...if you are like me and are looking for something for underarms and legs, this is not the product for mostly because of the time it would take to cover those larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this very much for those wild hairs</li>
            <li> Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  </li>
            <li> and it is small and handy for travel.</li>
            <li> And the more you keep up on it, the less the you have to do it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and isn&#x27;t any more painful</li>
            <li> I had a older version of this model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, if suffer from the same condition as myself, you&#x27;re better off just getting laser treatment done because, not even an epilator can get rid of the embarrassment of facial hair.</li>
            <li> Who knew aging means more facial hair for women as their female hormones decrease?  </li>
            <li> Great little tool to get those stray hairs we women are subject to after we reach a certain age.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found if I use it right after I get out of the shower and my pores are open it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> That is highly convenient.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with very little cost.  </li>
            <li> I love this little guy.  </li>
            <li> Evenually one of the little tabs holding the top on broke off but that was just normal wear.  </li>
            <li> my age I get those hard long hairs on my lip and chin and this product works great</li>
            <li> Sure it may have gotten a few hairs</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that the item will probably not perform at initial level for a long time but am satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> have to have it at the right angle and go over and over an area to get individual hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and we were trying to make it pull out at least 1 hair, but really, I should have paid a little bit more and purchase a better one..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any female that struggles with light facial hair issues.</li>
            <li> I like the new On/Off button which doesn&#x27;t bump on so easily and run the battery down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to using the product so maybe with time</li>
            <li> Would not advise anyone to purchase this new version.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> But I tried in 3 sets of brand new batteris.</li>
            <li> I thought I would buy new one before they discontinued them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for facial hair because I was tired of tweezing and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Very loud.</li>
            <li> i bought one for my friend recently for a funny gift exchange.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the money and does alright as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting anything like shaving legs etc with it.</li>
            <li> I did manage to mostly remove a small circle of hair -- the longer, coarser hairs, that is.  </li>
            <li> It was nothing like my old one!  </li>
            <li> Purchased new one for lots less money, does same great job as previous.</li>
            <li> I had an original EmjQi and it was wonderful, this one is painful and harsh.</li>
            <li> This new Tweeze does not remove hair like the old one.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic item, I previously owned one and lost it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have trouble getting the fine hairs though.</li>
            <li> actually works!&lt;br /&gt;3) pulls even the tiny fine white hairs on the surface of your face</li>
            <li> I need it to clear.</li>
            <li> So far though I&#x27;ve had a bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and it really controls the facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair was be trimmed first if too long.</li>
            <li> Saves money on professional waxing.</li>
            <li> It is completely unusable, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive way to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my old worn out one.</li>
            <li> It met my expect ions completely.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loud and sounds like an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Might hurt the first time, but minor.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li> It seems that I&#x27;m having to pluck nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I am surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second costing a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets more dead skin than actual hair..</li>
            <li> Perfect for annoying hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> Slick, works quickly and I&#x27;m ready for work in no time at all.</li>
            <li> It works as described, I only whish it had at least two tweezer heads rotating, the one is okay</li>
            <li> But since I started using Tweeze my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little at times but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning it as it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> I proabably will stick to shaving large areas like my long legs, &amp; I won&#x27;t use this on my upper lip or bikini area.</li>
            <li> it will work for general areas like the arm, armpit, cheek, chin.</li>
            <li> Grabs skin frequently even when held as taught as possible.</li>
            <li> This one barely pulls the eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> Pulls those little hairs out right now.  </li>
            <li> The previous versions of this product work a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> It can cause slight bleeding because the hairs are getting ripped out very fast.</li>
            <li> and it solved my mustache, beard, and face fuzz issues completely without the high cost of other methods that didn&#x27;t perform the results EZ Tweezer does.  </li>
            <li> Fast and minimal pain!</li>
            <li> comparison&#x27;s sake (for this review), I tried the device on my big toe, where the hair is still only about 1/8&amp;#34; long but much coarser.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it was a really compact and nice looking device</li>
            <li> but apparently they are made different now.</li>
            <li> At first I had to tweeze everyday.  </li>
            <li> I usually wax, but my facial hair grows really fast, by the next day after waxing I would see new hair growing in,</li>
            <li> So, I bought it for her, she tried it and it did not Tweeze a single hair, It would make loud noise, and it would smell like burnt rubber.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other cheap face epilators in the past and I&#x27;ve never had one that is new that works maybe 1 out of 3 tries.  </li>
            <li> Recently, due to serious arthritis wrist and hand issues, I gifted my hair stylist with one to use in exfoliating my invisible to me white facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget really works.</li>
            <li> It  does feel a little bit harsher than my older model.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough that I bought another larger one.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for the few dollars, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time for them to come back.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the chemical when I got chemical burns when I accidentally left it on too long.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how such a little thing could work so well.  </li>
            <li> I have had these prior, but during move last April it got wet and ruined.</li>
            <li> When I first tried to use it, I found it painful and thought it was just more wasted money.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this, especially because I own a larger epilator from Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I wish I had spent the extra money to get something that worked.</li>
            <li> It works well with medium to long hairs and pulled out all the hairs on my cheek and eyebrow area.</li>
            <li> hair is turning grey and this removes hair</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I put batteries in, the device automatically went on and the off switch did not work at all, so while the batteries were in it was in on mode perpetually.  </li>
            <li> I have one I have used for a long time and when my daughter comes over she uses it.</li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I got the item, I THOUGHT it was a complete waste of money before I opened it.</li>
            <li> These work well but take a long time to receive.  </li>
            <li> An ever bigger surprise, the pain was minimal.</li>
            <li> how to hold it, etc., but once we got all that down, we found it worked really well for the small areas like upper and lower lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years, and the blades finally got dull, so I ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a very small epilator, it does take some time if you want to do a large area like your legs.</li>
            <li> This is ny third one, this one the motor does not work, the previous ones the plastic cover broke after short use.</li>
            <li> but now I only tweeze every other week.</li>
            <li> Product says for men or women, but can not be used for mens facial hair and other areas require trimming of hair before use.</li>
            <li> Wishing it was long term!</li>
            <li> But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a hormone problem that involves long dark coarse hair that grows on my face and, neck.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done using it, the entire cap has dead skin inside of it and, not one peach fuzz or coarse hair will be found.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press onto skin forcefully or repeatedly in a single area because you can cause redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pick up a single hair.  </li>
            <li> It would not be advisable if you want to remove lots of hair at one time, but for a single rogue hair here and there, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The picture was of 2 packages, there was a picture of a single one for $12.99</li>
            <li> And when it does work, even with new batteries, it slows down to a crawl in a matter of a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> kind of disappointed in the quality</li>
            <li> I personally see a difference with less hair growth.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this item, I opened it and the battery cover was extremely difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> Not even in small areas such as your upper lip.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> and I am black haired and dark complexion (I am french) and this has been a problem for me for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to, initially it feels like little shocks when the hairs pull out, but eventually you become desensitized.</li>
            <li> I run it over my upper lip, feel to see if I have all the little prickles and if so, repeat.  </li>
            <li> product for the girl who has a lot of tiny little unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1- 10 with 10 being the most painful, it&#x27;s maybe a 3 .</li>
            <li> It is not particularly useful for underarms and it would take too long to do the legs.  </li>
            <li> The item was delivered quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit rough, but it is my back-up Tweeze.  </li>
            <li> It may not get &amp;#34;every&amp;#34; hair, but continued use will definitely keep it under control without using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Another tip is to be careful when you are cleaning it.</li>
            <li> i wish i would of bought a bigger one for my legs but did try it on them and no need to shave everyday anymore</li>
            <li> It works well, exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> It did take me a couple of tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It is not gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> So be careful if you use it too close to your hairline..</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work as well as she expected it.  </li>
            <li> My mother had her house broken into recently, and she said her old EmjQi was stolen.</li>
            <li> chin is just darn ridiculous to do anything than tweezing since they are sparse, but they come in dark and thicker than the normal skin fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to move the epilator in small circles and I would recommend you do it slowly because it you move too fast</li>
            <li> As a woman gets older she gets chin hairs and her eyesight gets worse.</li>
            <li> It took very little hair off my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Saw this other product on youtube and thought why not.  </li>
            <li> I ended up just using regular tweezers, as usual.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it mite be to other</li>
            <li> it took for ever to get this item compared to the other items</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it to me as I was using other stuff.  </li>
            <li> But be careful if you do not hold your skin it will pinch!</li>
            <li> I spent half an hour trying to pull any hair, and it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t squeezing/pulling hard enough to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only painful at first</li>
            <li> removing unwanted hair is not fun</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it, because its not worth it.</li>
            <li> this one seem very inferior in guality and is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly getting used to using it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t put it near my face or worse my bikini</li>
            <li> Like waxing, hair regrowth is lighter and less.</li>
            <li> I does work but it also hurts slightly.</li>
            <li> , basically: it&#x27;s possible this might work for someone with a different hair type, but for me it was completely useless.</li>
            <li> Blades move rough and remove very little hair.  </li>
            <li> no ingrown hair or rough hair regrowth which usually happens with the use of shavers...</li>
            <li> You just have to move it in the growth direction of the little hairs, so they&#x27;ll be removed.</li>
            <li> Not original one.</li>
            <li> Head stopped rotating without a little \\&quot;push\\&quot; on the mechanism.  </li>
            <li> This little tweezie devise was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li> and then I found this little life saver.</li>
            <li> Hurts somewhat, but not significant.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little but it pulls the hair out.</li>
            <li> I like this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Got a little worry thought I had lost my money.</li>
            <li> It pulls those little chin and mustache hairs out, doesn&#x27;t hurt and lasts forever with just a change of batteries.</li>
            <li> I use it and it does hurt a little, but nothing excruciating.</li>
            <li> It take a little getting accustom too though.</li>
            <li> the product itself works, but i need to hold the little cap thingy on with some masking tape.</li>
            <li> A little pinch, because it is a tweezer on steroids.</li>
            <li> This little machine plucks your hair, it is not a shaver.</li>
            <li> My plastic gaurd cap already has a crack in it &amp; could be a little easier to detach &amp; reattach for cleaning.</li>
            <li> the little plastic cap will get lost but it is not important.&lt;br /&gt;4) not precise.</li>
            <li> Waste of money/Time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few via Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it takes quite a few passes to get the hair</li>
            <li> So I use this instead, I can use it everyday,</li>
            <li> Bought this a few times since my mother keeps breaking them (how?).</li>
            <li> The hair is still firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot keep batteries in it and the battery cover does not fit after you put batteries in it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Mine is not removing anything, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use to remove a few hair from my toe.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife she has been wanting one for a few months now..</li>
            <li> &amp; yes it is much faster &amp; less painful than tweezing 1 by 1 or waxing.</li>
            <li> This is satifsfactory, though not superior as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> and if you press too close to your face, the blades slow down.  </li>
            <li> It pulls a little, but nothing to hardly notice.  </li>
            <li> Very little pain while using.</li>
            <li> It is a small battery-operated unit.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Since the postage back and forth is too expensive it just lies in my drawer</li>
            <li> You can do a small area at a time.  </li>
            <li> I was cleaning mine with the small brush that is included in the package</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I get whiskers on my chin (gross!)</li>
            <li> In the past decade +  I have used this product bi-</li>
            <li> So now I have two same eztweezers that are useless.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this!</li>
            <li> Love how it works but hate having to use it!</li>
            <li> No more plucking one by one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to navigate small portions of my knees where razors don&#x27;t navigate well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> meh, you get what you pay for :-/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;rt waste your money!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why they show two.</li>
            <li> every other, without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Once the redness died down I had three  patches where there was scratching and a thin layer of skin</li>
            <li> Now I can grab those hard to see chin hair without having to strain my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product but its not worth paying the shipping to send it back.  </li>
            <li> It can burn and, leave &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34; even though your plucking the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair that&#x27;s on your skin can get caught inside the tweezer and, it&#x27;ll actually stop it from running for a few seconds and, then painfully pull it</li>
            <li> The construction was shoddy.  </li>
            <li> Emjoi Tweeze is a somewhat buzzy noisy unit and may look a little scary.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> but then again I pluck a ton of hair from my chin and neck area so gauging pain is probably not a good thing for me to do.</li>
            <li> well... i gotta say, it gets the job done, its not as painfull as i was especting it to be, but a bit slow for my taste, i get tired of it after a while.</li>
            <li> Someone said it doesn&#x27;t get rid of little hairs, but it does!!!</li>
            <li> I hated plucking and with this it only takes a few seconds to cover the neck area.  </li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> But since we had got quite addicted to being hairless (and didn&#x27;t have to run out to be threaded every 3 weeks), we decided to buy another so that my daughter and I would each have one.  </li>
            <li> It got rid of all of those annoying facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair behind.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product and neither was my mom when she tried it as well.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of them 1 for me, and that one was broken.</li>
            <li> Thought the button was broken.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well and makes a horrible noise while operating.  </li>
            <li> even a single hair m soo disappointed  </li>
            <li> So painful in fact that tears run down your face (Even when used as described).</li>
            <li> it was alittle painful felt like little zapps.</li>
            <li> Hated the bumps left by tweezing.  </li>
            <li> Lip area is very painful and leaves skin swollen and red.</li>
            <li> This product is painful and not easily used.</li>
            <li> lot of the times the tweezer wont even grab the hair or it&#x27;ll just cut the hair in half and, leave annoying stubble</li>
            <li> This one was a failure!!</li>
            <li> Upon investigation I found that she is unable to use it because of her pace maker.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my lip and not impressed</li>
            <li> It was too expensive to return...</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the units would not remove hair at the root (like they are supposed to) and actually burned/cut my face, leaving abrasions all over my face.</li>
            <li> It is slightly uncomfortable, but if used routinely the discomfort diminishes.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the others but this one came from Hong Kong and is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed in this product as it did not perform as I expected.</li>
            <li> THICK COURSE HAIR SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> So bad...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad painful, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> i dont like is painful</li>
            <li> Painful, but does the job.</li>
            <li> and it is painful to me.</li>
            <li> If you plan to purchase, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tweeze for years &amp; was disappointed to discover, when i had to replace mine, that retail stores stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy</li>
            <li> This thing is worthless.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> For this awful experience, I rate it a one star.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great and was as described.</li>
            <li> The previous versions of this product work a little bit better.  This did not tweeze anything!  It doesn&#x27;t matter how you hold it.</li>
            <li> hazardous in every way!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s only painful at first but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not bad at all. Because it&#x27;s a very small epilator, it does take some time if you want to do a large area like your legs. It also doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out but nothing that a pair of tweezers can&#x27;t fix. It can cause slight bleeding because the hairs are getting ripped out very fast. Don&#x27;t press onto skin forcefully or repeatedly in a single area because you can cause redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the ones originally sold in stores.</li>
            <li> In our household we have 3 Emjoi epilators (all from Amazon) and we like them all for different things.  So I will post this same review for all three.  We started with the AP-9T Tweezers - about $13.95. It is a small battery-operated unit.  At first we had to learn how to use an epilator - how to hold it, etc., but once we got all that down, we found it worked really well for the small areas like upper and lower lip. Unless there is a massive amount of hair, it is not painful but you can feel when it \\&quot;makes hits\\&quot; - like a tweezer pull.  It is not particularly useful for underarms and it would take too long to do the legs.  But since we had got quite addicted to being hairless (and didn&#x27;t have to run out to be threaded every 3 weeks), we decided to buy another so that my daughter and I would each have one.  This time we went up a notch to the Emjoi AP-9L Epi-Slim.  It is about $14.77 at Amazon and also battery operated.  We like it much better.  It too is great for the small areas like the upper and lower lip and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we decided to also try a more expensive one.  This time we bought the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Tweezer set.  It is about $74.71 and it is more like the size of a men&#x27;s shaver.  It is corded and more powerful.  This one does great under the arms and on the legs and even in the bikini area.  It is not so good on the small areas like the upper and lower lip because the dual heads don&#x27;t fit that well.  But it will do the rest of the face and quite powerfully.  The first time we tried to do the cheeks and the side of the face, it hurt - like little electric shocks as it pulled all that baby fine fuzz most of us have there.  It makes your face so smooth.  But once you get past the first few times and the bulk of the hair has been pulled, it is not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, there is no reason to be hairy!  These gadgets really work.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic item, I previously owned one and lost it.  It takes some getting use to, initially it feels like little shocks when the hairs pull out, but eventually you become desensitized. way better than pulling out one hair at a time.  The item was delivered quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for one I already owned. I like this very much for those wild hairs we all get now and then. The one I had lasted over 5 years and there is an improvement to this one. The on and off switch has a dip now to prevent it going off in your luggage.....lol. Was pretty funny to go to baggage and have the handler say something is buzzing in your suitcase..... I will buy this again if I need another one. I gave 4 stars because it was the plastic head guard that broke off the tweezer and if it was metal it would last forever.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder for the Tweezee.  I found this product to be most beneficial in that it does meet expectations for the end result.  I bought this one for a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this this hair remover, had to replace the first one that I bought. Pieces broke out of it, loved it so much that I had to replace it. Removes fine blond hair really well. It is worth a try and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The Hair Remover is quite noisy and sometimes can&#x27;t get the hair I&#x27;m after. I&#x27;m still new to using the product so maybe with time I will become more skilled with it. So far though I&#x27;ve had a bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the device using batteries. That is highly convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought the tweez&#x27;e at Wal-mart.  I really like it and want another one.  It takes batteries, so you can take it every where with you.  However, Wal-mart no longer carries it.  I do not know about the automatic tweeze&#x27;s, but I really like this one.  The only draw back is that the hair grows back faster than it says.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product.  I purchased one about a year ago and it died, so I was happy to be able to replace it.  Does an A+ job!</li>
            <li> I, purchased a Tweeze when they new on the market, Loved it wanted to replace since it is wearing out. This new Tweeze does not remove hair like the old one. Would not advise anyone to purchase this new version. AB</li>
            <li> DOESNT WORK THREW IT OUT AS SOON AS I GOT IT VERY UPSET WITH THIS</li>
            <li> Love this product. I used to own one but I lost it. Happy to have found a replacement on Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I had stated that I didn&#x27;t know what I would do if it stopped working.  It did and I was so glad to find it available for purchase.  I hated plucking and with this it only takes a few seconds to cover the neck area.  I would recommend it to any woman with unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for facial hair because I was tired of tweezing and it worked great.  It did sting at first, but not any more than plucking hairs one by one.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I tried so many for upper lip and sideburns but this is the best one...&lt;br /&gt;it will not pull your skin like a epilator...no ingrown hair or rough hair regrowth which usually happens with the use of shavers...definitely safe thing to use on face...</li>
            <li> Use it twice a week. Only thing is, that it shows two items and I only received the one, EmjQi Tweeze. Not sure why.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does exactly what it says and I&#x27;m truly happy that I purchased it. If you plan to purchase, you will not be disappointed. The good part, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot and it gets stubborn unwanted hair on your face. Someone said it doesn&#x27;t get rid of little hairs, but it does!!! You just have to move it in the growth direction of the little hairs, so they&#x27;ll be removed. I will get another one, since it&#x27;s so inexpensive and does the job, that a razor won&#x27;t do. Feels good to have a smooth face!!!</li>
            <li> the tweezer arrived unusable. This is ny third one, this one the motor does not work, the previous ones the plastic cover broke after short use. Since the postage back and forth is too expensive it just lies in my drawer</li>
            <li> Not original one. This is a counterfeit</li>
            <li> It is garbage! That is why is so cheap!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it she had one it got lost or \\&quot; stolen \\&quot;  work good for her and now it makes me happy lol</li>
            <li> this product had such good reviews and i was so hoping it would work but because i have very course hair all it does is pull my hair it took forever to figure out how to get it to work in the first place and you really cant pinpoint the hair you just have to go over and over where the hair is until you get the right angle oh well it works for torturing my roommate so thats my only plus</li>
            <li> Great service. Received item very quickly! The item was packed well and was very happy with everything! Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years and will always have one available.  The perfect resolution to unwanted hair, even for the tender upper lip area.  I even introduced my husband to it!</li>
            <li> Had one before and loved it.  I don&#x27;t like this one it doesn&#x27;t remove whiskers on my mother.  Product is defective</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says and at a very good price. I had no issues with learning how to use it ( it is my first epilator ). It really is  not as painful as some people make it out to be. On a scale of 1- 10 with 10 being the most painful, it&#x27;s maybe a 3 .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked very well.  it didn&#x27;t pull my hairs like the one my mother has does and if you press too close to your face, the blades slow down.  It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Received product today.  Followed directions.  It broke in 30 seconds.  Head stopped rotating without a little \\&quot;push\\&quot; on the mechanism.  Turn it on.... Nothing.  Waste of money/Time.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  Does not seem like the exact model I had before.  Does not work like the exact model I had before.</li>
            <li> My mother had her house broken into recently, and she said her old EmjQi was stolen. I bought this through the amazon Add- on program. She said she loved the old one and that this is the same one she had. Amazon.com had this item for a very low price. My mother was very glad to get this item replaced. She seems to love it. Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it worked..hair stayed away for over a week...it gets easier to use.follow the directions and you will have no problems...would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. I love it. Definitely recommend it to anyone. Great for any type of hair. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I spent half an hour trying to pull any hair, and it just didn&#x27;t. I wish I had spent the extra money to get something that worked.</li>
            <li> I bought a Tweezie several years ago and have used it regularly since then. Evenually one of the little tabs holding the top on broke off but that was just normal wear.  I haven&#x27;t found a replacement until now.  What I like about Tweezie is that I can use it without having to look in the mirror.  I run it over my upper lip, feel to see if I have all the little prickles and if so, repeat.  It is very effective on all my excess facial hair.</li>
            <li> well... i gotta say, it gets the job done, its not as painfull as i was especting it to be, but a bit slow for my taste, i get tired of it after a while. the results however are amazing. hair lasts longer to grow and skin is realy smooth</li>
            <li> My mom had been looking to replace hers that she had for years she is very pleased</li>
            <li> I own a Tweeze and wanted a back-up.  The first one I ordered directly from the comppany has a smooth on/off switch. This one is a bit rough, but it is my back-up Tweeze.  Overall the product itself is WONDERFUL.  I no longer have to wax.  I use my Tweeze daily to keep a handle on all facial especially those unsightly chin hairs.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Tweeze for over 5 years now and absolutely love it. I just ordered a new one because I kept dropping the old one (klutz I know) which eventually broke the clear cover, although I was able to use the product without the clear cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine being without my Tweeze, I use it at least 2 times a week with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 words of advice though:&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure your skin is not too dry or irritated before using the Tweeze or you could make yourself sore&lt;br /&gt;2) It WILL hurt until you get used to it, keep using it often and then it won&#x27;t hurt so much (more hair to tweeze&#x3D; more tingles of hair being plucked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for any and all women, it&#x27;s the only way to keep your upper lip area hairless without spending hours and hours tweezing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It didn&#x27;t pick up a single hair.  All it did was pull and break the hair.  For all of the irritation it caused, nothing was done.</li>
            <li> This is my second EmjQi Tweeze.  I personally see a difference with less hair growth.  It&#x27;s like waxing but in a different way. You control the size of the area you are treating.  You can do a small area at a time.  Like waxing, hair regrowth is lighter and less.</li>
            <li> If you have facial hair and break out w bleach or even have shaved ur face b4 this gets course hair from the roots this is awsome product HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for removing the facial hair, just wish it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin so much</li>
            <li> The first time I used this item, the screws started falling out and it didn&#x27;t even tweeze the hair....</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my Tweezer that I purchased one for each of my daughters.  They  are also delited with the product.  So much easier than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it. Good-bye to facial waxing, and hello to more money in my pocket !! I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores anymore so I ordered a few via Amazon. The price was lower than I paid in the stores, and it came very quickly. Great Seller !!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you much,&lt;br /&gt;Debra-Sue</li>
            <li> Very pleased, have tried others, this is the best!  Works well &amp; great price!  This product was recommeded to me by 2 others who have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Works good on hair you can see and those you can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m slowly getting used to using it on my upper lip. So much easier than waxing without the pain.</li>
            <li> This little tweezie devise was recommended by a friend.  I tried hers and liked it so ordered my own.  It does a good job and isn&#x27;t any more painful that yanking with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> Good products -- met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The Tweeze is well worth the price!  I&#x27;ve had one for years, and the blades finally got dull, so I ordered a new one.  I use it every day, and it really controls the facial hair.  It may not get &amp;#34;every&amp;#34; hair, but continued use will definitely keep it under control without using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I does work but it also hurts slightly. It is lubricated with oil and the oil will get on your face, but easily wipes off. Overall,the product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great, not amazing, but great. I use it on my face and it pulls out most of the hair. It seems to have trouble getting the fine hairs though. I would pass the epilator over some areas several times and the fine hairs would still be there. This wasn&#x27;t a big problem for me since I just went in with the tweezers and pulled out whatever the epilator missed. It works well with medium to long hairs and pulled out all the hairs on my cheek and eyebrow area. You&#x27;re supposed to move the epilator in small circles and I would recommend you do it slowly because it you move too fast some of the hairs break and won&#x27;t be pulled from the root. Another tip is to be careful when you are cleaning it. I was cleaning mine with the small brush that is included in the package and I accidentally slipped the brush into the tweezer compartment. Near the bottom of the tweezer compartment there is some lube placed to keep the gears going so be careful not to smudge that. Other than that I would say this is a good deal. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It works great !!.  I also bought one for my daughter and she is thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;With my age I get those hard long hairs on my lip and chin and this product works great and it takes a long time for them to come back.  My daughter would shave daily because of the same hairs since she went though menopause and she loves it also.  We only have to use it once or twice a week and the hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> It works as described, I only whish it had at least two tweezer heads rotating, the one is okay but it takes quite a few passes to get the hair</li>
            <li> bought two of these one for myself and one for my daughter, does not work like the first one I bought from a TV commercial,that I paid $30.00 for that one was great. But these do not work right they dont do anything!!! cheap price and a cheap product dont waist your time or money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I get whiskers on my chin (gross!) and I have a fairly hairy lip, so the Tweeze is AH-MA-ZING! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I hope these things never go off the market.  I have never used a better product for tweezing large areas, such as neck and face.  It would not be advisable if you want to remove lots of hair at one time, but for a single rogue hair here and there, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these hair removers when they 1st came out about 5 years ago and I have used it until it&#x27;s in pieces held together with duct tape!  It&#x27;s quick and easy hair removal that I use on my face!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to get rid of the stubborn hair.  Hated the bumps left by tweezing.  Saw this other product on youtube and thought why not.  It had great reviews, so I ordered it.  At first I had to tweeze everyday.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it but now I only tweeze every other week.</li>
            <li> I love this EmjQi Tweeze. I usually wax, but my facial hair grows really fast, by the next day after waxing I would see new hair growing in, So I use this instead, I can use it everyday, every other, without irritating my skin. But since I started using Tweeze my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast, thats y I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a good purchase as a first epilator, I didn&#x27;t realize how little hair it would actually remove at a time. So was very effective but definitely for smaller areas such as the upper lip, maybe part of the bikini line...if you are like me and are looking for something for underarms and legs, this is not the product for mostly because of the time it would take to cover those larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for smaller areas, yes, I was very happy with my purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27; t work as well as the older one and is made more cheaply. kind of disappointed in the quality</li>
            <li> Love it. Had one before. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I tried many things on my facial hair and then I found this little life saver. It&#x27;s a tad painful, but you get used to it. And the more you keep up on it, the less the you have to do it. I highly recommend this for any female that struggles with light facial hair issues. I have saved a ton of money now that I dont have to wax anymore.</li>
            <li> This is satifsfactory, though not superior as I would have expected.  Hurts somewhat, but not significant.  A useful tool if nothing else works.</li>
            <li> Had a Tweeze for several years and always bragged that it was the best \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; products I ever purchased.  It quit working a while back and I went on line to see if the product was still available.  It was but I&#x27;ve had problems.  The first one sent did not work at all. I tried 2 or 3 set of batteries. My money was eventually credited back to my credit card. I ordered a second costing a few dollars more. This one works but does not do nearly as good as my original.  I need to use it 2 to 3 times longer than the original and still need to tweeze and/or shave the hairs the Tweeze doesn&#x27;t get.  No way I&#x27;ll ever brag about this product again and am looking for another product that will work properly.</li>
            <li> I love this I recommend this to everyone. Delivery was very fast. I gave one to my sister and she loves it as well</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters and they love them and in the store they are so much more and these  are the same as in the store at a much better price love it.</li>
            <li> did nothing for me.  get a bigger one. the hair was not removed not even tweezed.  save your money.  invest in a larger machine.</li>
            <li> This was a joke really. Sure it may have gotten a few hairs but I would need to go over and over and over the same area to get things smooth. Some hairs I could feel it grabbing but it wasn&#x27;t squeezing/pulling hard enough to remove the hair. I ended up just using regular tweezers, as usual. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
            <li> Pulls those little hairs out right now.  It pulls a little, but nothing to hardly notice.  Beauty is worth it.</li>
            <li> I had a older version of this model. But I drop it and broke. I purchased this one and I&#x27; m excited about this new version. It&#x27;s faster and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> This hair remover is terrific for those of us who need magnification to apply makeup. It works well and allows the user to be confident in not having those embarrassing stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Its time consuming with just one head. Takes forever. It probably would be better to buy something with more tweezing blades in it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price. I love it to clean up my eyebrows and take care of my mustache</li>
            <li> my husband bought one of these for me years ago off tv bc i was always complaining about plucking and it still works well.  i bought one for my friend recently for a funny gift exchange.  i still use mine weekly.  it is very noisy but works well getting all those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> Its very good.The only thing I miss is that before I bought the same Tweeze and it came with a  cream to debilitate the hair</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> love this product it works i wish i would of bought a bigger one for my legs but did try it on them and no need to shave everyday anymore must buy for summer!!!!!</li>
            <li> Actually, because of the pic I was under the impression that I received two for that price. I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but it pulls the hair out. And the hair stays away longer than when you use tweezers alone.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gets those tiny peach fuzz that I can&#x27;t stand! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. My Aunt loves her&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Sucky product. Not the best way to go when it comes to getting rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li> worked on peach fuzz hairs on the face (sideburn area) fine ,but not on more course hair on legs or armpit</li>
            <li> I like this little gadget. I get these little hairs that grow out along my ears, so this plucks them out nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this because through the years I have been getting more mustache hairs.  It does hurt some but so does plucking each hair individually and I&#x27;ve found if I use it right after I get out of the shower and my pores are open it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  Plus  if you do it right and make circular moves it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  I bought a second one to pack for vacations.</li>
            <li> a lot faster than plucking.. great for people that don&#x27;t have a lot of time or don&#x27;t see very well.</li>
            <li> I have to do it again and again to make sure that is going to cut all hair from my face.</li>
            <li> it came with out the included batteries. The battery cover doesn&#x27;t stay on but it does NOT work any how.&lt;br /&gt;It makes alot of noise but does Not remove any hair.  It came yesterday....</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  It took very little hair off my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Well I read some great reviews and decided to take a chance.  It is not pulling anything.  I am using it on jaw, upper lip, chin.  I am so disappointed with this product but its not worth paying the shipping to send it back.  I should have listened to my gut when I saw the As Seen logo on it.</li>
            <li> This product works as stated. I love it!!! I will buy more when I can to have spares. It does hurt a little at times but worth it.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. It got rid of all of those annoying facial hairs. I should have bought more than one of those!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore so buy two at a time. Works excellently for me and has since it hit the market quite a while ago. Try it...you may feel the same way. I am a devotee.</li>
            <li> Like this very much.  Just don&#x27;t know why they have two instead of just one.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few times since my mother keeps breaking them (how?). Works okay. Bought the first one when it was a hot new item. I am finding the technology has improved greatly over this one.</li>
            <li> Love it. This is my  second order. Wish I could  order more of the clear plastic top, the little snaps break off.</li>
            <li> At first item will not turn on eventually got it to work. Got a little worry thought I had lost my money.</li>
            <li> second one in 10 year, just love it</li>
            <li> Fast way to remove hair. Very good and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I read someone else&#x27;s review and they was right it goes through the batteries quickly. But it still does the job. My original one I bought when they first came out lasted me 4 years and yes it used batteries, but not like these newer ones do. but over all I still say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> When I first tried to use it, I found it painful and thought it was just more wasted money. It was headed for the trash even though I followed the directions. But, then I tried to hold the skin taut and it was far better. I was surprised how successful it was. All the hair was gone.  Worked better than the chemical hair remover I had been using. I have very fine mustache hair and the chemical doesn&#x27;t work well on very fine hair.  I stopped using the chemical when I got chemical burns when I accidentally left it on too long.  So I decided to try this.  I liked it enough that I bought another larger one.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for the few dollars, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. I have used one just like it for several years. Yes, the first few times you use it it does hurt some but nothing like waxing! My daughter is growing to love it as much as her mom.</li>
            <li> It works well, exactly as I expected.  It  does feel a little bit harsher than my older model.  But it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair behind. Doesn&#x27;t work well at all! I was very very disappointed in this product as it did not perform as I expected.</li>
            <li> i dont like is painful i dont use  u have to tweeze you hair in your chin i dont like that</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a hormone problem that involves long dark coarse hair that grows on my face and, neck. Using this is hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;First things first. It can burn and, leave &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34; even though your plucking the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair that&#x27;s on your skin can get caught inside the tweezer and, it&#x27;ll actually stop it from running for a few seconds and, then painfully pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the times the tweezer wont even grab the hair or it&#x27;ll just cut the hair in half and, leave annoying stubble behind.&lt;br /&gt;It gets more dead skin than actual hair.. By the time I&#x27;m done using it, the entire cap has dead skin inside of it and, not one peach fuzz or coarse hair will be found.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if suffer from the same condition as myself, you&#x27;re better off just getting laser treatment done because, not even an epilator can get rid of the embarrassment of facial hair.</li>
            <li> i love this.  I had one years ago and could not find one until recently.  I actually ordered two but only received one.&lt;br /&gt;This really works well.</li>
            <li> Works really good for the price!  Worth it!!</li>
            <li> I I had one before and I think they are the greatest thing they came out with.</li>
            <li> I love this device!  I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;d have to resort to shaving my unwanted facial hair if ever they so making this product! Only con is it causes ingrown hair on my chin. But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> love this&lt;br /&gt;Whe your in a hurrry it is great whe you doint have the time to tweez the hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> This thing is worthless.  Once in a great while it might snag a hair, but that is all. I bought it to use on some hairs above my upper lip and it does nothing.  A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> In the past decade +  I have used this product bi- weekly and it solved my mustache, beard, and face fuzz issues completely without the high cost of other methods that didn&#x27;t perform the results EZ Tweezer does.  Much to my dismay, as I age...all the problem facial hair has increased.  Who knew aging means more facial hair for women as their female hormones decrease?  I believe I&#x27;m now on my 3rd set as I now keep one in the glove box and one in my grooming supplies.  Recently, due to serious arthritis wrist and hand issues, I gifted my hair stylist with one to use in exfoliating my invisible to me white facial hairs.  She was astounded with such a product and now uses it and passes the word on to her entire clientele.</li>
            <li> just love the Tweeze - this is my second one - they work great at getting rid of facial hair quick - only use about once a week&lt;br /&gt;my hair is turning grey and this removes hair you can&#x27;t see but shows up in the sunshine</li>
            <li> It does work alright but not as effective as I had hoped.Works good on thin fine hair but for trying to do thicker hair you really have to go over it many times. It was worth the money and does alright as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting anything like shaving legs etc with it.</li>
            <li> Not good. save your money for something better</li>
            <li> Shipped fastly but It&#x27;s just wast of money it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t plucked even a single hair m soo disappointed  so I just give one star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and loved it. I bought two--one for home and one for travel kit. Perfect for annoying hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> love this, takes the little hairs right off and I put it in my purse, can do eyebrows too</li>
            <li> Not the best epilator out there, but it works well enough.  I get a lot of chin and neck hairs that I would rather not think about, but this thing takes &#x27;em out pretty well.  Just gotta keep fresh batteries in it!</li>
            <li> Better than using regular tweezers. Does not pinch you skin.</li>
            <li> It does not do the job it&#x27;s supposed to.  I owned one of these before that worked perfectly, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> I cant do without my EmjQi. The price is right, it works, is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spring that you just rub along your jaw. works better.</li>
            <li> First one died after two weeks.  Second one died after 4 weeks.  Will not recomend</li>
            <li> Good for very small areas</li>
            <li> Works great,and keeps the hair from menopause on face from building.Removes it totally...Love this product.Doesnt hurt and is just a great product, and price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I had owned this product before but lost it on a trip.  I love being able to get rid of the hair on my upper lip and chin without having to pay the high price of professional waxing.  It is fast and convenient and saves time and money.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It can work if you experiment and figure it out independently. It does not appear to be durable and although the package states that 2 AAA baterries are included, they are not (manufacturer&#x27;s fault and not so much the seller). Not expecting much for the money. The shipping was extremely fast though</li>
            <li> This product is painful and not easily used. Hair was be trimmed first if too long. Grabs skin frequently even when held as taught as possible. Takes several uses to eliminate hair. Lip area is very painful and leaves skin swollen and red. So painful in fact that tears run down your face (Even when used as described). I do not recommend using this product for easy removal of hair. Product says for men or women, but can not be used for mens facial hair and other areas require trimming of hair before use. Not happy with this product and neither was my mom when she tried it as well.</li>
            <li> I have had these prior, but during move last April it got wet and ruined. Purchased new one for lots less money, does same great job as previous. Saves money on professional waxing.</li>
            <li> Great buy on Amazon . You will like the results. Most excellent for us . Absolutely no complaints. Another win win situation and great product</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, the safty cover does&#x27;t stay on so I cut myself twice. Plus says comes with batteries and they are not in the package.</li>
            <li> Great product.. keeps my face clean.. I dont have to wait 2-3 weeks before I can go to the salon to wax.. Two trips to the salon will pay for the product.. almost painless and very effective..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and we were trying to make it pull out at least 1 hair, but really, I should have paid a little bit more and purchase a better one..</li>
            <li> This works great. It did take me a couple of tries to get the hang of it but now it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a long time. This was actually a reorder. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s not very painful and works well for me.</li>
            <li> These work great! removing unwanted hair is not fun but these get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product that will remove man hairs. I don&#x27;t have little dainty fine blond hairs, I have straight up whiskers. I can only pluck because nothing else works on them. This thing clears about 10% maybe of the hair I need it to clear. I have used it twice. It is not painful but then again I pluck a ton of hair from my chin and neck area so gauging pain is probably not a good thing for me to do.</li>
            <li> I had bought the Tweeze about 7 years ago, and loved it.  I thought I would replace it as after seven years I thought the blade wheel was not quite as effective as when it was new.  What I received wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the quality as my original Tweeze.  The construction was shoddy.  Very cheap plastic and the seams had gaps. When I put batteries in, the device automatically went on and the off switch did not work at all, so while the batteries were in it was in on mode perpetually.  It is completely unusable, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I have one I have used for a long time and when my daughter comes over she uses it. I bought it for a Christmas present. It has always done a good job and the battery life is long.</li>
            <li> works but you have to go over and over to get all the hair.  for price I recommend though, it is a quick way to do lip if no time to wax.</li>
            <li> I received a pack today. It took too long (more than one month) but I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> i have tried everything and this works great i would  tell people to buy this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without a Emjoi Tweeze in my life...the best way to remove facial hair I have come accross in all my years of tweezing!</li>
            <li> I was most pleased at your rapid response to my request and how quickly they arrived.  I so much appreciate the fact that you found them for me.  It is a wonderful product and I have had mine for over 10 years and wanted to buy one for a gift and have another on hand for myself, if the first one met its demise!  Thank you very, very much!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one I have had for several years. I feel it is not quite the quality as my original, even though it works great and I love using it. It arrived a lot quicker than I had thought it would.</li>
            <li> Good product should have got two</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and recived it in a timely fashion. When I opened product it didnt work. Company sent second product and that one did not work. So now I have two same eztweezers that are useless. Ive tried to contact company about fixing the problem and have received no response. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> Love it!  Was cheaper than I could find it anywhere else.  Work&#x27;s great and I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Works good but after some use it no longer gets rid of the hair.  Wishing it was long term!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing tweezer ever. I have purchased 3 of them and have one in each room of the house. It pulls those little chin and mustache hairs out, doesn&#x27;t hurt and lasts forever with just a change of batteries.</li>
            <li> I can use this by feel withoput putting on my glasses. Slick, works quickly and I&#x27;m ready for work in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this! Love how it works but hate having to use it! That being said, it works quickly and is sorta of like pulling tape off your face! There is some discomfort as your are plucking out hair but it is only momentarily!</li>
            <li> Being postmenapausel, I have a great deal of peach fuzz on my face. You can feel it pulling \\&quot;tweezing34;, yet I wish it became as clean as waxing</li>
            <li> I had purchased one about 5 years ago and the motor on it was much stronger then this one. This one barely pulls the eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> Painful, but does the job. If you have senitive skin I would not recamend it. It leaves my face red .</li>
            <li> I was hoping my mother could use this product because she is visually impaired.  Upon investigation I found that she is unable to use it because of her pace maker.  I use it and it does hurt a little, but nothing excruciating.</li>
            <li> this tweezer really hanks at your hair and it is painful to me. I am not saying it mite be to other I am just saying it does on me. I bought this for my lip and not impressed</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive way to remove facial hair.  I keep a couple of them on hand so when one stops working, I have a back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine have been well used for over a year before the switch broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately they are no longer available in retail.  This was the only outlet I could find.</li>
            <li> No more plucking one by one.  This product works great.  I wish I had bought one years ago.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Very pleased with the quality and functionality.</li>
            <li> Works well and I can already see a difference in the hair regrowth.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.  Very little pain while using.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. 👎</li>
            <li> When I first received this item, I opened it and the battery cover was extremely difficult to open.  During the process, the battery cover latch broke, but I held it on with a rubber band and hoped to continue happily.  I was only able to use it twice, from my experience I believe I could have pulled the hair out faster with a pair of tweezers.  I tried to give it another go today and the flipping power button came off!  Do not waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was confident that this product would work, My mother wanted one for Christmas. So, I bought it for her, she tried it and it did not Tweeze a single hair, It would make loud noise, and it would smell like burnt rubber. I will not recommend anyone this product, or the seller. For this awful experience, I rate it a one star. I hate it. I would like My money back!</li>
            <li> did not work period ..it took for ever to get this item compared to the other items and it did not work period....can I get that one star removed..DON&#x27;T BUY THIS</li>
            <li> It seems like I got a used one. It was greasy and I found what it looks like a blond hair in it!!! I didn&#x27;t return it, because its not worth it. I didn&#x27;t give one star because the product it self looks working and good for the price.</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.  I get facial hairs and I am black haired and dark complexion (I am french) and this has been a problem for me for a long time.  My Mother also had them.  This has been a dream come true.  I just shave them off with this and away  they go.  A friend recommended it to me as I was using other stuff.  I definitely would recommend it to you or anyone, because you are eventually going to have this problem .</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I wore out the first one.  I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough and my friend seem to like it they all want on. It take a little getting accustom too though.</li>
            <li> This little gadget really works. I shaved my legs first then I used it a couple of days later. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It takes the facial hair away with no problem at all......I keep mine right by the computer and do it all the time..my friend and her mother bought one too and they love em too</li>
            <li> This replaced my old worn out one. I was very happy to find them again, so I stocked up.</li>
            <li> Worked for 2 days. Tossed it. It was too expensive to return...</li>
            <li> Had one before.  These don&#x27;t seem to work as well</li>
            <li> So bad...I opened it and a piece of plastic fell out. I put the batteries in and it started up. Tried it-didn&#x27;t work so shut it off and started reading the instructions. All of the sudden it started on its own and I couldn&#x27;t get it to shut off so I took a battery out. The next day I tried it again and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. It is going back. Perhaps the next step up is better?</li>
            <li> This is my second one purchased-wore the first one out !! Love this product and would highly recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have had an electric tweezer previously and loved it.  This one is excellent.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> got it for a birthday gift and the woman just loves it thanks</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that the item will probably not perform at initial level for a long time but am satisfied for now. I had another product from same brand and was very satisfied until it developed rechargeable battery issues but this one seems to be more cheaply made. I am satisfied that I got what I expected for the price though and it is small and handy for travel.</li>
            <li> The picture was of 2 packages, there was a picture of a single one for $12.99</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I would have liked it or not since it never worked.  The packaging says it includes a battery, it didn&#x27;t.  Not worth returning it as it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> THE EMJOI TWEEZE HAIR REMOVER DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL. DIDN&#x27;T REMOVE ANY HAIR. IF YOU HAVE THIN HAIR IT MAY WORK FOR YOU BUT IF YOU HAVE THICK COURSE HAIR SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> It met my expect ions completely.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Blades move rough and remove very little hair.  I purchased one about 2008 that worked beautiful but apparently they are made different now.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how such a little thing could work so well.  It is not for a man to use on his beard, it works on fine hairs. Now I am thinking of buying one with multiple tweezer removal. The price was low enough for me to just buy it to try it. Great</li>
            <li> Not impressed. It is not gentle to the skin. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first epi I got it,I don&#x27;t know all r same /just this one is like it ,I don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> It sucks! It doesn&#x27;t really pull any hair but it does pull a lot of your skin that&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
            <li> Good wau to remove unwanted hair. Fast and minimal pain! The best product I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time. I love having my wiskers plucked out by this machine.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a Tweeze from wal-mart a few years ago,And has been the best thing I had ever used.So glad amason had them...</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product sooner. I wouldn&#x27;t have gone thru so much stress regarding hair removal. I am very pleased with it and going to buy 2  more for my daughters. The price is so incredibly reasonable!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these several years ago.  I just needed to replace it before it quits on me. great little compact devise.  recommend it highly.  make sure skin is clean and just keep it taught. works great!</li>
            <li> This works like a dream.  Gone in 60 seconds is the best name for it.  Easy to clean too, and the battery last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of them 1 for me, and that one was broken. The cap was already broken off and it didn&#x27;t work to good because I wasn&#x27;t able to get the cap to stay on. So I didn&#x27;t really get to try it out all that great. Delivery was on time, no problem there.</li>
            <li> Got it on ebay for 10 bucks or so but it does the job as long as you have the time, if it had more pully things it would be the best. But for a cheap price it works :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far.  Hope it continues to work as promised. Leaves skin feeling soft  Seems like some products leave razor burn. Yes, it hurts at first, but you kind of get used to it especially when there are fewer hairs to remove. It&#x27;s so nice not to have to worry about hairs on my chin for almost a week. Free shipping would have made the purchase even better but things aren&#x27;t always ideal. I bought it based on good reviews so thanks for the review process, it helps buying things sight unseen.</li>
            <li> the cap thingy on mine sort of broke. the product itself works, but i need to hold the little cap thingy on with some masking tape. the tweezing ability of this is...okay. it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> This is great if you have a couple hairs on your toes but I wouldn&#x27;t put it near my face or worse my bikini like like I did - takes much to much time.  I&#x27;d rather wax.</li>
            <li> you get what for pay for! i can&#x27;t understand the good reviews. I used it twice before it died, its not like i have a beard, i have fine hair but long around my lips an jaw line. it was alittle painful felt like little zapps. changed batties and everything, even for the price should last loner then 2 uses at most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tweeze for years &amp; was disappointed to discover, when i had to replace mine, that retail stores stopped carrying them. I checked amazon &amp; was relieved to see it listed. HOWEVER, how disappoited I was when I used it! The power was very low &amp; i had to go over spots 4-5 times for it to pull out the hair. At 1st  I thought it was the batteries. But I tried in 3 sets of brand new batteris. I am going ask for replacement only because this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever experienced this problem w/a tweeze.</li>
            <li> I had an original EmjQi and it was wonderful, this one is painful and harsh.</li>
            <li> As a woman gets older she gets chin hairs and her eyesight gets worse. You don&#x27;t have to have good eyesight to get rid of the chin hairs.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one, I love it, it removes the hair from the root and it is faster than just tweezing.  I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther</li>
            <li> I bought this to navigate small portions of my knees where razors don&#x27;t navigate well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggested, I started by attempting to remove the fine hairs on the back of my hand/wrist area to get an idea of how the device felt.  As far as I can tell, it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my arm, where the hairs are longer and coarser.  I did manage to mostly remove a small circle of hair -- the longer, coarser hairs, that is.  The short fine ones remained in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hair on my knees?  My hair is fine and then was about 1/8&amp;#34; long.  After a couple of minutes, I managed to pluck a couple of hairs, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison&#x27;s sake (for this review), I tried the device on my big toe, where the hair is still only about 1/8&amp;#34; long but much coarser.  I spotted a hair and used this device or perhaps a minute, attempting to remove that hair.  The hair is still firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically: it&#x27;s possible this might work for someone with a different hair type, but for me it was completely useless.</li>
            <li> This do not work for hairy armpits &#x3D;p. It does not pull out any hair. I ended up buying a similar brand and it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great...really fast,really clean..Does not pinch or pull.No redness ,leaves skin very smooth...Excellent size,color and easy to use.Would definitely recommend it to others...</li>
            <li> This seems to do what it is meant to do, pull hair out by the root. It kind of hurts though and is better at grabbing longer hair. Doesn&#x27;t work on short razor stubble type of hair. So be careful if you use it too close to your hairline.. it will remove those fast too!</li>
            <li> Awhile ago someone gave us a Tweeze. We fell in love with it right away. When one of my daughters moved to college she wasn&#x27;t able to take our only Tweeze with her. So, for Christmas I bought her one from Amazon. She thought it was the greatest gift in the world. I would recommend this product to all women who want to get rid of unwanted facial hair without using a manual tweezer. It&#x27;s safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had one before, when it was on t.v., it seems perhaps it had more grips or heads? That one worked great. this one seem very inferior in guality and is useless.</li>
            <li> Great little tool to get those stray hairs we women are subject to after we reach a certain age. A little pinch, because it is a tweezer on steroids. Love it.</li>
            <li> have to have it at the right angle and go over and over an area to get individual hairs. meh, you get what you pay for :-/</li>
            <li> This is a great automatic tweezer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) does not shave! it pulls out / tweezes your hair like a tweezer. that means that your hair will come back thinner&lt;br /&gt;2) actually works!&lt;br /&gt;3) pulls even the tiny fine white hairs on the surface of your face&lt;br /&gt;4) easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;5) strong unit, wont break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) battery life doesn&#x27;t last. It works best with a fresh pair of batteries because then the motor runs very fast. maybe it&#x27;s the batter that I buy.&lt;br /&gt;2) it&#x27;s loud and sounds like an electric razor. so if anyone catches you using this it will look like your shaving your face lol.&lt;br /&gt;3) the little plastic cap will get lost but it is not important.&lt;br /&gt;4) not precise. it will work for general areas like the arm, armpit, cheek, chin. but you cant shape your eyebrows with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;great product for the girl who has a lot of tiny little unwanted hairs. works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I got the item, I THOUGHT it was a complete waste of money before I opened it. Then after opening it up and trying it out I KNEW it was. Side note....it did not include the batteries as the packaging said it does.</li>
            <li> Emjoi products are excellent.  It works really well and really doesn&#x27;t hurt - you feel a tug when it pulls a hair out.  Might hurt the first time, but minor.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to turn it on. Thought the button was broken. Lol didn&#x27;t know I had to push the button upwards not press it down. Anyways, all I have to say is that it works.</li>
            <li> Had a co-worker that let me use the tweezer and loved it.  great gift for any family member or friend.</li>
            <li> Cannot keep batteries in it and the battery cover does not fit after you put batteries in it. Don&#x27;rt waste your money!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. doesn&#x27;t really get the hairs that I needed it too.</li>
            <li> These are a cheap knock off and they don&#x27;t even remove the hair like the tweeze should.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the original, more like cheap knockoffs that do not do the job. These were not sturdy or well made, like the original. The plastic cover that goes over the rotating pieces does not stay on nor does the battery compartment cover once the batteries are in place. Worst of all, the units would not remove hair at the root (like they are supposed to) and actually burned/cut my face, leaving abrasions all over my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  My wife was excited to use it but it didn&#x27;t work as well as she expected it.  Too bad it was a really compact and nice looking device</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is great for catching the long hairs that older women get on their chins. In fact, I bought several for gifts. However, I have not rated it very high, because that is really all it does. And while it does it well, it is advertised as doing much more.</li>
            <li> I find this product very effective.  It removes the tiny facial peach fuzz and coarser facial hairs.  It is slightly uncomfortable, but if used routinely the discomfort diminishes.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this, especially because I own a larger epilator from Emjoi. This one is incredibly cheaply made and extremely poor quality.  Not only that, but when I used it it actually removed my skin!  Once the redness died down I had three  patches where there was scratching and a thin layer of skin gone:  on the side of my eyebrow, at the sideburn and upper lip! And I definitely know how to use an epilator since I already own one. This product is a hazard!!!</li>
            <li> Bought 3, don&#x27;t wast your money. This item does not work as advertised. Advertised as &amp;#34;batteries included but no batteries came with anyh of them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these and they&#x27;ve all worked very well. you can use it anywhere on your body, but if it&#x27;s your first time trying it, try maybe your arm as there is a bit of pain, kind of like a quick needle poke, but you get use to it and it&#x27;s no problem, my friends keep stealing mine from me. I would recommend these, saves going to the salon to get your hair waxed that&#x27;s for sure!!</li>
            <li> Still works! One thing: you&#x27;ll go through batteries pretty quickly on it. But, it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I had the first one for 4-5 years. This little machine plucks your hair, it is not a shaver. So no encouraging of the hair growing back thicker. It is easy to use. I wore the first one out. Quality for price.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item and it did not turn out the same for me. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It does not work at all. Not even in small areas such as your upper lip. I am very unsattisfied with this product! Lessoned learned (Never by as seen on tv products)!!!</li>
            <li> I already have had several Tweezy Epilators and I liked them.  This is the same as the others but this one came from Hong Kong and is terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well and makes a horrible noise while operating.  I have thrown it away.</li>
            <li> Neither of them worked and there were no batteries.</li>
            <li> Mine is not removing anything, a waste of money. I dont recommend it.</li>
            <li> must have for my eyesight</li>
            <li> This was made out to be a GREAT product.  It&#x27;s a so-so product.  I thought that it would take care of all of my facial hair.  It didn&#x27;t.  And it&#x27;s LOUD.  Very loud.</li>
            <li> These work well but take a long time to receive.  You only receive one so I am not sure why they show two.</li>
            <li> I use it every week no problem Just make sure you have batteries (you will need to replace them every 3 or so months if you use it more than once a week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other cheap face epilators in the past and I&#x27;ve never had one that is new that works maybe 1 out of 3 tries.  And when it does work, even with new batteries, it slows down to a crawl in a matter of a few minutes.  Will not be ordering this brand again!  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I had my first Tweezy for 4 years. I dropped it and one of the plastic tabs broke that hold the cover on, but I was able to continue using it for another year or so. Finally, however, after using it approx once every six weeks or so, for four years, it finally gave out. I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without my Tweezy, so I ordered this second one. I figure that for the price, I got four years of use--a really good deal.</li>
            <li> This works great for unwanted facial hair!! The price is low and saves you money and time getting waxed!! It feels better than waxing too!! No pain and gets fine hairs as well! Highly recommend and I&#x27;m going to buy another to put in my purse!!</li>
            <li> I use to remove a few hair from my toe. Works great.</li>
            <li> Items did not work correctly. Did not send back because it cost more to do that than throw item away. I have had Emjoi tweezer for years. Never had a problem. I thought I would buy new one before they discontinued them. This one was a failure!!</li>
            <li> It  does a wonderful job with next to no pain!  Very easy to use with very little cost.  I like the new On/Off button which doesn&#x27;t bump on so easily and run the battery down.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like my old one!  It was very inexpensive so, in fact, I just threw it out!  This one product made me very leary about ordering anything else but I have &amp; I&#x27;ve been pleased!  (except for this one!)</li>
            <li> love it it is very nice to have</li>
            <li> I have several of these EmjQi Tweezer Epilators, and they work rather well.  Sometimes there is a difference in performance even though I bought the same product at different times, but all of them are fairly efficient and remove all but the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought one for each of us.  much cheaper than the &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; and probably just as effective.  We all like this product</li>
            <li> It removed some of the fine hairs but skipped a lot of them</li>
            <li> This was not as good as the one that I had bought from Bed Bath and Beyond many years ago.  It still works ok but it has a machine oil smell when it is being used.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this product, it works great. It arrived on time and exactly as described. I will recommend this item ot friends and family.I have tried other products but this one works best and last longer.</li>
            <li> Love these.  For such an inexpensive item, its surprising how well them work.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife she has been wanting one for a few months now.. An she loves it.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it is easy. But be careful if you do not hold your skin it will pinch! ::read the instructions::</li>
            <li> Chin and upper lip hairs are bane to me. The chin hairs especially, because they grow back in rapidly. It seems that I&#x27;m having to pluck nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my upper lip, I&#x27;ve done waxing twice. Oh dear holy mother of all that is good did that hurt like a stubbed toe - both times! I swore it ripped off a layer of my flesh. Very painful. Never ever ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chin is just darn ridiculous to do anything than tweezing since they are sparse, but they come in dark and thicker than the normal skin fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Emjoi Tweeze for dirt cheap and decided to give it a try. I am surprised how well it worked. An ever bigger surprise, the pain was minimal. Super duper! I tweezed my upper lip and chin. With the vibration of the unit against my skin, I can barely feel the fine hair plucking. Occasionally it will grab a stubborn or thicker hair with a bit of \\&quot;thunk\\&quot; making me flinch a bit more out of surprise than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done, I had redness in the areas tweezed and there was a bit of discomfort. Nothing severe though. I really expected the tweezing to hurt more, but I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t! Now I can grab those hard to see chin hair without having to strain my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Tweeze is a somewhat buzzy noisy unit and may look a little scary. However, it does a pretty darn good job. How much it will hurt really depends on the person. If you can pick up a Tweeze for cheap, give a go.</li>
            <li> Epilators hurt a bit, pinch sometimes &amp; do not grab every hair...I like this one because it does a pretty darn good job &amp; yes it is much faster &amp; less painful than tweezing 1 by 1 or waxing. I proabably will stick to shaving large areas like my long legs, &amp; I won&#x27;t use this on my upper lip or bikini area. I like to use it for my brows, &amp; the peach fuzz on the sides of my face. Handy for quick touch-ups. Makes the grooming process faster &amp; relatively more efficient but no epilator should cost over $10.00 in my opinion. My plastic gaurd cap already has a crack in it &amp; could be a little easier to detach &amp; reattach for cleaning.</li>
            <li> You may have to play around with it to get it to work the way you want.  If you have problems holding tweezers, this is a good alternative.</li>
