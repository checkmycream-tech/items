            <li>/&gt;(I got this for a reduced price for a product review and my opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li>When on skin, looks nice.</li>
            <li>Good product and the service is great ;-)</li>
            <li>Very easy to use dropper</li>
            <li>I love the feeling, wrinkles are saying bye, love it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it works!</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals are committed to only producing the very finest in skin care to woman around the world to give the very best because woman are all beautiful and they need to feel it through the product for the confidence and empowerment woman feel when they try Azure Natursl.</li>
            <li>Retinol is the most effective ingredients to target and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it works</li>
            <li>I had more wrinkles</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my Face feel so smooth, I use it at night under night cream!</li>
            <li>It seems to peel the most around those areas</li>
            <li>I make sure I use correct sun screen.</li>
            <li>this one is even better.</li>
            <li>Need more time.</li>
            <li>I love this product and as finances allow, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>Maybe the longer I use it, I will see more difference.</li>
            <li>This product is ok</li>
            <li>but I like the OZ Naturals better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, makes my face feel good...but has done nothing for the surface or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a year</li>
            <li>and when face is moisturized and hydrated, your face has more plump and volume to it meaning a more lifted and firmer skin texture and feel to it.</li>
            <li>Many cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>Better product than Lancome or my perscription of retinol .02%</li>
            <li>best when night moisturizer applied over this product preventing the dry skin feeling in the morning.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product as I have used Azure Naturals vitamin C serum in the past (before I started making my own and saving $$) and was happy with that product, so I figured their retinol product would be really good.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply to my face at night after I washed it and it didn&#x27;t give me any rashes or zits yet.</li>
            <li>I had a question or two and the reply came very quickly.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong.</li>
            <li>In addition, the fines lines around my mouth area have begun to diminish - huge visible difference.  </li>
            <li>a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take care not to get it around my nostrils or lips next time.  </li>
            <li>I was clinically diagnosed in 2011 with a very rare skin disease known as, Pyoderma Faciale.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I notice my chest where I have the most sun spot damage is lightening up and much more soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a good month before I give my final review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li>I like it very much !</li>
            <li>Healthy new skin emerges and that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first use I felt skin of my face more tight and bright.</li>
            <li>i absolutely  love Azure Natural  serum.</li>
            <li>This product is safe for all woman of all skin type even sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>Garbage worthy , save your dollar, if anything it can cause zits due to awesome pore clogging action,texture is thick hair gel with side of bump cottage cheese, smell is old, and in no way does it contain anything good for your face</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price is just right and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>The seller emailed instruction on the day I received the products to make sure I knew how to use them - that was unexpected but greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Female likes bright and inviting bottles, not black.</li>
            <li>I have to tell that Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti-Wrinkle Serum is one of mine favorite rejuvenating products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 3 months, with no improvement in my wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li>Used consistently for almost a month</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received serum quickly and like it so far.</li>
            <li>I was struggling with the fine lines above my lip and on my forehead</li>
            <li>/&gt;After three months, I really do notice a difference, especially with the fine vertical lines that were forming about my lip and in my forehead.</li>
            <li>Have not seen much results.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>works well as a skin smoother and softener, but not so much as a wrinkle eraser.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency on my face and fast absorption.</li>
            <li>Have seen much improvement in my skin since buying this serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle to the skin and is working well for my skin.</li>
            <li>As for wrinkles, maybe some improvement but not so much that I can be sure, or perhaps from an OTC treatment, that is what can be expected at my age.  </li>
            <li>I have had better results with Morning Light Beauty retinol cream which, by the way, has the same exact ingredients as a much more expensive competitor.  </li>
            <li>It did not provide enough results (really saw none) to warrant another purchase, especially since I need a moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>(I have read that this helps keep your skin healthy despite pollutants in the air, and the citrus helps fade scars and dark spots).</li>
            <li>and I do use an organic moisturizer along with another product that has retinol (the other product actually ended my adult acne - Neutrogena Night, which is a great product, but wasn&#x27;t slowing down the fine vertical wrinkles about my lip).</li>
            <li>After using the first bottle (truth: have now switched to another product), can say that my skin is brighter and more clear, pores appear less noticeable and for 65+ yo skin, that says a lot.  </li>
            <li>Over time (first bottle) I am definitely noticing a reduction in fine lines and an overall difference!</li>
            <li>so expectations should not be particularly high.</li>
            <li>It is been little time, but skin looks brighter and tighter every time I use it :)</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C helped the scar not become very visible, and it made it softer and just completely helped to blend it.</li>
            <li>Scarring has been reduced to just little tiny dots, skin tone looks better than it has even before getting Pyoderma Faciale, and my confidence, which is PRICELESS, has been restored!  ...not to mention, the little fine lines that I was starting to get around my eyes and mouth, are hardly noticeable!  </li>
            <li>I’m always scared to try something new</li>
            <li>I went from really beautifully smooth skin, to very rough, scarred, and pitted skin, in just a matter of one year.  </li>
            <li>I really have my doubts about how much retinol is actually in this product</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals is a high quality face skincare and anti-aging with natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a glow and feels so soft with no added fragrance.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am early 20s and learned this is the time to start with fighting wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I do have extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So rare at the time, that only 22 reported cases in the entire world had been documented!  </li>
            <li>Also I should say I have very thin, fair, sensitive skin and have had no adverse reaction using the products as prescribed.</li>
            <li>I have used these types of serums before (other brands - much more expensive) and they did not come close to delivering the visible, quick improvements/turnaround in my skins texture, clarity and brightness.  </li>
            <li>I think this is doing good for my face but think also I waited a little late to start using it because no product can erase everything I want it to, after&lt;br /&gt;74 years!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, subtle, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it few time and first thing</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a few weeks, but like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Although it initially made my cheeks and chin breakout, I decided to use the product on two areas - my upper lip area (fine vertical lines) and on my forehead (cheeks and chin were not happy with it).</li>

            <li> but it can peel away dead skin to a lesser degree and helps new collagen production nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Caused no harm, no redness, excessive dryness or flakiness, so that is very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it, and it works</li>
            <li> Received serum quickly and like it so far. Leaves skin soft, subtle, absorbs quickly. Will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> After a while my skin really dried out. I had more wrinkles then I had before. Now having to use oil to help hydrate.</li>
            <li> Garbage worthy , save your dollar, if anything it can cause zits due to awesome pore clogging action,texture is thick hair gel with side of bump cottage cheese, smell is old, and in no way does it contain anything good for your face</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. I am seeing results. Use at night for the best results!</li>
            <li> Good product and the service is great ;-)</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it few time and first thing I noticed was how tight my skin was. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few weeks, but like it very much.  It makes my Face feel so smooth, I use it at night under night cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months went to my cousins baby shower and was asked 3 times what am using my eyes and skin look amaz:ing have not seen my aunt in over a year she couldnt believe the difference.Soooo happy 58 and will take all and any compliments.</li>
            <li> Have not seen much results. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a good month before I give my final review. It was easy to apply to my face at night after I washed it and it didn&#x27;t give me any rashes or zits yet. So far it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I got this for a reduced price for a product review and my opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.  I have a saggy neck and I saw a noticeable difference in the wrinkles around my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Retin A I used to use but it can peel away dead skin to a lesser degree and helps new collagen production nonetheless.  Healthy new skin emerges and that&#x27;s a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take care not to get it around my nostrils or lips next time.  It seems to peel the most around those areas and I don&#x27;t see it til the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I think this is doing good for my face but think also I waited a little late to start using it because no product can erase everything I want it to, after&lt;br /&gt;74 years!</li>
            <li> From the spouse of account holder. ....&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! ! Gives my skin a glow and feels so soft with no added fragrance. I make sure I use correct sun screen.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong. Experienced headaches.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time and buy for my sister also.</li>
            <li> i absolutely  love Azure Natural  serum. i have purchased  around 3 different bottles. they all are amazing. this one is even better. its not smelly or sticky. it actually smells like Green tea and Aloe which are in thus serum. the product  does what it say. i have been using it for 2 weeks. mornings  and nights. i have noticed my pores less and less. your face feels beautifully soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals have great products.  I like the wrinkle eraser 2.5% and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I like it very much ! I use at night alone with a bit of rosehip oil, because my skin a bit dry and in the morning  alone with vitamin C serum. It is been little time, but skin looks brighter and tighter every time I use it :)</li>
            <li> My friends&#x27; comments about how &amp;#34;happy and glowing&amp;#34; I look are all the proof I need! Over time (first bottle) I am definitely noticing a reduction in fine lines and an overall difference!</li>
            <li> Bought all 3 of the Azure products - c serum, retinol serum, hyaluronic serum.  I have used these types of serums before (other brands - much more expensive) and they did not come close to delivering the visible, quick improvements/turnaround in my skins texture, clarity and brightness.  In addition, the fines lines around my mouth area have begun to diminish - huge visible difference.  The seller emailed instruction on the day I received the products to make sure I knew how to use them - that was unexpected but greatly appreciated. I had a question or two and the reply came very quickly. If you can&#x27;t decide whether to try these or not - I would say don&#x27;t hesitate.  Also I should say I have very thin, fair, sensitive skin and have had no adverse reaction using the products as prescribed.</li>
            <li> I have to tell that Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti-Wrinkle Serum is one of mine favorite rejuvenating products.&lt;br /&gt;After first use I felt skin of my face more tight and bright. Having sensitive skin I’m always scared to try something new but Azure Serum hasn&#x27;t caused me to have any breakouts or rash.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti-Wrinkle Serum almost month, every night and I have to tell that appearance of my skin is very good. I have compliments and see myself that those small spider wrinkles are gone. Face is not oily, well moisturized, luminous.&lt;br /&gt;Serum has just the right consistency not too thin or thick or odor at all. Very easy to use dropper but I have only one advice to company- change design of bottle or label. Female likes bright and inviting bottles, not black.</li>
            <li> When on skin, looks nice. Not quite moisturizing enough for my skin. Doesn&#x27;t carry over from application to application.</li>
            <li> Anxious to test it... looks as advertised</li>
            <li> Just started using. Seems to be working. Need more time. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and as finances allow, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Seem to be breaking out from this product. Will write a follow up...</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Nope. Don&#x27;t buy it. Spend your hard earned cash on something that works.</li>
            <li> This Azure Naturals Anti-Wrinke Serum is amazing!  I was clinically diagnosed in 2011 with a very rare skin disease known as, Pyoderma Faciale.  So rare at the time, that only 22 reported cases in the entire world had been documented!  There are still no definite answers as to what causes Pyoderma Faciale, and, unfortunately, because I was pregnant with my third child when diagnosed, the dermatologists and doctors could not treat me for it.  I had to suffer through the cycle, of what lasted months, of my face being taken over by horribly painful and very large cysts.  I went from really beautifully smooth skin, to very rough, scarred, and pitted skin, in just a matter of one year.  Having scarring on my face has been really difficult for me, since I am not one of those women that have thousands of dollars to spend on those outrageously expensive face treatments, to restore my skin and feel good again.  My good friend, who is a licensed aesthetician, turned me on to this product about a month ago.  I have used it every night before going to bed, and...WOW!!!!  In just a month, my skin doesn&#x27;t even look the same!  Scarring has been reduced to just little tiny dots, skin tone looks better than it has even before getting Pyoderma Faciale, and my confidence, which is PRICELESS, has been restored!  ...not to mention, the little fine lines that I was starting to get around my eyes and mouth, are hardly noticeable!  I am so thankful for this product, and will continue to buy it, FOREVER!  Thank you to Azure Naturals!  Oh, and the price is just right and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> grate effect  of retinol ,but without no overdrying and crack!</li>
            <li> All the reviews have to be fake</li>
            <li> Not sure about &amp;#34;wrinkle eraser&amp;#34;.  I ordered this product as I have used Azure Naturals vitamin C serum in the past (before I started making my own and saving $$) and was happy with that product, so I figured their retinol product would be really good.  Unfortunately I did not see much of a difference in using this product (after a month).  It is a serum, so I needed to apply a moisturizer over it.  My face felt very dry if I did not.  It did not provide enough results (really saw none) to warrant another purchase, especially since I need a moisturizer on top of it.  So I decided to go with another company&#x27;s retinol moisturizing cream.  I have had better results with Morning Light Beauty retinol cream which, by the way, has the same exact ingredients as a much more expensive competitor.  On the plus side, this product did not give me any skin irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li> works well as a skin smoother and softener, but not so much as a wrinkle eraser. Of course it&#x27;s not prescription strength so expectations should not be particularly high. Maybe the longer I use it, I will see more difference.</li>
            <li> excellent 100% recommended</li>
            <li> This product is ok but I like the OZ Naturals better.  This is an extremely greasy product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, makes my face feel good...but has done nothing for the surface or wrinkles.  Another gimmick.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like me.</li>
            <li> After using the first bottle (truth: have now switched to another product), can say that my skin is brighter and more clear, pores appear less noticeable and for 65+ yo skin, that says a lot.  As for wrinkles, maybe some improvement but not so much that I can be sure, or perhaps from an OTC treatment, that is what can be expected at my age.  Did feel face was dry in AM as only use at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caused no harm, no redness, excessive dryness or flakiness, so that is very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did best when night moisturizer applied over this product preventing the dry skin feeling in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.  No visible results what so ever.  I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> The is retinol serum is good I guess. I have been using it for more than a year but I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes to my skin. Granted I am only 24 and have not developed wrinkles yet. I suppose it is a good thing my skin hasn&#x27;t changed but I do not know if this product helped or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 3 months, with no improvement in my wrinkles at all. I really have my doubts about how much retinol is actually in this product but I&#x27;m not a scientist. I must give their customer service an A +. Requested a refund with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals is a high quality face skincare and anti-aging with natural and organic ingredients. Azure Naturals are committed to only producing the very finest in skin care to woman around the world to give the very best because woman are all beautiful and they need to feel it through the product for the confidence and empowerment woman feel when they try Azure Natursl. This product is safe for all woman of all skin type even sensitive skin.    Vitamin A definetly works wonders. Retinol is the most effective ingredients to target and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It is  proven to improve pigmentation,  dark age spots,  dark circkes, puffiness,  skin texture, tone, color, increase moisture and hydration that means bye byes to dull and dried skin and when face is moisturized and hydrated, your face has more plump and volume to it meaning a more lifted and firmer skin texture and feel to it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly; not greasy; works to reduce appearance of sun spots; made my skin softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None as of now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum! It is easy to apply and it works! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I notice my chest where I have the most sun spot damage is lightening up and much more soft. Also have been using it on a cut that would have turned into a bad scar. This Vitamin C helped the scar not become very visible, and it made it softer and just completely helped to blend it. I also use this product on my face, around my eyes, on my neck, shoulders, and as mentioned before, my chest. I have started to use it on my legs, just to see if it makes them any brighter or softer and it has! (softer)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> No major changes so far, but I have only used it for a few weeks - I was hoping to peel a bit.  I like the consistency on my face and fast absorption.</li>
            <li> Have seen much improvement in my skin since buying this serum. I have had problematic skin for my entire adolescence and this stuff has helped me get it under control. Also, the renewal properties are helping repair all the damage from past acne. I use it at night and use the Vitamin C serum during the day (I have read that this helps keep your skin healthy despite pollutants in the air, and the citrus helps fade scars and dark spots). When I wake up in the morning my skin just looks glowy and smoother. Pores also look smaller. I am early 20s and learned this is the time to start with fighting wrinkles. Definitely helps with skin renewal at night.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!! This has made my face softer and u can see the crow lines disappear</li>
            <li> I have been using this for few months now. It&#x27;s gentle to the skin and is working well for my skin. People who have not used retinol before should start with a very less quantity. I like the product and it works.</li>
            <li> Although it initially made my cheeks and chin breakout, I decided to use the product on two areas - my upper lip area (fine vertical lines) and on my forehead (cheeks and chin were not happy with it). I do have extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months, I really do notice a difference, especially with the fine vertical lines that were forming about my lip and in my forehead. So, for wrinkles it works. I was struggling with the fine lines above my lip and on my forehead and I do use an organic moisturizer along with another product that has retinol (the other product actually ended my adult acne - Neutrogena Night, which is a great product, but wasn&#x27;t slowing down the fine vertical wrinkles about my lip).</li>
            <li> Thank you for he great product, price,  and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling, wrinkles are saying bye, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. Many cost a lot more. It does take a while to work, a few weeks in fact, and your skin will look worse just before it starts looking better, but keep using it. They recommendation applying it and the adding a moisturizer over it, you will have good results with this method.</li>
            <li> Used consistently for almost a month and I don&#x27;t see even a slight difference in any of my wrinkles</li>
            <li> Better product than Lancome or my perscription of retinol .02%</li>
