            <li>Since I&#x27;m 80+ it doesn&#x27;t do as much good as I would like, but it has lightened and softened the puffs under the eyes.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I originally ordered this product for its price and the good reviews, I have to say I am not at all impressed and saw no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream, it does the job and its super absorbent.</li>
            <li>I bought based on the great reviews...but even Olay is better.</li>
            <li>I love it, it works great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed by how well it works for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will reorder as soon as it starts to run out!</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any uber-expensive eye cream I have tried (and I have tried them all!).</li>
            <li>I will def buy it again, I love organic creams and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have already bought more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product; it reduces puffiness and decreases fine lines.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It hydrates nicely.</li>
            <li>I liked the results.</li>
            <li>I liked the cream because of the way it feels on the skin.  </li>
            <li>but honestly, none of them worked.</li>
            <li>AS A MOISTURIZER.THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, nice texture, seems to be helping with wrinkles, firming, skin color -</li>
            <li>I was excited to see it on Amazon at a great price and prime eligible.</li>
            <li>The consistency is lightweight and goes on the skin very easily.</li>
            <li>makes skin drier and gave me fine lines when I used to have none!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one bottle and my eyelids are now very smooth.</li>
            <li>It rehydrated and is very light.</li>
            <li>Great price also, does as well or better than higher priced options.  </li>
            <li>cream is super good.</li>
            <li>After two days of use, this product showed why so many crave it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price.</li>
            <li>but it does help more then what I thought it would...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free &amp; it works !</li>
            <li>love this eye creme-</li>
            <li>this is an ok eye cream.</li>
            <li>and we both love this.</li>
            <li>I USED THIS CREAM AND FOUND IT TO BE SATISFYING</li>
            <li>I use many products all the time</li>
            <li>I have seen way better results when using Alpha glycolic based moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>Seems to moisturize rather than swell the skin into looking better.</li>
            <li>ok?</li>
            <li>I just love this eye serum</li>
            <li>It seems to work although i do not have many lines or any crows feet yet</li>
            <li>This works well firming the eye area, I recommend once it absorbs put your night eye moisturizer on top of it</li>
            <li>and my eyes look better than they have in 5 years.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Thank You :)</li>
            <li>and I think my makeup looks better when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>and it is more than plenty.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this another try and after about 9 days of use I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and based on the reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I use many of their beauty products.</li>
            <li>Love this for under eye area.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I will continue to order as I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use for a couple more weeks, but at this point would not order again.</li>
            <li>It is a good first step before applying moisturizer and makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled and hope the results hold up, it&#x27;s been 3 months now and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>As a result of continual use, the fine lines around my eyes are softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>It minimize fine lines, therefore giving the eye area a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>The cream is ok for my skin because its fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 and don&#x27;t have any real lines around my eyes to speak of (I have fair skin, but i&#x27;m not a sun person at all), but I do have some darker circles.  </li>
            <li>I didn,t see any significant difference in eye-undwer-eye firming, but it felt ok  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li>I am always hopeful when I see a good review and order a new product.  </li>
            <li>To make these products even better, the prices are more than reasonable!  </li>
            <li>I love its ingredients, it&#x27;s super light weight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any fine lines at the bottom of my eyes anymore, even if I squint them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the fine lines around my eyes but</li>
            <li>So, if your concern is fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend.  </li>
            <li>Very light but powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a HUGE difference in the fine lines around my eyes they have gone away, no lie.</li>
            <li>This eye serum is fantastic.</li>
            <li>AND IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
            <li>MY PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND SECURELY WRAPPED.</li>
            <li>I put it on every morning and every evening it is smooth</li>
            <li>It is great to find a product that actually does what it says it wil.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and worth a gamble!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>It does what it claims  with just a small amount and at a great price!</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s the only eye-cream i use ( I used to use good face moisturizer as eye-cream), I believe it&#x27;s causing the fine lines</li>
            <li>I put it on every morning and every evening, it is smooth and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>My eyes are firm and smooth and bright!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in firmness of skin - but there is a nice almost waxyness to the lotion that leaves the eye area kind of dewy, and it lasts if you use enough.</li>
            <li>Not bad and</li>
            <li>It has no odor, soaks in quickly and does not migrate into my eyes,  Which I</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been far more impressed with this company&#x27;s other skincare, particularly the glycolic acid and the moisturizer creams.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price which is too cheap compare to those high end facial care product.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better, my skin is very very sensitive...</li>
            <li>My skin feels more soft as well!</li>
            <li>I previously purchased these products from a natural supplement store, but because of the excellent service and lower prices from OxKom,  </li>
            <li>I really recommend the product and think it is a tremendous value!</li>
            <li>I prefer my current eye cream better OBAGI Hydroderm, because it smoths out the fine lines while I use it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for quite sometime now and it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It firms the eye area and you can still smile without it feeling like it is going to crack.</li>
            <li>but more of a light gel-like cream, for 3 months and finally just noticed its effects!</li>
            <li>I put on this serum and right away I noticed my eye area firming up and lines tightened and diminished.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that I&#x27;m using this product right now</li>
            <li>Went inside, put it right on.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>Love this as much as the Reviva Facial Cream - will buy this product again - goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and easy to use, morning and night.</li>
            <li>no bags, nice and supple and NO new wrinkles.</li>
            <li>For me they make it seem as if I have had a &#x27;little something done&#x27; in a good way.</li>
            <li>but.. Bottle is almost empty and still haven&#x27;t seen amazing results yet..</li>
            <li>Works on the first application.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>only gave this 4 stars because in reality it&#x27;s not a miracle worker You must drink plenty of water, and have been getting the appropriate amount of sleep...</li>
            <li>I used this many years ago and forgot how well it works on dark circles and makes my undereye area so smooth..</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it will take a while to be absorbed in to the skin.</li>
            <li>But this lotion is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I am using it on my whole face not just the eyes, and my smile lines (this is the reason I bought it)</li>
            <li>I bought this based off the stellar reviews it already had</li>
            <li>Most likely Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this cream since it&#x27;s the first one I have tried that actually made my problem area better.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>sure normal skinned people will like this product, but beware if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Been using consistently for about a month</li>
            <li>I am middle-aged and recommend this product for anyone who needs to firm and smooth the puffiness and fine lines around their eyes!</li>
            <li>The bags at the side of my eyes were reduced significantly and now, after five days of use, they have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Helps with puffiness and fine lines are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>You can $5 off your first order from certain online stores.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Because I liked the serum so much, I looked into other products by Reviva Labs, and recently started using the lift and firm serum, which is also, incredible.  </li>
            <li>I have tried  many eye firming serums before but this is the first one that does not leave a chalky residue once dry.  </li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to try out this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had visible positive results.</li>
            <li>I still have some dark circles, but just to have the bags gone is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>You do have to follow the instructions and apply once let dry and apply five more times.</li>
            <li>It does say it is suppose to tighten skin around eye area, but once you hit a certain age</li>
            <li>I have been using this awesom eye serum for several years, along with several other wonderful Reviva  skin care products, all of which give amazing results for a mere fraction of the cost of pricey department store cosmetics, which I used for many years before going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; because of allergies.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 50 and just starting to see lots of fine lines all around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference, especially if you have sagging or bags under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>Works very well with the puffiness around my eyes...</li>
            <li>This product works really well and does not irratite my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product really helps a 50 plus skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much the skin around my eyes was being lifted by a richer serum.  </li>
            <li>I am on the &#x27;younger&#x27; side of the &#x27;advanced skin care&#x27; spectrum</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it makes a difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Price is very workable.</li>
            <li>After applying for three weeks straight no results.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturing</li>
            <li>I had never used any of Reviva&#x27;s product line, and I really like this eye serum.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice much difference in line reduction or eye lid firmness.  </li>
            <li>It really firms the eye area.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, expecially since it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens!</li>
            <li>Even use it for my whole face.</li>
            <li>It has the same ingredients as Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Therapy which had been my HG eye cream until developing an allergy to it.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and really helps to hydrate under eye area.</li>
            <li>For those who have aging eyes, this product is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried a couple of new products at once, so I don&#x27;t know what made the difference, but around my eyes feels much tighter!  </li>
            <li>I usually use a more basic, and flower/plant based cream for my skin, like the creams from 100% Pure, but I have to admit I love this crew.  </li>
            <li>Been using about a month and can&#x27;t really tell any difference but for the price of this compared to the many other products I&#x27;ve tried  </li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for the past 3 years and love it!  </li>
            <li>I tried at least 8 different eye creams (Lancome, Ole Henriksen, Perricone Vit C Ester etc) before hitting on this amazing and cheap find.  </li>
            <li>But it is still too short time to do full comment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed less puffiness and more smoothness.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product and probably if used constantly, it does help firm the skin in the end.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, has never stung my eyes, and it has improved the overall tautness of the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes have definitely gotten more taut and even (without tiny bumps) since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and helps with the little wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t need the whole single pump full.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was going to make a difference in combination with the other cream, but it has definitely targeted the eye wrinkles and has made a difference.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products that say they help firm the skin</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few years and is my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is as good as any other more expensive creams I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away with the above and below eye area.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used many eye creams before other than finishing a tube of the 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine eye cream with hopes of reducing puffiness and dark circles, but that didn&#x27;t really yield any results.</li>
            <li>I only use a tiny amount, a full pump is too much.</li>
            <li>I used the product as directed and did not notice any change in the appearance around my eyes-with fine lines or dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>the skin around them is very soft.  </li>
            <li>So disappointed as it seems like a great eye serum!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if any other product will make a noticeable improvement in these eye areas, but this product most definitely has not done so.</li>
            <li>Let me just say, I have paid much more for eye serum with no better results.</li>
            <li>second time ordering.  not thick but seems to work and gentle to eyes.</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying this product, but when I read the ingredients I saw that it had parabens  (methylparaben &amp; propylparaben) in it  - these ingredients are toxic to the skin and a completely uneccesary extra.</li>
            <li>Only a little drop goes a long way(which is a good thing).</li>
            <li>I use this serum on my entire face and feel that it has a positive effect.  </li>
            <li>so the skin feels smooth and not too tight.</li>
            <li>Thiit has gotten rid of the few fine lines I have</li>
            <li>It spreads really well and dries quickly without making your skin feel stiff.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles but is makes them much softer and friends and family noticed after only 1 week of use.  </li>
            <li>so far i have seen some change but not awhole lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised it doesn&#x27;t work better...but still giving it a chance.................</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this eye serum doesn&#x27;t affect it adversely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and always take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re just naturally there forever</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something to improve the sagging on the above eye area</li>
            <li>and I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>I have used Reviva Firming Eye Serum, and after trying another product for a few months, I am so glad to have switched back to Reviva.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product after reading the book of Dr. Pericone \\&quot;The Prescription\\&quot; because it contains all the ingredients that are highly recomended for daily skin care regimen in the book.   </li>
            <li>disappear the next day (but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last because as soon as i start smiling again, the smile lines become obvious again).</li>
            <li>It has gotten rid of the few fine lines I had starting.</li>
            <li>And much cheaper than the Dr Perricone brand for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This eye serum might be fine for a younger person, but it&#x27;s not rich enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This eye serum applies silky smooth (a little goes a long way) and has kept my eyelids and surrounding eye area youthful and wrinkle-free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and so far I can&#x27;t say that any cream worked for me as sucessfuly as this one.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this one is actually doing what is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected to much</li>
            <li>Luckily they&#x27;re not super dark, but I believe this cream has firmed the skin enough to reduce fine lines and puffiness that it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dark circles anymore.</li>
            <li>This in combination with my other Reviva products (Elastin &amp; DMAE Cream, Collagen Cream, and Eye Complex Firming Cream) has kept my complexion far more youthful than my age - 71</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Reviva products as they are very high quality and very inexpensive what usually doesn&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because I think it is overkill given use of other products, and doesn&#x27;t do the same dramatic good for my skin as the moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and I used the first bottle down to the last drop...</li>
            <li>and I really see no difference in lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
            <li>Dark circles, not so much.</li>
            <li>but it has decreased the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was using the Bliss eye cream, which cost about $74 for a little jar and wasn&#x27;t doing much to help my eyes.</li>

            <li> the price is fair.</li>
            <li> It did good to me...</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m 80+ it doesn&#x27;t do as much good as I would like, but it has lightened and softened the puffs under the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good</li>
            <li> The diluted product even gives good results.</li>
            <li> I think it is good.</li>
            <li> The good news: this product does not sting.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.</li>

            <li> Prices good, quality products.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product for its price and the good reviews, I have to say I am not at all impressed and saw no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream, it does the job and its super absorbent.</li>
            <li> I bought based on the great reviews...but even Olay is better.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed by how well it works for the price.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder as soon as it starts to run out!</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any uber-expensive eye cream I have tried (and I have tried them all!).</li>
            <li> I will def buy it again, I love organic creams and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I have already bought more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product; it reduces puffiness and decreases fine lines.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It hydrates nicely.</li>
            <li> I liked the results.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream because of the way it feels on the skin.  </li>
            <li> but honestly, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> AS A MOISTURIZER.THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, nice texture, seems to be helping with wrinkles, firming, skin color -</li>
            <li> I was excited to see it on Amazon at a great price and prime eligible.</li>
            <li> The consistency is lightweight and goes on the skin very easily.</li>
            <li> makes skin drier and gave me fine lines when I used to have none!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one bottle and my eyelids are now very smooth.</li>
            <li> It rehydrated and is very light.</li>
            <li> Great price also, does as well or better than higher priced options.  </li>
            <li> cream is super good.</li>
            <li> After two days of use, this product showed why so many crave it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price.</li>
            <li> but it does help more then what I thought it would...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free &amp; it works !</li>
            <li> love this eye creme-</li>
            <li> this is an ok eye cream.</li>
            <li> and we both love this.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS CREAM AND FOUND IT TO BE SATISFYING</li>
            <li> I use many products all the time</li>
            <li> I have seen way better results when using Alpha glycolic based moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize rather than swell the skin into looking better.</li>
            <li> ok?</li>
            <li> I just love this eye serum</li>
            <li> It seems to work although i do not have many lines or any crows feet yet</li>
            <li> This works well firming the eye area, I recommend once it absorbs put your night eye moisturizer on top of it</li>
            <li> and my eyes look better than they have in 5 years.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Thank You :)</li>
            <li> and I think my makeup looks better when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> and it is more than plenty.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this another try and after about 9 days of use I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and based on the reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I use many of their beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love this for under eye area.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I will continue to order as I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use for a couple more weeks, but at this point would not order again.</li>
            <li> It is a good first step before applying moisturizer and makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled and hope the results hold up, it&#x27;s been 3 months now and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> As a result of continual use, the fine lines around my eyes are softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> It minimize fine lines, therefore giving the eye area a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok for my skin because its fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and don&#x27;t have any real lines around my eyes to speak of (I have fair skin, but i&#x27;m not a sun person at all), but I do have some darker circles.  </li>
            <li> I didn,t see any significant difference in eye-undwer-eye firming, but it felt ok  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li> I am always hopeful when I see a good review and order a new product.  </li>
            <li> To make these products even better, the prices are more than reasonable!  </li>
            <li> I love its ingredients, it&#x27;s super light weight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any fine lines at the bottom of my eyes anymore, even if I squint them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the fine lines around my eyes but</li>
            <li> So, if your concern is fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend.  </li>
            <li> Very light but powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a HUGE difference in the fine lines around my eyes they have gone away, no lie.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is fantastic.</li>
            <li> AND IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
            <li> MY PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND SECURELY WRAPPED.</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning and every evening it is smooth</li>
            <li> It is great to find a product that actually does what it says it wil.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and worth a gamble!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims  with just a small amount and at a great price!</li>
            <li> But since it&#x27;s the only eye-cream i use ( I used to use good face moisturizer as eye-cream), I believe it&#x27;s causing the fine lines</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning and every evening, it is smooth and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My eyes are firm and smooth and bright!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in firmness of skin - but there is a nice almost waxyness to the lotion that leaves the eye area kind of dewy, and it lasts if you use enough.</li>
            <li> Not bad and</li>
            <li> It has no odor, soaks in quickly and does not migrate into my eyes,  Which I</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been far more impressed with this company&#x27;s other skincare, particularly the glycolic acid and the moisturizer creams.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price which is too cheap compare to those high end facial care product.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better, my skin is very very sensitive...</li>
            <li> My skin feels more soft as well!</li>
            <li> I previously purchased these products from a natural supplement store, but because of the excellent service and lower prices from OxKom,  </li>
            <li> I really recommend the product and think it is a tremendous value!</li>
            <li> I prefer my current eye cream better OBAGI Hydroderm, because it smoths out the fine lines while I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite sometime now and it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> It firms the eye area and you can still smile without it feeling like it is going to crack.</li>
            <li> but more of a light gel-like cream, for 3 months and finally just noticed its effects!</li>
            <li> I put on this serum and right away I noticed my eye area firming up and lines tightened and diminished.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I&#x27;m using this product right now</li>
            <li> Went inside, put it right on.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> Love this as much as the Reviva Facial Cream - will buy this product again - goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and easy to use, morning and night.</li>
            <li> no bags, nice and supple and NO new wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For me they make it seem as if I have had a &#x27;little something done&#x27; in a good way.</li>
            <li> but.. Bottle is almost empty and still haven&#x27;t seen amazing results yet..</li>
            <li> Works on the first application.  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> only gave this 4 stars because in reality it&#x27;s not a miracle worker You must drink plenty of water, and have been getting the appropriate amount of sleep...</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago and forgot how well it works on dark circles and makes my undereye area so smooth..</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it will take a while to be absorbed in to the skin.</li>
            <li> But this lotion is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I am using it on my whole face not just the eyes, and my smile lines (this is the reason I bought it)</li>
            <li> I bought this based off the stellar reviews it already had</li>
            <li> Most likely Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this cream since it&#x27;s the first one I have tried that actually made my problem area better.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> sure normal skinned people will like this product, but beware if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> Been using consistently for about a month</li>
            <li> I am middle-aged and recommend this product for anyone who needs to firm and smooth the puffiness and fine lines around their eyes!</li>
            <li> The bags at the side of my eyes were reduced significantly and now, after five days of use, they have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Helps with puffiness and fine lines are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> You can $5 off your first order from certain online stores.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Because I liked the serum so much, I looked into other products by Reviva Labs, and recently started using the lift and firm serum, which is also, incredible.  </li>
            <li> I have tried  many eye firming serums before but this is the first one that does not leave a chalky residue once dry.  </li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to try out this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had visible positive results.</li>
            <li> I still have some dark circles, but just to have the bags gone is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> You do have to follow the instructions and apply once let dry and apply five more times.</li>
            <li> It does say it is suppose to tighten skin around eye area, but once you hit a certain age</li>
            <li> I have been using this awesom eye serum for several years, along with several other wonderful Reviva  skin care products, all of which give amazing results for a mere fraction of the cost of pricey department store cosmetics, which I used for many years before going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; because of allergies.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 50 and just starting to see lots of fine lines all around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference, especially if you have sagging or bags under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product...</li>
            <li> Works very well with the puffiness around my eyes...</li>
            <li> This product works really well and does not irratite my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product really helps a 50 plus skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the skin around my eyes was being lifted by a richer serum.  </li>
            <li> I am on the &#x27;younger&#x27; side of the &#x27;advanced skin care&#x27; spectrum</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it makes a difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Price is very workable.</li>
            <li> After applying for three weeks straight no results.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturing</li>
            <li> I had never used any of Reviva&#x27;s product line, and I really like this eye serum.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice much difference in line reduction or eye lid firmness.  </li>
            <li> It really firms the eye area.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, expecially since it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens!</li>
            <li> Even use it for my whole face.</li>
            <li> It has the same ingredients as Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Therapy which had been my HG eye cream until developing an allergy to it.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and really helps to hydrate under eye area.</li>
            <li> For those who have aging eyes, this product is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a couple of new products at once, so I don&#x27;t know what made the difference, but around my eyes feels much tighter!  </li>
            <li> I usually use a more basic, and flower/plant based cream for my skin, like the creams from 100% Pure, but I have to admit I love this crew.  </li>
            <li> Been using about a month and can&#x27;t really tell any difference but for the price of this compared to the many other products I&#x27;ve tried  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for the past 3 years and love it!  </li>
            <li> I tried at least 8 different eye creams (Lancome, Ole Henriksen, Perricone Vit C Ester etc) before hitting on this amazing and cheap find.  </li>
            <li> But it is still too short time to do full comment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less puffiness and more smoothness.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good product and probably if used constantly, it does help firm the skin in the end.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, has never stung my eyes, and it has improved the overall tautness of the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes have definitely gotten more taut and even (without tiny bumps) since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and helps with the little wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t need the whole single pump full.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was going to make a difference in combination with the other cream, but it has definitely targeted the eye wrinkles and has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products that say they help firm the skin</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years and is my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is as good as any other more expensive creams I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away with the above and below eye area.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used many eye creams before other than finishing a tube of the 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine eye cream with hopes of reducing puffiness and dark circles, but that didn&#x27;t really yield any results.</li>
            <li> I only use a tiny amount, a full pump is too much.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and did not notice any change in the appearance around my eyes-with fine lines or dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> the skin around them is very soft.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed as it seems like a great eye serum!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if any other product will make a noticeable improvement in these eye areas, but this product most definitely has not done so.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I have paid much more for eye serum with no better results.</li>
            <li> second time ordering.  not thick but seems to work and gentle to eyes.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this product, but when I read the ingredients I saw that it had parabens  (methylparaben &amp; propylparaben) in it  - these ingredients are toxic to the skin and a completely uneccesary extra.</li>
            <li> Only a little drop goes a long way(which is a good thing).</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my entire face and feel that it has a positive effect.  </li>
            <li> so the skin feels smooth and not too tight.</li>
            <li> Thiit has gotten rid of the few fine lines I have</li>
            <li> It spreads really well and dries quickly without making your skin feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles but is makes them much softer and friends and family noticed after only 1 week of use.  </li>
            <li> so far i have seen some change but not awhole lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised it doesn&#x27;t work better...but still giving it a chance.................</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this eye serum doesn&#x27;t affect it adversely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and always take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re just naturally there forever</li>
            <li> I was really looking for something to improve the sagging on the above eye area</li>
            <li> and I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I have used Reviva Firming Eye Serum, and after trying another product for a few months, I am so glad to have switched back to Reviva.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product after reading the book of Dr. Pericone \\&quot;The Prescription\\&quot; because it contains all the ingredients that are highly recomended for daily skin care regimen in the book.   </li>
            <li> disappear the next day (but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last because as soon as i start smiling again, the smile lines become obvious again).</li>
            <li> It has gotten rid of the few fine lines I had starting.</li>
            <li> And much cheaper than the Dr Perricone brand for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eye serum might be fine for a younger person, but it&#x27;s not rich enough for me.  </li>
            <li> This eye serum applies silky smooth (a little goes a long way) and has kept my eyelids and surrounding eye area youthful and wrinkle-free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and so far I can&#x27;t say that any cream worked for me as sucessfuly as this one.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this one is actually doing what is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected to much</li>
            <li> Luckily they&#x27;re not super dark, but I believe this cream has firmed the skin enough to reduce fine lines and puffiness that it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dark circles anymore.</li>
            <li> This in combination with my other Reviva products (Elastin &amp; DMAE Cream, Collagen Cream, and Eye Complex Firming Cream) has kept my complexion far more youthful than my age - 71</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Reviva products as they are very high quality and very inexpensive what usually doesn&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because I think it is overkill given use of other products, and doesn&#x27;t do the same dramatic good for my skin as the moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and I used the first bottle down to the last drop...</li>
            <li> and I really see no difference in lines, puffiness, or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Dark circles, not so much.</li>
            <li> but it has decreased the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was using the Bliss eye cream, which cost about $74 for a little jar and wasn&#x27;t doing much to help my eyes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is different but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me at all, as long as I receive the same product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many diffrent creams, and discontinued due to ineffectiveness, allergy, dry skin, false advertisement, cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 years old and don&#x27;t have any crows feet, dark circles or bags under my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different creams, serums, etc...from way too expensive to the cheap ones-this is the only one that I&#x27;ve ever noticed a difference in my eye&#x27;s appearance!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Reviva DMAE eye serum religiously for several months, now, and there has been absolutely no improvement in the bags under my eyes, or in the baggy lids above my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had developed extreme dryness and lines under my eyes and since using this product &amp;#34;no lines here&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> After I try other, more expensive creams/serums, I always end up back with this one.</li>
            <li> I work different shifts and my eyes get tired very fast and this serum keeps all the circles and puffiness away and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My recent purchased of this Reviva Firming Eye Serum was based upon previous positive comments from past customers.</li>
            <li> I will never switch to anything else, as long as it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> I got bacterial pink eye IN BOTH EYES the next day after using this the night before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 79 years-old and I wasn&#x27;t expecting a big whoop in results from this or any other eye product.</li>
            <li> However, not a single bit of improvement or a slight difference.</li>
            <li> The texture is silky and supple once dry.</li>
            <li> Helped dry skin, doesn&#x27;t make my makeup run and doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts.</li>
            <li> However, if you have deep wrinkles, crows feet or other issues around the eye area, i would recommend researching other soltuions to combat those issues.</li>
            <li> This has the same ingredients and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Applying Reviva in the morning and cold pressed coconut oil at night has taken years off my eyes - plumped fine lines, reduced puffiness and with no eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> You only use a little for one application.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a little change but not a big difference -maybe</li>
            <li> But I have never had very dark obvious ones to begins with.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day; the small bottle last really long time.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several days; intended for firming and take out a few wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> You need to use a q tip inside the bottle to reach that last few applications.</li>
            <li> And not only do I think this helps with that, noticeably, but it does firm up the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely see a slight reduction in my dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> It does firm the eyelid skin,  and helps lighten the dark circles that I&#x27;ve had my entire life.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> Gives an immediate &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feeling to the point I use it on other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I saw this product together with other DMAE forms of this in creams on the  DR OZ show, and I decided to try it for 3/4 moths.</li>
            <li> However, you only need a small amount to cover the area around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> When there is a small amount left, I add a bit of water to it.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with my other Reviva products during the morning and evening routine.  </li>
            <li> I use other organic products.  </li>
            <li> MAYBE IT FIX MY PUFFINESS UNDER MY EYE LIL, but its not fix any dark cycle</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It seems to be reducing some of the finer lines under my eyes, but I bought it for the dark circles and bags.  </li>
            <li> Like all the other Reviva products I&#x27;ve used, it is simple (without ugly ingredients), not too fragranced and has been gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles seemed to have diminished and I also noticed less puffiness as well.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are lighter and my lines are definitely less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have proven at this very moment, their claims were not true.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less noticeable and my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> It reduced the lines around my eyes and lightened my black circles.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year and it does firm, reduce puffiness and dark circles for me.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is the  only problem of late is 2 of the 3 bottles I orders were broken.</li>
            <li> I found that the serum forms a tight layer</li>
            <li> The product itself goes on cleanly, is not oily and wears well under make-up.  </li>
            <li> Little &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; around the eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every little bit helps for me.</li>
            <li> It does have a little lift power to it.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles are lightening and the puffiness is diminishing!  </li>
            <li> I try to squeeze out just a little</li>
            <li> Works well to firm up the skin around the eyes, HOWEVER, it took me months to discover that, even though I applied it very sparingly and stayed away from the edges of my eyes, it was leaking into my eye and causing my contacts to become foggy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> but the skin around my eyes is firm,</li>
            <li> Does it firm?  </li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ve been crying all day.</li>
            <li> The few wrinkles I was developing around my eyes seem non-existant now.</li>
            <li> This is an eye serum, but I use a few drops all over my face in the morning to prep my skin for my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It tightens the skin no more bags and my dark circles are gone.</li>
            <li> But if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, finally something that doesn&#x27;t contain all sorts of bad preservatives AND actually does something to help the delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it works ....</li>
            <li> I have no more crows feet.</li>
            <li> This is no magic ointment, but I think that over the longer term there is a benefit in around-eye appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 months now small dab in the morning and at night</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as the product is very thin.</li>
            <li> This product is no better or worse than any other for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> Mostly it&#x27;s a little too thin for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is non-irritating and does not have a nasty smell.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are both in our late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It seems to have firmed the delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs Eye Complex Firming Cream, For All Skin Types, .75 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> However I have discovered that in a pinch it works well as a primer under foundation because it&#x27;s very slick.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it at the same time with another product (Dermae Firming DMAE moisturizer with alpha lipoic - awful experience by the way)</li>
            <li> It is indeed a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I mean if  look upward, I can feel it!  </li>
            <li> Non irritating and does not run into eyes.</li>
            <li> also non irritating which is a plus</li>
            <li> If anything, I think the skin around my eyes got worse using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before with no problems, however this time the bottle was broken and the cream was spilled inside the envelope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation with this product</li>
            <li> lasik I noticed my bags and it annoyed me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I discovered the brush is the secret.  </li>
            <li> Cleared up all of the dark, ugly crowlines from my face.</li>
            <li> And I bought both expensive ones and affordable ones.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one did not match up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because atleast it wasn&#x27;t to expensive to give it a try</li>
            <li> however I got the wrong item from the seller, bummer.</li>
            <li> Eye serums can be so expensive; this one competes well with them.</li>
            <li> I kept using it for about a year because I fell for that \\&quot;It&#x27;s expensive, so it&#x27;s got to eventually work\\&quot; idea.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Very thin and watery in texture.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do anything bad like give me a rash or make things worse</li>
            <li> My little miracle in a bottle!!!!!  </li>
            <li> so maybe a batch of bad bottles?</li>
            <li> I regret to find this eye serum rather very disappointing.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only eye serum that I have found that I can use around my eyes that does not cause milia...those tiny white bumps that you get from using heavier creams around the eye area.  I have used this for about a year and it does firm, reduce puffiness and dark circles for me.  Great company and great product!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it.  I would not go a day without using it in the morning and at night.  You see immediate results!</li>
            <li> After two days of use, this product showed why so many crave it. The bags at the side of my eyes were reduced significantly and now, after five days of use, they have completely disappeared.  I will be building a stock of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product; it reduces puffiness and decreases fine lines. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price. I only use a tiny amount, a full pump is too much. Will definitely buy again. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning under my makeup.  It absorbs well without any greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.  Works on the first application.  If your upper lids are sagging--buy this. It works!</li>
            <li> I really like this product...I saw results in a couple of days.  My dark circles seemed to have diminished and I also noticed less puffiness as well.  Try it...I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more. Very easy to use and works very well. My skin feels more soft as well!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! !! The anwanted lines under my eyes are not longer visible. You will approve this message once u purchase this miracle solution.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is amazing!  I have tried so may products and never had results like this, even in the short time I have been using it.  It makes a huge difference, especially if you have sagging or bags under your eyes.  Because I liked the serum so much, I looked into other products by Reviva Labs, and recently started using the lift and firm serum, which is also, incredible.  To make these products even better, the prices are more than reasonable!  You can $5 off your first order from certain online stores.  I give it/them 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Works very well with the puffiness around my eyes...you can feel it tighten whenever you apply it on. I use it twice a day. Morning and night after washing my face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this 4 stars because in reality it&#x27;s not a miracle worker You must drink plenty of water, and have been getting the appropriate amount of sleep...but it does help more then what I thought it would...I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle and I used the first bottle down to the last drop...I will be buying again</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product after reading the book of Dr. Pericone \\&quot;The Prescription\\&quot; because it contains all the ingredients that are highly recomended for daily skin care regimen in the book.   So I decided to give it a try especially becuase the price is so low comparing to Periconne brand products.  The cream is ok for my skin because its fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any problems. It hydrates nicely. I don&#x27;t see any improvements from using it though.  Its a good mosturizer for the price.  I prefer my current eye cream better OBAGI Hydroderm, because it smoths out the fine lines while I use it.  I am 30 years old.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it&#x27;s partner does.  Little &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and helps with the little wrinkles around the eyes. I don&#x27;t have any eye sensitivity with this product at all. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 79 years-old and I wasn&#x27;t expecting a big whoop in results from this or any other eye product. My eyelids had a \\&quot;lizard\\&quot; look about them. I&#x27;ve used one bottle and my eyelids are now very smooth. I will continue to use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Gives an immediate &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feeling to the point I use it on other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle. I will never switch to anything else, as long as it is not discontinued. I use it twice a day; the small bottle last really long time. I am 57 and no, it does not make you look 25 but the skin around my eyes is firm, no bags, nice and supple and NO new wrinkles. Does not irritate my yes. Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product together with other DMAE forms of this in creams on the  DR OZ show, and I decided to try it for 3/4 moths. I liked the results. And much cheaper than the Dr Perricone brand for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works ....</li>
            <li> Cruelty free &amp; it works !</li>
            <li> love this eye creme-i use it twice a day and i saw a difference in 2wks.-not to greasy can be worn under makeup</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this product, but when I read the ingredients I saw that it had parabens  (methylparaben &amp; propylparaben) in it  - these ingredients are toxic to the skin and a completely uneccesary extra. So disappointed as it seems like a great eye serum!</li>
            <li> I been using this for about 3 months and it haven&#x27;t done nothing for me (no difference). I bought based on the great reviews...but even Olay is better. I don&#x27;t understand how this product can have  those reviews&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> This product works really well and does not irratite my eyes. I used this many years ago and forgot how well it works on dark circles and makes my undereye area so smooth..</li>
            <li> This product really helps a 50 plus skin.  I use it all over my face and neck.  Great price also, does as well or better than higher priced options.  Third purchase for this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Reviva DMAE eye serum religiously for several months, now, and there has been absolutely no improvement in the bags under my eyes, or in the baggy lids above my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if any other product will make a noticeable improvement in these eye areas, but this product most definitely has not done so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and so far I can&#x27;t say that any cream worked for me as sucessfuly as this one. It does firm the eyelid skin,  and helps lighten the dark circles that I&#x27;ve had my entire life. The cost is affordable for the amount that I use, which is a drop for both eyes. I&#x27;ve tried so many diffrent creams, and discontinued due to ineffectiveness, allergy, dry skin, false advertisement, cost. I&#x27;d read about Alpha Lipoic Acid and found that it does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> this is an ok eye cream. Only a little drop goes a long way(which is a good thing). the price is fair. No big results though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for the past 3 years and love it!  I had developed extreme dryness and lines under my eyes and since using this product &amp;#34;no lines here&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I did get what i was looking for .The cream is super good.I have no more crows feet. and i think the creams are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is no magic ointment, but I think that over the longer term there is a benefit in around-eye appearance.</li>
            <li> This serum works great, I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles but is makes them much softer and friends and family noticed after only 1 week of use.  I have reordered several times and will order again.</li>
            <li> Cleared up all of the dark, ugly crowlines from my face. Younger appearance today and everyone thinks I&#x27;m younger than I appear to be.</li>
            <li> I love its ingredients, it&#x27;s super light weight and easy to apply. The bottle is different but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me at all, as long as I receive the same product. I work different shifts and my eyes get tired very fast and this serum keeps all the circles and puffiness away and reduces wrinkles. I use it every day in the morning and before I go to sleep and the results are great. Plus, the price is really low. Great product. I&#x27;m a big fan of Reviva products as they are very high quality and very inexpensive what usually doesn&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream because of the way it feels on the skin.  However, you only need a small amount to cover the area around the eyes.  If you use too much, it will take a while to be absorbed in to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am almost 50 and just starting to see lots of fine lines all around my eyes. I tried the EL night time repair serum but didn&#x27;t see any difference. I put on this serum and right away I noticed my eye area firming up and lines tightened and diminished. It is a good first step before applying moisturizer and makeup. I do not recommend wearing at night to sleep. I found that the serum forms a tight layer and if you crinkle your face while in a sleeping position, it will freeze it and you will actually see lines where you slept.</li>
            <li> This eye serum might be fine for a younger person, but it&#x27;s not rich enough for me.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much the skin around my eyes was being lifted by a richer serum.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s.  I had to go back to my former product--UP eye lifting serum by Target which is comparable to Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is fantastic. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive eyes. You can use this under makeup and there&#x27;s no caking or greasiness. Very light but powerful stuff. It definitely softens the look of any lines under and above the eye area.</li>
            <li> My eyes tighten instantly. You do have to follow the instructions and apply once let dry and apply five more times. You only use a little for one application.  With continued use I think this product will help keep my eyes a lot firmer.</li>
            <li> I like this well enough.  It goes on smoothly, is non-irritating and does not have a nasty smell.  Does it firm?  Hard to tell.  Let me just say, I have paid much more for eye serum with no better results.</li>
            <li> I have tried  many eye firming serums before but this is the first one that does not leave a chalky residue once dry.  It firms the eye area and you can still smile without it feeling like it is going to crack. The texture is silky and supple once dry. I can stop the search. Reviva Firming Eye Serum gets 5 stars for me!</li>
            <li> so far i have seen some change but not awhole lot. i am going to continue to use it because i have not been using it for a month. i hope that it will work considering the change i have seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised it doesn&#x27;t work better...but still giving it a chance................. It&#x27;s not as creamy as I like ..will see</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it works or not, but I can say I no longer trust this seller. I got bacterial pink eye IN BOTH EYES the next day after using this the night before. Coincidence? I think not.</li>
            <li> Instead of firming the skin under my eyes, I&#x27;ve found the product actually makes it irritated and swollen. Looks like I&#x27;ve been crying all day. I stopped using it and am on to another product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this awesom eye serum for several years, along with several other wonderful Reviva  skin care products, all of which give amazing results for a mere fraction of the cost of pricey department store cosmetics, which I used for many years before going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; because of allergies.  This eye serum applies silky smooth (a little goes a long way) and has kept my eyelids and surrounding eye area youthful and wrinkle-free.  This in combination with my other Reviva products (Elastin &amp; DMAE Cream, Collagen Cream, and Eye Complex Firming Cream) has kept my complexion far more youthful than my age - 71 (people take me for the same age as my husband who is 19 years younger than I am).  I previously purchased these products from a natural supplement store, but because of the excellent service and lower prices from OxKom,  I definitely will continue ordering through them!</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my entire face and feel that it has a positive effect.  I have only been using about 1 -1/2 months but feel that my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product to people especially who belongs to the Baby Boomers era! Good product for the price which is too cheap compare to those high end facial care product. It did good to me...</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that say they help firm the skin but honestly, none of them worked. And I bought both expensive ones and affordable ones. But this lotion is the real deal! I actually bought it at the same time with another product (Dermae Firming DMAE moisturizer with alpha lipoic - awful experience by the way) and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this one is actually doing what is supposed to do! I am using it on my whole face not just the eyes, and my smile lines (this is the reason I bought it) disappear the next day (but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last because as soon as i start smiling again, the smile lines become obvious again). Still, it&#x27;s a good product and probably if used constantly, it does help firm the skin in the end. I will be using it for a while until I find something with lasting results.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both in our late 20&#x27;s and we both love this. Very gentle on my super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve noticed less puffiness and more smoothness. Seems to compete with the much more expensive serums. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now and see no reason to try something else.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT ABOUT 3 WEEKS MAYBE IT FIX MY PUFFINESS UNDER MY EYE LIL, but its not fix any dark cycle</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS CREAM AND FOUND IT TO BE SATISFYING AS A MOISTURIZER.THE SMELL IS NICE AND IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY. ,WAS IS NOT GREASY. MY PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND SECURELY WRAPPED.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this eye serum doesn&#x27;t affect it adversely. Helps with puffiness and fine lines are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off the stellar reviews it already had and I can say that those ladies were not lying. This is the best eye cream, it does the job and its super absorbent. I have noticed a HUGE difference in the fine lines around my eyes they have gone away, no lie. I am on the &#x27;younger&#x27; side of the &#x27;advanced skin care&#x27; spectrum so I dont know if this effects the way these products work on my skin. For me they make it seem as if I have had a &#x27;little something done&#x27; in a good way.</li>
            <li> I am always hopeful when I see a good review and order a new product.  Unfortunately this one did not match up to my expectations.  I used the product as directed and did not notice any change in the appearance around my eyes-with fine lines or dark circles under my eyes.  I gave it two stars because atleast it wasn&#x27;t to expensive to give it a try and it didn&#x27;t do anything bad like give me a rash or make things worse---I think it just gave me some extra moister in that area.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use the REVIVA night cream as well and it is amazing. Keeps your skin very hydrated. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was going to make a difference in combination with the other cream, but it has definitely targeted the eye wrinkles and has made a difference. I really recommend the product and think it is a tremendous value!</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected to much but.. Bottle is almost empty and still haven&#x27;t seen amazing results yet.. Feels really good around eyes tho! Will wait and see what happens!</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to try out this product.  I have seen a little change but not a big difference -maybe because I haven&#x27;t used up all the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing this eye serum.  I LOVE IT! I really feel like it makes a difference when I use it.  The few wrinkles I was developing around my eyes seem non-existant now. It is not greasy and soaks in well.  I put it on before applying my eye makeup in the a.m.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy again did not notice an difference at all. will try something else next time. i do not reccomend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and always take care of my skin.  I use many products all the time but this product did not make any noticeable changes to my skin.  I have seen way better results when using Alpha glycolic based moisturizers.  I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> What shows on the site does not look like what I received.  As with the firming liquid, I did not see any great changes in the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference, so I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> Love this as much as the Reviva Facial Cream - will buy this product again - goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li> It has improved skin appearance around eyes. Non irritating and does not run into eyes. Seems to moisturize rather than swell the skin into looking better.</li>
            <li> I didn,t see any significant difference in eye-undwer-eye firming, but it felt ok  I,ll try somethinmg else next time ok?</li>
            <li> second time ordering.  not thick but seems to work and gentle to eyes. Not greasy. Easy to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and absolutely love it! I&#x27;m 39 years old and don&#x27;t have any crows feet, dark circles or bags under my eyes I believe because of this product. I was excited to see it on Amazon at a great price and prime eligible. I wish I could say that I&#x27;m using this product right now however I got the wrong item from the seller, bummer. Amazon has issued me a return label and refunding my money. I&#x27;m putting another order in and hoping I get the correct item this time. Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> So I just got home. Saw this on my porch step. Went inside, put it right on. In the matter of minutes my bags were taut. I still have some dark circles, but just to have the bags gone is amazing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has some extra baggage!</li>
            <li> did not see any noticeable difference after two weeks, maybe because of the expiration date. Most likely Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite sometime now and it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take much. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m 80+ it doesn&#x27;t do as much good as I would like, but it has lightened and softened the puffs under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Every little bit helps for me.</li>
            <li> I just love this eye serum</li>
            <li> It is good I use every day</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, nice texture, seems to be helping with wrinkles, firming, skin color - also non irritating which is a plus</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product for its price and the good reviews, I have to say I am not at all impressed and saw no results whatsoever.  The product itself goes on cleanly, is not oily and wears well under make-up.  If anything, I think the skin around my eyes got worse using this product.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I buy this product on a regular basis. Great results. When there is a small amount left, I add a bit of water to it. The diluted product even gives good results. Eye serums can be so expensive; this one competes well with them. Price is very workable.</li>
            <li> After applying for three weeks straight no results. Very thin and watery in texture.</li>
            <li> I had one upper eyelid that was sagging. After using one bottle of this I noticed that eyelid was no longer sagging. It was a very nice surprise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed by how well it works for the price.  It does have a little lift power to it.  Not bad and the price is great!</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream! I haven&#x27;t really used many eye creams before other than finishing a tube of the 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine eye cream with hopes of reducing puffiness and dark circles, but that didn&#x27;t really yield any results. I&#x27;ve been using this Reviva eye serum, which isn&#x27;t a liquid serum but more of a light gel-like cream, for 3 months and finally just noticed its effects! It seems to have firmed the delicate skin around my eyes. I don&#x27;t have any fine lines at the bottom of my eyes anymore, even if I squint them. I still have dark circles but they&#x27;re just naturally there forever haha. Luckily they&#x27;re not super dark, but I believe this cream has firmed the skin enough to reduce fine lines and puffiness that it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dark circles anymore. I wear it twice a day - in the morning before I put on makeup, and after I wash up at night before going to sleep - and all I use is just a tiny pin-head amount. It spreads really well and dries quickly without making your skin feel stiff. I&#x27;d recommend it for its price and firming effects!</li>
            <li> it is soothing, but does nothing else that it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months, morning and evening. I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the fine lines around my eyes but the skin around them is very soft.  I layer this with another ester C creme over it hoping to get a double effect but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any at this point.  A little goes a long way as the product is very thin. It has no odor, soaks in quickly and does not migrate into my eyes,  Which I love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this until its gone and then evaluate whether to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have been usin this product for a while now and I like it.  It seems to work although i do not have many lines or any crows feet yet but i use it for preventative maintenance. I would recommend this product.  However, if you have deep wrinkles, crows feet or other issues around the eye area, i would recommend researching other soltuions to combat those issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different creams, serums, etc...from way too expensive to the cheap ones-this is the only one that I&#x27;ve ever noticed a difference in my eye&#x27;s appearance!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  The dark circles are lightening and the puffiness is diminishing!  I love it and will reorder as soon as it starts to run out!</li>
            <li> This works well firming the eye area, I recommend once it absorbs put your night eye moisturizer on top of it so the skin feels smooth and not too tight.</li>
            <li> I do not notice any difference after using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I use this product along with my other Reviva products during the morning and evening routine.  It has brightened my eyes and reduced puffiness.</li>
            <li> I think it is good. But it is still too short time to do full comment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in firmness of skin - but there is a nice almost waxyness to the lotion that leaves the eye area kind of dewy, and it lasts if you use enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 months now small dab in the morning and at night and there&#x27;s improvement. My dark circles are lighter and my lines are definitely less noticeable. I will continue using this cream since it&#x27;s the first one I have tried that actually made my problem area better.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, finally something that doesn&#x27;t contain all sorts of bad preservatives AND actually does something to help the delicate skin around my eyes. I was using the Bliss eye cream, which cost about $74 for a little jar and wasn&#x27;t doing much to help my eyes. I kept using it for about a year because I fell for that \\&quot;It&#x27;s expensive, so it&#x27;s got to eventually work\\&quot; idea.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews on the Reviva and Derma E brands, I decided it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a financial risk to try some of their items. I&#x27;m so very glad I did! I began using this firming eye serum about a month ago and I&#x27;ve had visible positive results. They were almost instantaneous results, too. I use this in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B0011DHA3A Reviva Labs Eye Complex Firming Cream, For All Skin Types, .75 Ounce]] and my eyes look better than they have in 5 years. After cleansing my face, I apply a hyaluronic acid all over, then use [[ASIN:B004VJ56AK Clarisonic Opal Sonic Infusion System with Anti Aging Sea Serum]] to apply this serum. It absorbs quickly, has never stung my eyes, and it has improved the overall tautness of the skin under my eyes. A little bit goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any uber-expensive eye cream I have tried (and I have tried them all!). Such a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I read the directions and applied this product ... I noticed a difference right away with the above and below eye area.  I use other organic products.  I was really looking for something to improve the sagging on the above eye area and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Thank You :)</li>
            <li> I have used Reviva Firming Eye Serum, and after trying another product for a few months, I am so glad to have switched back to Reviva.  My eyes are firm and smooth and bright!  I am middle-aged and recommend this product for anyone who needs to firm and smooth the puffiness and fine lines around their eyes!</li>
            <li> This is an eye serum, but I use a few drops all over my face in the morning to prep my skin for my foundation.  Like all the other Reviva products I&#x27;ve used, it is simple (without ugly ingredients), not too fragranced and has been gentle on my skin.  I don&#x27;t experience any eye irritation even when I use this on my lids.  It&#x27;s very moisturing and I think my makeup looks better when I use it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the Reviva line of products and will continue to use. Vitamin C is great for a smokers skin.</li>
            <li> You can get this at Ulta, if they have it. I have used this for years after seeing Dr. Pericone talk about his serum. This has the same ingredients and costs a lot less. It is great for people like me who dont like or need a greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good! It rehydrated and is very light. I will def buy it again, I love organic creams and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I could definitely see a slight reduction in my dark eye circles. But I have never had very dark obvious ones to begins with. The skin around my eyes have definitely gotten more taut and even (without tiny bumps) since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I had never used any of Reviva&#x27;s product line, and I really like this eye serum.  The consistency is lightweight and goes on the skin very easily.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better, my skin is very very sensitive...this stuff made my under-eye area sting when I put it on, and then instead of making my bags go away..it made them red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure normal skinned people will like this product, but beware if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for quite some time after hearing about dmae on Dr. Oz. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well to firm up the skin around the eyes, HOWEVER, it took me months to discover that, even though I applied it very sparingly and stayed away from the edges of my eyes, it was leaking into my eye and causing my contacts to become foggy and dirty.  This was to the point that I couldn&#x27;t wear my contacts at all.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much difference in line reduction or eye lid firmness.  The good news: this product does not sting.</li>
            <li> This product is no better or worse than any other for the eye area.  It does say it is suppose to tighten skin around eye area, but once you hit a certain age nothing will do that outside of surgery.  Been using about a month and can&#x27;t really tell any difference but for the price of this compared to the many other products I&#x27;ve tried  it&#x27;s o.k.</li>
            <li> Been using consistently for about a month and I really see no difference in lines, puffiness, or dark circles. Probably not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My recent purchased of this Reviva Firming Eye Serum was based upon previous positive comments from past customers. Unfortunately, I have proven at this very moment, their claims were not true. I regret to find this eye serum rather very disappointing.  I have used it for several days; intended for firming and take out a few wrinkles around my eyes.  However, not a single bit of improvement or a slight difference. I will not consider using this product ever again.  It is indeed a waste of my money!!! Cloud.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before with no problems, however this time the bottle was broken and the cream was spilled inside the envelope.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation with this product and I have really sensitive skin.  It really firms the eye area.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It tightens the skin no more bags and my dark circles are gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. No puffy eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Several times in the last two months when I applied this cream, I got a burning sensation.  So I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye creams/serums which were 5 times more expensive and none of them produced the same results as Revivia Firming Eye Serum Alpha Lipoic Acid.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a year now.  Each bottle last about 3+ months.  As a result of continual use, the fine lines around my eyes are softer and more supple.  It also aids in reducing puffiness!  I highly recommend this product, expecially since it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens!</li>
            <li> Helped dry skin, doesn&#x27;t make my makeup run and doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts. This is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for me. Im in my fifties and i use this under my eyes for moisture. Perfect under make up, non greasy. Even use it for my whole face. Plus it is affordable.  The onky downside s when you get low on product the pump doesnt reach the serum. You need to use a q tip inside the bottle to reach that last few applications.</li>
            <li> I usually use a more basic, and flower/plant based cream for my skin, like the creams from 100% Pure, but I have to admit I love this crew.  I&#x27;m 44 and don&#x27;t have any real lines around my eyes to speak of (I have fair skin, but i&#x27;m not a sun person at all), but I do have some darker circles.  And not only do I think this helps with that, noticeably, but it does firm up the area around my eyes.  Def makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a couple of new products at once, so I don&#x27;t know what made the difference, but around my eyes feels much tighter!  I mean if  look upward, I can feel it!  All I can say, it&#x27;s cheap and worth a gamble!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It seems to be reducing some of the finer lines under my eyes, but I bought it for the dark circles and bags.  It hasn&#x27;t done anything for them.  So, if your concern is fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend.  Dark circles, not so much.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 8 different eye creams (Lancome, Ole Henriksen, Perricone Vit C Ester etc) before hitting on this amazing and cheap find.  It has the same ingredients as Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Therapy which had been my HG eye cream until developing an allergy to it.  Applying Reviva in the morning and cold pressed coconut oil at night has taken years off my eyes - plumped fine lines, reduced puffiness and with no eye irritation.  All this at a fraction of the cost of Perricone.  I&#x27;m thrilled and hope the results hold up, it&#x27;s been 3 months now and so far so good.  Saw a difference within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes, had to return.</li>
            <li> Thiit has gotten rid of the few fine lines I have I put it on every morning and every evening it is smooth and it dries quickly. It has gotten rid of the few fine lines I had starting. I put it on every morning and every evening, it is smooth and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It works well. Just don&#x27;t need the whole single pump full. I try to squeeze out just a little and it is more than plenty.</li>
            <li> Being a guy and having worn glasses for years. My glasses covered up my eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;after lasik I noticed my bags and it annoyed me.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the one that solves the problem regarding this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It minimize fine lines, therefore giving the eye area a more youthful appearance. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> No comment yet as up to date , I have not start using it. So....it still seal up as I am still using another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been far more impressed with this company&#x27;s other skincare, particularly the glycolic acid and the moisturizer creams. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because I think it is overkill given use of other products, and doesn&#x27;t do the same dramatic good for my skin as the moisturizers. Mostly it&#x27;s a little too thin for my tastes. However I have discovered that in a pinch it works well as a primer under foundation because it&#x27;s very slick.</li>
            <li> I use this with my clarisonic face brush and it works great.  I used to use Dr. Perricone without the face brush (read $80/eye cream, $140 face cream).  I discovered the brush is the secret.  Next I researched reviews on Amazon and found this eye cream.  It is as good as any other more expensive creams I&#x27;ve found.  Start with the brush and this eye cream will produce miracles.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this another try and after about 9 days of use I was pleased. It is a good product. and I have upgraded it to a 4 from the one because it do calms the under eyes a lot.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Used this product for almost a month and saw no improvement. Used Obagi Elastiderm and saw improvement in ONE day.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s affordable. But if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s money wasted. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in skin tone when using this product. Wrinkles are less noticeable and my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to serum. It&#x27;s affordable, and gets the job done.  After I try other, more expensive creams/serums, I always end up back with this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and based on the reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the wrinkles but it helps diminish the look of wrinkles.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Very good serum for eyes. I use many of their beauty products. Prices good, quality products.</li>
            <li> makes skin drier and gave me fine lines when I used to have none! I have no idea why this is happening! But since it&#x27;s the only eye-cream i use ( I used to use good face moisturizer as eye-cream), I believe it&#x27;s causing the fine lines</li>
            <li> Love this for under eye area. Not greasy and really helps to hydrate under eye area.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My little miracle in a bottle!!!!!  I&#x27;ve already referred my friends. . . . .</li>
            <li> For those who have aging eyes, this product is very helpful. It&#x27;s all natural and easy to use, morning and night.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I have used it for a few years and is my favorite eye cream. It does what it claims  with just a small amount and at a great price! The only problem is the  only problem of late is 2 of the 3 bottles I orders were broken. They refunded my money promptly and paid shipping back...so I ordered again. All bottles were packaged well..so maybe a batch of bad bottles? I will continue to order as I love the product.</li>
            <li> This is totally useless. Did nothing for me. When I apply it on my eye areas it does not even feel like I just applied something there. Again if some results were visible I would have assumed it worked. But I did not notice anything at all.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it has decreased the fine lines around my eyes.  I have noticed a difference on my eye lids as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far have not noticed any difference. Will continue to use for a couple more weeks, but at this point would not order again.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by it.  Price is right too.</li>
            <li> It is great to find a product that actually does what it says it wil. It reduced the lines around my eyes and lightened my black circles. I have already bought more!</li>
