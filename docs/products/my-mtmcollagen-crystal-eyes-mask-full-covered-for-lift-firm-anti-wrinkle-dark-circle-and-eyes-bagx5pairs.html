            <li>I was so excited for this mask.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this one.</li>
            <li>The masks immediately made the skin around my eyes feel cool</li>
            <li>It felt like a true luxury treatment.</li>
            <li>I really am still talking about this amazingly refreshing treatment.</li>
            <li>They feel so cool and refreshed after use.  </li>
            <li>I also keep the masks in the fridge so they&#x27;re cool when I put them on.</li>
            <li>Put these on and they had a cool effect</li>
            <li>I really like the way they feel when on your eyes nice and cool and very relaxing.</li>

            <li>And I received my order quickly</li>
            <li>Very cooling and comfortable,  my laugh lines and other tell tale signs of tiredness and age are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this set of eye masks to feel like pure luxury or to give me such good results.  </li>
            <li>I truly cannot say enough amazing things about this eye mask.</li>
            <li>The package contains 5 individual packages with directions on each which is nice</li>
            <li>My eyes felt so much more alive after this was applied to them.</li>
            <li>And my supervisor was nice enough to send me home the next day :)</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about how refreshed.they left me feeling.</li>
            <li>It is really working!</li>
            <li>So at first I was freaked out by the mask when I took it out of the package</li>
            <li>Take away the tired look in the morning and the skin around the eyes look so bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was a really relaxing mask I enjoyed it and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>Amazing how one product can have so many similar reviews in the same couple month time period, all evenly spaced without overlap and the last 3 each contained photos.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I do when I purchase anything is to check out the ingredients, I try to use as many natural products as possible.  </li>
            <li>Anyway you can&#x27;t really walk around with these on</li>
            <li>It made my eyes so awaken, fresh and soft around the eyes.</li>
            <li>so you really must try this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you should really give it a try</li>
            <li>And my eyes were very puffy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But I would not recommend doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I was blessed with decent skin, but having reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27;</li>
            <li>I will be incorporating these into my normal beauty regime!</li>
            <li>LOL When I removed the patches (after 1/2 hour) Voil&amp;agrave; no more bags or tiny lines.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without these eye collagen!</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and you can still do everything like normal.</li>
            <li>has the directions printed on the package in the back only 4 easy steps.</li>
            <li>The patches feel like slapping wet fish on your eyes if I am completely honest fiddly slippery little things these patches are.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasently surprised when I</li>
            <li>my eyes felt refreshed immediately  and the puffiness and circles disappeared almost completely</li>
            <li>I have used 2 so far.</li>
            <li>After using these a couple times I did notice the fine lines getting smaller, not completely gone, but thinner probably because the mask left your face hydrated.</li>
            <li>Each review is also an Amazon verified purchase, which seems legit at first glance, not not when every single review has it listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you cool it a little you even feel an awakening sensation, on the morning</li>
            <li>..find that the results are a little better,around eyes just feels and looks fresh..</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find the eye masks contain essential oils, including my favorite-rose.</li>
            <li>The mask is easy to use, and makes my eyes less puffy and less wrinkly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first as I have used and been let down by other eye masks in the past so I was pleasently surprised when I this last night and my eyes felt refreshed when I woke up this morning! I will be incorporating these into my normal beauty regime!</li>
            <li> I never used collagen mask before and I decided, to try it. I found these things fabulous! I love them. They are worth any amount of money! After using it one time, I could see and feel the difference, immediately. I was blessed with decent skin, but having reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27; I was ever so slightly disturbed by the little lines and bagging under my eyes. As soon as my order arrived, I opened it.  The patches feel like slapping wet fish on your eyes if I am completely honest fiddly slippery little things these patches are. Anyway you can&#x27;t really walk around with these on they look silly. LOL When I removed the patches (after 1/2 hour) Voil&amp;agrave; no more bags or tiny lines. Gone! And my skin around the patches felt silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have never tried eye masks before and was very excited to do so.  The package contains 5 individual packages with directions on each which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to try to keep a track of only one set of directions.  After cleansing my face, I applied the mask over my eyes.  It is somewhat gelatinous feeling and adjusted very easily over my eyes.  I left them on for 30 minutes while relaxing.  They were easy to remove and my skin felt tighter and softer around my eyes and the puffiness was diminished.  I will definitely make this part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Amazingly lightweight. No smells. I feel and see dramatic changes and highly recommend this product to anyone looking to enhance their eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing how one product can have so many similar reviews in the same couple month time period, all evenly spaced without overlap and the last 3 each contained photos.  Each review is also an Amazon verified purchase, which seems legit at first glance, not not when every single review has it listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone went through a lot of effort to mislead customers here&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> Love this product! Can be a little tricky getting them on but once you do,just sit back and relax! Directions say to leave on for 30mins but I keep them on for 60mins..find that the results are a little better,around eyes just feels and looks fresh..so overall if you you have I would definitely recommend leaving them on longer..</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this set of eye masks to feel like pure luxury or to give me such good results.  The Collagen Crystal Eyes Masks are formulated to help the appearance of wrinkles (crows feet), reduce puffy eyes, and help with dark circles.  The first thing I do when I purchase anything is to check out the ingredients, I try to use as many natural products as possible.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the eye masks contain essential oils, including my favorite-rose. The masks also contain several vitamins and pearl powder.  This purchased contained five sets of eye masks, each set includes a mask for each eye.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried a set of the eye masks today, and followed the simple directions. I simply opened one of the foil packets and removed the eye masks. I was a little surprised to find out they felt like slime.  However when I was applying the masks to my eyes I was glad they had the slime texture as it allowed the mask to form to every curve around my eye socket. The masks immediately made the skin around my eyes feel cool and it was refreshing.  This alone is enough to keep me using the eye masks but after I kept them on for the 30 minutes as recommended and checked out the results I definitely knew this was going to be a repeat purchase for me.  My eyes looked rested and relaxed, and the wrinkles were indeed less noticeable. Best of all, even a few hours after I removed the mask, the skin around my eyes still felt refreshed and looked better.&lt;br /&gt;  The recommended use of the eye masks is 30 minutes twice a week. Do not forget you get five sets of the masks with this purchase.  I am very happy with this set of eye masks, I find them refreshing and effective.  To me, it feels like a spa experience. I recommend this product to anyone that would like to be pampered and look refreshed.  In fact, I have already recommending them to others.&lt;br /&gt;  I was provided this set of collagen crystal masks at no cost in return for an honest and unbiased review.  I based my review on my own experience and use of the masks.my review on my own experience and use of the masks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife. My wife loves it. She said this product is wonderful. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Luxury for your eyes!  My eyes felt so much more alive after this was applied to them. Skin cells were more radiant, firmer and more moisturized.  After using these a couple times I did notice the fine lines getting smaller, not completely gone, but thinner probably because the mask left your face hydrated. Very nice!</li>
            <li> These do the trick after you&#x27;ve been up late or crying. You will no longer have any puffiness or tiredness in your eye area. The eye holes are very small and it takes a little while to get the hang of how to put them on, but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Returned.  They didn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
            <li> It is really working! My wrinkles disappeared! But I guess, I have to use this mask any other day.</li>
            <li> Really great product it actually helped my eyes a lot my bags and the black color are almost gone I will totally buy this again pluss it was super relaxing.</li>
            <li> Another great mask to add to my skin care arsenal! I keep them in the fridge that way it helps in reducing the under eye bags and refreshes the eyes. Take away the tired look in the morning and the skin around the eyes look so bright and smooth. A great way to start your morning routine.</li>
            <li> OMG this mask rocks....I never used collagen mask before but I always wanted one...well this one is amazing.....I have a 18 months old baby who sometimes still wakes up during the night so on some days I am sporting some serious bags and circles under my eyes :-(.....I used this mask after one of those nights and the results were so great...my eyes felt refreshed immediately  and the puffiness and circles disappeared almost completely</li>
            <li> I truly cannot say enough amazing things about this eye mask. I truly thought I was not going to like it. It initially scared me since it had a small hole for your eyes. My daughter said it looked like I had eggs on my face, which I thought was hilarious. I placed them on my eyes and laid down to relax for 30 minutes. After about 5-7 minutes I began to feel a cooling sensation but it did not burn my eyes. I really really loved the way this felt on my eyes. It felt like a true luxury treatment. I gave 2 sets to a couple girlfriends to try since I loved it so much and well..... They felt the same way. I  will for sure be re-purchasing these again when I am out. Check out The crazy eye picture below. I really am still talking about this amazingly refreshing treatment. I Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My eyes have never felt better!!!  They feel so cool and refreshed after use.  My eyes normally feel tired, dry, and itchy but not after using this product.  I cannot say enough great things about how refreshed.they left me feeling.</li>
            <li> my eyes feel so refreshed and smooth! this ends up being a real nice treat for myself! the skin around my eyes are brighter and firmer! i am really impressed with the results! highly recommend for smooth bright fimer eyes or just for a nice at home spa treatment!</li>
            <li> It was my 1st time trying eye  mask. I never used collagen mask for eyes so I was little scared to use. I was worried may be it will hurt my eyes or I might feel burning. But this mask is so good. It made my eyes so awaken, fresh and soft around the eyes. I felt so relax. It comes in 5 packs with 2 masks for each eye. Wash your face before applying the mask. Remove all the makeup. Then apply it for 30 mins. Then remove the masks and dont reuse it. I was so excited for this mask. I took photos and showed to my friends online and text few friends. My friends will try this mask too. Highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! I feel like Im getting a treatment at the spa when using this product!!! After my skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting results. The mask is easy to use, and makes my eyes less puffy and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes doesn&#x27;t stick to ur eye area had to keep pushing it on my skin no difference the area around my eyes became red and irritated. Also the packaging is awful they send individual masks as if u borrowed them from ur neighbor no box or container</li>
            <li> So at first I was freaked out by the mask when I took it out of the package it was really wet and I was afraid it would get in my eyes and burn them. This however was not the case. I put them on( with a little adjusting) they fit well. I instantly felt the soothing of them. It was cold and had a little sting on where my bags are. I assumed that was just it doing it&#x27;s magic. Waited 30 minutes pulled each side off and my under eyes felt so smooth and looked brighter in color. It was a really relaxing mask I enjoyed it and will buy again in the future. I rate this 4 stars just because I think the package needs to say that it will not burn eyes. Lol</li>
            <li> This mask is slippery, it will slip off if you walk around with them, but to be honest I don&#x27;t think these are made for that. I think these are made for laying down. I put them on at night and listen to some relaxing music for half an hour before removing the eye masks and patting the under eye area dry with a soft towel. I also keep the masks in the fridge so they&#x27;re cool when I put them on. If you ask me question, do they work? They sort answer is YES! I used it once yet and I can totally see a difference, my under eye area is lighter and less puffy.</li>
            <li> These masks are heaven, the cooling effect relaxs me like I never imagined and leave my eyes so refreshed! So simple to use and works wonders! This is a must try ladies!!</li>
            <li> Very cooling and comfortable,  my laugh lines and other tell tale signs of tiredness and age are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I love this mask and is very easy to use. It fits perfectly on my eye and every time you use it you have a refreshing feeling and if you cool it a little you even feel an awakening sensation, on the morning it is like a caffeine shot for your eyes because you feel them softer, more relaxed, de-puffed and awake so you really must try this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome so you should really give it a try</li>
            <li> What an indulgence! This is a luxurious treatment for the eyes! Smells wonderful ( a big plus). Leaves my eyes feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love these.  Gets rid of puffiness quickly!  And I received my order quickly</li>
            <li> I hate when I have been crying to much, and my eyes get super puffy. It doesn&#x27;t happen often, but it does happen. Like say when you total you families only car? I still had to go to work the next day because the PA I saw in the ER wouldn&#x27;t write me a note. Anyways, I came home and let it all out. And my eyes were very puffy. I got some lavender oil, some soft music, comfy clothes, and I lay down and put these on. I was sent these to test in exchange for a review, and I am so glad I received them. It was the perfect way to calm my body and my mind down. After the allotted time I was please to see that the puffiness had gone down immensely. And my supervisor was nice enough to send me home the next day :) I received this product for instructional purposes with the request of an honest, un-biased review. All thoughts and opinions are of my own!</li>
            <li> It is really awesome and works. I like it because it made my eyes feels hydrated. It helped with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. Highly recommended. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> With all these eye masks out now it hard to choose one. I have tried many of them and the one thing that I truly hated was the ones that you put over your eyes and they are too thick, or they scratch you, ugh I knew I had to find something that worked for me. Thats when I saw these Collagen Crystal Eye Masks by MyM and knew that they would be perfect, and they are! These things rock, they are super thin and you place them on the skin and you can still do everything like normal. I almost forgot I was wearing them they were so comfortable. Then there are the results!!! They actually work, my eyes look less tired and I feel amazing. I am so happy that I found something that not only works, but make using them a great experience!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am loving these collagen eye masks. These eye masks come in five individual packets. I have used 2 so far. It feels nice and cool on the eyes. They stay on so you are able move around. After I took the eye masks off, the area around my eyes felt refreshed and smoother. It also looked brighter and felt firmer. It is a great way to pamper your eyes. I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these eye collagen! My dark circles, are gone! for it to go around my eyes I can get those wrinkles and crows feet. The best beauty product on my counter!</li>
            <li> For me the  dollar store eye masks work way way better than  these eyes masks.&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying these patches.</li>
            <li> These Crystal Eye Masks work wonders on sore, tired, and puffy eyes. I really like the way they feel when on your eyes nice and cool and very relaxing. Just wash face, apply the masks, and lay down and relax for 30 mins. they work great. You could not ask for anything closer then going to the spa and having a treatment done they are that good.  I notice the puffy bags are going away and the dark circles that go with them. I would recommend this mask to all who want refreshed looking eyes and a little spa treatment at home.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. They feel really good on your face and smell good. I can&#x27;t get over how good They feel. I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> i have never tried these Collagen Eye Masks before. So I was excited to try this one. It comes in a pack of 5 eye masks which is great.It is very easy to use it has the directions printed on the package in the back only 4 easy steps. It is not that soaking wet as I thought it would be.It has a texture of an cooked poached egg white feel.to it.Which feels nice when it is applied to my eyes.I applied it after my am shower when I woke up.Put these on and they had a cool effect and I like that.They stick to your face I was able to watch tv sitting up.But I would not recommend doing a whole lot.After the eye treatment i felt my skin was tighter and brighter under the eye.It sure did make me look more awake then I was before I put it on.I like it and going to keep using it for my morning and night routines.</li>
