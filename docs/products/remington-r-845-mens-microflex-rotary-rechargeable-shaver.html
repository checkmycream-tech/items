            <li>It has provided excellent service!  </li>

            <li>and I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>everything was great , wished for a better price but thats</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 years, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Did not buy this at amazon, but have had one of these for years and totally satisfied, batter lasts forever, close shave, thumbs up!</li>
            <li>, it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for him to use, easy to handle and gives him a great shave.</li>
            <li>is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.  </li>
            <li>ok it came on time and was well packed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sold three of my friends on them and they love them.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the details before choosing this shaver.</li>
            <li>I paid $5 more than a non-rechargeable and wish I had just gotten the cheaper one.</li>
            <li>but this one is better.</li>
            <li>In this case I made a gamble, satisfied with the price, I decided to test it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this again and am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent and the same close shave.</li>
            <li>GOING TO BUY ONE MORE SOME DAY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d sure like something I could take in the shower with me, but this will do.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>However, like others have posted, the battery has died very quickly.</li>
            <li>The MicroFlex R-845 provides me a smooth and rapid shave every day without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>overall its a great shaver for your money</li>
            <li>Otherwise, your skin will be irritated and itchy and you won&#x27;t feel comfortable shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great solid razor.</li>
            <li>I bought the refurbished one at $20 and it is worth that, but not a penny more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for me when the replacement heads were no longer available.</li>
            <li>But then, the 845 comes at a more economical price than the 890.  </li>
            <li>The razor head can be easily detached and cleaned, which I think is true for any Norelco or Remington products.  </li>
            <li>Everything else is good on it except the part that holds the cutters in the head will fall out during cleaning if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for something like $10 at a discount hardware store.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t quite enjoy the shaver until I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the Braun 7526 Syncro shaver a couple of weeks ago and discovered at a much lower price, the Remington is technically much better.</li>
            <li>yea right!</li>
            <li>I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>You can spend a little more $ and get a more sophisticated model but this model works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This is the very first review I have ever made on any product.</li>
            <li>I am well satisfied with the new Model</li>
            <li>They give a great shave - better than the Norelcos (i used various Norelco shavers foolishly believing more expensive was better).</li>
            <li>Not a bad shaver but spend a little more for a better battery or one that runs off battery or cord.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase a couple more for spares.</li>
            <li>My wife bought me the first one about 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>We still have the same one and it still shaves both his beard and my legs and has done so for many years with no problem.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this razor unless there is no possible way you can afford a better one.</li>
            <li>It was my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>So I tried many others and they only ripped the hair out of my face.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how long I might be able to go</li>
            <li>When my original Remington 845 broke, which had to be around 10 years old, I tried to go with other \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; shavers and they didn&#x27;t deliver at all.</li>
            <li>About 3 weeks ago, the run time really dropped off to about 3 shaves before needing a charge.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d get a Norelco $130 job and really have a razor.</li>
            <li>The hype associated with this brand is well worth it, they clearly know how to make an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>The shave is fast, about 2 mins.  </li>
            <li>I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well.</li>
            <li>The trimmer did stop working a few years ago but the razor still has original heads and shaves just fine.</li>
            <li>It is missing many features, the light indicator indicates pretty much nothing, except that the shaver is charging - it won&#x27;t let you know how much life the battery has left before getting recharged.</li>
            <li>Overall I find the Remington a good shaver and have no inclination to try or switch to any other make.</li>
            <li>It gave me a clean shave and left my skin virtually</li>
            <li>It was cheaper for me to buy a whole new electric razor that just the heads.</li>
            <li>Way better than my previous single-blade shaver.</li>
            <li>On the day it needed charging, I&#x27;d let it run a short time until the battery was completely dead and then recharge it 17-18 hours and be good.  </li>
            <li>I never did get a decent shave out of that one.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>HAD THIS FOR A LONG TIME USED EVERY DAY AND EVEN THE BATTERY IS ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t find a decent deal on a new one soon.  </li>
            <li>admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great  especially for coarse and hard to shave hair.</li>
            <li>My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!  </li>
            <li>Rather thick and strong hair, but doesn&#x27;t grow that fast.</li>
            <li>I paid over $100 for some of them and was completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>If you recharge before the battery is completely drained - you shorten the battery life.</li>
            <li>I shave about 6 times a week and never had to use a blade or back up that whole time.  </li>
            <li>but you will definately need a pre-shave lotion if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have not use it much; it does use the same shaving rotors and head as the 890.  </li>
            <li>When it gets too low to shave, I take off the heads, sit the unit on its back, and come back an hour later to make sure every ounce of power I can squeeze out is gone.  </li>
            <li>We were married in 1989 and It was within the first few years that I purchased this for my hubby for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This particular model ONLY works on the battery.</li>
            <li>The Remington operates only on battery power, i.e. you won&#x27;t be able to use it when the battery is dead by simply plugging it into the power outlet.</li>
            <li>However i have used many electric razors over the years and this is the first to ever give me razor burn that is actually as bad if not worse</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to African American men having difficulty with shaving their face, head, and having difficulty with razor bumps.    </li>
            <li>this is a replacement for the same model which was six years old.</li>
            <li>please bear in mind that this review is based on my personal experience: an Asian in early 30s.</li>
            <li>To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I can find is it cannot operate directly off the power/recharging cord; it can only be recharged and will run only off the battery.  </li>
            <li>Average density for an Asian, which I believe is fairly light compared to average American.</li>
            <li>However, the hair trimmer is not very good and useful.</li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get used to the closeness but your face certainly feels and looks different.</li>

            <li> It takes a little time to get used to the closeness but your face certainly feels and looks different.</li>
            <li> main problem was that it died a year and half after I bought it!</li>
            <li> The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.    </li>
            <li> Pretty soon I will have to charge it every night just to get a slow shave.</li>
            <li> but I was a little surprised that it only ran off the battery.</li>
            <li> , the Remington is a huge steal for its price but is not entirely perfect.</li>
            <li> first off ill start by saying i have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> I now have to charge it every night and even then I barely get through shaving before it starts to run down.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months, I went back to this shaver and wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my Dad, who has limited mobility.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a defect or my sensitive skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The MicroFlex R-845 provides me a smooth and rapid shave every day without any discomfort. I would recommend it over any blade shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used. When my original Remington 845 broke, which had to be around 10 years old, I tried to go with other \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; shavers and they didn&#x27;t deliver at all. I paid over $100 for some of them and was completely unsatisfied. After a couple of months, I went back to this shaver and wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift. I owned this model for a number of years and I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> If you recharge before the battery is completely drained - you shorten the battery life. I alternate between  this and an 842. When one dies, I pick up the other. And I always let the weak one run down to nothing before recharging. Buy 2 of these. They give a great shave - better than the Norelcos (i used various Norelco shavers foolishly believing more expensive was better).</li>
            <li> everything was great , wished for a better price but thats ok it came on time and was well packed</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 14 years ago, back in 1999. It has provided excellent service!  I shave about 6 times a week and never had to use a blade or back up that whole time.  It needed charging about every 2 1/2 - 3 weeks.  On the day it needed charging, I&#x27;d let it run a short time until the battery was completely dead and then recharge it 17-18 hours and be good.  About 3 weeks ago, the run time really dropped off to about 3 shaves before needing a charge.  I&#x27;ll check into replacing the batteries (I have some) if I don&#x27;t find a decent deal on a new one soon.  Everything else is good on it except the part that holds the cutters in the head will fall out during cleaning if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver over 10 years ago and the only thing I have done to it is replace the blades once. I retired it a couple years ago and put it in my travel bag. Since then I have purchased two other shavers, both expensive and both have been junk. I am currently trying to find another 845, but they are obviously out of production. I have never had an issue with razor burns, nor have I had the battery issues that others have had. I have had the battery go dead, but that is after months of sitting. I just charge it up and it is good to go again. I originally purchased this for something like $10 at a discount hardware store. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase a couple more for spares.</li>
            <li> Did not buy this at amazon, but have had one of these for years and totally satisfied, batter lasts forever, close shave, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Well the shaver itself was great. It gave me a clean shave and left my skin virtually uniritated.&lt;br /&gt;The main problem was that it died a year and half after I bought it! the battery would charge and work but the motor was working so slow that it was impossible to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;So since the 1 year warranty is over, and I had no box or reciept I had to throw the damn thing out :(&lt;br /&gt;So overall its a great shaver for your money but it may die...</li>
            <li> I found this to be a good razor and that it gave a close shave. However, like others have posted, the battery has died very quickly. I now have to charge it every night and even then I barely get through shaving before it starts to run down. I will be getting another Remington razor, but I will be getting a non-cordless one.</li>
            <li> I think the 845 shaver is the best thing that has come about for man since God made Eve.My wife bought me the first one about 6 years ago. Cost was $35 then. It worked so good I thought I&#x27;d get a Norelco $130 job and really have a razor. WWrong. I never did get a decent shave out of that one. You had to just wear the wiskers off with it. I stuck with it for 2 months and then went back to the 845. I then bought another one to keep in our travel trailer. Excellent service with that one also.I shave usually 5 times a week and put the unit on charge every third week. I&#x27;ve never had a battery go dead on them. I have no idea how long I might be able to go befor it would need a charge. It&#x27;s fast,one pass takes 90%of the beard and the 2nd pass takes the rest.The fact it is aggressive probably accounts for the neck burning sensation I used to get with it but using the Remington shaver stick takes care of that. I&#x27;ve sold three of my friends on them and they love them. One was an old time die hard blade man. If I ever have to get another you can bet it will be a Remington that uses the same model cutting head as the R845</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the details before choosing this shaver. I paid $5 more than a non-rechargeable and wish I had just gotten the cheaper one. This particular model ONLY works on the battery. If the battery dies, it can not be plugged in and used. You have to wait for it to charge. &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  Had a norelco but this one is better.</li>
            <li> I have heard all the hype surrounding Remington and their shaving products but I have always stayed away because of the price. In this case I made a gamble, satisfied with the price, I decided to test it. The hype associated with this brand is well worth it, they clearly know how to make an electric shaver. It contours to my face and gives me the \\&quot;closest\\&quot; shave I have ever had. It takes a little time to get used to the closeness but your face certainly feels and looks different. You can spend a little more $ and get a more sophisticated model but this model works fine for me. Stick with this brand there&#x27;s nothing like it!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my Dad, who has limited mobility. It&#x27;s easy for him to use, easy to handle and gives him a great shave. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great  especially for coarse and hard to shave hair. I highly recommend it to African American men having difficulty with shaving their face, head, and having difficulty with razor bumps.    For some reason, it is very difficult to find. I purchased one for my father years ago and he still loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a little less than a year ago and I was impressed by the closeness of the shave it gave but I was a little surprised that it only ran off the battery. I expected to get a couple of years of use out of it but it is already starting to slow down. Pretty soon I will have to charge it every night just to get a slow shave. Not a bad shaver but spend a little more for a better battery or one that runs off battery or cord.</li>
            <li> We were married in 1989 and It was within the first few years that I purchased this for my hubby for Christmas. We still have the same one and it still shaves both his beard and my legs and has done so for many years with no problem. The trimmer did stop working a few years ago but the razor still has original heads and shaves just fine. I trust Remington keeps making such quality products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a six month deployment to SW Asia.  It&#x27;s worked well and been quite convenient.  For the price it&#x27;s a good shaver.  It does chew up my face a little bit, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for two years, and it never really performed for me from the beginning. The shave is not even close to resembling a razor shave. The blades give me razor burn worse than a regular razor and the battery life is horrible. I would not recommend this razor unless there is no possible way you can afford a better one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because it has been consistant in its bad performance for two years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor is not recommended for snuggling with your lady friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a little over 8 months. It was my first electric shaver. By all means, it is a good buy for the price. It is missing many features, the light indicator indicates pretty much nothing, except that the shaver is charging - it won&#x27;t let you know how much life the battery has left before getting recharged. The Remington operates only on battery power, i.e. you won&#x27;t be able to use it when the battery is dead by simply plugging it into the power outlet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, it provides a good close shave but you will definately need a pre-shave lotion if you have sensitive skin. Otherwise, your skin will be irritated and itchy and you won&#x27;t feel comfortable shaving every day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver fits well in the hand and is sturdy. However, the hair trimmer is not very good and useful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I didn&#x27;t quite enjoy the shaver until I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the Braun 7526 Syncro shaver a couple of weeks ago and discovered at a much lower price, the Remington is technically much better. The Braun doesn&#x27;t shave close enough. I find myself going back to the Remington for tricky areas, such as the neck.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Remington is a huge steal for its price but is not entirely perfect.</li>
            <li> After about owning it for about a year the battery needed to be charged practically every night.  It also made a grinding noise somewhere between the blade and screen even after we replaced the parts</li>
            <li> itching on the skin after use this product. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a defect or my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. I have tried many different razors and this is the only one that works for me. My last one I had for 3 years and it got stolen. So I tried many others and they only ripped the hair out of my face. I decided to buy this again and am thoroughly pleased. I hope they never stop making it. And it&#x27;s one of the cheapest out there!</li>
            <li> first off ill start by saying i have sensitive skin.. However i have used many electric razors over the years and this is the first to ever give me razor burn that is actually as bad if not worse then i get from using a regular razor.. it may be because i have to go over each area time and time again to get it to do its job.. not real sure..  i just know that it gives me bad razor burn. and i have given up and ordered a norelco.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. Close shave, only have to pass once or twice. Best shaver I have used in a long time. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement for the same model which was six years old. Battery life is excellent and the same close shave.</li>
            <li> HAD THIS FOR A LONG TIME USED EVERY DAY AND EVEN THE BATTERY IS ORIGINAL GOING TO BUY ONE MORE SOME DAY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about 2 yrs.  For me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with skin irritation.  Just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face?!  I can&#x27;t imagine.  I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave.  The shave is fast, about 2 mins.  The dual blade design (each of the three heads has two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.  I&#x27;ll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will upgrade to a corded/cordless.    My problems with it are:    Can&#x27;t use with cord if the battery dies (didn&#x27;t know this when I bought it)  The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.    Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great solid razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I must agree with those who said that this shaver is mediocre. I bought the refurbished one at $20 and it is worth that, but not a penny more. It does not give a close shave without going over your face several times. My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good. To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times. I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying a shaver for $40, save your money and find a Norelco that&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for me when the replacement heads were no longer available. It was cheaper for me to buy a whole new electric razor that just the heads. I used this product for over a year.  Then upgraded to a Norelco for head replacement convienience.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it. I had a wet/dry razor similar to this, and they always seemed to break. I&#x27;d sure like something I could take in the shower with me, but this will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 years, very satisfied. Way better than my previous single-blade shaver. It&#x27;s sometimes annoying that it runs only on the battery, not directly from the wallplug, but it doesn&#x27;t happen that often.. The razor head can be easily detached and cleaned, which I think is true for any Norelco or Remington products.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;But please bear in mind that this review is based on my personal experience: an Asian in early 30s. Average density for an Asian, which I believe is fairly light compared to average American. Rather thick and strong hair, but doesn&#x27;t grow that fast. 2~3 shaves per week is enough for me..  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I purchased this Remington to use as a travel shaver having another Remington, Model R-890, for several years, still in use.  I am well satisfied with the new Model 845 tho&#x27; I have not use it much; it does use the same shaving rotors and head as the 890.  The only drawback I can find is it cannot operate directly off the power/recharging cord; it can only be recharged and will run only off the battery.  The 890 can be used in either mode.   But then, the 845 comes at a more economical price than the 890.  Overall I find the Remington a good shaver and have no inclination to try or switch to any other make.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money purchasing this unit. Will never by Remington again. This is the very first review I have ever made on any product. Maybe I got the only bad shaver they ever made... yea right!</li>
            <li> I bought mine years ago and the batteries are still are good.  As with all Ni-Cad batteries, I let the charge on these TOTALLY run out before recharging.  Since Ni-Cads have a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; and will only recharge down to that point.  When it gets too low to shave, I take off the heads, sit the unit on its back, and come back an hour later to make sure every ounce of power I can squeeze out is gone.  This shaver has served me well for at least 7 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like has been mentioned - it HAS to run off of battery.</li>
